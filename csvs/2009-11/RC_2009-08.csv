"When I was in Italy (about 19 at the time), I was crossing a bridge probably about 15 feet wide.  The entire bridge was taken up by old wop bitches all with their arms intertwined as ancient Southern European women are wont to do.   There were at least six of them.   They saw me coming but did not make any accommodation for me.  I got as far on the side of the bridge as I could without turning sideways, but they still didn't give me any space.   So I just ran right into one of the bitches.   Her entire gaggle began cursing me in Italian, ""maleducato"", etc.   I didn't give a fuck.  To me, they were the rude ones.  

And no, these weren't 100 year old women, they were in their sixties, definitely young enough to give a young nigger his space.

The best part was when some Italian youths about my age called to me right afterwards.   They had seen the whole thing.

"I've read this novel a few times, the last about five years ago. Because it came out in 1960, I think it needs to be read in light of the Cold War and the Space Race.

Notice Luna habitation started as penal colonies, and it has a Russian area and a Chinese area. Also notice the Luna protagonists (to my recollection) have Western European--including Spanish--names. This implies the Communists (USSR &amp; China) won a War and sent dissidents from North &amp; South America and/or Western Europe to the Moon as prison slave labor.

Now for the old Space Race to the Moon. It wasn't (originally) just a pissing contest demonstrating which government/philosophy is superior at whipping out bigger rockets and aiming them with greater precision. Watch Heinlein's 1950 movie *Destination: Moon*, and you'll catch some propaganda of why establishing dominance on the Moon is so gosh darn important. The Luna people in *Harsh Mistress* use this to their advantage, and I won't explain it here for fear of ""spoiling"" *Mistress* for you.

"As someone who spent a lot of time in Hong Kong I think I can see where you are coming from, but I would add some caveats.  I don't think that  China will, or even should emulate the western style liberal democracies of Europe or Americas somewhat lesser liberal democratic position.  China faces a fairly unique set of challenges and is socially and culturally very different from the EU and US, it will develop in a different manner and the end result (as much as there can be one and I suppose I am talking about 'in my lifetime') will be very different from the perceived aims of those national blocs.

Moreover, as you said, China is set to rise astronomically economically, indeed it already has been rising both economically and in social development terms for a long time.  Change in China really has been rapid and radical, if not always in a way that the west generally perceives as positive.  What that does mean is that they will be taken seriously (they have to be, their global positions are directly encroaching on US and EU interests).  

China has dona a lot to improve living standards and 'rights' the problem as I see it is that it deems it sown progress as more important than political or personal freedoms, it may even be right in that regard as focusing on progress economically, militarily and diplomatically should and seems to have increased the former a little. 

I'm not sure where China will be in 25 years time, I know I probably won't like it one way or the other, but it may well be the result of the best course of action for China. 

 It is a tough set of issues, do you trample on property rights to provide employment and industrial progress? Do you trample on personal rights to ensure stability and safety?  These are issues that the US especially and  EU states are dealing with currently and it seems in both cases the US various EU states are taking positions that seem less that what one might have expected in the past.  Of course China isn't in the same position as the EU or the US so its decision making will be different still, to determine the success, failure or popularity of those positions we should probably look to the Chinese population living in Mainland China (Places like Hong Kong and to a lesser extent  Shanghai are probably too different in some social terms to be good barometers..).

Plants 'discovered' that if they evolved to produce fruit that was appealing to the newly arrived land animals, they would do the hard work of [dispersing their seeds for them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit#Seed_dissemination):
&gt;The sweet flesh of many fruits is ""deliberately"" appealing to animals, so that the seeds held within are eaten and ""unwittingly"" carried away and deposited at a distance from the parent. Likewise, the nutritious, oily kernels of nuts are appealing to rodents (such as squirrels) who hoard them in the soil in order to avoid starving during the winter, thus giving those seeds that remain uneaten the chance to germinate and grow into a new plant away from their parent.

"On the contrary, it was the opposite. The adoption of Christianity by Constantine was one of his last ditch attempts to unify the Roman Empire and create some kind of solidarity. The Empire had been on its last legs for a long time for a myriad of reasons. BTW, the Dark Ages are now referred to as ""Late Antiquity"" in academic circles. During this time, the centers of learning ceased to exist or shifted to distantly or non-connected places, notably, Constantinople, Cordoba, and Paris. There was a scramble to get hold of any existing manuscripts from surviving libraries in order to preserve classical learning. In the 10th c., Moorish Cordoba had 70 libraries, one of which had about 400,000 volumes, while Paris had about 2,000. Monasteries and churches were the main storehouses of those manuscripts, where monks worked all their lives copying texts for their libraries and passing the originals on to other monasteries and abbeys. If not for Christianity, and the determined effort to preserve knowledge in a barbaric culture, there would have been a far worse situation. As feudal society replaced tribal structure in the early Middle Ages, widespread learning began again.

Uhhhhh..... what history books have you been reading?

""Late Antiquity"" is the period right BEFORE the ""Dark Age"".  You could say it ends with the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which was in 476 AD: the year the final Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed. The Eastern Roman Empire, i.e. Byzantium, would continue to be a viable force for another thousand years, as you said. And Islam became a political force before Muhammad's death in 632.

The Early Middle Ages i.e. the Dark Age, is the period from roughly 400 AD to 1000 AD in which the economy and population of Western Europe shrank drastically, there were massive migrations of mostly Germanic people (and that includes Franks, the ancestors of the French, and Anglo-Saxons, the ancestors of the English).
Cordoba was an Islamic city, so it does not help in your attempt to make Christianity seem the source of light in a dark age.

You say that ""Heresy was not a major concern in this period in Western Europe"".  There is a reason we do not have many records of the Church dealing with heresy during this period:  we do not have many records of ANYTHING that happened in Western Europe during this period.

I am perfectly aware that pharmaceutical company's act in unethical ways on occasion and that sometimes they do more harm than good, but I see no correlation or evidence of causation between US vaccination regimes and infant mortality rates, indeed whilst there is a significant difference between European and US infant mortality rates, much (although not all) can be accounted for by the differing counting measures, the remainder can probably be put down to the generally poor situation in the US with health care for poorer people.

"I had to check that you're the OP. I may be misreading you, but it seems that you're saying, this is Mexico, it's just a third-world economy, I'll never be recruited here no matter how good I am.

Apologies if I misunderstood. In any case, I don't buy into that one of reasoning. First off, I live in Tucson, AZ, just north of Nogales (Nogi), Sonora. I work with someone who commutes from Hermosillo weekly. Okay, I've never been to Mexico, but I just don't buy into ""it's third-world"". There's plenty in the US that's downright ""third-world"", and we're trending moreso that way all the time. Look hard and I'm sure you'll find stuff being done in Mexico that's world-class. I know that a world-renowned architect lives there--forgot his name. There's got to be more. 

Okay, here's my sob story: I flunked out of a high-quality, private engineering university and have had crummy, low-skill jobs ever since. Currently I am working as a construction electrician apprentice. I have to attend vocational school to keep the job. I spend a lot of time digging holes in the ground with a hand shovel. 

But, I'm a year from having a contractors license. All this low-skill work is (finally) giving me the financial stability to work on finishing my engineering degree at the local university. 

But, and this was my original point, my thinking has changed over time. What I want, either as an electrician or an engineer, is my own customers. Think in terms of building your own business.

A phrase that I recently heard was ""knowledge frontier"", as in ""engineering entreprenaurs tend to start companies later than computer-software entreprenaurs because only when they are at the knowledge frontier for their business segment can they invent a new product"". 

Your job in life now is to achieve financial stability and to work toward the knowledge frontier of robotics. 

The internet is your friend, bro. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that understand everything about Lasik machines is a good place to start. It's like this: can you sit down and draw the plans for an improved  version of one? 

I apologize of I sound preachy or old--well, I am old. :-) Also, if I'm trying to make the solutions to my problems fit your life.

There is a business in Tucson, General Plasma, Inc., that apparently makes a core part of the machines used to manufacture thin-film solar cells. Founded by an engineer about 10 years ago, when he already had 15 years in the thin-film industry. That's my goal: to be like him, though on a faster schedule, as I'm already old. :-)

If you really want to leave Mexico, your best bet may be a US green or an EU blue card. It's engineers that they want--engineers who know how to create products. And I believe having a portfolio of professional work to show would help in getting one. (I'm thinking hard about applying for a blue card.)

Actually Microsoft does have a monopoly (indeed this was affirmed by a court ruling not too long ago) and has used that monopoly unfairly to push products in other areas (again numerous cases before EU courts ranging from IE integration, Windows media bundling and interoperability.  Until Microsoft ceases to be the dominant OS provider it needs to act in certain specific ways, primarily not entering into other markets and using its OS monopoly to dominate those too.

Funny how it works.  My grandpa was very eccentric, peace loving (except he loved boxing, I mean participating not watching), and would do anything for anyone.  My mom always told me stories about how generous he was, how he would NEVER turn down a beggar, how he would get off the streetcar and give his brand new coat to man shivering on a subway vent and then jump back on, how he loved jazz which at the time was considered crazy for white boy.

I found a small parachute from a german flare which he had carried with him during the war and had written down where in Europe he had been.

"Stuff white people like is really funny because it really does define all of my white friends, and sometimes it is neat how a flock can really GET itself, and that's what comedy is all about, and pretty much what the channel BET is.

Still, It gets murky when I think about Ireland.  Ireland was treated basically like ""niggers"" to upper americans, they were the ""dumb monkeys"" of Europe, I guess a century ago, says my 500th generation Irish girlfriend.  At the same time, if you go to Ireland now, you won't see this ""monkey behavior"" anymore.  You won't see the viking, you won't see the celtics, or whatever, in most of the working and upper class, you'll see so many eerie model examples of British restraint and civility.   Ireland DIED.  and let's not even talk about what Catholicism did to the culture on TOP of that.  We're just figuring out sex a year into our relationship.

That's not entirely fair and Ireland is a real country with a culture, but while stuff white people like is more about the fun and funny and sometimes cool parts of ""white"" maybe american culture,  but then there's a bigger and more eerie zombie-like pattern imposed on all the countries Britain colonized.  Because what I said about Ireland can also be said over and over again with different worlds that have become intimate parts of my life. Ireland's the only WHITE country I'm familiar with that was dominated in the same way, the culture-killing way.

"&gt;So, why do you have to be a native born to be a president? 

The exact reasoning behind the clause is not clear, but from notes and discussion on related questions, it appears that the delegates of the Constitutional Convention were worried about foreign influence. [James Madison wrote](http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jyinger/Citizenship/history.htm):

&gt; the ministers of foreign powers would have and make use of, the
&gt; opportunity to mix their intrigues &amp; influence with the Election.
&gt; Limited as the powers of the Executive are, it will be an object of
&gt; great moment with the great rival powers of Europe who have American
&gt; possessions, to have at the head of our Governmt a man attached to
&gt; their respective politics and interests. No pains, nor perhaps
&gt; experience, will be spared to gain from the Legislature an appointmt
&gt; favorable to their wishes. Germany &amp; Poland are witnesses of this
&gt; danger. In the former, the election of the Head of Empire, till it
&gt; became in a manner hereditary, interested all Europe, and was much
&gt; influenced by foreign interference. In the latter, altho' the elected
&gt; Magistrate has very little real power, his election has at all times
&gt; produced the most eager interference of foreign princes, and has at
&gt; length slid entirely into foreign hands.

John Yinger concludes:

&gt; In summary, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention were deeply
&gt; concerned about foreign influence on the national government, and in
&gt; particular on the President. At the beginning of the debate, they
&gt; wanted the Legislature to select the President, and they tried to
&gt; limit foreign influence on the President by devising
&gt; time-of-citizenship requirements for members of the Legislature.
&gt; Presidential qualifications as such were mentioned, but they received
&gt; little attention at this stage in the debate. Ultimately, however, the
&gt; Convention decided that a President elected by the Legislature could
&gt; not be insulated from foreign influence and it turned, instead, to the
&gt; Electoral College.

"Yes, absolutely the Renaissance is related to the weakening of the church, although you can't really say it ""fell"" since they were still incredibly powerful, and in fact a large amount of the art commissioned at the time was directly approved by the popes and the religious elite.  If you look at the really early trend towards naturalistic depiction, say someone like Giotto, you can see the stylistic development toward weight and three-dimensionality.  Giotto is still very Catholic, and at the time the artists weren't dissecting yet, but the style had begun to change before the artists really got into the nitty gritty of models and cadavers.  The interest in depicting realistic human form seems to have developed before the loosening of restrictions.  

You're not exactly correct about the orthodox paintings.  Byzantine art is an animal all unto itself and has looked about the same for thousands of years, intentionally.  In fact, Byzantines were doing exactly the same type of icons while many different styles were developing in medieval Europe-- Romanesque, Gothic, you name it.   It doesn't really have to do with the Church maintaining control, because the church had about the same control in Western Europe as it did in Byzantium; just two different styles of artistic development.  

Yeah, I'm actually not a big fan of Picasso.  The only reason I talk about him ever is because people actually know what I'm talking about if I bring him up-- he's much like Koons in that he was pretty much a sell out, and self-consciously at that.

"This attitude frustrates me.  America has a big spotlight on her, so often we get closer scrutiny.  Moreover, we have currently been struggling with tensions that we did not have to deal with in the past--unlike many developed countries in Europe, the United States has not had to deal with radically new cultures.  Most immigrants who came to this country in the 1930s were so isolated from their own countries (due to distance or political views) that they fully adopted American customs.  Now we are at the stage where we receive many Mexican immigrants (who can come in larger numbers and stay more connected with their homeland); the immigration, combined with ""closer"" threats in the Middle East has made us reactionary.  The dumbest Americans cower behind this idealized vision of early America, which rebelled and seemingly took up staunch anti-intellectual pragmatism instead of European openness.  In reality, the founders who laid the groundwork for our Constitution were more open-minded.  

So, cut us some slack.  Americans themselves are now like immigrants.  We are confronting a new culture.  Only now do average Americans understand the true effects of cultural globalization.

"You know, it is possible that some of the old jazz singers, for example, did have larger larynges, so maybe I shouldn't make such a general statement there. I'd imagine this comes partly from training though, not just heredity. But it doesn't mean that all African Americans have that characteristic or that it really influences their speaking voice. I mean, Nina Simone had a incredible voice (in my opinion, one of the greatest voices in the history of recorded music), but it was very unique. Not just anyone can sing like she did.

I said dialect, because I meant that it's not any kind of dialect, including a sociolect. But I using the very literal definitions of ""dialect"" and ""accent"". From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect):

&gt;A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation, the term accent is appropriate, not dialect (although in common usage, ""dialect"" and ""accent"" are usually synonymous).

When African slaves were brought to America, obviously they learned English with an accent. And they usually lived in separate quarters with other slaves. So certain cultural traits were passed on from generation to generation, including the accent, although it changed over time. So they went from slavery to segregation, still live in general isolation from white. Well, that was only 50 years ago and the repercussions are still being felt. Beyond that there's also intense racism (things have improved by leaps and bounds, but it's still out there). So communities tend to stick together. There's a comfort and trust in it. 

Ok, another example. My current neighborhood was once predominantly Greek and Eastern European. You can still see it. There are schools that teach in Greek, Greek restaurants are everywhere. So for decades, people continued to speak Greek with each other. Younger generations especially have an easier time learning English, so when they went outside the community, they started to lose the accent more, but it's still there. Well in the last 20 years or so, other groups started moving in, Hispanic, Arab, Balkan, Indian, Jewish, Japanese, etc. Big melting pot. And more recently, the typical American (of western European decent). So the younger kids are growing up more ""American"" because that's what's around them.

While the Church was the place of study, mainly of the Bible though, saying that they ""preserved"" the classic works is a plain and simple perversion of language.

The study and rebirth of Aristotle, Socrates and co. began only later during the period of humanism (which started gaining momentum briefly after Dante's period).

"My short answer is yes. My long answer is below:


I've seen some academic arguments about just how well and widely people could think and act at various points in the past, but they all seem to depend on how much education such people got in their local circumstances. For instance, it's entirely possible certain residents of 10,000 BC were smarter about the world and themselves than certain peasants of Medieval Europe.


Human intelligence has ebbed and flowed erratically through the ages. Despotic control by sometimes demented or ignorant kings and emperors hasn't helped matters (one Chinese emperor had everything in the libraries of the entire country that he didn't personally like, destroyed. The destruction of the Library of Alexandria is another instance). Other examples include important forgotten technologies like steel making and concrete, which had to be re-invented again later.


Most people don't realize just how how capable people were (at least in some spots of the globe) 10,000 years ago or more. For instance, take a look at the technologies and capabilities proven to have existed in at least some human hands as far back as 22,425 BC:


""#1: People in general have possessed spoken language pretty much globally for at least 75,000 years by now, and perhaps for many hundreds of thousands of years. They've possessed some access to fire for nearly one and a half million years (though the secret of fire-starting may still elude them, forcing them to maintain perpetual fires in community hubs or else seek a flame from neighbors or others; such perpetual fires often burn for years or decades between extinguishings). One element helping make fire more practical is that lamps have been available for almost 50,000 years now (perhaps longer).""


""#2: Much of the humanity of this time are 'modern' humans, and have been spreading throughout the world (perhaps displacing older types of human ancestors) for tens of thousands of years by now. These 'modern' humans are so-called because they are basically as intelligent and behave much the same as the humans of the 20th century would under similar conditions.


The humanity of this period may have possessed brains roughly the same size as 20th century man's for close to 800,000 years by this point.""


""#3: Food seems to be plentiful during this time-- at least in some locations around the world. This could help make for a population boom before, during, and after this time, at least in the more fortunate locales about the globe. Abundant and easily accessible food would also allow people more time to experiment, innovate, play-- and make war.""


""#4: Besides the possible cornucopia of natural food sources perhaps available by now to some (if not all) of the world's population, there's also signs of agriculture and husbandry efforts underway in at least one spot near one edge of the swollen southeast asian peninsula (the Solomon Islands), going back at least as far as 3,000 years before now, and perhaps even 100,000 years in other places (if you count the earliest efforts with breeding wolves and horses for various purposes, including as contingency food supplies).


Dogs and horses have been domesticated for quite some time in various regions. Both are used at least as contingency food sources. Both are also used as pack animals and to pull sleds of various sorts. Horses are sometimes ridden (though the practice may be unusual), dogs are hunting and combat companions and perimeter guards for camps. Pet monkeys (sometimes highly trained) also may exist.""


""#5: It's possible that the people of 22,425 BC possess quite sophistocated clothing, body art, and personal accessories, as well as jewelry, fishing and hunting nets, ropes, cords, and string by this time-- and perhaps have for at least a couple thousand years already. Musical instruments such as flutes have existed for at least 25,000 years by now. Man-made housing has existed for more than 375,000 years. Food and drink containers have been in use for at least around 80,000 years, perhaps almost half a million. True pottery has been in use for at least around 10,000 years already in Asia.""


""#6: Humanity during this period (and perhaps for hundreds of thousands of years before relating to some items) displays skills of producing and deftly wielding projectile weaponry such as javelins and related gear, as well as knives, and bows and arrows (likely all stone-based or tipped) (note that simple bows have been in use in some spots for at least 7,000 years by now). People have been hunting big game and constructing animal traps for more than 20,000 years by this time (as well as shown more planning and forethought in their travels than before, which suggests at least memorization of terrain, if not a crude mapping of same; keep in mind humanity has been creating rock etchings and paintings for at least tens of thousands of years by now, in some locations).""


""#7: Prototypical market economies and related trade sprang up more than 10,000 years ago in some spots around the world.""


""#8: People of the period may enjoy significant amounts of trade and information exchange with others over vast distances-- perhaps even across the oceans to include virtually every continent on Earth (lowered sea levels have made it possible in some places to reach remote continents walking across land bridges, such as between Asia and North America, as well as via island hopping and seasonal sea ice crossings; but seaworthy craft are and have been available for maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of years, as well).""

"I understand basic healthcare is an esoteric concept for our American friends... I'll try to make this simple.

&gt; Sounds like rationing to me.

Rationing is the more-or-less equal distribution of a good where demand exceeds supply. Think of gas in the 1970s, or food in WW2. In this case, there is lots of steroids available, just no longer for free - thus it is not rationing.

&gt; Being permitted to pay for one's treatment instead isn't relevant.

Yes, it is. You are not getting refused a treatment - it might just not be the newest and shiniest. In European healthcare systems, you are paying for a basic level (e.g. metal fillings for tooth cavities), but can opt to pay for higher-level medical treatments (as in - for example - ceramic fillings). Under no circumstances you are forced to live with the cavity or forced to get your tooth extracted if a insurance decides so. 

You essentially pay the difference between the basic and the high-level treatment. The option to do so is IMHO essential for the well-being of our health providers (e.g. doctors) as well as for the ability to survive of our health insurances.

&gt; Because according to the article itself, the working alternatives aren't workable for all.

Well, it's an opinion piece. I let the scientists decide on what works and what not - obviously they decided steroids don't work.

quote: ""What concerns me is that to pay for these treatments, specialist clinics which offer vital services are going to be forced to close""

That's the real reason for the outcry: Some people will loose their profits. 

&gt; I'd assume that getting the drug itself is likely best for those people on it, as the doctors prescribe it for them, otherwise the doctors would be prescribing less than good health care. 

I've got bad news for you: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=doctors+pharmaceutical+corruption

Many doctors don't decide on a treatment on the grounds of what is best for you, but on what is best for the bottom line. Why should a publicly funded health insurance pay for extremly expensive medication if there is a more economic medical solution?

&gt; In this situation, a government bureau is deciding what's the best treatment for these people, not their doctors.

You forget the part where they've decided based on scientific studies. 

&gt; cheaper less effective

cheaper != worse. If you are not Pfizer, that is. 

&gt; health care system isn't managed by what's best for their patients.

It isn't. It is designed to give basic health care to everyone. It's fairly efficient in this goal, hell, it tends to do even more: in Germany, they even pay for yoga courses, taxis to go to the doctor, housemaids (in case of temporary disability), and travel vaccinations, three areas where I think personal responsibility (and private financing) would suit the cause better.

"Maher is spot on.  I don't know why he bothers though.  All he's doing is raising his and my blood pressure in reminding us all about it.

At this point there are really two distinct and highly identifiable populations within the USA.  The first and largest group comprises of those who watch daytime TV shows, are superstitious and easily manipulated by religion and propaganda.  The second group are the forward thinkers who are increasingly less religious, look beyond the messages presented by the media, seek intellectual fulfillment and personal growth.

When you think about it, the primary goal of the Government is to maintain the standard of living, happiness and security for the *majority* of the people.  Raising the general standard of education across the board is only important as far as is necessary to maintain the general standard of living.  That is to say we only need to be as educated to the point where the US economy can compete globally.  

This is as it should be as there are very real dangers with having an educated populous.  For example, people would stop doing ""ordinary jobs"" and start questioning the Government and each other on literally every aspect of life.  To be frank, it's a sad but true fact that until civilization transcends the need for work we need a substantial ""fat dumb and happy"" percentage of the population.  It might sound arrogant and politically incorrect to say so but there isn't really an alternative.

It's my belief that there's no such thing as a sustainable classless society because in the first place humans are not made equal, and second, human nature causes all of us to try and get a leg up on our neighbors - hence the failure of communism and fascism.

I've been thinking about this whole intellectual class division a lot recently.  In fact, at this point, my wife and I are pretty much resigned to leaving the US for Europe where at least religion plays a lesser role.

One idea I have thought of would be to turn the tables and create a kind of ""Church"" for forward thinkers (ie Reddit readers).  In this Church you would of course have to leave your religion at the door.  

The idea would be to build an organization as powerful as the Catholic Church for the ""rational"" minority.  The organization would help binds us emotionally, provide comfort and support, a wealth of resources and a platform for moving society forward in the way we all want.

Yes it's a pipe dream but I for one would love the support of a power base of rational, intelligent, free thinkers.  Right now I'm living in a world where a large majority of people I interact with never read books, prefer Oprah to Frontline, and quite honestly, I am afraid to mention my lack of belief in a supernatural deity at work for fear of ruining my career prospects. 

I have some ideas how to organize this but the main problem is that we free thinkers are in many ways just as fat dumb and happy as everyone else.  We won't get off our well paid, intellectually stimulated asses to do anything about it. (Well apart from to bitch on Reddit :)))

It totally sucks, Maher is right but I'm not sure even someone with a soap box as big as his can make any real difference.  The problem runs far too deep and is getting worse (Sarah Palin is as he puts it a great example).

"The term of service is two years (plus 2-3 months of training), so keep that in mind. This isn't the army and you can quit whenever you want, but its best to plan on spending the whole 2 years there. Sometimes you have the option to extend for a third year

The first app is about 15 pages, lots of short y/n questions and a few essays. After you submit that with references (who have to write a letter of recommendation for you) they call you in for an interview. This will be like a lot of job interviews in a way, but there is a quite a bit of psych eval in there too. They need to know you can handle dealing with foreign cultures, foods, and how well you handle stressful issues like loneliness (expect to be isolated from western culture for at least a few weeks at a time), poor health (you will get sick), and other things like child beatings (common discipline in poor and third world countries). 

They will also check your experience to see if you qualify for any of their programs. I expect you would do well in SED or ICT (Small enterprise development or Information and Communications Tech), but they may ask you to work on some more projects to get more experience first. One of my buddies did well in the interview but didn't have enough relevant skills so she was advised to work as an emt for 6 months. After that she qualified for the health program.

One the interview is done, you will be sent medical, dental and psych evaluation forms. If you have good insurance, in good health,  and are on the ball, these can probably be completed in a couple months, but expect it to take more. Mine took nearly a year because I had dental problems, crappy insurance and had seen a school councilor for depression in the previous ten years (after getting the college to fax my file, PC decided there wasn't anything to worry about.

If you have decent insurance and are in good health, it should cost more than a couple hundred to get the physical and so on, and you will be reimbursed for that. I had to spend several hundred more because of lack of and shitty insurance. It will also cost some time and stress. 

How physically demanding the job is depends on where you go and what you do. I will say maybe. My job was not physically demanding in itself, but living in the sahara and dealing with 125 degree temps for three months on end when you can't afford a fridge or AC (or live in a remote village where there is no power) can be stressful. However some volunteers end up in a tropical paradise where they can spend 4 hours a day lounging on a beach drinking cold booze (My country was moderate muslim. Booze was not available to buy anywhere. I ended up brewing batches of brousse wine in old 5-gal veg-oil drums)

Generally student loans can be deferred, and you may be eligible for assistance in a masters program afterwards, plus non competitive eligibility for govt jobs if you complete your service.

As far as your choices, generally you can choice where you go, when you go, or what you do, but you only get to pick one. I said I wanted to go to Eastern Europe, but I insisted on being a computer guy or i would have to postpone service for a few years. I did end up as a techie, but was sent to saharan west africa. It ended up being a very enriching two years.

You will be paid a local living wage, which for me meant living comfortably on approx $200 a month. an additional 200 something gets put aside for a completion bonus. Stay the full two years you will get roughly $6000

And regarding the emotional toll, yeah. Probably. It depends on so much. I went a little batty living in isolation, but did well when transferred to a nearby small city. I also made a lot of good friends, got to see the world from a new perspective, and met an awesome lady volunteer (just celebrated three years together).

OF FORTRESS EUROPE!

2022 -A new European order
Robot guards patrolling the border
Cybernetic dogs are getting closer and closer
Armoured cars and immigration officers
A burning village in Kosovo
You bombed it out now you're telling us go home
Machine guns strut on the cliffs of Dover
Heads down people look out! we're going over
Burnin up! can we survive re-entry
Past the mines and the cybernetic sentries
Safe european homes built on wars
You don't like the effect don't produce the cause
The chip is in your head not on my shoulder
Total control just around the corner
Open up the floodgates Time's nearly up
Keep banging on the wall of Fortress Europe

Keep banging
Keep banging on the wall of Fortress Europe
We got a right , know the situation
We're the children of globalisation
No borders only true connection
Light the fuse of the insurrection
This generation has no nation
Grass roots pressure the only solution
We're sitting tight
Cos assylum is a right
Put an end to this confusion
Dis is a 21st century Exodus
Dis is a 21st century Exodus

Burnin' up can we survive re-entry
Past the landmines and cybernetic sentries
Plane, train, car , ferry boat or bus
The future is bleeding coming back at us

"The UK is extremely well situated in Europe for both Wind and Tidal power. I would agree that it can't be the only answer but it is a solution for a blended supply.

The problems being discussed in the report which come down to the the unpredictability of wind energy and the extra cost due to the reduced economies of scale for non-renewable energy plant. Note that tides are predictable but they may not coincide with demand.

However, this seems to ignore the dynamics of the power market which divides the days into one hour slots and the capabilities of plants. Gas is wonderful because you can bring a Gas plant up to speed in minutes. Nuclear is the worst, you really don't want to spin-up the plant in less than an hour or so. So the report suggests that you would end up with big spikes.

So what do with the spikes? Well there is already a power connection between the UK and French Grid systems as well as one planned with the Nethlands (http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/interconnectors/). There are a lot of continental Europeans who like to pay a premium for 'green energy'.

What to do with the rest, well one popular method is to sell power 'overshoots' to high usage industries. Aluminium comes to mind here. As for the problem of thermal stations, it really comes down to UK power generation techniques - large stations in the middle of nowhere offering economies of scale but with associated transmission costs and thermal wastage.

Yep that last one is interesting. In many other countries they still have smaller thermal plants for the cities. Not only does the plant provide power, but it sells of the waste heat by providing district heating/hot-water. This means the plant isn't just selling power, it is also selling thermal energy which helps justify its existence when there are insufficient power customers.",t1_c0bngl9,2,0,,2,False,t3_96ydu,0,c0bngl9,0,t5_2qhkd,hajk,energy,False,,t3_96ydu,1426009559,1249294406,True,

"&gt;Because I don't want to pay for some smoker's bad decisions.

Well, if you're buying private insurance, that's what you're doing. Healthy people, who pay premiums but don't require a lot of health care, are effectively paying for the care of the unhealthy people who buy insurance from the same company.

&gt;Just because some, or even a majority of people are willing to hand over their money in return for government run health care doesn't mean I should have to.

No legislation in either the U.S. Senate or the House has proposed ""government run healthcare"" as you call it. All plans involve the private delivery of health care, paid for with government-provided insurance that is funded through taxation. As to your feeling that you don't feel you should be required to participate in a government-provided insurance program, why should I be required to participate in a society in which health care is a for-profit business just because a majority of people are willing to hand over ever-increasing amounts of money to the private insurance companies?

&gt;It's my basic human right not to have my money extorted even if it's to save someone else's life.

You want to go back to the state of nature? Fine. But this is a civilized society and we all must contribute to the collective good. We can either compete with each other for health care, or we can collectively support each other's well-being. And unless you're super wealthy, do you really think you'd pay more in taxes under a public insurance plan than you do now for private insurance?

&gt;Some European countries take 50% in taxes and they're still finding that it's unsustainable.

Well, in America we don't tax the rich nearly that much and it's completely unsustainable. The national debt is soaring.

"&gt;This is a 40 YEAR OLD WOMAN.

Who possibly has the mental age of a child.  **That** is the issue here.  **Lack of mental maturity** is the reason that adults can't have sex with children who are past puberty.

&gt;We're talking about a 40 year old woman who has a supposedly reduced mental capacity.

So then the salient question is, ""How reduced is her mental capacity?""  If it puts her at the same  mental bracket as a young child, then she is unable to legally consent even if she's physically an adult, just like a 13-year-old who has undergone puberty.

&gt;And if you must know, the age of consent is 12 years old in Italy. So stuff it.

No it's not.  The age of consent in Italy is 14, with exceptions made for 13 year olds who have sex with someone less then 3 years older than them.  Here's the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Italy), as well as the [source it cites](http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Codice_Penale/Libro_II/Titolo_XII#Art._609_bis_Violenza_sessuale).

"&gt; So you see blood hounds with cropped ears?

So do you see many, say, Europeans or South Americans or Russians, or Chinese, or Japanese, etc. with circumcised penises?

No. Most of the world views the circumcision of a healthy boy as repugnant.

&gt; The dogs you see with cropped ears generally [wouldn't have had] the health issues you're talking about. And the first ""advantage"" for ear cropping, not being bitten by another dog is a bit of a stretch don't you think? Unless your dogs routinely engage in illegal fights.

**Your comment can be mirrored for circumcision**:

The males you see with circumcised penises generally wouldn't have had the health issues you've alluded to. Medically cited ""advantages"" for circumcision, such as protection from STDs, is a bit of a stretch, don't you think? Unless your young child is engaging in sexual activity without a condom. After all, according to an [11 year study in New Zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract), circumcision makes absolutely no difference in the risk to STDs in a developed country, and [a recent mathematical model](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490F-44F5-AC5E-17893A3764BA.asp) found circumcision to be unimpressive to the point of being useless in curbing HIV in South Africa.

How about phimosis? Genuine phimosis occurs in [1% of intact men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis#Incidence).

How about urinary tract infections? [Girls have a 6x rate of infection than intact boys in the first 6 years of life](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/), [*Israeli* studies](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/) indicate that circumcision increases the risk of UTI in the week of healing, and there's not much of a difference between circumcised and intact adults.

"You have to define the terms properly to debate it intelligently.

What many people think of when they hear socialism is state socialism, which many radical left socialists would consider state capitalism rather than true socialism.  This is the view I take as well.  I'm not going to get into a no true Scotsman type argument, it may very well be that advocates of state systems truly believe it is the best way to bring about socialism, but many socialists believe that, whatever the intention, state socialism will always become state capitalism.

What we have in the West is basically a hybrid of market capitalism and state capitalism; a pure market capitalist system is probably impossible, and exists only in the dreams of libertarians and anarcho-capitalists.

Within capitalism, there are advantages and disadvantages to using the state or the market, and which is more effective depends on the particular industry.  The market alone does not deal effectively with externalities, but the market does deal better with applying new technologies and improving productivity.  Every developed nation began its development with heavy state intervention, which is necessary to establish basic infrastructure, education levels, etc. needed before a market system can really work.

From my perspective, and the view of many leftists, capitalism itself, however, is the problem, not simply the market as a means of implementing capitalism.  Capitalism itself, in state or market forms, can be generalized as the idea that the good of society is defined in a utilitarian way around maximization of production and capital accumulation; that is, capitalism sees capital itself, rather than a broader conception of the social good, as the predominant interest.  This same fixation on production is present in both liberalized market capitalist systems, but was also there in Stalinist ""Communist"" states which used central planning to develop.  We see this reflected today in virtually all political debates, where it's never enough to justify a position as simply it's morally right, or just, etc. but where everything must be justified by a utiliatarian logic according to the needs of capital.  An obvious example is eduction; education should be regarded as a good in itself, necessary to help a person to understand the world, be a good citizen, be a part of the intellectual traditions of their civilization.  Today, however, it's simply a form of job training.

What's the alternative to capitalism?  I couldn't give an exact blueprint of what a socialist society ought to look like, but in general terms it would be a more democratic form of society where the economy – whether using market or state forms of organization, or some other form – would always be ultimately subordinated to actual social needs expressed through democratic institutions.

There are several reasons we don't have this already, despite having formally democratic institutions.  One is the nation-state system, which forces states into competition for military advantage, which therefore often requires placing the economic basis for the military above other needs (or, for smaller and weaker countries, placing economic usefulness to a powerful patron state above other needs).  That's basically what went wrong with Communism – Stalin advocated ""socialism in one country,"" abandonment of internationalism, and it followed from that assumption that the USSR needed to industrialize as rapidly as possible, at whatever human cost, to gain the means to defend itself; Mao's China took this even further into an even more conservative, xenophobic, rabid nationalism, which of course has now become a largely market-capitalist state.  This is also part of why Europe has done better than the US in terms of developing a welfare state; since World War II, the US basically took over responsibility for the security interests of the developed capitalist world, which allowed the other developed capitalist states to devote more resources to social spending rather than military spending.

Another, of course, is ideological, which gets into a very complex area which I cannot do proper justice to here.  The problem is not only the vulgar fetish for the market, but the more general ideology of capitalism common in both market and statist systems.  Part of this is that, with the decline of religion as a serious, politically significant ideology in most parts of the world, there's an idea that we can have a form of state and society which is somehow morally neutral, above any particular culture, etc.  Once we adopt that idea, it's a short step to the notion that common social aims should be defined in the most minimalistic and ultilitarian way possible.  In practice, however, capitalism is not morally neutral; it tolerates different cultures by distorting them into something merely aesthic.  The more we bring in the state, the more we get the discipline of law and bureaucracy; but the more we use the market, the more we get equally ruthless market discipline, which forces people to conform in order to successfully compete, and punishes even more mercilessly through exclusion those who do not conform.

Finally, another is the nature of property and the actual, objective political power which always necessarily follows from control – whether through private ownership or through the state – of the productive means of society which people depend upon.  The obvious recent example, of course, was the bailouts; lost in the debate over whether or not failing private corporations should be bailed out at taxpayer expense was the more fundamental question: why are such vital areas of the economy, such as major financial institutions, controlled at all by private profit-seeking owners with little or no accountability to the public?  But those who control the institutions, public or private, which control vital aspects of the economy, are always able to translate that into political influence.  That's one major reason I don't by the ""small government"" libertarian line; in practice, so long as capitalism exists, the owners and controllers of capital will possess enough political influence to force the government to socialize their costs and risks, while profit continues to be privatized.  Similarly, we see the enormous propaganda campaign in the US by the private insurance industry to protect the very profitable status quo.  Even if you get rid of more overt means of corporate influence, such as campaign contributions, capital can still exercize influence through threats of divestment, layoffs, and capital flight.  There's also, of course, the media problem; which actually gives a good example of the false dichotomy of market vs. state.  It was the deregulation of the media in service of market principles during the Clinton era which allowed the consolidation of media ownership by a few owners; and it was in part because of that stifling of diversity among the media and its control by major multinational corporations with other interests that the media was extremely tepid and submissive towards the Bush administration during his first term, most egregiously going into the Iraq War.  So, in other words, deregulation and the ""market"" helped to create a media even more compliant to the state.

UK system is known to be one of the worst in Europe, at least one of the most expensive ones for the customer.

The limit on which things the Social Security covers (in Spain) does not depend on the extra years of life it will give you. It's usually decided by the government, and there are usually frequent modifications to **add more** things that get covered by it, and that didn't before. Obviously the cost of the treatment is the most important factor to decide, but there are also other things that are put on the balance to make a decission.

Plus, you still have the option of going for private insurance if you want. The difference here being, that private companies have to compete with the *free* Social Security, so they either give a good value for money, or they're out of business.

Remember Social Security doesn't have ANY marketing costs or anything of the kind, as it's free. So the costs are REALLY low, and private companies have to keep up with that - and they do pretty well. Just so that you can make a picture of how messed up the US system is.

I find abortion distasteful.  I know that sometimes it is the best option available.  Still, that embryo would be a child.  I'm not for murdering doctors or even making it illegal.  If there are no major medical complications, it is wrong to snuff out life to avoid the consequences of a choice. 

The US isn't an especially evil/violent/agressive nation.  Considering our position as a world power we really aren't that bad.  The nations of western europe were worse during their colonial periods.",t1_c0bnyjs,0,0,,0,False,t3_973a7,0,c0bnyjs,0,t5_2qh1i,bCabulon,AskReddit,False,,t3_973a7,1426009813,1249338451,True,
"A lot of what the people are saying are good. Here's mine:

1 Stay in school, do your homework even if you're smart enough to know everything. Your teachers will probably mark you down for not doing the work even though they full well know you're smarter than everyone else. It's worth it.

2 Study what you are interested in, passionately. Get through what you're not interested in and don't let that get in the way of what you are interested in.

3 Go out for a walk, bring your ipod and some good music. I like Bjork and some of her stuff just puts a huge smile on my face while going down the street. Find different places to go, or take a sketch pad and draw the woods or houses.

4 Be outgoing, definitely talk to people and build your social skills. People are fun, they do not hate you as much as you may think they do.

5 You're perfectly good looking, not fat, not ugly, not short, etc etc. People really don't care so far as you're not annoying.

6 Be happy, you live longer. Problems go away, realize that and moreso try to come up with and enact solutions quickly.

7 Don't play too many games. They won't kill you but once you're to the point that you're not even interested in the game, you're just playing in boredom, then stop. Read too, but read only what you like by authors that intrigue you. If 20 pages of a book doesn't make you want more, return it for another. For science, I like Michio Kaku and Richard Feynman.

8 Be healthy. Excercise, but do something you like or intrigues you. Do not just excercise but challenge yourself, get goals, etc. Make it fun but challenging.

9 Use technology to help you. For example, I keep notecards around everywhere and write down everything that I want, want to do, have to do, etc. Organize these ideas in some spare time, use google calendar and tasks to organize them and accomplish them. Find everything you want to improve in yourself, think of ways to do it, and do it.

10 Do not let technology stop you. A lot of times the prescribed or general way to do something is not that appealing or fun or is lacking just the right settings. Find another service or find a way around your hesitations. Make things simple and suited for you, otherwise look for ways to solve them.

11 Eat healthy, this helps your brain work at most efficient, makes you happy, prolongs life and reduces medical costs and is generally cheaper. Also eat less.

12 Stimulate your brain. Reddit is a start, but do some hardcore subject exploration too. Something out of a class but as in depth as you would learn in class

13 Have fun, do not be afraid to have fun and enjoy what you love to do. I love music, it's my hobby. I guess have a hobby. Spend a reasonable amount of time and leisure on it. Actually, do this instead of leisure, or moreso instead of tv.

14 Interact socially. Really, build some best friends. I have around 5 bestest best friends and around that are another 20 people I am terribly close with. Self actualized people statistically have fewer friends and they are closer friends. Be nice to people you don't like but don't waste time on them

15 Look up anything you don't know as far as it keeps your interest and intrigue

16 Look for role models. People who live their life in such a way that you hope to import their traits into yours. Look for them in more than just one field, in science, politics, culture, technology, etc. Look at these peoples lives and see what they do to help them be successful.

17 Don't smoke or do drugs. This is definitely a personal one for me. Cigarettes are plain a waste of money I don't have. Drugs even moreso. The time it takes to build the social empire of drugs is a drain I cannot afford against the things I want to do, especially because I do not find those people stimulating or heading anywhere with their lives. That is not to say people who do drugs cannot be successful, or that drugs are bad. I find them not in line with my personal interests 

18 Find people who are interested and stimulated by the same things as you, and use them to propel your own understandings and interests. Just because someone is not interested in the same things as your does not mean they cannot stimulate you, moreso they can even challenge you. I guess find people who are deeply interested and cultivate them to do research in the areas you are not interested in. This sounds like using people... it's not meant to be. For example I friends who are interested in comics and classical literature which I am not. On the other hand, listening to them discuss it is very deep and also lets me find out about the important things and ideas going on in those fields.

19 In terms of love, do what you want whether that be monogamous or more open ended, but only do what you want. Don't worry about social pressures and be happy. Also do not worry if it doesn't come, especially for the more monogamous end, people under 25 are much less interested in relationships and much more interested in sex. Don't be too prude but don't pass up a good chance. Don't worry about being awkward, the worst they can do is not like it and you can learn a world of information.

20 Ask for help. If you want to know how to do something, ask a friend that may know. Google it. Go to or call the office and ask how the program works. Ask, figure out how the system works, and then solve your problem.

21 Be realistic about reality. The jews don't control the media, racism is stupid, there is no cure all fat loss program in 15 minutes. If you don't know something, realize that, look around, form opinions, and get information from many sources. Test what you can. When you do know something, argue for it and see if you really know it and find out what you didn't know.

22 Be open to discussion. The worst thing is to discuss something with someone and they tell me they don't care, or they worse yet they are too sensitive to the topic to want to discuss it or close minded. For example my ex always told me I was too serious. I countered I had a playful affront but considered everything very seriously, whereas he has a negative demeanor and does not thing about much very deeply. He refused to even try to counter my argument.

23 Explore the world. Sometimes economically this is not possible, but at least make trips to the closest parks and cities. Some of the best things of my formative years was going across america and europe. Explore things with more than just the mind but physically, such as playing in the woods, building legos, or exploring displays at museums.

24 Share your enthusiasm. Those people worth keeping around want to hear it and will teach you something back.

25 Save up. Don't get a job if your parents are rich enough, it's a waste of time in menial service although it gave me great people skills. Save a significant portion of any money you get (25%+), spend less on eating out and let your parents pay for your food (or invite your friends to a dinner you cook, this really isn't something my peers were mature enough for until college though). Save this money for the interest you can get as well as a safety net. Do get a job if it will help your career or studies (internship, lab job, etc)

26 If someone is angry at you, it doesn't matter. Get what you need from them (or if a job, let them get what they need from you), and try to make your time together as pleasant as possible. Keep your cool, count to 10. I was at the airport and I missed my flight. My mom wanted to yell at the person helping me bc of the lines, I just wanted her to book me onto the next flight. There was nothing that woman could do about the lines, if she was that powerful to control lines at an airport, my god the airport was not utilizing their resources properly.

27 Your parents love you (hopefully) and want you to succeed. Any problems they give you are their own shortsightedness or farsightedness. Take their advice you know is true but don't want to listen to, and ignore their demands that you know are getting in your way. Don't lie to them unless it would get in the way of your goals or restrict you, ie don't tell them about the sex and drugs if they are terribly conservative. Ask them for help too.

28 Make mistakes. If you are not sure about something, assess it's risk to damage you in the long term. Don't burn big things down, do play with toothpicks and candles safely. Do try yoga even if it's too spiritual for your tastes, don't expose yourself indecently at work, etc

29 A friend is not someone who tries to coerce you to do things you don't want to do, moreso if they are damaging to yourself. A friend is someone who shows you the world and brings the best of their experiences to the table for you to share.

30 Habits are the biggest bitches in the world. Make good habits now, and work to correct all the ones you don't want, that is a job that takes many years.

31 Life is enjoyable, forget the negative, reinforce the positive, and test all the things you thought were negative again. You don't stop maturing until 25. I am constantly finding myself liking new foods, new genres of music, and many other things I grew up not liking. I am also realize how little I truly like some of the things I try to hold dear from my childhood.

"&gt; You can BUY panels for $2.84 per watt ready to go, just add inverter for another 1000 and some other miscellaneous costs.

That's per watt *peak*, which doesn't include the capacity factor -- and that's what my whole damn post is *about*.

&gt; Nuclear power costs 5-7 cents per kilowatt and once delivered it costs significantly more pushing up to 11+ cents per kilowatt making it much more expensive than wind and coal. The most important part is nuclear costs are only projected to go up faster while wind, geothermal, and solar very stable costs over time. They require no fuel, no safety concerns and no waste storage. Just imagine if you factor the cost of storing nuclear waste for 100 thousand to millions of years.

5-7 cents per kilowatt sounds way lower than what nuclear costs to build (about $2.33 per watt, as I calculated). Maybe you meant per kilowatt-hour? In which case the cost is about 5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour in total, as you said. Once you've amortized off the cost of construction, of course, the price goes down to less than 2 cents per kWh. This has happened at most of the older nuclear plants in the US, which is why they're such cash cows for the companies that own them.

And how are the costs going to go up over time? Nuclear energy is remarkably resistant to fluctuations in fuel costs; if anything, nuclear will get cheaper as the next-generation reactors start coming into more widespread use.

&gt; So when the oceans rise and our nuclear waste facilities leak... will nuclear really be the cheapest option ? Will radiating our costs turn out to be better than investing in geothermal ?

Hint: you can move nuclear waste if the oceans start rising.

&gt; Most important waste storage can only increase in price[...]

Why is this?

&gt; [...] and thus the price of nuclear energy will always be rising while urarnum sources diminish and projected rates already suggest even at today's rates we will run out of Uranium in 200 years or so.

Conventional waste reprocessing can extend that a lot, while raising the cost per kilowatt-hour of nuclear energy only very slightly. Or use it in breeder reactors; there are several under development. Or use thorium; it can last a *long* time, and it doesn't produce plutonium.

But hey, you know what? In ten or twenty years this discussion will have resolved itself one way or the other; China and India are going forward with nuclear in a big way, and the US and Europe are betting the farm on renewables (backed up, of course, by good ol' fossil fuels).

"Actually, the point about men's rights no longer being a superset of women's rights is somewhat reasonable.

Equalism in a step, but it has problems too. In equalism, do we fight for equal rights?

"well in answer to that!
From [Why on the left](http://www.2pass.co.uk/goodluck.htm)
This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world; however, there is a perfectly good reason.

Up to the late 1700's, everybody travelled on the left side of the road because it's the sensible option for feudal, violent societies of mostly right-handed people.

Jousting knights with their lances under their right arm naturally passed on each other's right, and if you passed a stranger on the road you walked on the left to ensure that your protective sword arm was between yourself and him.

Revolutionary France, however, overturned this practice as part of its sweeping social rethink. A change was carried out all over continental Europe by Napoleon.The reason it changed under Napoleon was because he was left handed his armies had to march on the right so he could keep his sword arm between him and any opponent.

From then on, any part of the world which was at some time part of the British Empire was thus left hand and any part colonised by the French was right hand.

In America, the French colonised the southern states (Louisiana for instance) and the Canadian east coast (Quebec). The Dutch colonised New York (or New Amsterdam). The Spanish and Portugese colonised the southern Americas. So The British were a minority in shaping the 'traffic'.

The drive-on-the-right policy was adopted by the USA, which was anxious to cast off all remaining links with its British colonial past

Once America drove on the right, left-side driving was ultimately doomed. If you wanted a good reliable vehicle, you bought American, for a period they only manufactured right-hand-drive cars.

From then on many countries changed out of necessity.

Today, the EC would like Britain to fall into line with the rest of Europe, but this is no longer possible. It would cost billions of pounds to change everything round.
The last European country to convert to driving on the right was Sweden in 1967.

I grew up in a well to do neighborhood that leaned right, I saw tons of kids that weren't taught these things, but mostly because they were just spoiled brats.

(well, I knew some in SF but they never had kids, and frankly they were just lazy ass hippies that represent a small portion of the population.)

And progressivism a failed idea? Really? Europe seems to be doing pretty darn well. The world's highest living standards, the world's highest life satisfaction ratings, the lowest suicide rates, the highest lifespan, the best education systems (oh yeah and college is free) and the lowest crime rates, generally speaking. In Europe I'd pay only about 8-10 percent more in taxes than I now pay, but I'd have avoid six figures in college debt, and 5 figures a YEAR in medical costs, plus another few K a year paying off all that debt.

"&gt; Better? Better how? The U.S. has far more of the vital equipment and facilities to run advanced tests and procedures than these other countries you're holding up as shining examples. If to you, as it does to so many others, ""Better"" == ""cheaper""... then yes, those other countries are ""Better"". Oh wait, what was their tax rate again? How much of those taxes go towards health care?

The proof is in the pudding, if an abundance of advanced equipment was 'better' than why are we sicker, and dying earlier, and paying WAY more for the cost? What's the motive for owning expensive machines here vs. there? Here? Profit. Ever wonder why hospitals advertise their Open MRIs on TV? I got very sick in a small city in Germany once, I was given an MRI and an endoscopic procedure, without an ounce of waiting. I was born in a Scottish hospital, my mother was allowed to stay the recommended amount of time instead of getting the boot by some insurance company. In both my experience, my parents, and many of my relatives, you don't want to get sick in the US. I was BLOWN AWAY by my German hospital stay, the facility was top notch, didn't smell of death, and I WAS the ER patient. Literally, THE patient for about 2 hours, and this was in Stuttgart, not a little village. Honestly I thought I must have been in heaven, my nurse was a stunning 24 year old blonde girl in the little white hat and skirt. I was waited on hand and foot, total cost: zero.

&gt; That's a complicated issue, one that I would argue is much more related to the genetic makeup of the population than it is to healthcare issues.

No, it's not. You're deluding yourself. The countries that beat us like the UK and other parts of Europe have HUGE immigrant populations and a high degree of variance (higher so than here, huzzah!) Have you been to London lately? It looks like a Benetton ad. Our lives are shorter because much of our population never gets preventive care, or they put off taking the more expensive medicine, or half a pill, or waiting until it's so bad that they are beyond rescuing. 

The insurance companies have a fundamental flaw that makes their continued presence untenable:
They cannot be profitable unless they are huge, and there are few of them. This is not true competition. They cannot be profitable if they don't have the ability to say no either.

"That really has much more to do with capitalism and infrastructure than gluttony.  

We pretty much invented fast food and revel in it as well as soda and other extremely unhealthy products because we have a market for them.

They are easy and cheap to produce and as a result the stores and facilities that sell them can be expanded rapidly.  

Our infrastructure and working hours aid the problem by generating more of a market for ""drive-thrus"" and extremely easy and quick (and often unhealthy) meals.  The nature of our cities and towns and land is such that many must own vehicles to travel and thus walk or bike much less.  Many of our cities are extremely unwelcoming to bikers.  

We certainly do consume lots of everything but when it comes to alcohol we have some of the latest starters in the western world.

Ashkenazi Jewish genetic diseases are a group of rare disorders that occur more often in people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage than in the general population. Even though most of these diseases are severe and life-limiting, some can be treated to reduce symptoms and prolong life.

"Well you like to throw quotes around. Here is something I copied and pasted from wikipedia.

&gt;Goebbels notes in a diary entry in 1939: ""The Führer is deeply religious, but deeply anti-Christian. He regards Christianity as a symptom of decay."" Albert Speer reports a similar statement: “You see, it’s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn’t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?""[19][20] In the Hossbach Memorandum, Hitler is recorded as saying that ""only the disintegrating effect of Christianity, and the symptoms of age"" were responsible for the demise of the Roman Empire.[21] In 1941, Hitler praised an anti-Christian tract from AD 362, neo-platonist and pagan Roman emperor Julian the Apostate's Against the Galileans, saying ""I really hadn't known how clearly a man like Julian had judged Christians and Christianity, one must read this....""[22]

"&gt; That machine certainly depreciated to zero years ago, and the tech, the engineer, the doctor could not possibly have split $12,000 between them.

While I doubt it has been completely amortized, yes I agree you are substantially correct in this regard. There is no explanation in the cost of the machine alone.

Let's figure that just 3 patients a day use it, that's 1000 per year roughly. If only $1000 of the fee for each person (a rather small fraction, most cases) were paid towards the cost of the machine, that's a million bucks a year. Since they can do up to what, 30 scans per day, at many places around the clock, and since $1000 doesn't even tend to be a third of the fee at most places... even if they were valued at $20 million, they could pay the things off in a year or two. This is faster even than the rate of equipment upgrades.

And, as you said, the imaging tech and doctor don't split $12,000 between them. We can figure in the hospital wanting their cut, a large electrical bill (they're what, 3 phase and draw alot of juice), we still can't get up that high.

On the other hand, if it really costs them $1000 per scan, and if the insurance company fights with them only paying back 1 in 12... they'd raise it that high, wouldn't they?

And it's not just that. But now they have to hire people to argue with the insurance companies. There are salaries to pay, more office space to lease.

I think we can explain the $12,000. Granted, neither of us like the answer, but there is an explanation and it's not ""profit"".

&gt; Now, socialized medicine on the other hand is a landslide success in a number of other countries. 

Depends on how you measure, doesn't it? You might measure in how healthy people are, but I dare say that even without socialized medicine, most of Europe would remain healthier than we are.

You might measure satisfaction, but let's face it... people are always happy with the status quo. They'd be happy with it here, if the democrats didn't need another issue to clobber republicans with. (Personally, I'd rather they clobber them with warmongering and fiscal mismanagement... but the democrats want to do those things as well, so they need a distraction.)

And then we could measure in ways that no one else would like, but that I personally find appealing. Let's measure how much personal responsibility people in those countries take for themselves. Let's measure the erosion of their liberties, at least for the places that used to have them. Hell, let's measure the erosion of adulthood itself. What kind of score do you think they'd get on those, by the way? 

Is there enough benefit to socialized medicine to outweigh all that? I'd be lying if I said that you couldn't bribe those things away from me... but I never thought people could be so... [shrug] ... cheap? Short-sighted, maybe.

&gt; You might think I have some bleeding heart, half-brained, lazy socialist agenda, but it might surprise you to learn I'm actually just really pissed off at being ""legally"" robbed of the difference between what that procedure actually cost and $12k.

"braindrain, as you can see in [this chart](http://j.photos.cx/healthcare-spending-dd4.gif), the US health system is the most expensive one in the whole world. This is becase it's profit-based, so there are so many people who must get paid between the patient and the companies that things get awfully expensive (marketing, etc.). I'm making up the numbers, but as others have said, something that costs $100 could end up costing $1000 to the patient.

This also means that, despite being so expensive, there's **less** money to pay the doctors, and thus there are less doctors available. That's why you suffer doctor shortage.

Here in Spain (sorry it's just the example I know best, but I know it's even better in other EU countries), the doctors are *VERY* well paid, yet there are enough of them to cover almost everything. Money is only spent in: a) Paying for the hospital manteinance and equipment; b) Paying the staff salary. That's all. You get the occasional long waiting times here and there in crowded cities when in critic times of the year, but it's usually quite smooth and wait times range from 0 to maybe 30-60 minutes if you're really unlucky or happen to go to a hospital with some sort of staff problem.

From my own experience, you usually go to the hospital, tell the ""receptionist"" nurse what's your problem, and then just show them your Social Security card. If it's an emergency, they'll get you in queue in a second. If it's not, they'll usually try to give you an appointment with your assigned doctor if he/she is available (it'll usually be more comfortable for you), at a determined time (say, 17:00). So you go home, and just go back at 17:00 and sit in the waiting room, and the doctor will call your name in minutes.

And you don't need to be carrying a cent in your pocket for this. Just your Social Security card, which will grant you free assistance in any hospital in the whole country (as they have a global DB to check your number when you check in).

Personally, I would be really angry if they ever tried to remove or limit our Social Security system as it is right now.

Edit: Oh, and please don't use the UK system as a comparison.

...and reading the rest of your link:

*""Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had been a response to an Israeli military raid in the West Bank city of Nablus at dawn on Tuesday""*

[Islamic Jihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine) is not Hamas, in fact Hamas were in the process of [arresting such militants](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099318.html) trying to operate in Gaza.  Israeli government spokesman [Mark Regev](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SILJxPTqjAM) later confirmed that Hamas fired no rockets during the ceasefire.

&gt;**Hamas does not recognize Israel.**

Hamas leadership has said several times, to many people, that they are now willing to accept Israel.

&gt;&gt;displaced refugees are allowed to return to homes

&gt;**This is unrealistic. Israel is unprepared and unwilling to suddenly take in such large numbers. You can argue until the cows come home about what is just and what is legal, but if peace is conditioned on an unrealistic goal, then peace is impossible.**

The only thing making it unrealistic are the people protesting it.  If however you are saying that 'legal' and 'just' cannot be achieved then it is clear where the problem lies; you're arguing for an illegal and immoral resolution i.e. suppression and capitulation, or no resolution at all.  Your way of thinking is part of the problem, not part of the solution.  You're also trying to say it is unpractical.  Unpractical?  Really??  'Practical' would state that many would choose to stay in a recognised Palestinian state, practical says that much of the land from which they'd been removed would be back in Palestinian hands anyway if they went with 1967 borders - which moderates on all sides say is doable.  'Practical' also shows that many regions have taken in massive influxes of populations and prospered...Israel on independence for example.


&gt;&gt;Back in 1967... the only difference between then and now can be put down to one thing:

&gt;**War. The 6-day war started when Egypt closed the straits of Tiran and lined up a thousand tanks on the border, to provoke Israel. If we now scale things back to pre-1967, this time Egypt won't line up 10,000 tanks on the border? Why do you believe that forward progress will be made by going backwards in time?**

Hardly going backwards, you take what positives you've garnered.  I like to think of it as 'moving forward through gaining historic perspective'.  But backwards?  No, like, oh I don't know, the peace treaty with Egypt.  If the land was enough in 1967 but isn't enough now, even though it would mean peace treaties with not just Palestine but the 22 state Arab League, then you can either argue for a need for a buffer zone (mistrust) or that you've become attached to the land seized since then (greed).  (War) is just an extension of (mistrust)...or there has been conflict since then so there is less reason to trust now.  That has already been addressed but to surmise if mistrust is the break on the process it can only be relieved by beginning to trust is encroaching quantifiable measure.  So when Hamas becomes democratically elected they're entered into negotiations like Annapolis.  When Hamas asks for and holds up a ceasefire trade restrictions are lifted as previously agreed as a condition.  Neither of these rewards were forthcoming so 'mistrust' is hardly legitimate when steps to empower trust are not taken whilst justification for mistrust is consolidated.

Like I said elsewhere, I can empathise with mistrust but you can't afford to let it dictate, otherwise things will never get better.  Certainly mistrust has led to things getting progressively worse.  Not only that but what is enough of a buffer?  Paris had 300km between it and Germany but it still became an open city and had 2 World Wars fought on its territory.  If France had taken that route after WW2 then Germany would be somewhere in the Urals now.  If it had not taken that route after WW1 one could almost argue the second would not have happened.  A little bit of trust goes a long way.  Neither France or Germany fear invasion from each other anymore and not because of buffers or Maginot lines.  You really want to argue that Israel needs a buffer...does the buffer get bigger as technology gets better.  An argument for an Israeli Euphrates Delta won't do you any favours.  

...or you could go with trust, legality and justice.  You moved people off their land - you allow them a right to return.  Saying that there's no more room for them is a silly argument.  There's room for Israeli [Aliyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Statistics), there's room for 3.4 million people since conception?  Then there's room for the indigenous people who were since spurned.

&gt;**The big issue is the return of the refugees. I think it is unrealistic to expect that Israel, 7million people, of whom 25% non-Jewish, to take in over a million Arabs, most of whom voted for Hamas.** 

Thank you.  At least I finally got an answer from someone.  We might not see eye to eye but I appreciate that.

You're right, I agree with you.  Not that it is unrealistic but that massive return of an Arab/Palestinian people is, I believe, the perceived problem.  It doesn't have to be but those that identify Israel with an ethnic identity (Judaism) and not a civic identity (Israeli) realise that Israel would not cease to exist in 20 years if it was allowed....but it wouldn't be a Jewish state just a state with a massive Jewish population and where Judaism is protected - just as the League of Nations intended with Palestine before Israel was formed from within it.  Unlike in Northern Ireland where Sinn Fein could play a waiting game because Republican babies were outnumbering Loyalists and Downing St had promised they'd recognise a referendum, the opposite is true in Israel.  An inconvenient domestic Arab population is already growing.  Right to return would be one hell of a catalyst.  The alarming thing for those who would play down peace is that they realise if this turns into a democratic or a diplomatic battle *- the oppressed guys with no army ultimately win!*

There's a countdown - the Arab population is growing.  That's the Neo-Zionist conundrum.  Keep democracy and go for peace and, given time, the neo-Zionist goals are lost at the polls.  Israel forms into a state with civic identity, not Arab or Jew, but Israeli.  So something has to give: democracy or peace or a combination there of.  Giving up peace means war, land grabs, expulsions - everything ethnic cleansing.

It's not a problem for moderate Israelis, post-zionist Israelis, humanitarians.  They're ok with Israel being a state for Israelis; Arab, Jewish, whatever.

That they voted for Hamas is neither here nor there...Hamas is saying that it will accept Israel and is willing to put down arms.  The 1million+ Arabs equally would have to live with Israelis who had served with the IDF and voted for Lieberman.  Or how France, Holland, Belgium and Germany integrated their economies in [1957](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community) just 12 years after one of the bloodiest conflicts the world has ever seen.  It's called moving on.

&gt;**If you condition peace on that, might as well give up on peace.**

Actually it is simpler than that.  The majority of the people on both sides want resolution.  The Arab states certainly want a resolution, their biggest threat is domestic and this crisis creates lots of internal groups from Islamic Jihad to Shia elements with backing from Persia.  Find an amicable resolution and their raison d'être vanishes. The world community wants a resolution; those outsiders involved in the region with troops committed need a resolution.

There are however some people on both sides who will never want a resolution.  Maybe some hardliners Arabs in the Izz ad-Din al-qassam brigades or the Islamic Jihad.  And in Israel it is those resolute [neo-zionists] that can't have both peace and democracy without losing their ambitions.   Certain big business capitalists have already eyed redevelopment contracts in Palestine - Gordon Brown wrote an empowering paper on it whilst still Chancellor.  They wouldn't want to see resolution either if there's a profit - just like contractors don't want to see the end of an Iraqi occupation either.  But these are minority groups, and forewarned is forearmed.

If you condition peace according to these people...we'll never have peace because they don't want it.  If we condition peace to the rest, the giant majority, then it is very much achievable.  Already people are being won over.  Hamas for example, hard line of the hardline in the 1980s, has said that things have changed and that if the Geneva Convention is recognised, meaning a return of East Jerusalem and a civilian right to return, and that they can agree on 1967 borders, then, in their words, they'll 'accept Israel'.",t1_c0bpw3s,2,0,,2,True,t1_c0bptzk,0,c0bpw3s,0,t5_2qh13,[deleted],worldnews,False,,t3_97avs,1426010909,1249479379,True,

The earth can comfortably move to a higher temperature without a mass extinction, and without the economic disaster caused by, say, Europe freezing due to the sudden demise of the gulf stream, but the speed of the change could mean that many species bite the dust and plenty of cities become less livable, or hardly livable, in a short time.

"Good American table manners involve a complex ritual of constant switching between fork and knife.  Normally, the knife lies on the plate at a slight angle, blade facing inwards, and the diner eats with the fork in his right hand and his left hand in his lap.  Then, when he needs to cut something, he switches his fork into his left hand, picks up his knife with his right, cuts the offending foodstuff, and then switches back, whereupon he continues to eat with the fork in his right hand his left hand in his lap.

Now, in Europe -- I can't speak for Britain, but certainly in France -- this is horrifying.  Your hand in your lap while you're eating?  Gross.  The rules are much simpler: your knife is *always* in your right hand, and your fork *always* in your left.  The knife is used not only for cutting but also to push food onto your fork.  It's a superior method in virtually every way, save perhaps one: you primarily deliver food to your mouth using your left hand, which for most people is the non-dominant one.

Personally, having been raised that way, it never seemed strange.  Sometimes very small children will eat with just a fork in their right hands, but as soon as you're of a certain age you eat with a knife.

Americans frequently won't even set a knife at the table if the thing you are eating is not perceived to require cutting, e.g., salad or spaghetti.  Europeans *always* set a knife, because most of the time, you're actually using the knife to help you get food off the plate and onto your fork anyway.  I find eating without a knife to be quite difficult, I'm not sure how Americans do it.  And yet they do.

"&gt;I actually think monarchy is much more fitting, since we're talking about private ownership, which predominantly (though not always) means individual ownership.

Calling private business ownership monarchy is disingenuous. The parallel is not as clear and straightforward as you seem to claim. I can see how one may interpret it as one, though only in a loose semantic sense based on the fact that ""one"" person is ownership of said company. However, monarchies tend to have a feeling of *absolute* power attached: the businessman can do whatever he deems fit with his company and those within, for they  are *his* to do with as he pleases. Just as we, as citizens of our nation, are the nation's to do with as the nation pleases.

If it became constitutionally illegal to say ""The flag sucks cock"" and the law stated that those who said such should be jailed for three months, then the government can do so. There is *no* higher power that can stop this. The only way this would change is if the nation itself -- represented by the government, ruled by the people in America's case -- decided to change it. This is the right of a sovereign government, which in the case of monarchy is placed in one man. 

What we see in business is something different. A businessman, no matter how much clout he has in a company, cannot keep you detained in the basement for saying anything, no matter how offensive he deems it. Nor would a business owner be able to put someone who displeases him to death. This isn't because the owner fears rebellion of the people, or that neighboring companies would wage war, but because there is a *government* overarching the company, which states that such things are illegal. The government is what guarantees and decides such things rather than the business owner. All the business owner can do is decide to no longer *employ* someone. While this can fill the shoes of a metaphorical death (firing) and dissipation of property (office supplies) by the state (business), it does not speak about the situation honestly. Instead, we have a highly biased model which insists where it should not. As it does here:

&gt;And they abuse this power, just like kings did.

How do they abuse their power? And, for that matter, *what* is this power that they ""abuse""? The only obvious power is that ownership: they own a company, they run it as they deem fit. 

&gt;Well, freeing slaves was terrifying to Southern slave owners. Democracy was terrifying to European monarchs. 

And the thought of someone laying claim on the table I made with my own hands is terrifying to me. For this point to be worth anything at all, you need to step back and realize that we're talking about *property* rather than government (so the European Monarchies are a bad analogy) and a piece of property which is *not* human (unlike slavery).

If we wish to take the argument and compare it to slavery, it might be fitting to specify *how* it's like slavery. This analogy misses a ciritical component: the alleged slave is still free. Anyone can leave a job to work for themselves, *set up* a co-op that works exactly you describe or another job that behaves according to a more traditional schema. No one is locked into a system at all. Instead, they can go  wherever they wish to and allocate their resources however they please in order to make money. 

Who are you to say someone *can't* go into a job without taking on the responcibility own *owning* a segment of it? There is stress associated with ownership of a company. As others have said, business owners stick their necks out. It's *them* and *their* livelihood on the line if it fails. They have a great deal of *personal* stake in the matter. What if I don't want that sort of personal stake? What if, when the company goes under, I want to be free to go off and say ""I worked hard and did my job well,"" without having the failure of a company *which is mine in part* brought back in  my face? There is liberty there. More so than in a system of forced responcibility.

&gt;They would still own them for a long time. Maybe even for most of their working career. Like I said, it would be gradual. You can't take any of your wealth into the afterlife with you.

The last point is rather moot, unless you want to start attacking someone's right to bequeath property after someone dies. 

Aside from this, the original owner placed a ton of risk when they began their business. Why should they have all of the risk and hard work in the beginning and none of the benefit at the end? It's one thing to see company shares vanish before the might of a hostile takeover and shrewd maneuvering, and another to see it *given* away because of some strange sense of equity. One is a risk business owners can expect, the other is a slap in the face.

&gt;Is this you throwing a temper tantrum? ""I don't wanna! I don't wanna! Waaaaahhhhh!""

It's a legitimate question for anyone who has believes people have a right to their property. If I came before you and demanded that you turn over your possessions at the point of a gun, would you be throwing a tantrum if you resisted? This is precisely what's going on if someone made a law to strip ownership of businesses from the owner to the workers. This is what happened when the government decided to strip away land from Native Americans. This is also what happened when the government decided to take slaves away from slave holders and levy taxes. There needs to be justification that extends beyond the barrel of a  gun or the end of a law. If it came down to a game of numbers or force, there would be no need to debate. So appealing to the authority of law or the majority to determine what is fair seems rather weak.

&gt;Crumbs. Food scraps. Not good enough.

Who are you to decide what is or isn't good enough? As I mentioned before, there are people who don't want the responcibility of owning a business. Why should they demand the perks of a risk they'd rather not take? Why should they be forced to take a risk they'd rather not have in order to earn a decent wage? 

&gt;Marx made the point that wages are kept as low as they can possibly be kept while still keeping an employee. Their compensation is not the amount they deserve, in reality.

In a healthy system, this isn't a bad thing. To shift the paradigm a bit, the commodity employees sell to employers is hours of time. If the employee sells their hours of time for too much, no one would want to purchase it. If they sell it for too low, the employee can't earn a living. Should we give bits of profit to the paper maker who makes the paper a company uses to work? They provided their service -- the paper *and paper making* -- and they get a discrete payment with no holding in the company.  Employees tend to have a greater stake, but still not a perfect stake because they are shielded from risk. If the company goes down, the paper maker looses a client and an employee lost a job. The employer *lost property* and all the investments made into that property. 

&gt;Right. Even patents right now are only good for a limited time. There's no reason an individual should be granted perpetual ownership of a company. That's not fair. Just like the government insures employees have certain rights, they should also insure more rights, like the right to vote on things in their workplace and to share in the profits.

Patents are given so that inventors can benefit from the concept of their invention. They made a new type of apple slicer. They are given exclusive rights to make more slicers for a set amount of time and profit from it. At no point is the actual slicer taken from them, let alone taken and given to the factory that made slicers *for* the inventor. It's given to the people to use the idea as they please. Why should something as novel as removing ownership rights and granting it to a subset tangentially involved in the piece of property become the norm? Should renters eventually become owners of a property, no matter how much they loved to tend the garden? Why should the renters be forced to keep a fancy garden at all if they don't want to?

Liberty is a tricky thing, especially when paired with ownership rights and economics. But I think *forced* ""democratic"" business models take things way too far. Especially if we tread into the mire of relationships between companies. If a company is under contract to perform services for another company, temporarily, does the employed company an employee of sorts who has a say in how the employer company runs? Why should *that* be fair? Do maids have a say in the households they clean, as they're employed by the owners for a time?

"&gt;Well, first off, in a free market, you probably wouldn't be able to maintain a mortgage without insurance

not true. Lots of people do. It's completely optional.

&gt;You'd be strongly incentivized against letting your house burn down, because it's better to owe money on a house you can live in than to owe money on a smoldering pile of ash.

House is the collateral for the loan. If you stop paying the loan, the bank gets the house -- whatever condition it's in. There is nothing else they can claim besides the collateral.

&gt;So you'd call the fire protection service that you were subscribed to and give them an order to come protect your house.

right... because you are at home all the time, just in case this happens.

&gt;And again, without bankruptcy, no easy way for him to duck it if you win.

So out of curiosity, what do you do with the people who genuinely can't pay? Let's suppose the crazy neighbor from your example not only lost all his equity in the house but also lost his job and savings due to the recession? If he can't declare bankruptcy, what do you do with him?
Also, if there is no bankruptcy for individuals, would there still be bankruptcy for corporations? If the answer is no, would the shareholders be liable for the debts? [As an aside, a significant number of american settlers were escaping from their creditors back in Europe.]

&gt;It's not necessary to socialize/populize the services you mentioned (police, fire, basic health care, etc); doing so is just an easy answer to a complex problem, and is, more than anything, a sign of simplistic (and ultimately, unrealistic) thinking.

On the contrary, it is the recognition that world is more complex than a school textbook would have you believe. Pure ideologies do not work. You, however, seem to think that ""privatize it"" is the answer to every problem.

&gt;And it's been proven time and time again that most populized/socialized systems just don't work.

False. Every developed country with socialized medicine (UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Australia -- you name it) has better health care outcomes and lower costs than the US system. That's a fact. If you cannot acknowledge it, we have nothing further to discuss.

&gt;As to your ""hybrid"" solution: There is no universal definition of ""basic,"" and once you establish ""basic"" healthcare, it will only continue to grow, and the proponents of the growth will be happy to borrow a phrase you've used: They will tell us it's being done by necessity.

Agreed, but now we are just negotiating where to draw the line. That can be settled through the democratic process.

&gt;Just look at ""basic"" education, which now covers K-12, college, and is looking to expand downward to preschool. Insanity. Utter insanity.

College is certainly not free in US and neither is daycare for preschool children. And just to make sure I understand what you are suggesting, do you want to get rid of public education?

&gt;Subscriptions would be a g model for police protection and fire protection, as well as basic health care... Insurance is a great way to handle advanced health care, accidents, and the insurance model would also probably would well for fire protection (though not likely for police protection... maybe for advanced police services).

So somebody who cannot afford the subscription does not get police protection? Also, what constitutes ""advanced police services""? Are you really so callous as to make the victims pay police for protection? Isn't this the kind of ""protection"" I can get from the mob?

&gt;Charity, of course, is the free market's way of making sure the apparent scads of ""disadvantaged people"" don't get left behind.

Are you seriously suggesting that charity is the way to solve health care crisis? That doesn't seem to be working for 50 million americans. In your reply you have demonstrated sociopathic callousness and indifference to the suffering of others. You would have me believe that you are a charitable person?

&gt;They are, however, voluntary, and not funded by coercion, which is really the important factor. 

I think you are confusing coercion with democracy. Sometimes democratic process will lead to decisions you don't like (for example, I don't like that the speed limit is 65mph).

"The Ron Francis trade.

Looking back, the Penguins got the best end of the deal there by FAR. Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson were fan favorites and keys to their two cups, while Grant Jennings was a decent (albeit not overwhelming) defenceman. They gave up John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski, and Jeff Parker. But hindsight is 20:20. At the time, this seemed like much more of a gamble.

Cullen was leading the scoring race at the time of the trade (with over 90 points, and would finish with 110 for the season) and had had a 90 point season the year before. Zarley Zalapski was a former 1st round draft pick (4th overall) who had 48 points with the Pens and a solid hip check, but had begun to rankle under Bob Johnson's system (requiring a change of scenery). Jeff Parker was a throw-in, but he was mid-twenties D-man with the looks of potential.

So, let's call Parker and Jennings a wash. The Whalers traded a fan favorite but (they thought) peaking centerman for a younger, faster scoring leader. Zarley Zalapski was a scoring d-man, while Ulf was always a punisher, so that was more for taste than quality, but still considered a move up in the offense department. In Pittsburgh, many thought that this could have been a major bust.

But Francis turned out to be FAR from over in his career. Ulf never made a difference in goals for, but his ""borderline"" dirty play helped give some grit to the otherwise finesse-heavy Pens (and later, the Rangers). Jennings proved a capable player who would remain in Pittsburgh for another few seasons before quietly fading into the minors.

Cullen's best days were behind him, however. He finished the next season with 77 points, got injured, and never got above 55 points again. He also suffered from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which caused him to retire early.

Zalapski had two solid seasons with the Whalers (57 and 65 points) before becoming injured. He was traded to the Flames, never regained his scoring touch, and bummed between the NHL, minor leagues, and European leagues, where he still plays.

Jeff Parker played four games for the Whalers before becoming injured and retiring.

"Firstly, kudos - thanks for the well thought out reply - more interesting than bear-baiting!

I accept your counter-arguments, and will bear them in mind next time I'm over. I must confess, my experiences of America have been for a fair part less than wonderful. Don't get me wrong - as I said previously, I *know* that my initial statement was a gross generalization - I've had some fantastic experiences while out there, but some experiences that have been so negative they've seriously dented my impression of the country as a whole.

When I lived in Chicago, it was from the age of 7 til 17 - I lived in white suburbia north of Chicago, where there were sidewalks where you would not see a soul, *ever*. The city I lived in had no center, no business district, nothing - a couple of supermarkets dotted around, and a mall a 20 minute drive away, filled with the same stores you see everywhere else. As for community - there really wasn't any - everyone lived in their McMansions, drove their kids to school half a mile away, and commuted to work downtown - if you wanted to meet people, the only place in town was the church.

As for my adult experiences of America - they've been far better, admittedly, than my childhood there, but something still lacks. I've principally spent time in Charlottesville, VA, New York, Boston, Denver and LA - the cities are busy, and full of people, but there's no conversation, no interaction beyond the superficial. In the setting of the majority of various clients I've worked with, the tendency is towards very formal, utterly work-oriented interactions, with no personality behind them.

Ultimately, I suppose the principle difference between American culture and European culture that has really defined America for me is down to the level of sociality. Brits are seen by Americans as being uptight and reserved - they are - but when they open up, they really do - crack a Brit's crusty outer shell and everything comes spilling out. Americans are superficially very, very open, but damn near impossible to know beyond that superficial level (again, I know this is a generalisation, but it's been my experience of them).

&gt; The USA is almost as large as the whole European Union. So to claim that it is the only country on earth is wrong. The USA is 50+ countries without universal health care

This is hilarious, only because I often find myself pointing this out to others who claim Americans aren't diverse because they don't travel to other countries as much.

Point is, all other nations have national health care, this one (or these) does not. The states are definitely on the conservative side of things here.

&gt; You also ignore the fact that all the other countries have a GDP per capita that is $10,000+ lower than that of the USA.

That is simply false. Norway and Luxembourg are higher than the USA. Ireland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and others are less than $10,000 away. (at least, according to the CIA's factbook).

&gt; You are comparing apples and oranges. The military budget doesn’t have anything to do with health care (even though the military budget is too large).

I'm not comparing anything. I'm pointing out major conservative standings: personal responsibility for health care and a large national defense. The US definitely stands on the conservative side of these things in comparison with the rest of the world. To claim the conservatives here are dismissed out of hand seems quite the falsehood.

"The server has been overrun, and I didn't see them. BUT I have been exploring it on Google Earth lately. It's interesting in that what I've seen doesn't quite show the squalor that makes the photo essays, but it's still obvious from above, that the city is... well, ""quite spacious"" in parts. 

I haven't run into any kind of abject squalor, but lots of completly vacant blocks, and lots more that are mostly vacant. You can tell that those blocks were once packed house to house, by the architecture of the remaining houses. Apparently, the city comes in and mows the grass in the blocks.

What's most interesting may be in what's *not* there. There are some sections where Google's street view coverage just ends. 

Still, I don't find Detroit as disturbing of some parts of Philly. For all its abandonment, Detroit has the image of ""small town America"" in the ""normalcy"" of its neighborhoods as they once were. Houses with yards, sidewalks, trees. Like a small town, just more blocks.

One shot in Max Manus/Man of War where a guy gets run over. It isn't a the most pretty show i have done, but it was extremly complicated because of the way it was filmed. I am not going to explain it unless you really want a long and boring talk.

Try to speak their language (Spanish, Portugese, or native languages like Quechua (Peru) if you really good).

2.  They flirt in a polite and wholesome way for 15 minutes.

3.  Doogie gets the Howser halfway in before she wants to stop for some reason.

5.  Later, he writes a journal entry about the whole thing on his computer (which is too primitive for internet porn).  At one point he looks up slightly, smiles, and finishes the journal entry with some clever-yet-polite-and-wholesome concluding thought.

He snapped in the last episode and went to Rome.  This was after not boning his babysitter, on whom he had a massive lifelong crush, after his girlfriend went to art school, after not boning a girl during an eclipse, after not boning his mother's boss, after not boning the older sister of a cute preteen, after not boning Vinnie's longterm girlfriend although he had the chance, after not boning sixteen or seventeen different interns, after not boning that redheaded bitch who kept showing up again and again and played the chick who slept with the mayor and KILLED HIM WITH SEX in *Twin Peaks*.

"&gt;Every time you have a ""connecting point"" you have a new weakness in the system. ... If a truck breaks down on the road, you get another truck.

When there are more connection points, it's easier to arrange an alternative route. Those points will also have more storage available, because that's required when switching modes. As a downside, loading the cargo in another mode of transport will delay the total time a given object is underway. The flow of resources should be just as fast, and more resilient: if a train breaks down, you can have trucks as backup measure. If you already rely on trucks completely, and ff prices rise (as they inevitably will), you're up shit creek without a paddle.

&gt;The sudden affordability of the car

The sudden affordability of compressed energy in a convenient package, i.e. petroleum. Which is a one-time only bonanza, and will be not affordable anymore just as suddenly. Gradually rising tax is just a way to smoothe the transition on our own terms.

&gt;You're making a ethos argument here, not a logos one.

No. Dense living allows for more energy-efficient transportation. That's why cities exist.

&gt;... That has got to be the single most absurd thing I have read in weeks.

Drop thousand accountants and bankers with a trillion dollars on an island. Drop a thousand shipwrights and mechanics with materials to build a ship on an island. Guess who gets home first?

&gt;More sophisticated systems cost more -- especially when that sophistication is being applied to ecological standards. The more sophisticated the system, generally, the more costly it is.

Earlier technology often was cheaper ánd more ecological, by necessity. The reason that more advanced technology is more energy expensive, is that energy hasn't been a limiting factor in the last century and there was always more available at a bargain price. Now it's time to focus our efforts on efficiency gains, and a ff tax will stimulate that.

&gt;Thank Cthulhu you're not in charge of things. No. That's absolutely absurd. The level of social injustice and turmoil you're recommending in so blithe a manner says to me that you have no clue what you're discussing.

Shub-Nigurrath is on my side! It will inevitably happen. The free marketeers' approach is just to wait until depletion naturally makes the ff prices rise, at wich point the same turmoil will happen, but the other taxes will still be at the current high level.

&gt;And whenever the rates are raised, the effects are as I describe.

As an example, see other places where ff taxes are higher. In Europe, car engines are just much more efficient as a result of consistently higher taxes.

&gt;... a guarantee of disaster.

What's the argument? Taxes are already levied. It's just changing a number in the calculation from eg. 0,5% to 5%. When cleverly applied, it can eliminate other taxes. It's a breakeven, in the worst case.

&gt;Actually, humans are better adapted to desert environments than they are to temperate climates. Barring access to water, LV and PHX are better places to situate a large population.

Given the right adaptations, which will not happen as long as ff are that cheap.

&gt;Again, that's an ethos argument, not a logos argument. You're trying to take the moral high ground on an entirely practical discussion. It's... a flawed approach.

It's an entirely practical argument, based on energy costs. Lifestyle is a choice subject to practical constraints: arguing that reality should adapt to support lifestyle choices is absurd, and ironically a moral argument where you value the personal opinion of the persons involved higher than the objective energy costs of a house in the suburbs vs. one in the city.",t1_c0bsa6y,0,0,,0,False,t1_c0brux7,0,c0bsa6y,0,t5_mouw,silverionmox,science,False,,t3_97qdy,1426012277,1249636667,True,

"Part 1:

&gt;Of course I can. By convincing the other wage workers you're working with to take over the means of production.

But given that they are already willing to work for wages, how do you stop them?  If you are an anarchist, you won't.

&gt;The problem is that you will oppose the means by which we can reach anarchy (ie revolution) because you need to defend the right of the capitalist to exploit the worker. As such, you have already put yourself in the opposite camp in regards to achieving anarchy.

That is not anarchism.  That is authoritarian.  If you outlaw *any* form of trade between consenting individuals, be it coop trading, or capitalist trading, then you are an authoritarian, because the only way you can stop certain trades from taking place that allow both sides to make gains is by having an authority to stop them.

&gt;You miss the part where all workers of a company are convinced of their exploitation and then justly take over the means of production and run it themselves.

You miss the part where that doesn't have to occur in every company.  In many cases the workers will not want to own their own companies for whatever reason, and would rather earn wages.  You keep mistaking what you want others to do, and what you think you can convince others to do, with what they will actually do.  You seem to not understand that gains can be made by not owning a company, but earning a wage instead.  Many people would gladly make a wage than run their own company, even if they had the choice.  For some reason you want me to think that taking a wage paying job is the last thing anyone would choose.  That is incorrect.  You can easily see your errors by merely considering all the self-sufficient farmers who lived in the countryside who voluntarily left their farms to take up wage paying jobs in the factories in and around the cities.  Nobody forced them.  See, you have to look at what people do before you can claim to know what the optimal choices for people are.  Don't presume to know what's best for people until you ask, or observe.  In many cases, wage jobs are SUPERIOR to being self-sufficient.

&gt;He can only do that when he own his own house and his own workshop/farm.

That's how society began.

&gt;If everyone had this capability, then capitalism would have collapsed already as wage-slavery would not be preferred.

But people started out as self-sufficient farmers, and voluntarily left to go work as wage earners.  Self-sufficiency collapsed.

&gt;It is in fact for this particular reason that the EU Enclosure movement and the US land monopoly used state violence to help the initial stages of Capitalism.

Irrelevant to our discussion, which is anarchist theory.

&gt;Nobody wanted to work for wages ""voluntarily"" when there was an alternative.

Yes they did.  Millions of farmers had the choice between staying on their farms and being self-sufficient or leaving their farms and working for wages.  If you look at what actually happened, like if you actually read history instead of just demanding that I read it, then you will see that there was a huge voluntary movement away from privately owned self-sufficient farms and workshops, to wage labor in the factories. This happened in the American northeast, south, and midwest, as well as in Europe, China, virtually all over the world.  When people are given a choice between being self-sufficient or being a wage earner, many people willingly chose to leave their farms and workshops to go work in the factories.  This was such a prevalent movement that I find it extremely telling that you willingly choose to ignore it.

&gt;Again, unless everyone has this option, then you cannot speak about how an alternative exists and ""voluntary"" wage-slavery.

To ask that everyone be given the same exact options before they are allowed to choose is like asking that pigs first have to fly.  Look, just consider the world, you know, outside your basement.  Some people are born in the desert.  Some people are born in lush forests.  Some people are born in prairies.  Still others are born near the ocean.  Each one of these people face stark realities that no capitalist or anyone else is responsible for.  Not only that, but more importantly, people are born with varying abilities, with varying desires, wants, needs, and drives.  Nobody can nor should have the exact same alternatives before I presume to decide whether or not individuals can decide to work for themselves or if they work for others for a wage.  Some people, by the fact of mother nature alone, face death or working for a wage.  These circumstances are not caused by capitalists, anymore than a socialist country is the cause for why someone is born in a very barren location with little to no food.  The Earth is not all fun and roses.  Some places are very dangerous and harmful to man.  The key thing is that everyone is free to trade and free to make any choices they want in order to alleviate their predicaments. 

If you were an anarchist, and not a totalitarian, then you would have allowed people to find any means necessary to better their situation, including the willingness to work for wages and not own their own farm or workshop or whatever else.

&gt;I don't know this utopia you speak of where all parents own their own houses and are self-sufficient. How do you make it happen?

Capitalism.

&gt;Study history. See how many of these children preferred to go become wage-slaves. Again, learn about the enclosures and the history and rise of US Capitalism. Read goddamn Tucker fer crying out loud.

You study history.  You study how many self-sufficient farmers willingly left their farms to go work in the factories for a wage.  The number will knock your socks off, but that would only be if you were intellectually honest and consistent, which it doesn't seem you are.

"I'm 16 and I have the same feeling.

It's not the age. It's the rationality. It's the fact that you realize how immense and amazing it all is and how it all got there where as a religious person would be capable of doing such a thing, but they usually see something worth appreciating and see god in it instead of letting it sink in and bringing them more comfort than belief in god ever could. (run-on) I've never actually met a religious person who feels that wonder, but I have met other atheists who do. 

I was lying on the rooftop of our hotel in Vienna watching the sun set over the city during my school trip to Europe this summer and I started talking to a kid about how amazing it is that each one of those dim specs you see in the sky is a star about the size of our sun. We got talking about it and I'm sure you have all had conversations like this before. We talked for 4 hours. Until 3:00 am. We talked about anything from politics to religion. We even had a conversation about this very topic. Turns out, he's an atheist as well. We had to go back down from the roof when all the other kids up there did because we didn't want to be alone up there, but we really wanted to stay longer. That was one of the highlights of my life and I will never forget it. 

That wonderment you feel when you realize how amazing the universe/world/anything is is shared by most of us. I would say Atheism is more eye-opening than anything.

"why is your goal to debunk? seems rather intellectually dishonest

I guess it fits though since you're crediting hunayn ibn ishaq with translating the works of greek philosophers, when the article you link talks about his work in translating scientific and medical texts from greek into arabic. it's quite well known that averroes translated the works of aristotle and plato from greek to arabic and worked with translators to have them translated into latin. For his work, he is credited with being among the fathers of the european enlightenment. You casually assert that his books were burned, yet we have many of his original manuscripts today. 

what is your point exactly? Hunayn ibn ishaq was one of many arab scientists that benefitted from the Muslim civilization's emphasis on scientific and technological advancement. He worked at bait al-hikmah, the house of wisdom, in Baghdad, where it was customary to pay scientists the weight of their manuscripts in gold.

That's what the article says. Besides, you ignored my main points 1) the article is christian propaganda, and 2) it doesn't matter what french scholars claim about arab history!! - they are studying heresay of heresay written by, in best case scenarios, orientalist scholars that lived 200 years ago hell-bent on justifying the atrocities committed against non-whites. 

I object to jihadwatch and you bring me ""brussels journal, the voice of conservatism in europe""??? it has titles like ""Swat and the Prospects of Islamic Conquest"" and ""Clenardus and the Way Out of Islam"" - sorry but this is just more propaganda.

actually, there are many shades of gray - half-truths, exaggerations, rhetorical innuendo, etc. I'm not surprised to hear you describe the world as black and white though, it explains much of your simplistic worldview. 

here, I'm going to annotate your first quoted paragraph with ""LOL + quick commentary"" for each rhetorical device designed to be propaganda:

&gt;When the Arab Muslims, a collection of backward **LOL@rhetoric**, nomadic **LOL- there were many real cities - the conquerors were not bedouins** warrior tribes **LOL - islam is anti-tribalism** who did not even have a fully developed script **LOL study the uthmani script it's very advanced - european languages were not even written at this time**, conquered Egypt, Syria and Iran, they took control **LOL you realize bait al hikmah was built by muslims, this is a lie designed to discredit their acheivements** over some of the world’s largest centres of accumulated knowledge. To say that “Muslims” or “Islamic culture” created the civilizations of the Middle East can be compared to an illiterate **LOL gross exaggeration** person storming into the planet’s largest library, killing all the librarians and then claiming to have written all the books there **LOLOL - [thousands of original texts were written by muslim scholars you dirty liar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_contributions_to_Medieval_Europe)**. The cultural superiority of the Middle East in relations to Europe did not begin with Islam’s entry into the area**LOL - because so many medical texts were written prior to the 7th century right?**. In fact, it ended with it **LOL - except for the 800 years of enlightened islamic scientific acheivement**. One of the great riddles of history is how this once-dynamic region could become the world’s number one problem spot **LOL - it's not a riddle, we know exactly how it happened - european christians conquered enslaved killed and looted the civilization**. It so happens that this decline coincides with the region’s Islamization **LOL - you're off by 800 years it actually coincides with european colonization**, although some would claim that it had already started before this **LOL - some? who? nobody is that dumb**. Islam’s much-vaunted “Golden Age” was in reality just the twilight **LOL - an 800 year twilight?** of the conquered pre-Islamic cultures, an echo of times passed.

your propaganda is worth lots of LOLs. pretty please, stop linking propagandist rhetoric. At this point, you're just trolling. You're not interested in academic debate, just smearing hate-speech.

A certain number of them being wealthy does not make the Copts wealthy as a group (unless you have no grasp of statistics). Moreover I never said that they were ""barely surviving off of pig meat."" Perhaps you wish to crack open a medical dictionary and look up the definition of malnutrition.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8185844.stm

From the story: ""Dr Atif Salib, who runs a clinic in Manshiet Nasser, says he is now seeing cases of malnutrition and anaemia in children. Pork was the only affordable source of animal protein.""

&gt;similarly, the chaldean communities did just fine. Saddam repressed them, but again, it's quite a stretch to call that religious repression.

Saddam was actually surprisingly tolerant of the Chaldean Christians. It's the democratic Islam Republic of Iraq that's now making it such a unwelcoming place for them. 

&gt;Your trying to apologize for and soften the effect of the spanish inquisition just shows what repugnant depths you'll fall to in order to ""win"" an argument.

The Inquisition and the Reconquista are two separate things. If you didn't know that I can presume you've little knowledge of the subject at hand.

Moreover, you're confounding the crusades (which was the topic we *were* discussing) and European colonialism. The Crusades were simply a pan-European reponse to Muslim aggression, which started the day Muhammed couldn't get his way and decided to go on a holy war to solve his sect's problems. For example, the Barbary pirates constantly raided Europe since the 11th century and untile the 19th century and captured millions of Europeans and sold them off as slaves. They felt they were justified in doing so because Europeans were not Muslims. Interestingly the Arab slave trade was the precursor to the European one, started before the European one, and ended much after the European one. Mainly because Europeans were sophisticated enough to throw off the Middle Eastern holy books and embrace the Enlightenment.

&gt;Oh some of them speak arabic? so did every learned man of europe at the time. It was the lingua franca. 

Now that's absolute bullshit. I would seriously like to see an academic reference for that. Latin was the lingua franca of Western Europa until the after the Renaissance when French was used as the language of diplomacy.

"I've been saying this for over a year now. It's simply too late to expect that it's possible to avoid disaster. 

So, that being the case world population is going to decline, waterfront properties may flood and energy demand will also decline. 

We still need renewable energy, but in many ways mother Earth will enact her own kind of minimalism on humanity. 

The question is what areas will be the best to live. I'm guessing North America is one of the best. South America is pretty good, but politically less stable. It won't take long for people to starve. 

They say the world is always nine meals from anarchy. So in about 3 days of severe food rationing and the areas effected will fall into chaos as people starve to death.  

It should be a stark wake up call but one that will have come far too late. I expect the world population to decline by at least 2 billion people within my lifetime. I expect to see a summer with no arctic ice within 10 years. 

I fear this will trigger a cooling period and the northern latitudes will be fucked, as in most of Europe and the entire north half of America. It may ruin most of America's crop land for who know maybe a few hundred years maybe just a couple decades. I suspect if the rapidness of warming is a rough deterministically factor then we'll see a cool period trigger which will be worse than the Little Ice Age if not a full blown ice age. 

Once the arctic ice is all melted it will be hard to deny ocean currents are being severely damaged as well and that leads us to the realization that climate on earth is about to change dramatically. If we disturb the ocean currents weather as we know it changes on earth and all in all they may be far more fragile than we ever thought. However they should return to a similar equlibrium once the warming trend ends.

More worrisome is that activity in our solar system is helping the trend along and CO2 is just amplifying the problem. Unrelated to CO2 levels the earths magnetosphere has decline 15% or and it appears it could be do to level of dust particulate rising in the solar system as we spin around the edge of the galaxy. 

It's is VERY likely that some parts of the galaxy are more dangerous and thus extinctions are more prone. The falling magnetosphere could also be a polar reversal which probably isn't all that great either.

http://books.google.com/books?id=hwmCBIYB0vAC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=galactic+plane+extinction+likelyhood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=30uTuF5AQ5&amp;sig=WB3YoaRODW9aD14Ajd4qOPxue1c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-e59So6dFpWBtwf1ivjmAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false

I suspect we have entered an area of the galaxy which has increased the likely hood of extinction and, rather than meteor strike, probably altering our weather by pulling us through large radioactive dust clouds and such. The clouds can interfere with solar winds and change the size of the suns heliosphere, which is the most likely reason for magnetosphere decline, but... we'll see.

I highly suspect it's not just CO2.

"I feel your pain here man.

I had a bad experience with an old high school crush, which involved a lot of the things you mentioned.  Unclear feelings, leading me on and not putting out, expecting me to be a boyfriend like figure, but never recognizing me as one.  Not to mention that she had a boyfriend when we told each other we had feelings for each other.  I cannot totally blame her, I agreed to a lot of those conditions, until she told me that she wanted to see several guys at once after she broke up with her boyfriend.  So I ended it then and their.  

She still persisted to come onto me, even after she picked out a new boyfriend.  So to drive the fact home that we totally done, I began dating her best friend/next door college room mate.  She wasn't a rebound, and I really did have feelings for this other girl, it only lasted the one date when she decided that I made her too ""uncomfortable.""

I wake up the next day to see that these girls have de-friended me on facebook, as well as some of their friends that I had met at their college.  I felt like crap, but in the end I realized that I had just gotten rid of this drama, and that it couldn't have ended any better way.

Since these two break ups I have come to realize a few very important things:
1.) Stay away from girls in relationships, if they are willing to be affectionate with you while they are in a relationship, then there is nothing keeping them from being unfaithful to you if you ever do get in a relationship.

2.) Stay further away from girls who are just coming out of a relationship.  You may think you are helping them by being the shoulder to cry on while they are recovering, but they will come to recognize you as only a friend figure, and won't want any more.  

3.) When you end things with a girl, all it means is that you are setting yourself up to be with a better person.  Always keep in mind that there are 6 BILLION people in the world, meaning there are 3 BILLION women, your odds are pretty good for finding someone better.  As a wise man always said ""Women are like buses, there'll be a new one every 10 minutes.""

P.S. I would not advise waiting for her, for it seems that she is just holding you in this purgatory of hers.  Don't wait for her to come back from Europe, but let it play out.  I guess what I am trying to say is that you shouldn't restrict your options when you are single.

I do wish you the best of luck

"&gt;a) In your opinion, should Europeans be afraid, that Islam is the fastest growing religion in EU? Do they intent to turn EU into a Islamic state?

Yes Europeans should be afraid. And yes extremists want to turn the whole world into an Islamic state. However, don't get me wrong. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and don't have any higher domination plans. It is the religious leaders who should be controlled.

&gt;b) Are there any Islamic countries that are actually successful? in the sense that the average population has a good standard of living (e.g. health care and schools and freedom of speech)?

Hmm, this is all relative. I think the wealth in the gulf countries like Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabic helped them have a good slandered of living (schools, health care, ...). But not freedom of speech. On the contrary they are one of the worst regarding freedom of speech. I can't think of any successful Islamic countries in that sense.

&gt;c) What do you think we should do about the Islamic forces in the world? Is talk the way to deal with it? Propaganda e.g. plenty of television and Internet? Destruction by long distance bombing?

I think the media (TV, Internet, ...) is a great tool. But people shouldn't know it is coming from outside or they'll reject it. I think Obama did some very clever moves regarding the issue. He's approaching Muslims in a good way and slowly gaining their trust. The last thing you want is a president like Bush.

&gt;d) Why do Muslims women put up with all the shit they are being put through? Why do they accept it? Why don't they revolt? (e.g. the burka - WTF!?)

They think this what god wants them to do. But the fact is, there is no mention to any of this in the Quran! And actually according to the Hadith women slaves are allowed to walk bare chested in public.

All of this is a way for male domination. Women has little value in Islam. They are no more than sex machines. Sure, they say there are 2-3 hadiths that say good things about women. But what about hundreds of other degrading ones. Why choose to read ones and not read others. 

&gt;e) Is it true that people that leaves Islam are ""open targets""?

In theory yes. According to the Quran they should be killed. Which is the case in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan.

And by the way LOTS of people who can afford it make the effort to see American-educated dentists in France. The ones who actually care about their teeth and not just a superficial visit.

My brother-in-law had a ""dead tooth"" that required lots of work to save it. He made multiple visits to a standard French dentist to receive treatments. After it was all finished, he went to visit one of the special American-educated dentists to get the work reviewed. This dentist told him that everything would need to be redone. He put together some extensive notes for my brother-in-law to give to the cheap-o dentist in order to correct it. He also pointed out a number of cavities that my bro-in-law had not even been informed of.

My brother-in-law related to me the discussion he had with the American-educated dentist about the lack of quality in French health care, which I would happy to post here if there was any open-minded interest in it. But I'm sure I would be speaking to a bunch of brick walls. Reddit has made up its mind on the issue, and once Reddit forms a bandwagon it's pretty hard to offer a different viewpoint.

This is then handed over to be tried in a seperate court with a seperate judge and jury. 

In addition, civil law jurisdictions also tend to be constitutional jurisdictions, so interpretation of the law is refered back to a foundational document rather than precedent.

"The following post pertains more to this whole thread than just your comment.
 
The taste difference between the sugar sweetened and the HFCS sweetened in soda is ridiculously minimal, at best. It is probably almost all about perceiving what you expect to perceive. Although, to be fair, when it comes to taste and smell, it is really only an individual's perception that matters even if it is erroneous.

The soda you love in Europe has 50% glucose and 50% fructose. The soda you seem to hate in America is 42% glucose and 55% fructose. HFCS and regular sugar are practically identical in terms of sweetness: HFCS is a 1.1 by weight, sucrose is a 1.0. HFCS was formulated to mimic the taste of sucrose when it was created and blind taste tests at the time confirmed their success. I can't find any modern scientific study (blogs don't count) examining the differences in taste between sucrose, not glucose, and HFCS. I know there is one that found no difference by Breslin, Beauchamp &amp; Pugh in 1996 (edit: this is actually referenced in the Slate article I mention below).

People worry about fructose because it doesn't stimulate insulin like glucose and is more likely to turn to fat. Which is true... except in cases when fructose is paired with glucose... which is always because pure fructose make us feel ill. In normal daily doses, the difference between sucrose and glucose is minimal.

The case for it being less satiating is not compelling either.

Further, on the matter of health, if you look up the studies that found HFCS leads to more increased fat storage over regular sugar (sucrose) diets, you will find support. BUT they found their results with a 30% fructose diet, rather than the normal 8-9% concentration found in normal diets. There is a good review on sweeteners, containing this information as well, by GH Anderson (2006) in *The International Journal of Obesity*. I'm fairly certain this is not funded by any outside source, as it is only a review and requires no funding, but it could be hidden.

"That's not entirely true. Languages don't evolve like species. They aren't getting more and more comfortable or efficient. Instead languages just drift over time with no real rhyme or reason. For instance, the reason why the vowels in english are all pronounced differently than the same vowels in mainland europe is because the sounds of every vowel in english has just shifted. Originally, all european languages inherited the latin characters with the latin pronounciations, still common in every other european language: i was ""ee"", e was ""ey"", a was ""ah"", etc. This used to be the case for english, but for no real reason, they all shifted, i is ""eh"", e is ""ee"", a is ""ey"".

Right now, there's a similar vowel shift going on in the US. However, it's going one direction in the northern US, and a different direction in the south (NB: the advent of TV is actually slowing this down, and we're generally shifting more in the same direction now).

MILAN -- Global warming killed 150,000 people in 2000, and the death toll could double again in the next 30 years if current trends are not reversed, the World Health Organization said Thursday.

One heat wave killed 20,000 people in Europe alone this year, the WHO said, launching a book on health-weather links at a U.N. environment conference.

Climate change, linked by scientists to human emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide from cars and factories, is causing more frequent floods and droughts and melting ice caps.

""An estimated 150,000 deaths ... were caused in the year 2000 due to climate change,"" the study said. A further 5.5 million healthy years of life were lost worldwide due to debilitating diseases caused by climate change, it said.

""The 1990s were the hottest decade on record, and the upward trend in the world's temperature does not look like it is abating,"" it said. ""In Europe this past summer, for example, an estimated 20,000 people died due to extremely hot temperatures.""

But to some degree, it's because in the early and mid twentieth century, they arrested all the socialists, all the radicals in the Debs era at the start of WWI, and lots of people in the McCarthy era.   Also, there were some big points where the socialists probably could have won but racism divided working people, e.g. in strikes over the eight hour work day, black and white people were divided, on account of the white workers having gone on race riots killing black people a few months before, lots of black people worked as strikebreakers and the strikers lost, even though at one point they were fighting off the military with stolen artillery.   That tactic got used over and over again, endless labor divisions based on race, the right tries to make poverty about brown people, in the sixties  while the french radicals got the six week vacation all our energy was still getting sucked up by people defending whites only water fountains and basically getting democracy for the first time in a third of the country.

You were taking an ice-pick and tearing a large gash in a nice little model which I was presenting to reddit and to the original poser of this question.  And I felt a need to defend my position. That conversation has continued on down to this point.

____________

Now I'm going to write a little bit more, because you're directly challenging me, and questioning my conversation style. Again, here, I must defend myself, musn't I? 

In respect to your question about my use of the word ""narrative,"" let me say this:

I don't subscribe to anyone's ideas or notions. I haven't read any particular author's thoughts in depth at all. I didn't finish college. I have my own perspective on the world which I have formed through thinking independently about what I see around me. The internet is a great tool for learning about what's happening... and it's intriguing to put together models. 

I'll tell you that I have a personal philosophy which is very very important to me - and central to my life and to how I view the world. This concept seems to have been central in the lives of the european philosophers who I most admire - folks like Descarte and Kant and Nietzsche and Aristotle. I call it the ""power of conception."" What societies believe is sometimes in error. What scientific fields believe is sometimes in error. What individuals believe is sometimes in error. And people's lives are made miserable by the fact that they don't see things accurately at times. 

So, this is my standpoint... and this what I was trying to explain to you when you started getting upset at my manner of talking with you. I feel an ethical obligation to try to get people at reddit to think outside the box a bit.",t1_c0bv6dh,1,0,,1,True,t1_c0bv5p1,0,c0bv6dh,0,t5_2qh1i,otterplay,AskReddit,False,,t3_9910o,1426013727,1249875270,True,
"All these authors -&gt; Margaret George, Linda Lay Shuler, Jean M. Auel, Diana Gabaldon, Stephen King, and Koji Suzuki.

Margaret George writes a lot of memoir type books, the first one I read was called ""Memoirs of Cleopatra"". I believe her most recent book was ""Helen of Troy."" Linda Lay Shuler wrote the ""She Who Remembers"" trilogy which starts with a young Anasazi girl accused of witchcraft because of her blue eyes. Jean M. Auel wrote the Earthchildren Saga, which pretty much follows the life of a woman raised(and cast out) by neanderthals in Prehistoric Europe. Diana Gabaldon has a time travel series, I'm not quite sure how to explain it but it starts off with a woman going back in time and being forced to marry a scottishman younger than her. Pretty typical romance beginning with a lot of character development. Stephen King...I don't have to say anything other than he rocks my socks. Koji Suzuki is the man responsible for movies like The Ring and Dark Water. The Ring Trilogy is really worth reading if you're interested in finding out the back story of the creepy girl that crawls out of the TV. 

I'm usually a sucker for thick books, they make me feel like I'm getting a better deal for my money as well as a good story. Oookay I should probably stop my rant now. Ooh!

"First off asking any American why they're against anything, and getting a well reasoned answer is a task all by itself.

Communism, Socialism are to most Americans foreign (European) concepts. That alone makes them undesirable to American notions of freedom.

The fact that America uses some socialist principles to its advantage matters little to people who hate without needing to know exactly what it is, and why they should hate it.

The government bailouts and essential ownership of the auto and banking industries are two recent examples. Medicare and Medicaid are another two examples of government control of supposedly free markets...so is social security.

There is a sub-set of Americans, the ultra-rich, politicians, big business, and others who have a vested interest in keeping this idea afloat amongst the rabble so they have something to focus their collective anger on, whilst continually getting fucked over by these very same groups.

Then there's what I call the institutionalized Southern mentality...willful ignorance for ignorance's sake. The prime example being the civil war. How many Southerners actually owned slaves or profited from their ownership?

I've seen figures of between 15 and 20 percent who were direct owners or benefited in some material way from slavery. Yet the confederacy fought a long hard war basically over states rights, and the ability for one man to own another.

The descendants of these people make up the major contingent of the birthers, are still extreme racists and xenophobes...but 100 % ""real"" American to the core.

Free markets and fundamentalism go hand and hand. Faith based free market fundamentalists, like their religious analog, have the dogmatic zealotry of their religious brothers, along with no logical proof, or material evidence for their position. Yet their proselytizing never ends. Deregulate everything, privatize everything else. The only thing government should provide is prisons, police and a military...and even that is being privatized as I write this.

This is the masterstroke of the GOP, it's also what will eventually consume it. 

Get a bunch of essentially undereducated rabble to vote against their very own best economic interests again and again by transparent appeals to their worst fears and unending prejudices, keep relitigating the civil war and perceived injustice to hard working white people (the new underclass) and you've got a captive (to their collective ignorance) audience.

Socialism/Obamaism whatever ism, they're against it, or at least they think they're against it. The GOP has been reduced to the poor white mans party of unfocused rage.

"Wait, so socialism is communism AND fascism?

Edit:  Wow, seriously guys?  Did you read past the first few words in the wikipedia link you're hitting me with?

&gt; In both popular thought and academic scholarship, Nazism is generally considered a form of fascism – a term whose definition is contentious. Both fascism and Nazism reject ideologies like democracy, liberalism and Marxism,[29] but it is difficult to indentify a perfect definition of the two terms. According to most scholars of fascism, there are both left and right influences on the ideology; it has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.

&gt; Some historians, such as Zeev Sternhell, see each movement as unique, however many historians argue that there is a stronger family resemblance between the Italian and the German fascist movements than there is between democracies in Europe or the communist states of the Cold War.[32] Additionally, the crimes of the fascist movement can be compared, not only in numbers of casualties, but also in common developments, such as Benito Mussolini's March on Rome and Adolf Hitler’s attempted coup d'etat in Munich.

In other words, Nazism called itself socialist but was more fascist than anything else.",t1_c0bvgkj,1,0,,1,True,t1_c0bvevh,0,c0bvgkj,0,t5_2cneq,thereddust,politics,False,,t3_9945n,1426013879,1249903635,True,
"&gt; I'm going to college almost exclusively on [subsidized] loans, and I like it that way. I would MUCH rather have this system then have the government pay for my education. Taking out loans and paying for everything myself makes me feel independent, responsible and it makes me appreciate my education a lot more. I don't spend my days partying and getting drunk, cus I know I'm paying for this.

That's one of the saddest things I've ever heard. I finished up with undergrad last year $70,000 in debt. Let me repeat that for you: I'm 23 years old, just starting my life, and I'm *$70,000 in debt*. I'm also one of the lucky ones who got a scholarship and went to a state university: it could easily be three times that amount for private school students. Who needs that at 23?

I'm also engaged to a Russian citizen and although neither of us want to live in the U.S. for long, we've got little other choice until I'm done paying off loans, since salaries in Russia don't even come close to allowing me to pay off that amount of money before we're too old to start saving for retirement--and I know plenty of other American graduates who've made different kinds of personal sacrifices just to pay off the massive amount of debt that they incurred in the process of getting an education.

Meanwhile, *all* of my fiance's education, from kindergarten through his Ph.D., was government-funded, and the government would have stopped paying if his grades had stopped being up to government standards.

I don't know if you've actually compared the efficacy of higher education in the U.S. with that in Europe and Russia, but I studied abroad in three countries as an undergraduate and spent my first year of grad school as a Fulbright fellow in Russia, and I'll assure you, it was humbling. High school students in Hungary were the TA's for my third-year undergraduate Galois theory class; second-year undergraduate Russian students were sailing past me, a grad student, in pseudo-differential operators--and it's not because I was a lazy student back home, it's because of what education standards in the U.S. have become as a result of students paying for their education. See, European and Russian students in general take their education seriously, since the government stops paying for it if they don't, whereas U.S. students pay for their education and somehow think that entitles them to things like grade inflation and scaling to a curve, and professors know they can't get away with holding students to higher standards because they'd complain to university administrators (the ones who are paid so well thanks to their tuition dollars), and as a result they continue to assign low-level topics and assignments that keep even motivated students limited in what they've got time to pursue on their own.

"You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist I don't think to see problems.  Even if Paulson didn't conspire specifically to provide huge amounts of cash to his friends he can be seen as caring about helping them.  Not through conspiracy but just an entitlement mentality he shares with them where they should be able to do whatever they want and if things go badly governments should bail them out.  Nobility in Europe didn't have to conspire to maintain the status quo they so deeply shared a sense of entitlement that they naturally took actions that supported the shared outcome of routing the wealth of the nation to their collective pockets.  Now you can also have out and out conspiracy to bring things things about (within the current government) but my guess is the more important factor is just having a bunch of people that all see the way the world should work is to route huge amounts of cash into the pockets of a few people.

They don't have to conspire in petty schemes.  They just naturally support actions that bring about the transfer of funds to those few people.  This is actually a much more robust design to bring about the desired results than having to conspire on all sort of individual schemes.  They just see the natural role of government is to provide huge benefits to well connected friends and carry out such actions.  They think it is perfectly appropriate to use regulations to allow anti-competitive behavior.  They think it is perfectly sensible to avoid regulation that would harm their rich friends.  I think such actions are much more common than any secret plots to take what isn't theirs and give it to friends or those that bribe them...

They see providing benefits to their rich friends much like someone else might see helping those that don't have enough to eat get enough to eat.

We're through... don't call me, don't text me, don't bother now.  You'll never know what you lost, I was the one, and now I feel sorry for you because you'll never have that again.  I feel so sorry for you, ha ha ha. (ed:  she left messages at my mom's demanding I call her back.  My mom would've called her to tell her I was in Europe except she didn't leave her number and my mom doesn't have it.)
(Ed: I just got dumped while I was on a different continent than my girlfriend... I've been in Europe only 5 days... and the emails are just beginning.

JD, Call me, we need to talk

Tuesday June 12

Subject: Just listen....

ok fine, you don't want to call me then just listen.  I'm mad and hurt right now.  I really felt something between us and now you've gone and thrown it all away and I have no idea why.  JD, we were amazing together weren't we?  We always had fun, and I tried to be so easy going and happy with you.  We were the couple that could spend an evening out with our friends or laze about on the couch and either way end it all in fantastic sex and confessions of love.  I know that something has happened to change all that, but you have to admit that you still feel something for me.  To deny that is to deny your very soul. I know you'll call me tonight. We have a lot to discuss. A lot of bad nd good.  It may not change things and we may still be broken up, but you at least owe me a conversation. A chance. Em

(ed: I've been in Europe for 12 days.  I am coming home on Saturday. On this day I go shopping in Rome and get a necklace for Em and write a postcard to my grandparents.)

Thursday June 14th

Subject: I tried...

I tried to reach out to you JD, I really did.  But I take back all those nice things I said.  I'm glad we're broken up.  You're boring as shit to be with.  I pretended so many times to like the stupid shows you like, to watch the stupid movies you like, to enjoy spending time with your asinine friends.  I've moved on.  I realize that you are not the right person for me in any way whatsoever.  You bring out the worst traits in me and I'm a million times better without you. I'm bringing by a bunch of your stuff to you mom's house.  So long JD, I'd like to say it was fun but it really wasn't.  Believe me when I say that I never want to hear from you again.  Em

Thursday June 14th

subject: OPEN FIRST!!! DO NOT READY ANY OTHER EMAILS!!!

If you love me, you will delete every email I've sent you over the past week without reading it. (ed:  When she went by my mom's house to drop off my stuff, she bumped into my mom... my mom told her I was in Europe until Saturday...) JD please I am begging you that when you get back you do not read any email but this one.  We've all made mistakes while you've been away.  I can explain it all to you, call me ASAP.  I love you with all my heart and soul! Em

(Ed: I read the emails... Em and I are no longer together. I learned two very important lessons from this whole ordeal.
1. Careful when you date passionate people, because passion swings both ways. Sometimes they'll love you, but other times they'll hate you.  And when they hate you...boy do they hate you.
2. When you go to Europe for 2 weeks, leave your fucking phone on.)

"Indeed, the Turks adopted Islam because it was the major religion in the region when they showed up. This allowed them to more easily expand their borders and gave them political strength and support from the Arabs.


The Turks allowed other religions to exist within the empire in peace provided that non-muslims did not bear arms or take roles in the administration of the Ottoman Empire; and as long as they paid taxes. 


The Nationalism/Religion motivated ill will toward the Turks is a recent phenomenon caused in part by foreign influence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. After all, it was European influence that got the various ethnic groups within the empire to revolt against their Sultan.

"Firstly, he is honestly giving his opinion, don't downmod.

1. There are fairly effective govt. run systems. Of course, it is tricky, and maybe the US political system isn't up to it.

2. He's being pedantic. Of course it isn't free, steal from the rich more, already.

3. Sweeping statement, and frankly unbacked. AFAICS the mess was caused by the free market. Maybe it could be set up to work better though, for instance limits on how the contracts are set up, rules on when to drop people. (In the Netherlands they *have* to take on people, and money comes from a state pot if they would cost the insurance company money.

4. Possibly true, but i don't think it is ethical to get the rich flexibility over the backs of those who are poor/got screwed by insurance companies. You can set it up so people with more money can get more treatment to some extent.

5. From what we see European countries, it is just not true. Furthermore it would save a lot of money in insurance companies, etcetera.

6. What is or isn't he for universal health care? And emergency care is for emergencies. You'd think those are things that just *emerge* rather then things that one can see coming for miles. Treatment that gets there earlier is almost always cheaper.

7. Same as 4.

8. Afraid so. However, i guess there are already things to keep people safer, like car safety. Also in Europe (don't know about US)bans on smoking in bars/cafes Frankly i'd rather pay a little more taxes then take away freedoms that happen to be more risky. It's not really that bad though, except on soft drugs. I live in the Netherlands, but still, they should just make production legal too.. 

9. If the jobs at insurance isn't doing anything useful anymore, they should be lost. Those jobs are on the paychecks of the people.

10. Doesn't really have to be so. Private practice could still exist.

11. Uhm, don't know, how that would work out in the US.

12. Also, see 8. It is a rather real concern. In the Netherlands for instance, there is also a high tax on smoking and alcohol. (Although the reason might be more to get tax then to stop it's use.) Imo, it is not that bad, though. Again, it is up to the political system(uhm, well, maybe it's more complicated then that) to keep the government in check. (And the US one seems a little shoddy at this point.)

13. This is pretty much happening in the Netherlands.(You can opt out though.) I really don't get why they don't just give the patients a memory stick or something.

14. and 15 *Could*, it hasn't happened in many countries. Anyway, when some treatment is scarce either waiting lists pop up, or the highest bidder, it's just that choice. And if you have a waiting list you don't need a market to increase capacity.

"The best cure for bad management, is more bad management. 

Corporate American, nor the private medical sector, nor those who blindly oppose any and all public options don't have time on their side. 

Either they look like leaders now or fools later and then people will say DAMN we could have saved 30 trillion dollars if we just did public care back when the Clinton pushed it or maybe 50 trillion back when Truman tried to push it. 

There is no where to run from publicly managed care, it's just too damn cheap and effective compared to the spider web of bullshit America calls health care. 

So, go ahead, fight your war but it's putting the GOP's reputation on the line when all the facts point to the reality that public care would save us trillions is just a stupid move.

They should cave and ask for non health care related favors from the Dems because at this rate they've pushed the Dems into a corner where even if a Dem senator wanted to oppose health care they are being forced to pass something, anything to prove they aren't a lame duck congress. 

The harder the GOP pushes the more pressure the Dems feel the pass the bill however since they are using slander instead of rational the GOP are effectively silencing themselves from having any lasting say in the issue. 

If they don't cut costs the program will collapse in a matter of years, so the idea that they won't cut costs is a misconception at best. Costs are whats driving people to want public care now and it's not hard to realize that if costs don't come then the issue of costs will come up again with a more aggressive approach.

The trick is just getting the public plan in place from that point it will devour the private insurance industry and in doing so it will unite people. All these people on the care will be GET YOUR GOVERNMENT HANDS OFF MY PUBLIC CARE OPTION because once they use it they'll never go back and that's Obama's plan imo. You can take whatever concessions you want but if there is a public plan option people are going to flock to it and if you mess with the public plan they are going to raise hell and that means either private companies take less profits or... private companies go out of business and new smarter ones model themselves after more cost effective care system like in Europe and Canada.

"&gt;I diagree entirely. Our position as a first world power happened simply by the existence of our huge economy. The Entente wasn't begging us to enter WWI based on our history of policing Europe, it was begging us because we were in a unique position compared to any other overseas power.

I disagree, the US acted in an extremely effective manner both prior to and post WWI and WWII and benefited from its positioning afterward in both cases (massively in the second instance).  Not that that is a bad thing, the US also managed to influence Europe's development and essentially allowed Europe to forge the best part of half a century of uneasy peace.

&gt;While true in some cases, isn't this an even better argument against the US being the world's policeman? But still, in many other cases, we do things that do not benefit us at all: Tsunami aid, peacekeeping in the Balkans, etc.

Tsunami aid may have been altruistic but it wasn't exactly a significant proportion on US foreign military and humanitarian aid.  Of course it is an example of the US not acting in its direct interests (although on a PR basis it obviously is...) but then its contribution was on a par with the EU, not something isolated and unique to the US.  

As to the Balkans, the US certainly had an interest in the region, although a limited one, which is reflected in the number of troops it deployed (significantly less than Germany and the UK for example).

However, it is rather clear that the US's actions in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas where conflicts have been 'less' official were not due to some international moral position, but because of US national interests or US ideology.
 
&gt;In most cases around the world, the overthrow of a dictator is a condition for US aid. 

No, usually US conditions are economic and relate to the opening of markets to competition. Rarely does the US impose directly political conditions on aid, although it is not unheard of, it will use aid as a carrot (counterbalanced by the stick of US military of UN security council action). The US is not alone in this regard, but the consequences can be rather nasty, especially in Africa.

&gt;Rare exceptions, like some occurring in Central Asia at the moment, are mandated by our ""role"" as world-police: we can't get to Afghanistan without going through somewhere. 

US alliances have often been with dictators (albeit right wind ones) where it has been necessary, as we are aware the US has on more than one occasion essentially deposed a democratic government to promote an undemocratic one more sympathetic to US aims.

&gt;Again, in most cases, US aid comes totally free of obligation. 

Most certainly does not.  That said, the most needed aid generally does, food and disaster relief is almost always free of conditions.  Even then we should look at things like tsunami relief to Burma and the issues that came up at the time (that said I think that it is obvious that it was Burma acting the fool, not the US/EU etc...).

That however does not make up even a significant portion of US aid.  (development aid and military aid eclipse it).

I will point out though that aid from the US people (a surprisingly large amount) is obviously free of any conditions.

&gt;This is just plainly false. Western Europe has very comparable prices and standards of living to the US, and did so even before the Euro began to provide competition for the dollar. 

Not quite. The cost of living in Europe is generally higher across the board.  One aspect of this is the  difference in fuel costs, which has an impact on all parts of the economy.  Take the UK for example, fuel  costs $6.25 a US gallon, something like 300% of the US cost, in Germany it is $5.60.  That drives prices up.   Now add the fact that there is better consumer and employee protection legislation (making production and so goods and services more expensive) and you should realise that your point is incorrect.  I can't find the statistics now, but I am fairly certain that when I looked last the US had the lowest cost of living of almost any industrialised western nation, including Canada and the UK etc.. except possibly Greece and Turkey.

&gt;The dollar being relied on as the world's reserve causes all sorts of problems, namely, it contributed to the current economic meltdown. See the Triffin dilemma

And it also provides massive benefits, namely that the US can simply print its way out of debt, something that no other country can do.  Moreover the US has for the last 40 years been able to essentially export inflation, any increase in the monetary base was split over multiple countries and not just its own citizens.

&gt;This is not what I am suggesting at all. However, I believe a crash is inevitable. You can't change the fundamentals by fiat, no matter how hard you try. It would have been better for us to suffer the damage in September, rather than try to gloss it over through inflation and pay for it for decades. 

It rather depends.  I would much rather slide down a 1000ft cliff than fall off the top, the former may cause me harm over a long period and cost about the same, but the latter could be fatal.

I agree that the US system is broken, I agree that it is inequitable and I would love to see the US lose its position as the most dominant power in the world (and it is happening) I would also love to see the dollar collapse (slowly) and the banks shrink.  What I don't want to see however is a desperate, nuclear armed America in meltdown, cut off from goods, services and money looking for a quick fix.

&gt;What I mean by ""America first"" is that we need to start looking out for our citizens, like every other nation, instead of trying to remake the globe. That task is impossible, and is bleeding our coffers and the veins of our soliders.

The US has and always will look after its own interests.  Those interests however may not always be the same as all of its citizens, usually it would generally be for some majority, or some powerful minority.  Even the bail outs and current collapse have benefited some of those, as did the various wars and dead soldiers.

What I really wouldn't do though is confuse self interest with some sort of altruism or international duty, the US acts in the former, not out of the latter.",t1_c0bw5b7,1,0,,1,False,t1_c0bw328,0,c0bw5b7,0,t5_2qh1s,ajehals,Economics,False,,t3_9997f,1426014252,1249943397,True,

Blah blah blah. I didn't say you need to bow down to anything. More distortion. BTW, the point of all those museums is to make sure this never happens again via proper education, not to make you ""bow"" to Jews.

Now, to make my position clear:

I cannot judge who has a legitimate claim or not in this particular conflict. My judgement is based on the fact that when a small country like Georgia is desperate enough to trigger a conflict with the Russian Empire, they must feel that their existence is threatened - nothing less would cause them to take such risks. When Russian sock puppets like Ossetia and Abhkazia act up, knowing fully that mother Russia has enough troops on their territory to defeat the entire conventional armies of Europe, they are not the victims - the are the aggressors. Those actions show no more courage that a little bully hitting another little boy while the bully's big brothers are immobilizing the victim.

They're used something like the US Special Forces are used. A highly trained, rapid deployment force. And they get ""dirty"" jobs sometimes, e.g. blowing up the Greenpeace ship in New Zealand back about 15 years ago. 

The legion itself has its own surrender jokes. A few divisions(?) joined the German army in WWII, and one surrendered to the Vietnamese when they were fighting over there. Since that time, they carry a ""China hat"" on their standard. Apparently, it's a joke to them, too. 

I found it interesting that the legion doesn't really promote patriotism among its troops, and apparently the feeling is mutual as far as the French population is concerned. A father might be fine with his daughter dating a regular soldier, but not so approving of her dating a legionaire. CW wasn't really all that interested in France, either. He never formally became a French citizen, although he lives in Europe now, and won't be coming back. It seems the legion is mostly interested in itself. They don't fight for France, they fight for the legion, as he puts it.

Which party is pro-gay? B/c I don't see one.  Which party is staunchly pro-choice? B/c i don't see one either.  Which party is AGAINST the drug war? Which party is against the criminalization of prostitution? 

Both parties gave up massive amounts of money in bailouts, both believe in corporate welfare.  Both parties pushed and supported the Patriot Act and supported the Iraq war initially.  The Democrats now act like they oppose it but don't bring an ounce of troops back home.  Both pander to lobbyists just the same.  Both are corrupted by this lobbying (see RIAA and MPAA's influence over Biden, or Phillip Morris' influence over the entire Democrat party).  

The Republicans may flat out deny global warming and ignore the need for any environmental changes, Democrats on the other hand push new regulation that either A) is harmful or B) is just feel good regulation and doesn't really accomplish shit.

Here we are as a nation debating social health care.  One party is batshit insane thinking ""Death Squads"" are going to kill all our fetuses and elderly, the other is pretending its going to give america this awesome european styled single payer healthcare, when they're serving up insurance industry written public option that is frankly; a clusterfuck.

One side (R) wants to censor our speech (porn, rap music, anything remotely non-religious) The other though isn't much better (over zealous political correctness, Clinton's going after video games).  And of course, you can't forget the 1-2 punch of Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore teaming up to censor music.

One side is filled to the brim with bigots (R).  While the ""alternative"" (D) believes in policy that reverse discriminates, instills attitudes of entitlement, and convinces minority demographics that they are not good enough to do for themselves and that the government must help them.

Last I checked Bush and Obama, along with their respective parties, are pro-FISA, they're pro-CIA, they're pro-DOHS, they're pro-Federal Reserve, they're pro-NAFTA, they're pro-WTO. They both don't believe a shred of copyright or patent reform is wholly necessary in anyway that might benefit the individual or the populace as a whole, only reform that benefits corporations. Both parties do absolutely nothing to combat corruption within the EPA or the FDA.

How about education?  One side (R) push ridiculous policy like No Child Left Behind.  Has that been undone by our Democrat congress or President? Nope.   In fact, there was a voucher system in Washington DC, that allowed parents to have the tax money for their child be attached to the child, rather than the school.. allowing the kids to use tax dollars to go to private schools if they wished thereby makign the public and the private school compete for the students, since the money was attached.. else; fear the poor public school closiing down.  Guess what? Grades, graduation rates all in increased, disciplinary action decreased. But b/c this was a threat to the teacher's unions, and because Democrats hate any solution that doesn't encourage government reliance, they're out to kill the program now that Obama is in office.  Both sides put ideologies before education, they put their lobby groups (like unions) before education.

Both Bush and Obama have had staged and stacked ""Town Hall"" meetings full of planted friends in the crowd waiting with canned questions to give the illusion that they're speaking to us and listening to our concerns.    Both administrations are pushing for a National ID card of one form or another.  Both believe wholly in warrantless wiretaps.  AT&amp;T's illegal spying has not stopped under Obama and does not look like it will.  It was Clinton who gave us DMCA, it was Clinton how gave us the marriage act identifying marriage between a man and a woman at a national level.  It was Clinton who deregulated the media.  

Look at the history of war in the last 20 years: Reagan ramped up nuclear armament and started countless skirmishes over the cold war, Reagan's actions in Nicaragua and Chilie are chilling, his actions of People's Park is appalling, he was also responsible for empowering the Taliban, Bush Sr empowered Norega and started a bullshit war over fabricated crap with Iraq, Clinton continued to bomb iraq and fucked up Somalia, only to have Jr come in and start Iraq up again, and for Obama to continue this madness.

"When is the last time you saw a health care ad? There is low or no competition currently. Exactly who has to advertise? What source states that advertising and other unnecessary overhead accounts for 30% of all health care costs in this country?

Further, is it not possible that even if our health care is more expensive due to necessities of advertising that it is still more beneficial than a socialistic system because it permits people to choose between multiple providers?

&gt;So chances are, once you're in a public system like that, you won't EVER need to pay an extra cent for any of the medical attention you might require.

I think you've missed the point. It isn't whether people will generally be covered or not (that is evident), but rather what happens to the people at the margins when the government will not cover them. The UK has a 5 million dollar limit for adding one additional year of life to a person's life. If your treatment will cost 5.001 million dollars to give you that additional year, you are screwed. Being that most people barely have enough money to afford one health insurance policy, most people won't be able to afford a private supplemental to the public insurance, thereby subjecting them to death if the bureaucrats in Washington decree that only X dollars may be spent to save a life, but a given person's health care will cost X+1 dollars.

&gt;TIP: Travel someday. Go to any European country (except the UK). Check how a regular public hospital works, and get informed about it. Then sit down and wonder why have all your previous governments been denying that to you all for your whole history. Then think about how ironic it is, that when you finally get a president that wants to help you and make things right for once, you actually reject him. I guess you have what you deserve... or they've really brainwashed you.

I've traveled England and Italy, but I appreciate your patriarchal, sarcastic tone.

Sometimes I do.  Recently I have my doubts.  

&gt;Do you feel that you were mislead about the reasons for the invasion? Do you believe the rest of the US was mislead?

I was boots on ground in Kuwait on Thanksgiving in 2002 - before the war was a war.  Back then I never thought my country would through action or ignorance propel us into war.  Looking back it's pretty hazy and the evidence looks thin.

Nope.  I'm generally pretty easy-going.

To me personally:  servers.  I swear, they're trying to hold a hard-disk jihad against me.
To the soldiers (I'm speaking out of my element):  anyone who is stirring shit and making it harder for us to hand over a semi-stable Iraq.

"Your figures don't convince me that my argument was unsound.  50 years may sound like a short time in the entire span of human history, but it makes little sense to look further back than the Industrial Revolution for ""corporations"" in the modern sense.  There were a handful, but they're statistically negligible.  Given only 200 years to work with, then, the fact that almost a fifth of the S&amp;P have been around for a quarter of that time and a few have been around for half is remarkable longevity.  Some of them manufacture products which are obsolete in a matter of months; they've survived literally hundreds of product cycles.

&gt; If free markets lead to monopolies and oligopolies, then we would have high prices, little competition, and virtually no economic progress. If this were true then Eastern Europe would be economic powerhouses and the U.S. would be a basket case. In short, reality doesn't agree with Marxist theories.

I never said I was a Marxist, though I find your implication that the US has a model economy pretty rich.  And blaming Eastern Europe's economic woes (if, indeed, that's not an overgeneralization) on the Soviet Union's communism is trite and misleading.  There's a lot more going on there than the application of any one economic philosophy.

You make a superficially fair point about my choice of industries, but upon inspection I don't think it works.  First of all, I didn't bring up health care; I was responding to nixonrichard, who identified it (probably not totally incorrectly) as the source of reddit's beef with the free market.  Second of all, I never said the insurance industry was a poster child for the free market.  I said it was a poster child for business; its business model illustrates exactly what is wrong with the idea that businesses will work for us if simply left alone.  Aside from government regulation, the insurance industry's business model provides them no quality incentives whatsoever.

I agree there's plenty of government intervention.  I don't think all of it is very effective, but we would be much worse off without it.

And I must confess, I can't stand the pretense that we should be ""objectively"" discussing economics instead of politicizing it.  Even if I had been free to choose my example, I would very likely have chosen health care **because** of how political an example it is - it is a case of market principles and economic decisions bearing on our lives in a clear and integral way, and I won't pretend that's irrelevant.

"&gt; It is, somewhat, a matter of semantics but an important one non-the-less.

A good point. For example, the sole party leading the USSR was the Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за which literally translates to ""Communist Party of the Soviet Union"". Yet they were an example of a centralized socialist state.

The USSR took on a decidedly different character post-Stalin. Which brings up the important point, something that seems to repeat time and time again in the history of these countries is a tendency to become single-party, dictatorships. Whether this is due to coincidence, or some prevailing weakness in the nature of the governing institutions is something I've not yet been able to determine.

At any rate, just because the DPRK says ""democratic"" and ""people's republic"" in their title does not make it so. Just because the CPSU says ""Communist"" in their title does not make it so. 

That being said, I believed Marx suffered from too strong an idealism, and lack of realization about the inherent selfishness of people. In order to create a ""stateless, classless socialist society"" of any particular longevity, it would require an overarching government of some type to maintain the boundaries of ""classlessness"" and ""socialism"" to work against the inherent grain of the selfish masses. This was lost also on the early thinkers and leaders when they appealed to the selfishness of the proletariat in overthrowing the bourgeois and the other ruling classes. People can be greedy about wanting fairness as well.

&gt; That is a complete paradox, and is utterly impossible - which is why we use the terms State Capitalism or Market Socialism

Neither of which describe the phenomena we see with China (and to a lesser extend Viet Nam) very well. I would say China *used* to be a State Capitalist country, but it is starting to move away from this and developing in a direction that is clearly not along the models of the Market Socialist countries we see in Europe either. They are effectively a single party dictatorship (but Maoist as opposed to the much more malign Stalinist model), 中國共產黨 translates as ""Middle Kingdom Common Property Party"" or ""China Communist Party"". Which is the singular option for elections. Yet, in parallel, they are growing and encouraging a vast market based economy. This is a fascinating contradiction that will be interesting to watch sort itself out.

"&gt; Further, is it not possible that even if our health care is more expensive due to necessities of advertising that it is still more beneficial than a socialistic system because it permits people to choose between multiple providers?

Dude, no matter how many providers you have... science is only one, and depending on what you have, you'll need treatment X or treatment Y. The only important thing is that you receive the most appropriate one, just that. If you don't agree with what the doctor has just told you (which is usually stupid), you can ask for a second opinion, etc., as many times as you want. And if another doctor thinks it would be better to get a different treatment, you can get it. And if you want a different doctor treating you, or a different room, or whatever, you just ask for it. You can go to any damn hospital in the whole country, and you have the right to be treated there because you have a Social Security card that says you're part of the system.

Basically, cost doesn't mean a sh*t here. Everything is already paid, so you just get the best thing available for you, as far as modern technology allows.

&gt; I think you've missed the point. It isn't whether people will generally be covered or not (that is evident), but rather what happens to the people at the margins when the government will not cover them.

It seems you aren't [very well informed](http://realhealthcare.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/all-the-information-thorough-explanations-and-detailed-faq-about-the-possible-next-us-health-care-system/), and you didn't read when I said *""except the UK""*, exactly for the reasons that you just mentioned. I'll explain (you can find more about this in the link I gave you):

In a public system **EVERYONE IS COVERED**. Since they're born. They don't have to pay anything. They may have a job (and thus be paying with part of their salary) or not (and thus not contributing anything to the system, currently). But **they're covered anyway**. Do you get it?

&gt; I've traveled England and Italy, but I appreciate your patriarchal, sarcastic tone. There is nothing like a pride filled European sneering down their nose at the world's lone superpower, questioning the intelligence of an entire nation, to reaffirm my suspicions that you're a total twat, and furthermore a terrible ambassador for your continent. Now fuck off.

I'm not an embassador of shit, I said Europe but I could've said ANY FIRST WORLD COUNTRY in the world. Europe is easier for you to find, but you choose.

And you could've done without the insults, especially towards a person that is just trying to help you and open your eyes, because it seems you don't have a remote idea of how wrong you are, and ironically you're defending a system which has been screwing you for your whole life. I find that unbelievable.

You don't need to convince me of anything. I already live in Spain, and am absolutely delighted with the health care system we have, which works wonders, for everyone, and even has benefits some years. I *know* it works. And btw, it's considered to be one of the best systems in the world. Not the best though, so it can be done even better, and I hope they keep improving it like they have been doing so far.

However, if I lived in a country where we had a different system from what the rest of the world is using (being the ONLY ones), and people happened to be **dying** because they have no money to pay for their medical attention, I would certainly TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE and check out what other countries are doing, because if it doesn't happen anywhere else, it's obvious that only WE are wrong.

Furthermore, if smaller countries manage to get it working, you, as the most powerful country in the planet, surely have all the means necessary to make it work as well. Especially considering that in a public system, the more people there is in the country, the more feasible it is (economically), as most of the people who contribute to it are injecting more money than what they'll ever actually use, and there's a higher % of working people than unemployed people. So the more people in the country, the more benefits it will obtain.

"If there were no progress in politics, we would still own slaves.  (The free market would *never* have cured that one.)  The Great Depression would have lingered at its lowest point right up until World War II.  (Despite the propaganda that ran a few months ago, the New Deal did *not* prolong or worsen the great depression, and no economist will tell you otherwise unless he has a political agenda.)  We wouldn't have had a highway system or train system that ran coast to coast, and if we did, it would have come much later in history.  (If the free market can take care of those needs so well, why don't we have a high-speed train system on par with Europe's right now?  There is absolutely no logical reason to not have one in this nation, yet nobody has proposed building one except the government.  The free market is far more hesitant tackle tasks that large, especially in this day and age.)  We never would have walked on the moon.  *The fucking moon!*  Who walked on it?  We did.  

&gt;Registering firearms is a very small jump from confiscating firearms. FEMA already did confiscations in New Orleans, against the 2nd Amendment.

When there is something in the constitution specifically protecting the right to own guns, it *is* a big leap from registration to confiscation.  Keeping track of guns makes sense to anybody trying to solve crimes in which guns are involved.  Gun control laws have been around for almost two centuries.  Occasionally it has to go to the Supreme Court, (not very often) but we haven't come anywhere close to having our guns taken away since Bliss v Commonwealth in the 1830s.  (The case where the individual rights interpretation of the second amendment was set.)

And yes, FEMA fucked up royally on every single level during Katrina, and they are an excellent example of the worst case scenario of government involvement, that I grant you.  However, you have to look at how rare it is for situations to ever get that bad.  If our government were as bad as many Libertarians believe, there would be Katrina level failures every month.  Levies would always fail, because the government contractors didn't design or build them right.  

In general, though, it's not government that screws things up, it's *any* sufficiently large entity.  Corporations are, if anything, worse, and if you believe we should look at the worst case scenario of a situation, then we should look at the worst result of what will happen if the government steps aside.  Unfortunately, the world has become far too complex and interconnected for a large country to be run effectively without large entities getting involved.  If government steps aside, something will have to fill in the gap, and it will be comprised of a large collection of people.  As such, it will have all the same flaws as government.  The difference is, we won't be able to vote them out.

I guess I got a bit sidetracked off of guns, and onto the underlying philosophy of Libertarianism there.  Anyway, I think it is important to be aware of what the worst case is, and to prepare for it, but always *assuming* the worst *will* happen leads to paranoia and social backsliding.

"Here's my conjectured explanation (discussion welcome).

I make five points of background, give my explanation, and discuss the future.

First, Drama.

There is

James N. Frey, *How to Write a Damn Good Novel*, ISBN 0-312-01044-3, St.  Martin's Press, New York, 1987.

Don't bother to read it because it's not very good and it's main message is simple and likely available many other places and, as you might conclude, implicit in most of what you studied in English literature in high school and college.  From such background can note:

* The ancient Greeks made a cute discovery:  People **really** like *drama*, that is, what is now commonly called *formula fiction*.  People like this material so well it was seen, say, through at least year 1900 as a sure-fire way to get and hold the attention of an audience.  Elements of *formula fiction* and such *drama* include a person, that is, a *protagonist*, the audience can *identify* with, an introduction to the protagonist to make the audience identify with them, a big problem faced by the protagonist, a big struggle by the protagonist to solve the problem, in the end, success for the protagonist and, in particular, he gets the girl, reinforces truth and justice, etc.  So, grab the audience by the heart, the gut, and below the belt and don't let go until the success at the end.  Or, give the audience a vicarious, escapist, fantasy, emotional experience.  For the *problem*, have examples of what people are commonly afraid of -- sin, corruption, duplicity, manipulation, theft, evil, scandal, violation of *the great natural order*, etc.  That is, trigger false alarms in the danger detectors of the audience.

* The English *morality* plays of about 1000 years ago were a second act of Greek drama.  So, find some ignorant, superstitious, fearful people and grab them by the heart and the gut with the threat of *sin*, e.g., from below the belt.

* A related approach is that a *drama* has *transgression*, *retribution*, and *redemption*, and might conclude that *Star Wars* is an example.

* Nearly all Hollywood movies and made for TV *drama* fit well as such *drama* and *formula fiction*.

Second, the Industrial Revolution.

Next we observe that starting with the industrial revolution and progress in physical science, medical science, and engineering, say, by 1850 or so, by 1900 the world had some grand new standards of what, borrowing from medicine, we might call *information safety and efficacy*.  This was radically new stuff very different from formula fiction.

Third, Humanities Education.

US high school and college education still places a lot of emphasis on the *humanities*.  E.g., it is common to require four years of English literature in high school and two more years in college but require only two years of math and no physics or chemistry.  Commonly more history is required than science or math.  So, in high school and college, commonly the *humanities* are still emphasized as if before, say, 1900 or 1850.

Now a lot of people in college major in the humanities, and there they get a big dose of the information safety and efficacy of old fiction before 1850.  E.g., European history concentrated on kings and treaties and ignored the influences of economics, technology, and geography that might have explained some *causes*.  E.g., that a country might be awash in good farm land, grains, domestic animals, and forests, be good at finding gold in mountain streams, knew how to work with iron, had good access to the open oceans seemed to be irrelevant.

Fourth, the Mainstream Media.

So, when the media hires people, who gets hired?  Right:  Overwhelmingly humanities majors.  More generally, the media, nearly everyone there, is solidly locked into the norms, values, and techniques of the humanities and fiction before 1850 and with next to no influence from the rise of science, etc. by 1900.  Heck, those people report temperature changes without indicating F or C, report percentage changes without being clear about the two quantities being compared or if the percentage is at an annual rate or not, will nearly never give references or complete quotes and have no respect for primary sources, deliberately write headlines that distort to get attention, regard graphs as just exercises in graphic arts and can't graph data in ways that would get a passing grade in a freshman physics lab report, etc.  That is, for solid information needed by citizens, they are incompetent.

As bad as the media was, now it's worse:  Apparently to have more shock value to get more attention, they have gone for partisanship and given up on objectivity.

Fifth, Citizenship.

Now, as we can see on the Internet, many US citizens very much want to to be well informed about government, politics, the economy, the *news*, etc.  Here the citizens are not commonly devoted to the academic humanities culture and value solid information with the standard of safety and efficacy illustrated from 1900 to the present.

E.g., when there is a possible epidemic, we want to hear about epidemiology and vaccination, that is, the risks and what we can **DO**, based on solid medical science, that will lower the risks and not hear just formula fiction about the threat and get not even dip squat about what to **DO** about the threat.  So, the media norm is to be helpless:  Cry but do nothing productive.  Net, the *humanities* and the media are good at *communicating* pains but useless at doing anything productive about the pains and, thus, are a terrible disservice to humans and humanity.  Contemptible bummer.

In short, we want to be **INFORMED** and not have our danger detectors stimulated with false alarms or be misinformed, grabbed by the heart, the gut, or below the belt, or treated like ignorant, superstitious, fearful people watching a *morality* play 1000 years ago.

Explanation.

Mainstream media, from executives, producers, directors, writers, reporters, etc. are still solidly stuck in the mainstream of English literature, drama, and formula fiction as it was well before 1850 and with next to no influence of any progress in science, etc. since 1900.

So, anything -- intended to be news or entertainment -- that passes through their keyboards, microphones, or cameras has to be just what those people understand and value, that is, more cases of drama and formula fiction with next to nothing in actual solid information as needed by informed citizens.

About the best that can be said is, once in some situation, e.g., the economic crisis of 2008, the attack of 9/11/2001, there is a lot of suffering, then the media will report the suffering with all its passion, pathos, poignancy, etc. while before the crisis having done nothing at all, zip, zilch, zero, not even dip squat, to inform us as good citizens in advance in ways that would let us avoid the problem.  Useless drama?  Always.  Useful information?  Never.

So, now, as in this thread, there is a big conflict:  We tell the *newsies* to go stuff it.

Being angry at the *newsies* for their irrational nonsense disconnected from reality goes back at least to some movies, e.g., one of the Andy Hardy series, of the 1930s.  *Citizen Kane* was another view.  Movie audiences understood right away.

Likely the way the media continued with their nonsense is McLuhan's ""The medium is the message"" meaning that each of the major media companies had close to a monopoly so could charge high ad rates, pump out cheap, sensationalistic nonsense, and still make a lot of money.

How bad is it?  Quite broadly, there is nearly no other major part of Western civilization -- not law, medicine, finance, engineering, manufacturing, computing, accounting, building construction, restaurant operation, agriculture, the military, auto repair, plumbing, even lawn mowing -- where so much emotional entertainment and so little contact with rational reality as in the media is tolerated.  No one would want to cross a bridge, board an airplane, take a medicine, live in a house, drive a car, or fire a gun designed with the techniques of the media.  The media is far outside the mainstream of civilization.  In particular, just now, with health care supposedly 1/6th of the US economy, to be well informed as citizens we need solid information on proposals to *reform* our health care system.  If we do a reform based mostly on just outrageous nonsense we get from the media, then we will deserve the passion, pathos, and poignancy of terrible suffering we will get.

The Future.

The Internet is pulling both ad revenue and eyeballs from old media.  On the Internet, people can hope to get information of wide variety -- in topics, depth, point of view, etc.  Such content is said to populate *the long tail* (of the distribution of popularity).

Will old media adapt?  Likely and apparently not.  This far into the 21st century, they would have to move from before 1850 forward at least 100 years, quickly.  They'd have to return to college and major in math, physical science, medical science, engineering and then get jobs in organizations of with other people who also moved well past 1850.

Generally old business organizations with an old *business model* facing change just stay with their old business model and go down slowly and die and never really change.

"Just for the record, I'm not the one downvoting, because even though I don't agree with all of what you are saying, I respect your opinion and think that it is perhaps the best course of action for your country. Just out of curiosity, what country do you hail from? 

I agree though that many of the people that would rise up against the government are not as well informed as they could be. I will say that they are most likely more well informed than those who bitch and moan and actually do nothing. It's hard not to really read about what goes on this country and not be fighting mad. Furthermore, those you call Paultards have usually voted for those carbon copy politicians because they have had no one else to vote for and picked the lesser of the two evils, which is still evil. I agree too that misinformation in this country is rampant and intentional and for the most part effective. I believe that goes back to the previous point and validates Henry Ford's claim that, ""If the people truly understood the banking system (or any of gov for that matter), there would be a revolution by morning.""

As for the statements I respectfully disagree with, I would not be ashamed of anyone fighting for liberty and freedom. At 22, I have seen a drastic reduction in my own liberties in just my lifetime, and can truly say they sicken me. I could not imagine losing many more and despise paying taxes for some of the stupid bullshit they pay for. (Disclaimer: I know taxes are necessary and can be used for good, but I work for a government contractor that uses union labor and I see shit every day that makes my blood boil) I consider myself well above average with respect to my level of education and understanding of our national affairs and to be frank, I am just about sick. Most people are completely clueless, apathetic or complacent, but I can imagine how some people are even more angry about it than I am, whether they are more or less informed. They would bring guns to the fight because for one of many reasons, but I would not think less of them for doing it. As far as educating our fellow countrymen, that is a lesson in pure futility. I can not even have an intelligent conversation with some of the smartest people I know without them invoking either emotion or incorrect information they swear is true. The MSM and anti-intellectual forces in this nation have completely broken the back of intelligent and informed discourse and the best hope we truly have of fixing it is violent revolution to end this abuse. At this point, we can not only not educate, but even trying to is sacrilege. Also, if a revolution were to occur, I do not believe a lot of the military would resist it if it were truly a popular revolution. The biggest discredit to revolutionary movements right now are that the people behind them have some horrible character flaw (racism, ultra religious nationalism, etc, etc). If, to steal a word from the GOP, Joe Six Pack, put down the beer and picked up the rifle, I don't think his neighbor down the street in the national guard would shoot him.

Finally, I'm not sure why you think our ancestors had to fight the British, they could have locked their guns away and educated their fellow countrymen who couldn't even read, but who would have listened or cared? See a parallel? Perhaps the people who lead the movements today do come off as a bit off, but that is only because the powers that be have branded them as such. You don't think the British Crown didn't try to brand Jefferson and company as crazy extremists? 

I think the man you call an idiot did educate people. How many people do you think knew they could openly carry a weapon legally? How many people do you think saw his flag and wondered what the hell it meant and went home, checked google, and saw that Thomas Jefferson suggested the Tree of Liberty be occasionally watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants? 

I understand where you are coming from in hoping that my countrymen will all go home, read some history books and suddenly become educated and throw the crooked ass politicians out of office peacefully, but I'm going to put more of my money on the dinosaurs coming back and just be thankful that there are enough armed idiots out there to make the government think twice about becoming completely tyranical overnight. I respect your opinion and understand that it works well in well educated countries, though I think Europe is more corrupt than the US. You just have to do the best you can with what you have and realize there are different solutions for different places.

"Great, let's talk about this seriously.

Here are your basic facts:

1. The US spends more on healthcare than European countries.
2. The US scores lower than European countries on certain health criteria, such as infant mortality and life expectancy.

You have concluded that European systems would counteract both points.

Regarding Fact #1, I presume you don't actually believe people will consume *less* healthcare if you make it free at the point of delivery, as that would fly in the face of common sense and all economic theory.  So where would money be saved?  There are several possibilities:

1. Insurance company profits.  However, these are only around 5%.
2. Executive compensation.  This is a tiny drop in the bucket compared to actual expenses.
3. Doctor salaries.  Regulating these may indeed save money, but I would say it's better to get more doctors and introduce more competition than regulate salaries.
4. Drug costs.  Regulating these may also save money, but at the risk of reducing innovation.  However, it's difficult to know what to do here when other countries are free riding on us.

Regarding Fact #2, it's also quite possible that our populations are different.  The US has a higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, which hurts our infant mortality statistics.  The US has a higher rate of obesity, which affects life expectancy.  (Not to mention a higher homicide rate.)  How is single-payer healthcare going to fix these?

For an example of a healthcare system that is *not* free at the point of delivery, look at Singapore's system.  The government spends about 1.3% of GDP and combined public and private spending totals 4.3%, far less then either the US or Europe.  Yet Singapore has better life expectancy and infant mortality rates than the US.  If simple health stats and price tags are enough, why shouldn't we adopt *their* system?  I think it's a lot more complicated than that.

I'd love to see some real discussion instead of the usual cut and paste talking points.

He thought his girlfriend knew, but sometimes there are communication issues.  The point of this story isn't the communication issue or how it happened, really, it's her reaction.

&gt; Then you would think his mother told her what happened? Hmm? Are ou just trying to show me how sutpid you are now?

From the transcript you're evidently having trouble reading:

&gt; [She left messages at my mom's demanding I call her back. My mom would've called her to tell her I was in Europe except she didn't leave her number and my mom doesn't have it.]

&gt; [When she went by my mom's house to drop off my stuff, she bumped in to my mom... my mom told her I was in Europe until Saturday...]

...

&gt; Why didn't you read it and come to a sane conclusion? Is it because you're an absoloute fucking idiot?

This story might be true.  This story might be false.  The circumstances surrounding it are far from impossible, though, so the story as a whole is plausible.  There's no way you or I can verify this or any single aspect of the story so to go on a rant about how we're idiot's just because you don't think it's logical so therefore it's all wrong is, frankly, idiotic.

"The public option is simply a better option.
Correlation does not equal causation, but when you have the same correlation and there is only on consistent variable in a large number of situations, then you have a likely case for causation. If every single country in the world that has public health care has lower costs than the us, then the odds that all of those countries doing some other thing that reduces cost exactly the same way are pretty low.
Also, preventative care has long been proven to reduce costs, and it is a more attainable option with a public health care system.
Finally, in Canada (and Europe, and many other places around the world) there is less incentive for excessive tests, just in case treatments, etc. I think the one real difference other than a public system is that almost every country is less litigious than the US.

"Mostly when you're 20 you should realize that you're not going to be 20 forever. Pretend that you're going to die at age 30 and that the next 10 years will be when you complete your great adventures.

To this end, I suggest keeping one thing in mind: **Stay poor as long as possible**. You can do this when you're young. When you have a partner and/or kids, it will be much harder.

Things to do when you're poor include (in no particular order of preference):

* **Study to get an elite advanced education** - those people you see in the nice part of town generally are doctors, lawyers, PhDs, etc.. If you want to earn $300-400K/year reliably and retire by age 40, get an elite education from the best school you can find.

* **Start a startup company** - sign up for **Ycombinator** and build *anything* that you fancy. Who cares if it completely fails? You'll have one of the best times available in life, and even if your startup totally fails, you'll learn how making something of value is so important.

* **Travel to Europe/Asia/Australia/Canada/etc** - grab a backpack, borrow money, and hit the road. Do this for at least a year. Fuck a beautiful girl in a field in the Alps. Spend two weeks by yourself in a beach hut in Thailand. Then go back to the Alps and fuck that girl again. Travel gives you perspective and gets you out of your child hood patterns, helping you to grow.

* **Have lots of partners**. Get married if you want. Who cares if it doesn't work out. You have 10 years to completely fuck it up many times.

This will help my career and build my ability to get from start to finish on a project. I've already seen much improvement here, so it's just a matter of further growth.

2. Get over my awkwardness when addressing sex. I've already gotten over my inability to have a conversation, that was easy. I've also figured out a great way to be one of the highest value people in the room (town, actually). This last step is the final cornerstone I need to be where I want to be, socially.

3. Visit Cuba, Japan, Europe. This year I did a massive coast-to-coast road trip, visiting dozens of cities and meeting lots of new people, and also having lots of new experiences. I want that to continue. Along the way, either buy or develop an on the fly translation system so I can get around without relying on professional translators. Should be easier than it sounds if I use off the shelf components.

4. Come up with as many quirky random things to try as possible. I've got to keep my mind open and my life fun!

5. Be a VIP at a night club, at least once. Cut ahead of everyone in line. I know a DJ, so I might be able to get this one with his help.

I will point out that religious differences were at the center of African slavery, with Muslims converting African kings (who were animists) and then enriching them in the slave trade. About 10,000,000 Africans were sent via Zanzibar and sold to Muslim countries from 900 to 1600.

The claim was that non-Muslims were lower order beings simply because they were non-Muslim. This wacky thinking was also used by Muslims who enslaved over 1,000,000 Europeans in North Africa, and was a ""selling point"" in the Atlantic Slave trade, where Catholics in South America imported about 9,000,000 animist Africans.

No.  This is not about your performance.  It is about sharing burdens.  

&gt; How much are health care organizations allowed to take out if I need an x-ray? How about if my wife gives birth? How about a preventative annual exam?

Ideally, they will demand the doctor to document his costs, and reimburse him for that.  Less ideally, they will determine how much a doctor can charge for a given treatment, and if he does not like it, he is out of the pool of admissible doctors for this public insurance.  Between those extremes, it is how it works in EU, which, just as an example, has about 38% of the billed cost per birth compared to the US.  

(As a sidenote, I have a strong suspicion that in the US, clinics overcharge insured patients in order to be capable of channeling some treatment to the uninsured.)  

&gt; The system may need desperate help and a major overhaul, but no -it is not simple, it is not 25 words, and if you get one of these (or dozens of other) foundation concepts wrong the first time around changing it will be close to impossible.

How did the Islamic jihad affect the balance of power in the Mediterranean and the middle east? A couple centuries later, what religious motives led to the Crusades? How did the returning Crusaders' importation of Greek philosophy via Arabic translation affect Roman Catholic thought? How did that lead to the Renaissance, and to the Enlightenment? Cut the religious foundations out from under those events and the last thousand years of western history becomes arbitrary and disconnected.

In a nutshell:

- Remove the legal obstacles that slow the creation of high-deductible health insurance plans and HSAs
- Equalize the tax laws so that that employer-provided health insurance and individually owned health insurance have the same tax benefits
- Repeal all state laws which prevent insurance companies from competing across state lines
- Repeal government mandates regarding what insurance companies must cover
- Enact tort reform
- Make costs transparent so that consumers understand what health-care treatments cost
- Enact Medicare reform
- Allow a tax-deductible donation to help the millions of people who have no insurance and aren’t covered by Medicare, Medicaid or SCHIP.

The American people, on the whole, are never going to feel comfortable with a European-style system.

Then you look at Americans at these rallies stirred up by false information that has no basis when most probably don't know anyone who has been in a universal healthcare system nor have they ever had an experience outside the country to know what public healthcare or real socialism looks like. People in Spain ask me this question all the time, ""In the US you don't have any social security, do you?"" And I used to explain that it's something that's available when you reach 65 years old. ""No,"" they'd say, ""that's a pension."" The American definition of social security doesn't meet their standards.

One more thing to add is that I have never seen a system more protective of its citizens and taxpayers than European socialism.

"Have you read his so-called racist remarks? He seems to have simply made the mistake of talking about the fact that culturally, those of northern european decent (IE assholes with blonde hair and blue eyes) had what he considered to be a more accurate/healthy view of morality than those of southern European and middle eastern decent (IE assholes with brown hair, brown eyes). The only problem with these statements is the fact he mentioned physical characteristics. But lets remember that the man was aphoristic, and he used those characteristics as a metaphor for purity/dirtiness. A really bad move, but not an inherently racist one until his sister pimped out his writings to Hitler in a move to get acclaim. Nietzsche was dead long before this ever happened, and there's a great argument for Nietzsche hating the Nazis as much, or more than he disliked the preistly (Nietzsche disliked both Jews and Christians).

Additionally, the racist claim makes no sense considering his policy of essentially fellating ancient Greece any time he could. Cause guess what? Greece didn't have many Aryans in it, but it did have a whole hell of a lot of people who agreed with Nietzsche's moral system.

As for Nietzsche's anti-semitism, I think you can see where I'm going with this. Nietzsche found in the Jewish community during his time a world view he was staunchly opposed to. If not for his penchant for metaphor, and poor metaphors at that, this was no more racist than atheist redditors saying that Christians are stupid. Is it offensive? Ya, probably, but it's not racist in any meaningful way.

Nietzsche, as I said before, was an ass, but he was not a categorically racist ass unless sociologists are also racists. Were some of his appraisals inaccurate, over simplified and offensive? Fuck yes they were. But were they actually prejudiced in a meaningful way? I don't think so.

Perhaps we should take a moment and actually read what Nietzsche said. Don't worry, I've got time. I'll wait.

- Funny but in many places it became illegal with the separation of the state and church. During the *anti-religious* French Revolution (September Massacres 1792) the prostitutes were slaughtered by the mobs. Police patrols circulated day and night to prevent soliciting or even smiling at the opposite sex.

- The czarist regime regularized the prostitution but the *atheist* Bolsheviks banned it and called it ""exploitation"". The brothels were closed and the prostitutes were sent in concentration camps. In all the Socialist countries prostitution was a crime.

- In the Bible-thumping USA prostitution used to be legal and in many places regulated, now under a much more secular regime is illegal. 

The current laws against the prostitution were introduced by the secular Govts in their power trips. The main reason or given motive was to prevent the spreading of the venereal diseases and has nothing to do with religion.

"&gt; If they die in the street all the better: that's money saved for the insurance company.

I'm sorry, but you're the one living amidst the smoke and mirrors of your own self-righteousness.

One of the main drivers for President Obama's health care reform push is, as he's admitted, that we spend *too much money* on health care. Almost a sixth of our GDP. Most of that is money coming *out* of the private insurance companies' pockets, since they're still a bigger spender than the government. In fact, Medicare spending is going to bankrupt the Treasury precisely because for political reasons its coverage has to keep up with what private insurers are willing to pay for. If seniors weren't used to $10 copays for the latest billion dollar arthritis drug from their private plans, the government wouldn't had to have given it to them, but here we are with Medicare Part D. Ditto for expensive cancer screenings and treatments, which, by the way, give you a [significantly higher chance of survival](http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/08/5-yr-cancer-survival-rates-us-dominates.html) when you're diagnosed in the U.S. instead of Europe.

&gt;The Anglosphere, for anyone who still doesn’t know, is a modern name for the community of free, democratic, English-speaking nations. Where the EU is based on state-to-state accords, the Anglosphere is chiefly formed of organic links between businesses, independent institutions and citizens. The characteristics of the Anglosphere are parliamentary government, free elections, an independent judiciary, a limited state and the common law.

[Anglosphere](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/3676521/The_borders_of_the_Anglosphere/)

In the Nineteenth Century a fringe movement appeared which attempted to interpret the Anglosphere in the racist way you describe but the Anglosphere itself was and remains rooted in traditions which make any racist doctrine impossible.

The Anglosphere naturally supports Individualism and Exceptionalism along with Parliamentary Government, Free Elections, an Independent Judiciary, a Limited State and the Common Law.

The Anglosphere is what Canada [outside Quebec] was before Trudeau came along and screwed it up.

This law simply states that if large-scale smuggling operations are detected at the border (not Iron Man 2 on your iPod), the signatees will coordinate with each other to prosecute the offenders.

Killing the income tax would immediately recapitalize the market.  Defaulting on the public debt would force Iceland to live within it's means by discouraging people to lend to the government.   Going gold based would immediately stabilize and put faith in the currency.  And clearing out the private debts would immediately allow the market to find a bottom, so that the reset button can be pressed and they could move forward from there.

""A series of analyses was performed to address whether modern Jewish Y-chromosome diversity derives mainly from a common Middle Eastern source population or from admixture with neighboring non-Jewish populations during and after the Diaspora. Despite their long-term residence in different countries and isolation from one another, most Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level. Admixture estimates suggested low levels of European Y-chromosome gene flow into Ashkenazi and Roman Jewish communities. A multidimensional scaling plot placed six of the seven Jewish populations in a relatively tight cluster that was interspersed with Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations, including Palestinians and Syrians. Pairwise differentiation tests further indicated that these Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations were not statistically different. The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population.""

"&gt;British Mandate Palestine and the arbitrary way the British created the states in the area (similar to the disaster that is partition in India and Pakistan).

The British did not force anyone to move from Europe.  In fact, they worked against immigration.  Early Israelis went so far as to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent British people to get them out of the country and make way for their take over.  

&gt;The fact that a large amount of the land in the area had be legally acquired by Jewish organizations in the lead up to the creation of the state.

Let's try that shoe on some other feet.  There was a group a while back called the Montana Freemen who threw around the idea of declaring independence from the USA.  They owned their land just as much as some Israelis owned some land (about 10% of the acreage, not really significant).  But the reality is the Freemen's claim was a joke and everyone got a kick out of it.  Israeli Arabs own a similar percentage of modern Israel, but you wouldn't see in them a right to govern any part of Israel or to turn any significant part of Israel into an independent state.  

&gt;which ignores a million issues.

Two is not quite a million.  The issues you raised really show how Israel is responsible for the whole mess.

According to our working model, the **more-recent** migrations were mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, as is seen in the Arab-specific Eu 10 chromosomes that include the modal haplotypes observed in Palestinians and Bedouin. These haplotypes and their one-step microsatellite neighbors constitute a substantial portion of the total Palestinian (29%) and Bedouin (37.5%) Y chromosome pools and were not found in any of the non-Arab populations in the present study.

Although Canada has a population smaller than California, 830,000 Canadians are currently waiting to be admitted to a hospital or to get treatment, according to a report last month in Investor's Business Daily. In England, the waiting list is 1.8 million.

----------Many Americans have to wait as well, how is this any different? Have you ever BEEN to an ER at 3 or 4 AM on a weekend? Everyone has to wait sometimes. That doesnt mean one system is better than the other, or their system is fucked up, because Americans have to wait as well.

At Whole Foods we allow our team members to vote on what benefits they most want the company to fund. Our Canadian and British employees express their benefit preferences very clearly—they want supplemental health-care dollars that they can control and spend themselves without permission from their governments. Why would they want such additional health-care benefit dollars if they already have an ""intrinsic right to health care""? The answer is clear—no such right truly exists in either Canada or the U.K.—or in any other country.

------Where are you getting this from? If they are UK or Canadian they probably dont care about your health benefits because they already get health benefits- from their governments. If we had a universal plan, then hell yeah, I'd opt to control and spend the healthcare dollars from my employment the way I see fit as well, since I wouldn't be in such dire need of it because I don't have or cant afford health insurance. What are you talking about man?!

Rather than increase government spending and control, we need to address the root causes of poor health. This begins with the realization that every American adult is responsible for his or her own health. 

------TRUE, BUT as a responsible adult we cannot just simply wish ourselves healthy, sometimes things happen and we need medical care. Accidents happen that are unavoidable. Diseases can be struck without rhyme or reason, and as a responsible adult we can't simply perform surgery on ourselves, or go into a local clinic and get chemotherapy for ourselves, we need a system to effectively provide these things to us, all of us, at little cost.

Unfortunately many of our health-care problems are self-inflicted: two-thirds of Americans are now overweight and one-third are obese. Most of the diseases that kill us and account for about 70% of all health-care spending—heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and obesity—are mostly preventable through proper diet, exercise, not smoking, minimal alcohol consumption and other healthy lifestyle choices.

Recent scientific and medical evidence shows that a diet consisting of foods that are plant-based, nutrient dense and low-fat will help prevent and often reverse most degenerative diseases that kill us and are expensive to treat. We should be able to live largely disease-free lives until we are well into our 90s and even past 100 years of age.

------I agree with you on this Mr. Mackey, but lets tak a look at our society; fattening processed foods are much cheaper and more available than foods that are good for us. This is both a societal problem and an individual problem, but this is not a reason to deny people healthcare. Europeans smoke and drink way more than Americans, but you don't see them denying healthcare to their citizens because of it. That's just discriminatory; because you are fat or because you smoke, we shouldn't give you health insurance?? Maybe if people had health insurance they'd be more willing to take measures to protect their health; hell, I am trying to quit smoking myself, and it is hard! I am having toruble doing it alone, so what am I going to do? See a doctor and see if one of the medications available to help quit will be able to help me. But with these sort of things unavailable to many, and very expensive also, its not an option for alot of people. If it were, Im pretty sure they'd use the services. Not only that, but in other countries it has been shown in studies that people live longer and are healthier because they have access to healthcare in the first place- instead of letting an illness worsen or spread, people go get it treated before it becomes a major health problem. This is why our system lacks, it does not benefit enough people for them to get preventative care, they have to wait until they are gravely ill before anyone will help them, and that is not right. 

Health-care reform is very important. Whatever reforms are enacted it is essential that they be financially responsible, and that we have the freedom to choose doctors and the health-care services that best suit our own unique set of lifestyle choices. We are all responsible for our own lives and our own health. We should take that responsibility very seriously and use our freedom to make wise lifestyle choices that will protect our health. Doing so will enrich our lives and will help create a vibrant and sustainable American society. 

-------""Unique set of lifestyle choices""? We are all human and we all have the same healthcare needs- if you are sick you want treatment. If you and I both have cancer, we may need different types of treatment but that doesn't matter we both need to be treated for it bottom line. If you have more money does that make you more entitled to recieving treatment than me? Under the current system, yes it does, but that does not make it the best plan for the majority of people. Mr. Mackey, I don't understand people like you, who think like you; universal healthcare would benefit you and I both equally, so why are you so against it? I tend to think it's simply because people like me NEED this more than people like YOU, because you have more money than I do. This is a complete failure of society, and I look down upon you sir for your bastardly stance on such a dire issue for your fellow Americans. Fuck you Mr. Mackey. Just, fuck you.

"See thats the thing most people dont see. This isnt going nearly far enough to be considered a Canadian or European or god.. a socialist solution. No this is patently an American solution, Obama is having such a hard time trying to get reforms in that simply provides insurance to those not profitable to big healthcare insurance. It is supposed to be a balance too, competition, but there is a chance it could end up just being a bailout for the unprofitable, toxic-assets of insurance companies. Of course that doesnt make much sense, what I mean is that, those people turned away by insurance companies I feel are their responsibility, they shouldnt be able to only insure super healthy people, of course they are making a rediculous sum of money.  If I were Obama I would pass legislation that forces regulation down the throat of insurers, making it clear that their job is to insure everybody at a reasonable price, with a clear business practice and with a modest but reasonable profit margin. 

 It isnt fair to make a business insure those who cant pay or dont pay, that is when government welfare would foot the bill, people shouldnt be uninsured because they cant find work or hell, even if they are lazy they dont deserve to die, so thats where the government should step in.  The public option really is the solution that is the least invasive to the private insurers, because it only picks up the scraps they dont want and it leaves them operating the same way they always have.  I think the options should be put government regulation that makes the private insurers act in the best interest of people while still running competitively or completely switching to a public healthcare system and bypassing insurance (since your health isnt really something you should ever be uninsured on, and you really should never not be covered when health issues are so random and devastating.).

"Did they compare the cost of a land lines between Europe and North America. One thing people are not aware of is how lousy and expensive land lines were (and perhaps still are) in Europe. Compared to most of the world, US and Canada have always had superior land lines. Even when things were regulated, we had VERY cheap land line phones compared with Europe. In Europe, you were charged by the minute, even for local calls. The quality of the lines were crap and more than once I picked up a phone and there was no dial tone.

I pay about $25 a month for my land line phone and you can get a cheap long distance plan for a couple of extra bucks. AND IT ALWAYS WORKS!

The fact that we had this better and cheaper infrastructure has affected cell phone use. I didn't get a phone for years because I was either at home or at work or had a very short commute in between. I could always call in from somewhere to get my messages. I pretty much only use my cell phone when I'm stuck on the commute home or for short conversations. I guess that makes me old fashioned.

In Europe it was very easy to install the infrastructure to cover a large population. As many people have pointed out, many European countries are smaller than some US states or Canadian provinces. It doesn't take long when you 'get off the main' road and you won't get a signal, especially in the prairies or when you are somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. There are a few places in North America where they have packed people in like Europe, but there is a lot of area that needs to be serviced by a smaller population. And that's got to cost something.

So just what are you paying for? If you need a basic phone, you can get a cheap pay as you go plan that's $20/month. If you need the super spiffy shiny gee-gaw that does everything but get you a drink, you are going to pay. I saw people line up and pay hundreds of dollars for an iPhone. Now they want to complain about the operating costs. Give me a break. It's like buying a high end sports car and then bitching about the gas mileage.

**Paying Patients Test British Health Care System**

By SARAH LYALL
Published: February 21, 2008

LONDON — Created 60 years ago as a cornerstone of the British welfare state, the National Health Service is devoted to the principle of free medical care for everyone. But recently it has been wrestling with a problem its founders never anticipated: how to handle patients with complex illnesses who want to pay for parts of their treatment while receiving the rest free from the health service. 

Although the government is reluctant to discuss the issue, hopscotching back and forth between private and public care has long been standard here for those who can afford it. But a few recent cases have exposed fundamental contradictions between policy and practice in the system, and tested its founding philosophy to its very limits.

One such case was Debbie Hirst’s. Her breast cancer had metastasized, and the health service would not provide her with Avastin, a drug that is widely used in the United States and Europe to keep such cancers at bay. So, with her oncologist’s support, she decided last year to try to pay the $120,000 cost herself, while continuing with the rest of her publicly financed treatment.

By December, she had raised $20,000 and was preparing to sell her house to raise more. But then the government, which had tacitly allowed such arrangements before, put its foot down. Mrs. Hirst heard the news from her doctor.

“He looked at me and said: ‘I’m so sorry, Debbie. I’ve had my wrists slapped from the people upstairs, and I can no longer offer you that service,’ ” Mrs. Hirst said in an interview.

“I said, ‘Where does that leave me?’ He said, ‘If you pay for Avastin, you’ll have to pay for everything’ ” — in other words, for all her cancer treatment, far more than she could afford.

Officials said that allowing Mrs. Hirst and others like her to pay for extra drugs to supplement government care would violate the philosophy of the health service by giving richer patients an unfair advantage over poorer ones.

Patients “cannot, in one episode of treatment, be treated on the N.H.S. and then allowed, as part of the same episode and the same treatment, to pay money for more drugs,” the health secretary, Alan Johnson, told Parliament.

“That way lies the end of the founding principles of the N.H.S.,” Mr. Johnson said.

But Mrs. Hirst, 57, whose cancer was diagnosed in 1999, went to the news media, and so did other patients in similar situations. And it became clear that theirs were not isolated cases.

In fact, patients, doctors and officials across the health care system widely acknowledge that patients suffering from every imaginable complaint regularly pay for some parts of their treatment while receiving the rest free.

“Of course it’s going on in the N.H.S. all the time, but a lot of it is hidden — it’s not explicit,” said Dr. Paul Charlson, a general practitioner in Yorkshire and a member of Doctors for Reform, a group that is highly critical of the health service. Last year, he was a co-author of a paper laying out examples of how patients with the initiative and the money dip in and out of the system, in effect buying upgrades to their basic free medical care.

“People swap from public to private sector all the time, and they’re topping up for virtually everything,” Dr. Charlson said in an interview. For instance, he said, a patient put on a five-month waiting list to see an orthopedic surgeon may pay $250 for a private consultation, and then switch back to the health service for the actual operation from the same doctor.

“Or they’ll buy an M.R.I. scan because the wait is so long, and then take the results back to the N.H.S.,” Dr. Charlson said.

In his paper, he also wrote about a 46-year-old woman with breast cancer who paid $250 for a second opinion when the health service refused to provide her with one; an elderly man who spent thousands of dollars on a new hearing aid instead of enduring a yearlong wait on the health service; and a 29-year-old woman who, with her doctor’s blessing, bought a three-month supply of Tarceva, a drug to treat pancreatic cancer, for more than $6,000 on the Internet because she could not get it through the N.H.S.

Asked why these were different from cases like Mrs. Hirst’s, a spokeswoman for the health service said no officials were available to comment.

In any case, the rules about private co-payments, as they are called, in cancer care are contradictory and hard to understand, said Nigel Edwards, the director of policy for the N.H.S. Confederation, which represents hospitals and other health care providers. “I’ve had conflicting advice from different lawyers,” he said, “but it does seem like a violation of natural justice to say that either you don’t get the drug you want, or you have to pay for all your treatment.” 

 Karol Sikora, a professor of cancer medicine at the Imperial College School of Medicine and one of Dr. Charlson’s co-authors, said that co-payments were particularly prevalent in cancer care. Armed with information from the Internet and patients’ networks, cancer patients are increasingly likely to demand, and pay for, cutting-edge drugs that the health service considers too expensive to be cost-effective.

“You have a population that is informed and consumerist about how it behaves about health care information, and an N.H.S. that can no longer afford to pay for everything for everybody,” he said.

Professor Sikora said oncologists were adept at circumventing the system by, for example, referring patients to other doctors who can provide the private medication separately. As wrenching as it can be to administer more sophisticated drugs to some patients than to others, he said, “if you’re a doctor working in the system, you should let your patients have the treatment they want, if they can afford to pay for it.”

In any case, he said, the health service is riddled with inequities. Some drugs are available in some parts of the country but not in others. Waiting lists for treatment vary wildly from place to place. Some regions spend $280 per capita on cancer care, Professor Sikora said, while others spend just $90.

In Mrs. Hirst’s case, the confusion was compounded by the fact that three other patients at her hospital were already doing what she had been forbidden to do — buying extra drugs to supplement their cancer care. The arrangements had “evolved without anyone questioning whether it was right or wrong,” said Laura Mason, a hospital spokeswoman. Because their treatment began before the Health Department explicitly condemned the practice, they have been allowed to continue.

The rules are confusing. “It’s quite a fine line,” Ms. Mason said. “You can’t have a course of N.H.S. and private treatment at the same time on the same appointment — for instance, if a particular drug has to be administered alongside another drug which is N.H.S.-funded.” But, she said, the health service rules seem to allow patients to receive the drugs during separate hospital visits — the N.H.S. drugs during an N.H.S. appointment, the extra drugs during a private appointment.

One of Mrs. Hirst’s troubles came, it seems, because the Avastin she proposed to pay for would have had to be administered at the same time as the drug Taxol, which she was receiving free on the health service. Because of that, she could not schedule separate appointments.

But in a final irony, Mrs. Hirst was told early this month that her cancer had spread and that her condition had deteriorated so much that she could have the Avastin after all — paid for by the health service. In other words, a system that forbade her to buy the medicine earlier was now saying that she was so sick she could have it at public expense.

Mrs. Hirst is pleased, but up to a point. Avastin is not a cure, but a way to extend her life, perhaps only by several months, and she has missed valuable time. “It may be too bloody late,” she said.

“I’m a person who left school at 15 and I’ve worked all my life and I’ve paid into the system, and I’m not going to live long enough to get my old-age pension from this government,” she added.

She also knows that the drug can have grave side effects. “I have campaigned for this drug, and if it goes wrong and kills me, c’est la vie,” she said. But, she said, speaking of the government, “If the drug doesn’t have a fair chance because the cancer has advanced so much, then they should be raked over the coals for it.” ",t1_c0c0znr,5,0,,5,True,t1_c0c0zin,0,c0c0znr,0,t5_2cneq,AriKant,politics,False,,t3_9allp,1426020123,1250256904,True,

All companies are greedy. All the telecoms are public companies so look at their financial statements. Sprint isn't even making any money. The rest are making money but not 500 dollars per line a year. They are making normal profits. 

So either companies are wasting hundreds of billions of dollars Northern European companies aren't, the US system costs massively more for some reason, or this study didn't accurately measure costs.

I'd assume the latter. American plans come with free in network calling, free nights and weekends, and a heavily subsidized phone.

"I'm glad you made that post.  There's this reality distortion field when it comes to reddit and discussing the NHS; suddenly everyone outside the UK is championing the NHS (National Health Service) of the UK as if it is some kind of perfect solution. 

Problem is, the NHS costs an absolute FORTUNE to keep going.  It's Europe's biggest employer.  1 in 4 employees are bureaucrats i.e. they are middle-management / administrators.  That's a LOT of people.  A big complaint about the NHS is that level of care isn't consistant from one hospital to the next.  Some hospitals are rife with the MRSA virus  and there's often a ""postcode lottery"" as to whether you're eligible for certain treatments or not.

Short answer : private care is WAY better than what the NHS can offer.  Many people in the UK still take out insurance for private health care, while continuing to pay their national insurance contributions (which pays for the NHS).  

It's just very difficult to run a massive system like this without introducing waste and many levels of bureaucracy - which in turn mean less money is spent on doctors and nurses (many nurses have been literally imported from the Philippines and other 2nd world countries to make up for the shortfall).  The best doctors end up going into private health care.

Many medical operations end up being outsourced to private firms because waiting lists are too long on the NHS.

I'm not saying it's ALL bad.  There are some great aspects to nationalised healthcare.  You can see a ""GP"" and get diagnosis for free (even though you can wait up to 2 weeks for an appointment,  hmm), medicine is free if you qualify (disabled / unemployed / retired) and no doubt it helps many millions of people on a daily basis.

However given how big the NHS is in the UK, I dare not think what kind of public health system the US (with 5 times the population) would come up with.

Personally I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle.  Create smaller systems - maybe on a state/county level - that are funded by the LOCAL tax payer PARTIALLY.  The other funding is through private payments from patients who want a higher level of service.

The place is a giant fun zone for twenty-somethings, think that scene from Pinocchio except nobody's turned into asses at midnight. Every night they have a large dinner where they sit you with a new group of people. The typical process was you start buying rounds for the table, everyone gets to know each other, then we'd invite the group and others back to our room for 'ouzo circle'. 

After passing the bottle around and getting sufficiently schnookered, we'd head down to the hostel's dance club and go ape shit. One of the wildest days was we woke up at 10 to go on a booze cruise. Half my friend's face was scraped up, and he had no idea how we got home. I'd been domed off on the beach that night by an incredibly busty Texan, both of us nude on the hostel's private beach, with several passersby cheering me on. 

Well we walked down to that beach and swam out to the sailboat, where people were gathering. The captain drove us around from cove to cove, where we'd stop and cliff dive. Girls were given 2 free drinks to go topless, 4 to go completely in the buff. Guys were given 1 drink for nude jumping. This progressed to a wild, scantily clad boat ride full of awesome. 

I met a Danish blonde babay who had the ass of a 12-year old boy and a husky, sultry voice. We smoked a j with the Captain, had boatwide beer drinking competitions- as I looked over to her shotgunning a beer with such beautiful form, I knew it was true love. 

We hit the dance club that night with all the newly acquired friends from the boat trip, and later in the evening I had some of the best freaky-deaky sex with that little goddess. After, she promptly kicked me out her room, saying ""I've got mine, so now you can go."" 

That sealed the deal for me. After the second night of unparalleled coitus, I asked her to move to America and marry me, explaining it only had to be for a year or two, just for kicks. That didn't work out. All I have from this glorious week in an island paradise are the glorious memories and genital herpes. 

And that is one of my best travelling tales. I know it sounds like a yarn spun by a typical broseph, but there is no exaggeration here, gentle(wo)men.

* universal healhcare is not evil you 'tards
* corporations don't care about people, americans don't get that

* america is the most arrogant country in the world, they think they own the earth, ""god"" only blesses their country, they perpetrate preemptive attacks on relatively peaceful countries (all based on lies of course), they think they invented democracy (no they didn't, and they fail at it).

"Well, my understanding was that it had to be transmitted through brain material or the spinal cord. But, I do see that Wikipedia now says there was a study done in 2004 that shows that it ""could"" be transmitted through blood transfusions. That is the first I have heard of it being transmitted through blood. But... I haven't read the study and I'm not sure which version of CJD was covered by the study.

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease

&gt;""Blood donor restrictions
&gt;In 2004 a new report published in the Lancet medical journal showed that vCJD can be transmitted by blood transfusions.[28] The finding alarmed healthcare officials because a large epidemic of the disease might arise in the near future. There is no test to determine if a blood donor is infected and in the latent phase of vCJD. In reaction to this report, the British government banned anyone who had received a blood transfusion since January 1980 from donating blood.[29] From 1999 there was a ban in the UK for using UK blood to manufacture factional products such as albumin.[30]

&gt;On May 28, 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration instituted a policy that excludes from donation anyone who spent at least six months in certain Western European countries, (or three months in the United Kingdom), from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy have relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in Western European countries (six months or more if military). The three-month restriction on travel to the UK, however, has not been changed.[31]

&gt;The American Red Cross' policy is as follows: During the period January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1996, spending a total time of three months or more in the Channel Islands, England, the Falkland Islands, the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales precludes individuals from donating. Since January 1, 1980 to present, spending a total time of five years or more in the above countries and countries in Europe. (For complete listing, please go to Redcross.org)

&gt;A similar policy applies to potential donors to the Australian Red Cross' Blood Service, precluding people who have spent a cumulative time of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

&gt;The Singapore Red Cross precludes potential donors who have spent a cumulative time of three months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

&gt;In New Zealand anyone who has lived in the UK, France or the Republic of Ireland for a total of six months or more between 1980 and 1996 is prohibited from donating blood.

&gt;Similar regulations are in place in Germany, where anyone who has spent six months or more living in the UK or Northern Ireland between January 1980 and December 1996 is permanently barred from donating blood.[32]

&gt;As of 1999, Health Canada announced a policy to defer individuals from donating blood if they have lived within the United Kingdom for one month or more from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1996. In 2000, the same policy was applied to people who have resided in France, for at least three months from January 1980 to December 1996. Canada will not accept blood from a person who has spent more than six months in a Western European country since January 1, 1980.[33]

&gt;The Association of Blood Donors of Denmark precludes potential donors who have spent a cumulative time of at least twelve months in the United Kingdom between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996.

&gt;The Swiss Blutspendedienst SRK precludes potential donors who have spent a cumulative time of at least six months in the United Kingdom between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996.""",t1_c0c1g6j,1,0,,1,False,t1_c0c0utv,0,c0c1g6j,0,t5_mouw,storyofitall,science,False,,t3_9ac0s,1426020336,1250279622,True,
"Yes, ""the risks associated with that deposit"". A deposit is not an investment, or even a loan, it is the placement of money for safe-keeping, which doesn't change its risk profile, or its ownership. A deposit is NOT owned by a bank. It is repayable on demand according to the terms of the deposit. Go and read any banking act to see what a deposit is (and I include the Icelandic banking act in that - it states what a deposit is). The problem here is that with Landsbanki they were able to operate in the UK and Holland under EU laws and regulated by their own Icelandic national authorities. Those authorities failed totally to ensure that the Icelandic banks kept deposits as deposits - but rather they treated the money as if it was their own, like equity or pure risk capital that they could play with. 

The Brits and Dutch DID complain to Iceland (which Eva Joly seems to have missed) but with the usual Icelandic tone (""Who are you to question the simply brilliant nation of Iceland?"") it was rejected out of hand. The risk therefore was being carried by the Icelandic government - which like all democratic governments acts as an agent of its own people. (When WWII broke out the Brits didn't say ""Oh, I didn't vote for a war. Why should my home be bombed? This is all the fault of some stupid politicians running a failed foreign policy!"" etc etc. No they accepted that their own government had fouled up, and been forced to make certain guarantees to a fellow nation. They accepted the consequences of those guarantees. They did NOT go banging pots and pans outside parliament. This is what the Icelanders don't seem to understand - they don't seem to realise that when you become a sovereign independent nation it does not mean you can do what you like with no consequences. Rather it means that you are an equal with other sovereign nations and must accept responsibility - because the buck stops with the nation. This is why the IMF won't deal with Iceland at the moment, neither will China, nor the Brits, nor the Danes, the Dutch, the Americans, the Germans. Just a few weeks back the Norwegian governent - Iceland's closest friend - said that they would not engage in any financial dealings with Iceland until they had sorted out their obligations. This is code for: recognise their resposibilities).

So at every stage the Icelandic government has assumed full responsibility for those deposits through its own actions (or more strictly speaking inaction) and that is why the Icesave debt falls to them.

Finally Milstar you write ""the seizing of those assets"". Right. And who did ""those assets"" actually belong to? The Icelandic banks? No. They were deposits - the property of British people - being taken out of the UK. The UK was entirely correct in stopping that movement. Read my original post to see why the freezing order was issued. Or are you another Icelander/friend-of-Iceland who choses to ignore the legalised theft that consitutes law 125/2008?

"This isn't really surprising. Of course it would take the right longer to mobilize in the US than in the EU, but the entire western world is seeing an upswing in fascism. We should have been tipped off by the National Front going up against Chirac years ago.

The reason for this is the fact that the left has been thoroughly declawed, in Europe, at least.

"Owning cell phones, cars, and TVs hardly makes up for not having access to health care or higher education (things that socialist countries provide as a basic right).  Wikipedia's article on Scandinavian economic models disagrees with you.

""According to libertarian think tank Timbo, when measured by wealth, the poor have less wealth than in the United States. For instance, they live in smaller apartments, have lower home ownership, and have less household equipment. These findings are however contradicted by a peer-reviewed study in the American Economic Review by American economist Lane Kenworthy who found that the percentage of household living on less than 40% of U.S. median household income (adjusted for household size) was lowest in the Nordic countries, and much lower than in the U.S.""

On an anecdotal level, my girlfriend is Norwegian and I have spent lots of time in the Nordic countries.  I can safely say that I have never experienced the kind of poverty that I had become accustomed to in the US anywhere in Western Europe.

I would agree that in Scandinavia (as an example) the cost of consumer goods is very high (minimum $5 for a crappy can of beer in the Norwegian grocery store) but they have very high wages as well.  They expect to make a minimum $25 an hour working in any retail shop unskilled.

"Great post! Thanks for taking my points seriously, usually when you see someone break down a reply point by point they're nitpicking and disagreeing for the sake of winning an argument.

To quote Trainspotting, and I hope you don't take this the wrong way, you were colonized by wankers. I know that the deal to unite with England and Wales (and Ireland? I don't quite know the history there*) was mutually beneficial and wasn't really a hostile takeover, but when you were your own nation and suddenly you're part of a larger institution, you tend to feel like your will is being subjugated by something, or at least your self-determination is somewhat watered down, and self-determination is a core American principle; our country was founded after casting off an imperial power, so it's only natural (if horribly incorrect) that many people here think any step toward joining the world community is a step away from what they believe America to be. I believe this is where a lot of the anti-UN sentiment in America and the anti-EU sentiment in Britain comes from: wounded pride, the idea that someone knows better than we do, or that we'd have to average what we want to do with our resources with a country that has less in terms of material wealth. I don't agree with this personally, I think a country should have some humility, but humility is just as hard to come by on a national level as it is a personal one. I think it takes some getting used to, which we haven't really had the chance to do until I would say 9/11 and the ascension of China. You hit the nail on the head when you were talking about 9/11. In the last 100 years, there have been two major attacks from outside forces, Pearl Harbor and 9/11, and no real economic competitors until relatively recently. We're a relatively young state, so we haven't had the experience many European countries have had with changes of government and the shrinking or shifting of our borders. Because of that, there's the idea that we're really kickass, when really we're just kind of... Childish, I guess? Naive. It's based in reality, but it takes the reality and runs away with it to the point that it's ridiculous and wrong. As the world globalizes in front of us, the attitude of pride in any country gets more and more outdated.

Military might is the big stick that people are always whispering around. It is not an inherent good by any means, and I think that the military-industrial complex is indeed a real, powerful, and evil force in our politics, but the way I see it, when judging a nation-states ""greatness,"" one must factor in the ability to project its will overseas and the military is a huge part of that around the world. I don't think it's a pleasant metric, really, but a lot of people can't help but look at it like ""my country can kick your country's ass!"" which in some part of our lizard brain means we're better, which leads to the USA chants and jingoism we've been seeing so much of from the right. Most other countries haven't had that experience in a great long while, at least when it's borne out of a realistic worldview; the last I can think of is the UK pre-WWII, when people liked to say the sun never set on your empire. You guys see our attitudes as so last century, and they are, but that's because last century you went through what we're going through now.

"I have no stake in the healthcare system at all other than that I occasionally get antibiotics for sinus or throat infections.

Health are is an incredibly complicated thing that wasn't really made so until the government got involved, at least that's how it looks to me. What is apparent to me is that in my 22 years in this country (I know, a short amount of time, but its all I have) the government has broken everything it has touched. To let the government rush into fixing health care because Mr. Hope himself promised it to win the poor vote is not any better solution than what we already have. Obama has done so much so fast to this country that people don't trust him. Hell I actually know, for the most part, what he has done and what is going on, and I don't trust him (and no, I'm not some stupid fucking conservative, I'm about as rational and thought out as it gets). Republicans obviously have no plan to fix heath care, but the democratic solution, ""O lets just create another bureaucracy to handle it,"" is an equally bad idea. If something needs to be fixed, it is the insurance system. The government wants to regulate away, regulate insurance. They tried to regulate health care and that has just raised costs, deregulate health care so the people who can afford it can pay for it without insurance and regulate insurance so the people who can't can afford insurance. 

Working for a government contractor has made me see that 3/4 of the cost associated with any government project comes from overhead costs that don't actually contribute to the project. The same thing has happened to the hospitals who are forced to create massive amounts of overhead to deal with government regulation and to pay for pharmaceuticals. Cut down those two costs and I bet health care becomes a lot more affordable. It doesn't help either when medicare will only pay a fraction of the cost of a procedure because then the rest of the cost is shifted to private pay as overhead. Unfortunately, a greed factor gets figured into that as well. An operation may cost a lot more than medicare will pay, but the difference is more than made up for in the private pay cost. Fix that and I would like to think costs will also decrease.

I am not a doctor or an economist or anyone in really any position to make this decision, but I try to stay informed about what happens in my country and so far I have heard wild speculation and asinine propaganda but not a single detail about how this plan will actually work. I am not against fixing health care, its long over due. But we can't run head long into a complex fix just because it works in Europe. We aren't Europe and what works there won't here. We need intelligent debate, critical assessment, and well thought out actions before we do anything. What's going on now isn't any of those things, its left vs right. Mr. Hope vs Dr. Doom (The Republicans). Also, I don't know if Dr. Doom had a mistress or anything, but if he did, it would definitely be Sarah Palin, and she would be sucking his cock like it was shooting money.

"you my man, have obviously not lived in a country of socialized medicine for even a single minute and are consequently misguided on the subject. Ive lived in what is consequently rated one of the ""best"" health care systems by the OECD repeatedly and it sucks. bigtime. And there is no other alternatives because if you get ousted by the government run racket and have to pay yourself the prices are _ridiculously_ high, easily $400/hour or more. If the governments ""need based"" bureaucracy medical board decides ""no more soup for you"" you are so utterly fucked beyond the grave you wont even know what hit you. And its the same in Canada and UK and France and Sweden or whatever country which has socialized medicine, if its ""free"" your ""needs"" are being contested by some kind of authority, and the ones who whines, cries, degrades themselves most get the best service because they are the ones who ""needs"" it the most.
The big problems with socialized medicine in combination with private care (like norway, sweden, UK, Canada etc) is that if you are going to utilize private services you still have to pay the taxes for public health care first. Then you have to pay for the taxes for your private doctor, then you have to pay your part of the taxes this private doctors clinic has to pay (lets face it, all expenses + profits a private clinic has are going to be payed for by its customers). This in essence means that you cant compete with the government, like i said ive already payed  $400+ pr consultation in Norway, the land of milk and honey and socialized medicine. Sure its private practices, but they are subsidized with tax payer money and if you walk in the door not backed by that anymore you are a health care outlaw. Consequently a lot of people travel abroad to get help and i know for a fact that is the case from all countries of socialized medicine.

You asked for a libertarian system, again, the singapore system is a superb example of extremely good health care solved in a close to libertarian manner, the systems in Norway, Sweden, Canada, UK, France are NOT, in any way or form, they involve violence against you as a person if you dont want to join their racket, you life is in the hand of a committee, if you dont like the committees decision you are ""free"" to do whatever you like as long as you keep paying those 60% taxes while you are sick to ensure good health care to others while depriving you of your own health. And no matter how inefficient they become they will always solve all of their problems with more people and more taxes.

Dont try to somehow transform the success and efficiency of the Singapore system into validation in your head that government run health care is ""da bomb"". They are not comparable in any way or form.

But ive thoroughly understood that socialized health care is whats coming to america, its such an aggression towards it its almost scary. The problem you you guys is that you never actually sit down and think, its either this extreme or the other, nothing in between. I can only hope, that if it happens nobody in your family will get sick with an un-popular illness and by un-popular i mean an illness rarely seen in the majority. Because the most scary part about socialized medicine is that its government run, and governments wants to get re-elected, and to keep the voters happy the governments need to show they treat the diseases the voters get efficiently, which means all the diseased _the majority_ gets are treated more efficient than the ones a minority gets (except for all the diseases the majority finds pity in, those are treated the best of all).

""Yes you are. Look at the Singapore information. Unemployed people get 100% free medical care. Many get 60% free or 80% free healthcare. Who the hell pays for that, the magic healthcare fairy?""
Maybe they havent been unemployed their entire life and have a huge health care saving account worked up already? The unemployment numbers here are staggeringly small. And as i said, it is only _close_ to a libertarian solution, but its better to be 95% free than 10% free. The big ball of metal your dragging behind you should be as small as possible.

""As you can in all 'social systems'. Choose your doctors, choose your hospitals, get second opinions, choose your surgeons. The choice is never removed. Just the paying part is.""
Hahaha, i almost chocked. You cant choose a god damn thing, you are delusional trying desperately to portrait socialized medicine as a beacon of hope. Its incredibly hard to get second opinions, you hardly get to see your surgeon, much less choose one. And just to be sure, how do you decide what/whom to choose? Here in Singapore the doctors/clinics have webpages with detailed statistics, complete resumes of their doctors, links to medical publications etc. Under socialized medicine all of this is redundant, you have a job and get your pay no matter what you do between 9-3 and the patients have no choice but to use you, what are their alternative, private!? i think not. No need to document my mediocre skills for the world to see.

""In Canada, and many practices in the UK, are all private owned and operated, the government only pays the bills. You obviously know nothing of ""socialized"" medicine. It just means that the government handles the paying part, not that the government RUNS the doctors offices.""
Why on earth should it be necessary for the government to first force money from me by gunpoint and threat of jail before having it go through a huge bureaucracy and then handing it back to me through yet more bureaucracy!? There is no way on this planet that having my money washed through that maze is going to provide me _more_ health care than i would actually be able to buy had i given the same money straight to the doctor. And i actually have to cry and whine and fill out 19 forms to the government before they would even consider giving back some of my own money. And this is no kidding, at home and in europe there are so many form to fill out there are actually lawyers you can hire to help fill them out to ""maximize"" your chances of getting medical attention, its just retarded. As long as ive been in Singapore ive had to fill out two forms, both with just my name on it and how i want to pay, then its carte blanche access to all the experts i have needed. And yes, obviously i know nothing about socialized medicine having been brought up in the country all others look at like the jesus of socialized medicine whereas you are an expert by just feeling a faint breeze coming down from canada via Michael Moore documentaries.

Your problem in the US now is that you have a system that is 25% efficient and costs 75%, you drool at countries with socialized medicine because they get 50% efficient at 50% cost, while you should be looking at true free-marked and people empowering solutions which will give 75% efficiency at 25% cost. Its just a simplification, but its a good illustration, no matter how retarded the alternative, as long as its better than what we have now its good to go, lets not spend even 5 minutes checking out what else is out there.

I don't know that I expect civilization to completely collapse, as much as I expect the economy to enter a period of long-term contraction before finally reaching a stable state not based upon growth or decline.

"It really depends on what you like

 Sydney is the biggest city in Australia, it is busy, full of life and activity, but it is also expensive and dirty. The tap water is grotty and the air is sooty, I personally wouldn't swim anywhere near Sydney harbour. People tend to be in a hurry and are often rude. It has the best clubs in Australia, and arguably the best night life. It has terrible public transport, but the ferries have a charm. There are some really nice places in the inner city and northern suburbs, with a few nice places around the inner south, but you can expect to pay through the nose for a shoebox. Western Sydney is the worst place to live in Australia. 

  Melbourne is the second biggest city, there is always something going on, but it is far more relaxed. There is a lot of old money in Melbourne, and it is always referred to as the artistic capital of Australia, every artist and musician ends up living in Melbourne for a while, and even though very few make it big, very few regret the decision. Because the city is filled with artists, there are always cool little exhibitions and live gigs on every corner. Melbourne has the best public transport in Australia, the trams are awesome. The entire city, and indeed the state is absolutely nuts for AFL, and it is impossible to stay for very long without it rubbing off on you a bit. Melbourne has so many Mediterranean residents that it qualifies as the second biggest greek city in the world, so the food is good, and cheap. The nice areas are near the city, particularly the inner north and west. The further you go out, the worse it gets, generally, the nicer a place sounds, the worse it actually is, broadmeadows is a hole. Melbourne has notoriously unpredictable weather, you should be prepared to get sun burnt, rained on and catch a cold on any given day. The beaches are shit.  

 Brisbane is cruisy and humid and disorganised and relaxed and ugly. There is no consistent architecture, its not actually on the sea, the river is pretty grotty, it is really hilly and can sometimes feel oppressively hot. That said, the tropical weather and super relaxed attitude to everything pretty much make up for it, it is only a short drive to many of the most spectacular beaches and water parks, and it is just fun. The pubs are good, the cafes are good, there food is fresh and the people are funny. All the rich people have weekend houses on the gold coast, which is the playground of the rich and famous, lambourghinis and penthouses abound, it really is fun. Brisbane's summer storms are simply awesome.

 Adelaide is the only city that wasn't settled by convicts, the free settlers built marvelous buildings and the city is beautifully planned out. There is quite literally a pub on every corner and a church on every other. The beaches are nice, the people are nice and the beer is great. The Adelaide hills are gorgeous and the town sits nestled in their shadows. Adelaide feels like a mix of Melbourne and Canberra. Everything north of Adelaide is desert and the summers are stupidly hot and dry. 

 Perth is a beautiful city, once you have seen the flame trees you will never forget them. Perth has the highest concentration of millionaires of any capital city in Australia, as a direct result of the mining boom. as such there are plenty of upper class establishments and shopping places, and plenty of rich kids having fun. For some reason there are also a lot of hot girls in Perth and the music scene is refreshingly vibrant. It is generally pretty casual, but this can be a bit of a downside at times as there is not a lot but country folk, desert and sea for thousands of k's in every direction(excluding freemantle). It can feel pretty remote and nearly lonely at times, despite the millions of residents, you are definitely separated from the world. 

 Darwin is hot, really really hot. And it never stops being hot. You can't swim in the ocean due to crocodiles, jelly fish and sharks. It is like some strange intersection of tropical paradise and urban wasteland. Everyone is always pissed and stoned, the steaks are huge and the culture is lacking. It is surrounded by gorgeous wilderness, it is just like that movie ""Australia"", because thats where it was filmed. All your iconic Australian imagery is there, without the cultural diversity and intellectual stimulation of the southern cities. 

 I havent actually lived in Hobart, but It is cosy and cold and small, Tasmania is uncompromisingly beautiful, with the vast majority of it uninhabited, the old buildings and strong environmental movement make it into an odd but comfortable place. 

 Canberra is planned and ordered, it is built on a series of triangles and circles, aligned with the hills. It is a government town, with most people and businesses working for or with the government. The public service pays well and expects little of you. Because everything was built by the government it has far more infrastructure and services per head of population than any other city. It can be very beautiful, feeling European at times, it has the most pronounced seasons of any city in Australia. It is two hours to the snow and two hours to the beach, so everyone leaves town for the weekend.  It is probably the best place to raise a family. The whole town is filled with trees and museums and universities, it is legendary for being too comfortable. It also has the highest rent prices of any city. If you have lived here once, you will come back eventually. Everyone comes back to Canberra eventually. 

 I don't like any city the best, they are like different moods, or different flavours, personally I love the culture of Melbourne and Adelaide, but to me, Canberra just feels like home.

"To refine your very valid point: 

Europe is the enemy, because Europe is where the rest of the educated world went.  A step towards government healthcare is a step towards Europe.  A step towards taxing $30 million bank CEO salaries, is a step towards Europe.  A step towards a functional primary and secondary education is a step towards Europe.  A step towards free college for the top half of high school students is a step towards a place in which the philosophy of the right makes sense only to the dumbest of the dumb. 

The right knows that Europeans and Canadians are very happy with their healthcare.  The right know that the rest of the industrialized world is perfectly happy with paying for free college.  The right knows this is one less cigarette boat, and once less of an ounce of respect for being rich.  And, most damningly, once less of an ounce of respect for an ancient book they think should guide our modern democracy.  High-caste Hindus would hate to see real rights granted to the underclass rabble. Likewise, the right, and their dull vassals, would hate to see real knowledge granted to the people.

"Well, here are the options:

- Kolibri is claiming that Western Europeans have ethical rights that Americans don't.
- Kolibri is claiming that Western Europeans believe that everybody has an ethical right to food and shelter and that Americans don't believe this.
- Kolibri is claiming that Western Europeans have legal rights to food and shelter and Americans don't.

I think it's pretty clear that Kolibri isn't making claim (1), that claim (2) is at best unsubstantiated and at worst wrong and that claim (3) is patently wrong.

In the article that Kolibri is responding to, the author cites the fact that there is no right to healthcare in either the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence as sufficient evidence of his claim that the essential ethical conscience of America does not subscribe to the idea that healthcare is an essential right (on par with, say, life, liberty or property).

When Kolibri said, ""in the rest of the Western world it is,"" I took that to mean that - as per the context of the article that he was responding to - Kolibri was implicitly conceding the author's inference [""if it's not in the Constitution or the Decl. of Independence, then you guys don't actually consider it an ethical right - at least, not as a country""] and attempting to shame it by contrasting it with something that was presumably different.

Since, in effect, the author basically used ""legal right"" and ""ethical right"" synonymously (after making the argument that it made sense to do so), and Kolibri seemed to concede that ""it may not be so in the U.S.,"" I assumed that Kolibri's claim about Western Europe was *somehow* explicitly tied to the idea of legality (if only as a justification for claim (2)).

"The ""secular miracle"" of Sunni Islam would be that somehow it developed a complex system of law where difference of opinion was not only accepted as a given, but actively studied in order to gain a fuller understanding of the law. It probably is even misleading to speak of ""law"", because it isn't at all a formal, codified law as known from civil law legal systems. And this development occurred in a religion that had and has no formal hierarchy or institutional framework. Point is there's been surprisingly little ""bitter struggle and conflict"" (assuming you're implying violence and bloodshed here) in Sunni Islam following from the diversity of Islamic law, although of course there's been bloodshed for other reasons.

As for a so-called scripture-prescribed conflict between believers and non-believers: I'd like to point out that the countries that have been ethnic mosaics for centuries are in the Middle East, I'm thinking of the area known today as Lebanon for example. Countries that had lost any rich ethnic diversity - until the migration waves post WWII - are to be found in Europe. The last round of destructive, unrivalled ethnic purification over there was barely sixty years ago. The countless communities in the Middle East however still exist and have survived whilst being under so-called Islamic rule for centuries. I don't understand why those communities haven't been completely eradicated or assimilated if Islam is in practice a religion that is incapable of coexisting peacefully with (or tolerating) other religions and communities.

Another important point, *Islam is not based on nationalism*. In a system or country based on nationalism: people are treated differently on the basis of their nationality. People are forbidden from entering territories, arrested, deported or what not on the basis of this idea of the nation and nationalism. We find this completely natural, although of course it isn't, it's just as artificial as any other system. In Islam however, the law you have to abide by and the rights, duties and dispensations you have are based on religious affiliation. It's a completely different system.

I would further argue that the problem with contemporary Muslim countries is that they have a wicked mix of nationalism and Islam. A mixture of two systems that sadly brings out the worst in both.

That list above is great though. Some added thoughts:

* Tipping isn't mandatory but it can be expected at bars. I tend to only tip on good service so use your own judgement. IF a bartender opened your $3 beer bottle, that's not a tip. If they mixed you a kamikaze, that's worth an extra buck or whatever. Double the tax and round to a dollar amount is fine for any restaurant you come in and are served.

* If you're news-starved NPR is amazing. Find the local station on a radio or just download the podcasts. The internet is also great.

* American TV service sucks, is overpriced and isn't worth it. I gave up cable twice now and have no problem entertaining myself with internet stuffs [hulu and the like] because the boxes/DVRs and remotes are very, very crappy and never work when you want them to. Also most of it is absolute crap and anything good is available online anyway, if only a day later.

* Don't worry about insurance or anything like that until you talk with your wife and/or get a job. It's pointless worrying about it until you can do something about it.

* Don't worry about guns or religion either. Most americans [people for that matter] don't run around telling everyone they're wrong about everything and shooting off guns and such. If you seek out the subculture it's there but otherwise it's like any hobby, some people do it and other's don't

* Take some time to get used to driving, I've heard it's a totally different beast. Also be aware of cops. If you get pulled over for something stupid be very nice [yes sir et cetera] and play dumb/overly exhausted [So sorry officer I got an hour of sleep last night spent the whole day teaching and now I'm really just trying to get home so I can prep for tomorrow]. This has gotten me out of every ticket.

* When in doubt, be a nice charming european man and we'll just get wooed with your accent and forget what we were arguing about.

"Reagan ended third party clinical trials and paved the way for the medical system we have today where drug companies run their own clinical trials and then hand the data they deem fit to the FDA for review and citizens are bombarded with unproven and highly overpriced alternative drugs in convenient timing to the expiration of drug companies patents. THEY INVENT DRUGS TO REPLACE WORKING DRUGS JUST TO GET NEW PATENTS and charge 3 times as much. Watch Big Pharma and The Corporation

Reagan's trickle down economics and deregulation also mark the period at which our banking system rose the bar on corruption thus leading to today's situation. We've allow endless consolidation in almost every industry since the 80s and globalism also bloomed into a full blown business model as the US sought the cheapest possible unit price and thus outsources US labor. 

All that should have been prevented with even conservative market protections which every other Republican administration before Reagan used. US goods were among the best in the world and we sold ourselves out and our industrial secrets. Global corporations funded by American wealth don't owe allegiance to any nation, including the United States. Instead of US trade being controlled by the citizens of the nation, corporations act like nations within the United States leveraging our name at their profit and pushing their liability to  everyone. Regan did not entirely cause this, but his deregulation, lower taxes and other rewards for the rich was exactly the opposite direction we should have gone. Reagan marked the end of market protections and a huge spike in global corporations investing in cheap foreign labor instead of American labor. 

For people to keep their freedoms and the sovereignty of the homes it's key corporation aren't allowed to act on our behalf and many times on money borrowed in our names. It's very important to break apart monopolies and actively look for unfair business conditions because with the great wealth of a capitalist economy also comes enormous consolidation of power if anti-monopoly laws are not enforces. 

Clinton rode the bubble and effectively did nothing positive to change the long term outcome of enormous corporate corruption, influence in government, consolidations of markets and zero market protections for US products. 

We could have probably created a trade agreement with Europe to keep cheap foreign labor out and we'd still be making electronics and the huge internet boom would still be fueling American and European factories first and the rest of the world second. Doesn't that sound better than being China and India's bitch ? 

If the cons would wise up and go back to examples like Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt or dare I say even Nixon is a better example of not COMPLETELY selling out to the wealthy because you grasp the concept that it will erode our rights and cannibalize our wealth if you allow endless monopolies.

"Nothing in particular against [DCU](http://www.dcu.ie/), but just to note the two biggest general universities in Dublin are [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/)  and [Trinity](http://www.tcd.ie/).  Bear in mind that an international student may if anything be made more welcome at a smaller place though - think small town vs. big anonymous city.

University culture in Ireland is much, much more like Britain than the USA in general.  ""Animal House"" is the *wrong* mental image to have.

Re Ireland in general: note that Americans raised on the typical romantic stereotypes of Ireland might be in for a bit of culture shock.  It's not quite like the movies, nor the strange notions Irish-American descendants of the famine diaspora tend to have handed down, especially not if you're coming to live for an extended period rather than march through the tourist traps.  If at all possible, it would be smart for your and your son to vacation to Dublin for a bit if you haven't already just to check the place out.

I'm not sure it makes sense to worry much about relative ""party school rep"" between UCD and DCU. Bear in mind they're both in Dublin, Ireland.   People who want to party will party in Dublin.  It's *Dublin* in *Ireland*.  It might be slightly (slightly!) harder to find a serious party every night if you're attending DCU, but not by much (since in both cases it's easy enough to wander into Dublin, I mean).

Young Americans in particular can go off the rails a bit in Ireland (and other parts of Europe) owing to one cultural difference, I've seen it happen: alcohol is legal to buy from 18.  Impress upon your son that it's okay to turn down invitations to house parties, nightclubs and so forth - Irish people have usually learnt *some* moderation by the time we get to uni, same is not necessarily true of middle-class Americans typically introduced to alcohol and other mind-altering substances much later than we are.  

Dorm quality I can't comment on - dorms/halls are there mostly for the international students (which an  American of course would be, mind you).  Most students live off-campus in rented accommodation, especially after the first year, even if international. 

UCD would have a generally rather higher international academic reputation than DCU. Whether it's entirely deserved or merely a product of UCD being much bigger and over a century older  is another matter.   TCD is ranked [49th](http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege/) in the world, UCD is [108th](http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitycollegedublin/),  DCU is [302nd](http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/dublincityuniversity/), [DIT](http://www.dit.ie/)  is [328th](http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/dublininstitutetechnology/), according to the Times list anyway.

"&gt;Wealth does not imply wide-scale drug use.

It ""indicates"" it more than poverty does. 

&gt;But wide-scale drug use (in the sense of luxury spending rather than spending on a cheap local commodity, ie Afghan heroin) does imply wealth.

Jesus. Ok, listen. The USA, Europe, Canada, and Aussieland consume the vast majority of the worlds drugs. By amount of drugs consumed, not money spent. This is a fact. Thus my statement, the top drug consuming nations tend to be the wealthiest, where the people have the most money and free time. That is all I said, it's an easily verifiable fact. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of heroin in Afghanistan or whatever. Look, here's my first (seemingly bland and obvious) post which sparked this debate. 

&gt;Well, drug use tends to happen in societies where people are rich enough to have hobbies and free enough to pursue those hobbies.

&gt;You were arguing the first, when you meant to argue the second.

The part about ""free enough to pursue those hobbies?"" What's wrong with that? I'm again stating the obvious that they not only have to be wealthy, they have to be free enough to get and use drugs. Singapore, China, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, ect come to mind.

"&gt; your alcohol is supplied by the alcohol store.

Swedens relationship to alcohol is very “special” to say the least. Alcoholism and drug abuse is the main model we use to explain and understand social problems. For instance; if you go to jail, for whatever reason, your drinking habits will come under close scrutiny, even if you were not drinking when you committed the crime. In prison and afterwards you will be offered help to cope with this. 

I was a trainee at the Swedish “Prison and Probation Service” (Frivården) for six months and I had one of my clients come in ones a week (for a total of six moths I believe) to do, among other things, a mandatory Alcohol-test – even though the client was a Muslim and had never had a drink in his entire life because of religious beliefs.

There is an understanding in Sweden that everyone is a potential alcoholic and you need to understand this when you drink. As a swede you should not romanticize the subject of drinking! “I like drinking, it makes me more relaxed etc..” is bad, however you can always say things like “I try not to drink to much, I don't need it to be myself”. And whatever you do, don't tell the children that you drink! They are not suppose to know about this until they are at least 18! If they find out any earlier they will probably become meth addicts before you know it!

A TV chef was criticized recently for drinking wine that she used while cooking, because she promoted bad drinking habits. We don't have glass of wine to dinner during work days (In fact, this could very well be considered alcoholism). You are suppose to drink as much as you can on the weekend. (this is very socially accepted)

To keep us all from becoming  alcoholics, we need very strict rules. If you want to serve alcohol (and you do, because everyone drinks like crazy here) at your bar/nightclub – you also have to offer food during the time you serve alcohol so that people who drinks to much can eat and shape up (at a nightclub I worked at we served microwave food at ridicules prices, just to comply with this). You also have a “restricted area” where you can sell your alcohol, and people are are not allowed to leave this with their drink. Thats whay, on a beautiful warm summer night, bars in Stockholm can be completely packed with people inside, but none sits in the outside chairs because they don't have proper fences around them! (This looks crazy)

But we also need the “alcohol store” or the infamous “Systembolaget”. It's the only place in Sweden where you can buy alcohol (legaly) to bring home. They usually have a very, very good selection on stock, and if something is missing you can order almost anything from around the world and they will bring it home for you. They really have very good service! Part of their work is to make sure you don't drink irresponsibly however, and this affects their otherwise excellent service:

* They close at 1800 hours (with some exceptions) and are closed on Sundays. 
* They are closed on national holidays – especially the ones you want to celebrate with a drink. (everyone of them) As a responsible citizen you are expected to plan your drinking and buy it in advance.
* They do not sell any pre-cooled beverages or beer bottles in plastic – you are not supposed to walk in here and buy something that you drink straightaway (Again, you drink all of it  the coming weekend)
* They all sell some beverages that are alcohol-free, even though this is the only place to buy alcohol

Weed is completely out of the question. While it is socially accepted to drink until you puke over your own clothes and then fall asleep in this condition – watching a movie at home with some good company and weed is not. (for instance rape charges has been dropped because the perpetrator was to drunk to realize the girl said no)

And it's not the politicians that needs convincing, it's the voters. Sweden makes no distinctions between hard and soft drugs in the law and a one time use of an illegal substance is considered abuse. We have high sentences for drug related crimes, by Swedish standards.

I'm sorry for writing a long rant like this – but I consider this a big part of Swedish cultural. I really love living here, but... much in the same way you can swing an election with fear of external threats in the US, we are afraid of threats to our social security. And you can win votes here by protecting us from ourselves.

So again, you should at least consider Denmark!

I'm not sure if there are any exact measurements (except number of items) in for example ""Robinson Crusoe"", but I can still feel in my head how large his fortifications were (and the next reader will feel something else). I think that is an advantage.

For time, if a species/civilization evolved on a planet orbiting something else, I'd guess they'd still be stuck with something related to what was visible in the sky for day to day timekeeping. The smallest unit in everyday use could maybe be how quick they could move their arms/tentacles from their waist to their mouth (~1 second). For longer periods (years) I'd guess solar seasonal/other cyclical variations (shift in planets magnetic field, sunspot activity, large meteor impacts) play a role. Maybe they also got together and decided on a new year zero at some point, Star Trek stardate style. For shorter intervals (hours), maybe some rituals like the [prayer program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery#Monastic_life_in_Western_Medieval_Europe) in the monastery in ""[The Name of the Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_name_of_the_rose)"" determines the time periods. Maybe they count hours and months on their fingers/suction cups, or maybe they only think of time as either before or after dinner. Maybe they only eat dinner every 12th year.

For distance, maybe the actual distance doesn't matter as much as how long it takes to get there. ""It's two days by camel"" or ""It's 10 ticks on the A train"" or ""It takes two lifetimes to get there even by plasma pod"" or ""Urba needed a teleport, and he needed it now, but the application process would take days"".

For weights and size, I still think you'll mostly get away with saying relative stuff like ""it would leave a large dent in Fnarlugh's skull"", ""he could fit it in his pouch"" or ""its gravity sucked in smaller ships, like the one they were in now"". 

Who is to say how big a civilization is? Maybe their biggest starships are 1 cm long by our standards. And flies may have a shorter lifespan, but they're quick to get out of the way of the newspaper, so maybe they think about as many thoughts before they die as we do.

"Story Time:

I'll preface this by saying I'm no skin (although I do enjoy some Oi/Streetpunk). A few years back in my hometown of Portland, OR, there was a ""war"" between factions of racist and anti-racist skinheads. Back in the 80's some racists killed an Ethiopian man named Mulugeta Seraw by beating him to death. This was a heavily cited-upon case and involved a larger racialist organization, but violence never really came to that level again until the early 00's. It wasn't so much that Racist/Fascist/Nazi skinheads (affectionally called ""boneheads"") were common, more like people looked the other way. There were known bonehead houses, and they would go to shows to intimidate people and perform general acts of douchebaggery, etc. I'm not sure if it was a change in their tactics, or an increase in their numbers from out-of-staters, but they started to gain the attention of the press and local anti racists. A group called Volksfront emerged, and had a fairly ruthless reputation. They were joined by European Kindred (a more conventional prison gang), East Side White Pride, and other unaffiliated boneheads and racists. Conversely, larger organizations like Skinheads against racial prejudice (SHARP), Anti Racist Action (ARA), and AntiFa had chapters popping up, along with an autonomous group called the Rose City Bovver Boys. What erupted was low-intensity street fighting, more akin to a game of of cat and mouse. Skins would go to a bar that boneheads were know to congregate, and then mean mug them until enough friends showed up on either side to run the other ones out. Cars were bombed, houses were shot at, etc. The Bovver Boys were and still are infamous for their violence, arguably by emulating the thuggish tactics of their racist counterparts.
They would jump boneheads in 10-1 gang beatings, shut down shows, and generally wreaked havoc. Soon this degraded into fighting or intimidating anyone who they saw fit. However, for their faults they were successful in pushing the boneheads out of the city or into hiding (last I heard some are out in Hood River/The Dalles or mid-valley towns like Salem and Dallas). Violence peaked and died out around 04'/05', right around the time I started going to punk and hardcore shows, so I wasn't a witness to most of the happenings. All these groups still have a presence in Portland, albeit a less obvious one. It is increasingly rare to see a skinhead ""dress down"" these days, perhaps because of ridicule and judgement from the mainstream.

Unless we see more actual bilateral trade, we'll only see the growth of American government and China will therefore only have growth prospects primarily in terms of the rest of the developing world.  

Maybe China's fine with that but it won't help anyone there move up the value chain.  You have to pay American prices for American things if you want to understand the market.

"&gt;I noticed you didn't answer the only question that is really relevant so I'll repeat it

Strange, I could have sworn it wasn't there when I looked at your previous post earlier. I must be getting old. For my reply, see [my previous post on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9azd1/global_warming_raw_data_unavailable_to_3rd/c0c2z44). 


&gt;No one has said he hasn't or won't release it. Because of that, this is a straw man.

Ok, when he releases the data, I'll retract my statement. Until then, it stands. He certainly hasn't released it under the 'data' section of his website, where he has links to every other data set under the sun.

&gt;Implausible. [...]

Ah, now we have a source.
[http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=403](http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=403) (I'll just post it here, lest it suddenly change for some reason).
I note that this is not a primary source either, it's just someone re-telling something that happened to someone else, just as was my original argument against the linked article.
At last there's progress, as we now know the name of the person it happened to: Warwick Hughes. Which makes it strange that Mr Hughes does apparently not carry any details of this conversation on [his website.](http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22I+will+still+not+pass+on+the+data%22+site%3Awarwickhughes.com&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=) 
You'll also note that Mr Hughes is not, as Orlowski claimed, a climate scientist but, according to his website, a ['free lance earth scientist'.](http://www.warwickhughes.com/). 

&gt;I do trust them in terms of their honesty and belief that they have interpreted the data correctly.

So if you trust them, but not McIntyre? Or, if you *do* trust McIntyre, why don't you use the data he claims to have for the verification?

&gt;Why doesn't Jones just give them the data?

Because it's not his to give away. To quote straight from the [CRU website:](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/availability/)
""Since the early 1980s, some NMSs, other organizations and individual scientists have given or sold us (see Hulme, 1994, for a summary of European data collection efforts) additional data for inclusion in the gridded datasets, often on the **understanding that the data are only used for academic purposes with the full permission of the NMSs, organizations and scientists and the original station data are not passed onto third parties.** Below we list the agreements that we still hold. We know that there were others, but cannot locate them, possibly as we've moved offices several times during the 1980s. Some date back at least 20 years. Additional agreements are unwritten and relate to partnerships we've made with scientists around the world and visitors to the CRU over this period. In some of the examples given, it can be clearly seen that our requests for data from NMSs have always stated that we would not make the data available to third parties. We included such statements as standard from the 1980s, as that is what many NMSs requested."" (Emphasis mine).

Since this apparently does not satisfy you, on what grounds to you object to it? Do you think that CRU is lying about the part that they promised to not give away the data to third parties? If you think they are lying, why are you prepared to believe them if they were to give you something that they say is the real data? 
Ah, here we go:
&gt;No. See Benford's law

Benford's law doesn't separate 'fake' from 'real' data - it separates statistically plausible data from statistically implausible data.
It's easy to create a fake data set that satisfies Benford's law, for example:
11, 2, 10, 15, 3, 2, 4.

&gt;It's easily solved. Give the data to every academic that wants to analyze the data to confirm it's integrity with the gridded data (and thus confirm the conclusions drawn from that data); they won't do that though.

Of course not - it's not theirs to give away. They'll be sued and no-one will give them any more data.

Finally, I will refute one of your statements by applying your own, slightly modified, answer to it:
&gt;given that the phrase has been repeated so often in this very public debate, Jones (or Hughes) would have said ""that's a lie"" if it was a lie.

Answer:
&gt;No one has said he hasn't or won't refute it. Because of that, this is a straw man.

2. Learn about new culture
3. Improve english

Lots! We learn basic english on school, but most of the middle class' kids go to english schools (i went to one for 6y).

1. Come on summer - you will see what a real summer looks like ;D
2. Don't be afraid of talking to people: most of brazilians are willing to improve their english, so they will help you/talk to you.
3. Go to small cities (if you don't know portuguese, go with another brazilian). Small cities have wonderful things (and you will eat the best food ever).
4. If you are in Sao Paulo, go to clubs and bars. You will drink good beer, meet wonderful people and maybe, will finish your night with someone.

Every city is kind of dangerous - as i always say, depends on the place - but statically speaking, Sao Paulo is not that dangerous.

"&gt; We know for a fact that China has indeed made great jumps in GDP.

That isn't his argument. His argument is that they *are* fudging their numbers (which they have been since the 80s), he simply fails to mention that every government fudges their numbers in a certain matter. 

&gt;The fact is China is exploding and innovative as hell.

China's economy *was* down, likely well down to 4-5% growth which isn't enough to sustain reasonable levels of employment for the country. Chinese electrical data showed a massive downturn until July. It took a sudden 5.7% year to year nosedive from may of 2008 to may of 2009. It was down an additional .03%. Hell, power consumption in Sichuan dropped 9.9% in the first quarter, but its economic growth in the same period reached 10.8%. The local government explained the economic growth is mainly led by the post-disaster reconstruction.

Exports are down an outrageous amount due to US/EU consumers not purchasing goods. You're looking at a near 10% drop across the board.

&gt;China consumer spending is exploding providing a domestic market for the first time.

Aside from car sales there have been no real measurable indications of this. The majority of their economy right *is* floating on the 600 billion that the government infused. That would be like the United States or the EU suddenly throwing out 3 trillion and 2.4 trillion (USD)  into public works. You would certainly notice domestic spending going up but would you be able to find Mr.Yuan spending his money? The indications say that *if* Chinese consumers are spending they are likely only spending slightly more than they use to. 

&gt; And a lot of the economic cutbacks are actually redirected outside the country. 

Economic cutbacks? Such as?

&gt;The author is full of it....Well they are.

I'm not sure what ""private economic consulting firms"" you're paying attention to, but I wouldn't be listening to them if you intend to make money in China. While China has made leaps and bounds in the last twenty years, anybody who has paid attention to it's growth has suggested pretty openly that their GDP numbers are generally overstated by 2-5% depending on the quarter/year. Again, this isn't anything new. If you want to see how bad things are in China for the average guy, go to a job fair where unskilled labor have been looking for a job since January of last year and college graduates are looking jobs for roughly the same amount of time. At 7-10.8% annual growth this wouldn't be the case (and we saw it wasn't the case from 2000-2003). 

Honestly, when it comes down to it, the world simply isn't big enough to create 29 million jobs a year, year after year for China, and that noticeably scares the Chinese government. Is it recovery? Yes... probably? Is it recovering at the rates that the government is throwing out there? Likely not.

&gt;Many of these trees also began an evolutionary process of producing red deciduous leaves in order to ward off insects. In North America, as in East Asia, north-to-south mountain chains enabled plant and animal 'migration' to the south or north with the advance and retreat of the ice according to the climatic fluctuations. And, of course, along with them migrated their insect 'enemies' too. Thus the war for survival continued there uninterrupted.
&gt;
&gt;In Europe, on the other hand, the mountains – the Alps and their lateral branches – reach from east to west, and therefore no protected areas were created. Many tree species that did not survive the severe cold died, and with them the insects that depended on them for survival. At the end of the repeated ice ages, most tree species that had survived in Europe had no need to cope with many of the insects that had become extinct, and therefore no longer had to expend efforts on producing red warning leaves.

I suppose you live in a big city. If so, is the indigenous culture widely present in big cities? Are there obvious differences between the indigenous and the population of European ancestry? I.e., do the indigenous or mestizos study or are employed in the same fields as the whites? Are they considered equal? 


What are some stereotypes, like ""Indigenous people are lazy""?


Are the non-indigenous interested in the indigenous culture? Anyone studying Kichwa, for example?


I learnt Spanish from an indigena from Chile and she even mentioned that the indigenous there would be happy and honoured if a white person like myself (not even a really white person by European standards) was to take the initiative to speak to them. Don't know if it's true, as I haven't been to Chile yet. Does this sound outlandish for Ecuador? It sounds outlandish to me.

And don't give me shit about this having nothing to do with the banks. This was your banking stocks inflating the market, as you can see in this [grotesquely spiky graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OMXI15.jpg) from Wikipedia.

As to how many people benefited, I don't believe you one fucking bit. You are looking at the status **now**, when people who took massive loans to buy homes are now bankrupt. Sure, that's not a net benefit in the end, when the economy came crashing down. But in that sense, many bankers are bankrupt too now. ""Benefited"" to me means took the loans at some point. Whether or not that money was lost in the crash doesn't give it back to the foreigners who loaned you the money in the first place.

It doesn't have to be every last person in the country who did that, but a very significant number did. You pull the number 10,000 - 20,000 out of your ass, [another Icelandic guy before you](http://www.reddit.com/user/Unnat) said it was ""less than 20 people""! You guys need to get together and get your stories straight, there's a big difference between 20 and 20,000. I bet if they start counting the people who bought second homes, new cars, took vacations etc. on **borrowed money**, it would be far higher than your numbers.

Finally, this investigator you mention is paid for by the government of Iceland. Why is what she says ""truthier"" than what independent bankers, **not paid for by the Icelandic government** say? There is conflict between those two accounts, if you didn't notice.

&gt;This makes me want to punch you

Don't give yourself a heart attack. This stupid anger and outrage doesn't change facts. Like I said, in the end, it's not gonna be about how many upvotes your sob story can buy on Reddit. It's going to be about how bankers across Europe and the US see things, and they are righteously pissed. These are the same people who warned you about recklessly spending money, the same people whom your politicians laughed off.",t1_c0c37vq,0,0,,0,True,t1_c0c36d5,0,c0c37vq,0,t5_2qh13,DaveM191,worldnews,False,,t3_9aztn,1426021271,1250439153,True,
