Now for the old Space Race to the Moon. It wasn't (originally) just a pissing contest demonstrating which government/philosophy is superior at whipping out bigger rockets and aiming them with greater precision. Watch Heinlein's 1950 movie *Destination: Moon*, and you'll catch some propaganda of why establishing dominance on the Moon is so gosh darn important.

I don't think that  China will, or even should emulate the western style liberal democracies of Europe or Americas somewhat lesser liberal democratic position.  China faces a fairly unique set of challenges and is socially and culturally very different from the EU and US, it will develop in a different manner and the end result (as much as there can be one and I suppose I am talking about 'in my lifetime') will be very different from the perceived aims of those national blocs.

Moreover, as you said, China is set to rise astronomically economically, indeed it already has been rising both economically and in social development terms for a long time.  Change in China really has been rapid and radical, if not always in a way that the west generally perceives as positive.  What that does mean is that they will be taken seriously (they have to be, their global positions are directly encroaching on US and EU interests).  

China has dona a lot to improve living standards and 'rights' the problem as I see it is that it deems it sown progress as more important than political or personal freedoms, it may even be right in that regard as focusing on progress economically, militarily and diplomatically should and seems to have increased the former a little. 

I'm not sure where China will be in 25 years time, I know I probably won't like it one way or the other, but it may well be the result of the best course of action for China. 

 It is a tough set of issues, do you trample on property rights to provide employment and industrial progress? Do you trample on personal rights to ensure stability and safety?  These are issues that the US especially and  EU states are dealing with currently and it seems in both cases the US various EU states are taking positions that seem less that what one might have expected in the past.  Of course China isn't in the same position as the EU or the US so its decision making will be different still, to determine the success, failure or popularity of those positions we should probably look to the Chinese population living in Mainland China (Places like Hong Kong and to a lesser extent  Shanghai are probably too different in some social terms to be good barometers..).

 There's one set of root DNS servers.  These are a.root-servers.net through l.root-servers.net.  How are these looked up?  Dirty little secret: DNS resolvers have these hard coded, or at least written in config files.  They define what the servers for each TLD are.  So, when a new TLD is added, what they're doing is adding records pointing to the nameservers for ""eu"" or ""mobi"" or ""tel"".  In this case, we're looking for ""com."" which is run by Verisign.  The root servers for com. are a-m.gtld-servers.net. 

Each domain registry runs their own set of servers to direct 2nd level domains (i.e. reddit.com, google.org) to their own DNS servers.  Essentially, when you're buying a domain name, you're paying for this entry.  You're allowing the TLD(Top-Level Domain, again, like org, eu, com, etc.) provider to delegate authority for that domain name(say, diffra.com) over to you. So, the next query goes to any one of A-M.gtld-servers.net (which of these is selected randomly, in theory.  they should all return the same results).  This query is more familiar to most people.  When you set the nameservers for your domain name, this is what you're setting.  You're saying ""hey, okay, check for dns information for reddit.com over at these servers.  for brevity, let's say they're a and b.reddit.com (they aren't).  

Then, we query those a/b.reddit.com servers (again, only 1, randomly) and ask ""hey, do you know where www.reddit.com is?"".  They respond ""ohai, it's at 69.22.138.145"".  This is called an ""A""(address) record. End of story, you have your IP.

...Almost.  There's a few cases where this wouldn't be true.  if the previous few paragraphs went over your head, stop and reread them, or do some googling before continuing.

It's possible that a.reddit.com returns an NS record.  What this says is ""well, i don't know where www.reddit.com is, but I know that c.reddit.com knows.  The root servers and tld servers all deal in NS records.  They simply redirect you to another server.  Think of this as a 301/2 redirect.

It's also possible that they return a CNAME record.  This can be explained as ""yo dawg, i herd you like DNS requests, so I put a dns request in your dns request""  Basically, what it's saying is, ""that's cool that you've come this far, but, really, www.reddit.com is ""httpweb.reddit.com"".  Go look up that hostname, and make your request there.  In this case, you start the process over again and look up httpweb.reddit.com. and take whatever result you get there as the result for www.reddit.com.  You can daisy chain cname records if you want.

email works a little differently.  It has it's own special type of record, MX.  you follow the whole process above, but when you get to a/b.reddit.com, you ask it for the MX record instead of the A record.  It returns a hostname like ""mail.reddit.com"".  you then proceed to do a whole lookup for the A record of mail.reddit.com.  

EDIT: if you have access to a unix shell, you can do the whole process above yourself.  use the following commands:

**Look up root servers**

    host -t ns . 

**look up tld servers for com**

    host -t ns com. 

**look up nameservers for reddit.com**

    host -t ns reddit.com. 

**look up a record for www.reddit.com at one of it's nameservers**

&gt;The sweet flesh of many fruits is ""deliberately"" appealing to animals, so that the seeds held within are eaten and ""unwittingly"" carried away and deposited at a distance from the parent.

The adoption of Christianity by Constantine was one of his last ditch attempts to unify the Roman Empire and create some kind of solidarity. The Empire had been on its last legs for a long time for a myriad of reasons. BTW, the Dark Ages are now referred to as ""Late Antiquity"" in academic circles. During this time, the centers of learning ceased to exist or shifted to distantly or non-connected places, notably, Constantinople, Cordoba, and Paris. There was a scramble to get hold of any existing manuscripts from surviving libraries in order to preserve classical learning. In the 10th c., Moorish Cordoba had 70 libraries, one of which had about 400,000 volumes, while Paris had about 2,000. Monasteries and churches were the main storehouses of those manuscripts, where monks worked all their lives copying texts for their libraries and passing the originals on to other monasteries and abbeys. If not for Christianity, and the determined effort to preserve knowledge in a barbaric culture, there would have been a far worse situation. As feudal society replaced tribal structure in the early Middle Ages, widespread learning began again.


But, during this period, the main intellectual and economic lights were in the east: in Byzantium and in the Islamic world. It was not until the 11th and 12th centuries that Western Europe would come into its own.

Israel was an almost empty desert. When Jews moved in, lots of Arabs from neighboring countries moved in also to enjoy the prosperity.  Most of the guys calling themselves Palestinians had ancestors that were not in Israel in 1890.

In any case, that's ancient history. A significant number of Jews existed in Israel by the time of the holocaust and 1948, and the Jews accepted the UN partition plan of 1947.  The Arabs refused and decided to try to kill/deport all the Jews in Israel.  They failed, and got less territory than they could have got in peaceful terms.  And you blame the Jews for this?

The settlers were (wrongly) used by the governments as a negotiation card against the Palestinians. They thought that if they evacuate a lot of settlers, they could get away with a better agreement than if settlers were evacuated out-of-agreement.

This was probably a mistake in policy.  As for the horrible things that settlers do, the vast majority of Israelis are strongly against them, and the army rarely cooperates with that.  Many settlers are arrested by Israel's security forces when they do bad things.

Uhhhhh..... what history books have you been reading?

""Late Antiquity"" is the period right BEFORE the ""Dark Age"".  You could say it ends with the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which was in 476 AD: the year the final Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed. The Eastern Roman Empire, i.e. Byzantium, would continue to be a viable force for another thousand years, as you said. And Islam became a political force before Muhammad's death in 632.

The Early Middle Ages i.e. the Dark Age, is the period from roughly 400 AD to 1000 AD in which the economy and population of Western Europe shrank drastically, there were massive migrations of mostly Germanic people (and that includes Franks, the ancestors of the French, and Anglo-Saxons, the ancestors of the English).
Cordoba was an Islamic city, so it does not help in your attempt to make Christianity seem the source of light in a dark age.

You say that ""Heresy was not a major concern in this period in Western Europe"".  There is a reason we do not have many records of the Church dealing with heresy during this period:  we do not have many records of ANYTHING that happened in Western Europe during this period.

When you have one relatively small non-profit agency in each province and all they do is pay the bills, there is no reason to get involved in any individual's health care, and certainly no manpower to get to that level of meddling.  Cutting back on coverage or services doesn't gain any raise or bonus for the gov't employee administering the invoices and billing.

Sure there's limited funding, so they have an incentive to spread the money they get around as evenly as possible.  The incentive comes from either genuinely wanting to help everybody get the best care or (if you're cynical) minimizing the amount of public complaints about wait times and result pressure from the politicos.

So, with limited resources, the system self-regulates to some extent - a doctor knows the MRI machine is busy with serious trauma patients and people with brain tumors, so you don't get referred for your sprained wrist unless there is a really good reason.  But that is your doctor making a professional judgment on the appropriate use of limited diagnostic resources (which has to happen in any sane system).

In practice, the system works very well.  At least that's my experience.

For starters, I consider myself basically a Libertarian. I hated Bush and already strongly dislike Obama.  However, if some Chinese guy started mouthing off to me about how awful Bush was or how America is a decandent nation of slovenly fools, I would immediately go on the defensive.  I would do this despite the fact that I would agree with both of those statements.  When you are ensconsed in an alien nation and an alien culture, you tend to not take much flak from that nation/culture about how yours is fucked up and why its fucked up.  There is a simple reason for this: ignorance.  I am not going to embrace a Chinese person who is bashing America, even if I agree with their argument it is because their argument and opinion is based solely on the reportage of others.  They have not been to America.  They don't have any idea what it is like.  They are simply making an assesment based on what others have told them.  Most of the time they are not even making an assessment - they are just parroting.  Infact, the Chinese aren't even the worst.  It is the expat Europeans who expound at greatest length about the myriad defects and problems with America and American culture, but I digress...

The pinnacle of social organization and political achievement is harmony. The harmonious society.  In the west, at least until recently, the pinnacle of the same is strict adherence to transcendant principles.  To put it another way: Harmony = an easily managed populace, Transcendant principles = a clear sphere of liberty.

Please read some good, modern history of the Medieval period before you talk about what was going on at the time.  Try Peter Brown, he's very engaging and easy to read, even perhaps fun.  Christianity, although it was doing its usual comply-with-me-or-go-to-hell nonsense, had very little to do with the problems that arose; if anything, the monks were responsible for preserving as much as they could of the knowledge of the past.  Most of the issues were related to the constant raiding by the Vikings and ""barbarians,"" which wreaked havoc on the old Roman trade system.  The Romans had been going down hill for quite some time, and so when the Empire collapsed things went pretty badly.  Much of Europe lost its financial base, and so even kings weren't as wealthy and able to maintain the arts the way they had in the past.  

Now, the past wasn't all that great anyway; the average Roman wasn't able to read either, and most people didn't even have citizen's rights and of course women were chattel.  That didn't change for hundreds of years.  In fact that didn't change until fairly recently.  So your medieval people were financially worse off than the late antique and more raided, but otherwise about the same.

The church's point of view on reading the scriptures was that someone ought to know something about theology before they read it.  Not that only some kind of nobility ought to read; monasteries and convents took in TONS of people and taught them to read.  Both men and women, by the way.  And generally the nobility could read as well, and they wrote to one another quite a bit, and we have the writings.  Charlemagne was a voracious reader and his courtiers had lengthy debates about the virtues of art and education *which we still have to this day.*  If you're interested, check the *Libri Carolini.*  Most of it's in Latin.  In fact pretty much everything is in Latin, for official state documents or things that were intended to be read by people in different countries (like histories, for example).  

As to the art, there is a pestilential modern tendency to say ""OH THESE PEOPLE COULDN'T DRAW LOL.""  This is patently untrue.  There was a particular stylistic decision made at the end of the Roman Empire to begin a more schematic, less ""realistic"" type of depiction; it is not because people suddenly got stupid.  We have examples of both styles in the same monument.  Placing some kind of value judgment on art is always a bad idea; what constitutes beautiful to one person is terrible to another.  Thus, Picasso makes some people really frustrated-- he could obviously draw, but he chose not to.  Over time, the techniques of the Romans were lost to an extent (concrete making, etc) and as people tend to do the later artists built on what the former did.  Over time the style AGAIN changed, the Italians leaned toward three-dimensionality, and there you go, the Renaissance.

Most of the problems people have with understanding Medieval art arise from the fact that Art History is a relatively young field.  Like, about 120 years old young.  And when it started, a young guy by the name of Winkelmann was absolutely in LOVE with classical art, and his writings took off and suddenly everyone was in love with it to the exclusion of just about everything else.  Medieval art was studied, but in a more dry, cataloging type of way, and it didn't help that it was largely done by Germans who were doing it because it was ""German"" art and ended up politicizing it.  A lot of Medieval art was used as NAZI propaganda, and it gave the rest of the world a bad taste.  Art historians veered away from it and taught an entire couple of generations that illusionism is somehow ""better"" than otherwise, without any real basis for that declaration.  And because it is more challenging to actually understand non-illusionistic art, a whole lot of lazy people were perfectly fine believing that Michelangelo was tops and everything non-realistic was chaff.

If we view carbon emissions as a form of damage, then the people who emit carbon should be paying to clean it up. 

Fortunately, we have several practical and reasonably inexpensive means of removing carbon from the atmosphere, such as plowing biochar into soil. So here's my libertarian solution to global warming: if you remove carbon from the atmosphere, you gain a right to emit that much carbon back into the atmosphere, and you can sell that right.

Note that unlike carbon credits as they're usually presented, this is not the government claiming an exclusive right to emit carbon, which it sells to the rest of us. Credits are earned and sold by anyone who removes carbon. The government's role is minimal, essentially amounting to management of a property right, with a tax to emitters payable only in carbon credits.

Initially, there would have to be a transition period, as businesses ramp up carbon absorption. There'd be a ratio...eg, to emit 1000 tons, you have to buy 1 ton of carbon removal. This ratio can be adjusted until we achieve a one to one ratio - carbon neutrality, without necessarily getting rid of fossil fuels.

A more government-centric carbon market that gives people credits for removing carbon could end up being effectively the same thing, so I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea. However, carbon markets in Europe are not working well, and the bill in Congress looks like it'll be about the same. In both cases, we're seeing all sorts of political favors and lobbyist distortions. In Europe, some big carbon emitters have actually been profiting, because they were ""grandfathered"" and given credits for free...so many they were able to sell excess.

I can't site, but remember reading that Arafat had indicated that he couldn't give up right of return because he'd get assasinated if he did. Arafat was offered everything he wanted except right of return and turned it down. So long as there is a sufficiently strong subgroup of the Palestinian side that wishes for the destruction of Israel it's a waste of time negotiating because the Palestinian leaders don't have the scope to make an agreement even if they personally want to. They can ignore agreements.

The Israelis can't give right of return because if they do it's guaranteed that the state will instantly turn into another middle eastern basketcase, and paved with their blood. I'm surprised they're contemplating a limited right of return. It would be interesting to know the details of this.

The Palestinians need to find a way to break down the obstacles to trade that are preventing them building a stable middle class. The quality of the land doesn't have to be that important if you can get enough brain power and there is well-educated talent in the Palestinian diaspora. Economic development should be the top focus of all discussions (especially in regards to the ways that Israel is hampering it).

Abu Mazen is not an idiot, but he is a crook. Perpetuating the conflict is a means of keeping international aid flowing without having to be responsible for the well-being of one's constituents. Instead, blame for Palestinian misery is deflected on the Israelis. And what an effective sob story it is, receiving a disproportionate amount of attention in relation to body count. 

Abu Mazen is universally hated in the West Bank. He sits in the Muqata in Ramallah and has ventured out maybe once throughout his entire tenure. But he wears a three piece suit and is the front man for the moderate Palestinian circus, so stupid European/American politicians throw money at him. And what does he do? pockets it and lines his buddies' pockets as well, following in the footsteps of his insane predecessor, Arafat. That is why Fatah is internally so weak, so weak that Hamas managed to overthrow them with an army 5-10 times smaller than Fatah's security force.

The corruption of Fatah has consumed the party and its continued existence  in the West Bank relies on two things: (1) It is not Hamas (2) Israeli presence for security. Strangely enough, Fatah *needs* Israel, mainly to control the West Bank for them, because the minute the IDF moseys out of town Fatah will crumble. Since power abhors a vacuum, Hamas, being organized to a good degree, will take over. And with the results coming in from Gaza, nobody wants that to happen - not the Israelis, not the the Pals.

- DARPA was set up in February, 1958 in response to the then Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik. It was originally established as as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), by Public Law 85-325 and Department of Defense Directive 5105.41. Until the mid 1960s, ARPA was focused on space and missle related research. Its role was refocused in 1972 when it was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and it became oriented toward smaller more diverse and exploratory projects. In 1993, its name was changed back to ARPA, then in 1996, its name was changed again to DARPA. *Several technologies have been traced to DARPA including a precursor to the Internet called ARPANET.*

However much people vote this down because you dislike the that fact ARPAnet was born to a military family. *It will still be the truth.*

You won't see the viking, you won't see the celtics, or whatever, in most of the working and upper class, you'll see so many eerie model examples of British restraint and civility.   Ireland DIED.  and let's not even talk about what Catholicism did to the culture on TOP of that.  We're just figuring out sex a year into our relationship.

That's not entirely fair and Ireland is a real country with a culture, but while stuff white people like is more about the fun and funny and sometimes cool parts of ""white"" maybe american culture,  but then there's a bigger and more eerie zombie-like pattern imposed on all the countries Britain colonized.  Because what I said about Ireland can also be said over and over again with different worlds that have become intimate parts of my life. Ireland's the only WHITE country I'm familiar with that was dominated in the same way, the culture-killing way.

I'm sure most post colonial literature is ABOUT this, but the only thing I read was FRANTZ FANON's  THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH six or seven years ago.

Whenever you print the kind of money that has been printed, inflation ( here meaning devaluation of the money ) results. This is almost too obvious a fact of life IMO, although there is TREMENDOUS disagreement about this within the investment community ( The Great Flation Debate ).

Inflation will likely not be ""steady"" but more likely herky jerky - with a steadily rising overall trend.

The great threat of US Dollar collapse is something I worried about myself, but it seems unlikely to happen in the next 5 years.

While the system is becoming more and more untenable and will become more so during the 2010s as Social Security and Medicare and Pensions drag on the system, the major players (Europe, Japan, US, China) all have too much to gain from allowing the current system to play on.

Having large companies in inflation protected (or benefiting) sectors makes a great deal of sense in this environment, providing both downside protection and providing a decent amount of upside potential.

The exact reasoning behind the clause is not clear, but from notes and discussion on related questions, it appears that the delegates of the Constitutional Convention were worried about foreign influence. [James Madison wrote](http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jyinger/Citizenship/history.htm):

&gt; the ministers of foreign powers would have and make use of, the
&gt; opportunity to mix their intrigues &amp; influence with the Election.
&gt; Limited as the powers of the Executive are, it will be an object of
&gt; great moment with the great rival powers of Europe who have American
&gt; possessions, to have at the head of our Governmt a man attached to
&gt; their respective politics and interests. No pains, nor perhaps
&gt; experience, will be spared to gain from the Legislature an appointmt
&gt; favorable to their wishes. Germany &amp; Poland are witnesses of this
&gt; danger. In the former, the election of the Head of Empire, till it
&gt; became in a manner hereditary, interested all Europe, and was much
&gt; influenced by foreign interference. In the latter, altho' the elected
&gt; Magistrate has very little real power, his election has at all times
&gt; produced the most eager interference of foreign princes, and has at
&gt; length slid entirely into foreign hands.

John Yinger concludes:

&gt; In summary, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention were deeply
&gt; concerned about foreign influence on the national government, and in
&gt; particular on the President. At the beginning of the debate, they
&gt; wanted the Legislature to select the President, and they tried to
&gt; limit foreign influence on the President by devising
&gt; time-of-citizenship requirements for members of the Legislature.
&gt; Presidential qualifications as such were mentioned, but they received
&gt; little attention at this stage in the debate. Ultimately, however, the
&gt; Convention decided that a President elected by the Legislature could
&gt; not be insulated from foreign influence and it turned, instead, to the
&gt; Electoral College.

They said ""Sorry guys, but then we'll have to ask you to put the fire out."" 

We said ""No problem, we were leaving anyway, but can't find this guy's shoe."" They walked back to their car and took 4 bloody huge flashlights out and gave us 2 of them. They joined us in scouring the beach and dunes for the one missing shoe until we found it. We thanked them, we all wished each other a great night and that was our encounter with the police.

Another time I was supposed to pick up a parcel at a post office on an industrial park. It was dark when I arrived and I couldn't find the damn place. Then I noticed a police van approaching me. They opened the window and went ""Need directions?"" I was a bit embarrassed, but I explained that I was looking for the post office. They said I had to turn around and just go straight ahead, but then they said ""Oh, get in. We'll take you there."" We had a friendly chat and then I was were I needed to be.

Axtell argues that there is no evidence that the early European explorers and settlers who came to the Americas were familiar with the ancient European practice of scalping, or that they ever taught scalping to Native Americans. Axtell writes that the idea that Europeans taught scalping to Native Americans became popular recently, during the 1960s. This idea quickly became conventional wisdom because it fit the tenor of the times of the counter-cultural 1960s, writes Axtell, but he argues that archaeological, historical, pictorial, and linguistic evidence contradicts this notion. Certain tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the 19th century.

If you look at the really early trend towards naturalistic depiction, say someone like Giotto, you can see the stylistic development toward weight and three-dimensionality.  Giotto is still very Catholic, and at the time the artists weren't dissecting yet, but the style had begun to change before the artists really got into the nitty gritty of models and cadavers.  The interest in depicting realistic human form seems to have developed before the loosening of restrictions.  

You're not exactly correct about the orthodox paintings.  Byzantine art is an animal all unto itself and has looked about the same for thousands of years, intentionally.  In fact, Byzantines were doing exactly the same type of icons while many different styles were developing in medieval Europe-- Romanesque, Gothic, you name it.   It doesn't really have to do with the Church maintaining control, because the church had about the same control in Western Europe as it did in Byzantium; just two different styles of artistic development.  

Yeah, I'm actually not a big fan of Picasso.  The only reason I talk about him ever is because people actually know what I'm talking about if I bring him up-- he's much like Koons in that he was pretty much a sell out, and self-consciously at that.

Moreover, we have currently been struggling with tensions that we did not have to deal with in the past--unlike many developed countries in Europe, the United States has not had to deal with radically new cultures.  Most immigrants who came to this country in the 1930s were so isolated from their own countries (due to distance or political views) that they fully adopted American customs.  Now we are at the stage where we receive many Mexican immigrants (who can come in larger numbers and stay more connected with their homeland); the immigration, combined with ""closer"" threats in the Middle East has made us reactionary.  The dumbest Americans cower behind this idealized vision of early America, which rebelled and seemingly took up staunch anti-intellectual pragmatism instead of European openness.  In reality, the founders who laid the groundwork for our Constitution were more open-minded.  

So, cut us some slack.  Americans themselves are now like immigrants.  We are confronting a new culture.  Only now do average Americans understand the true effects of cultural globalization.

I'd imagine this comes partly from training though, not just heredity. But it doesn't mean that all African Americans have that characteristic or that it really influences their speaking voice. I mean, Nina Simone had a incredible voice (in my opinion, one of the greatest voices in the history of recorded music), but it was very unique. Not just anyone can sing like she did.

I said dialect, because I meant that it's not any kind of dialect, including a sociolect. But I using the very literal definitions of ""dialect"" and ""accent"". From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect):

&gt;A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation, the term accent is appropriate, not dialect (although in common usage, ""dialect"" and ""accent"" are usually synonymous).

When African slaves were brought to America, obviously they learned English with an accent. And they usually lived in separate quarters with other slaves. So certain cultural traits were passed on from generation to generation, including the accent, although it changed over time. So they went from slavery to segregation, still live in general isolation from white. Well, that was only 50 years ago and the repercussions are still being felt. Beyond that there's also intense racism (things have improved by leaps and bounds, but it's still out there). So communities tend to stick together. There's a comfort and trust in it. 

Ok, another example. My current neighborhood was once predominantly Greek and Eastern European. You can still see it. There are schools that teach in Greek, Greek restaurants are everywhere. So for decades, people continued to speak Greek with each other. Younger generations especially have an easier time learning English, so when they went outside the community, they started to lose the accent more, but it's still there. Well in the last 20 years or so, other groups started moving in, Hispanic, Arab, Balkan, Indian, Jewish, Japanese, etc. Big melting pot. And more recently, the typical American (of western European decent). So the younger kids are growing up more ""American"" because that's what's around them.

Sometimes vowels get dropped or added to individual words.   Sometimes as part of a larger [vowel shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift) within an entire language. 

Sometimes a [consonant shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_German_consonant_shift) occurs.   Within [Indo-European languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) is the whole [Centum-Satem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centum-Satem_isogloss) divide.

There are even [meaning shifts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change) to the base semantic meaning of a word that can and do occur over time.  

These shifts then interact with one another causing even more changes in pronunciation and semantics over time.   And when word borrowing between languages occur, that also feeds into and effects things.  

These shifts in language account for why you are not raised up speaking the language of Chaucer or even Shakespeare.

Cuba's record harvest had been set in 1952:

&gt; in 1952, when Cuba produced its greatest harvest of 7,298,023 million tons

&gt; the 1970 harvest only reached *7,558,569 tons*. 

So, it failed to meet its objectives, but still resulted in a record crop. There have been all kinds of [disasters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) of forced collectivization, but I don't think this would rank as one of them. 

I think it's pretty broadly understood and accepted that agricultural subsidies, primarily coming from the US and EU, have massively distorted the global market for agricultural goods. The most disastrous affect of these policies has been on developing countries that have few alternative sources of foreign currency when the market price of their agricultural commodities drops below the price of production. 

For the *most* part, these subsidies are simply the result of internal politics: France loves its small farms, despite how inefficient they are. The US has a powerful and aggressive agri-chemical lobby, that's been able to play tit-for-tat. 

In the case of sugar and corn, the case is a bit different: Cuba had been the US's primary supplier of sugar until the revolution. United States gradually replaced its sugar with HFCS, supported by subsidies. The link corn subsidies and anti-cuban policies is just back-room politics - brilliantly ""exposed"" in Carl Hiassen's [Strip Tease](http://www.amazon.com/Strip-Tease-Carl-Hiaasen/dp/044669567X/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249245873&amp;sr=8-19)

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the US redoubled its efforts to destroy Cuba economically. The Helms-Burton Act made it illegal for foreign companies or their subsidiaries to do business with Cuba, if any part of the company also did business with the US. Again, the US is not *ignoring* Cuba, but exerting illegal, extraterritorial measures with the goal of destroying Cuba through economic isolation. The length to which the US has pursued these efforts borders on the [bizarre](http://americas.irc-online.org/am/3220)

1426009281,t3_96uhs,,True,,1249248695,0,,7,False,t1_c0bmx83,0,"My short answer is yes. My long answer is below:


I've seen some academic arguments about just how well and widely people could think and act at various points in the past, but they all seem to depend on how much education such people got in their local circumstances. For instance, it's entirely possible certain residents of 10,000 BC were smarter about the world and themselves than certain peasants of Medieval Europe.


Human intelligence has ebbed and flowed erratically through the ages. Despotic control by sometimes demented or ignorant kings and emperors hasn't helped matters (one Chinese emperor had everything in the libraries of the entire country that he didn't personally like, destroyed. The destruction of the Library of Alexandria is another instance). Other examples include important forgotten technologies like steel making and concrete, which had to be re-invented again later.


Most people don't realize just how how capable people were (at least in some spots of the globe) 10,000 years ago or more. For instance, take a look at the technologies and capabilities proven to have existed in at least some human hands as far back as 22,425 BC:


""#1: People in general have possessed spoken language pretty much globally for at least 75,000 years by now, and perhaps for many hundreds of thousands of years. They've possessed some access to fire for nearly one and a half million years (though the secret of fire-starting may still elude them, forcing them to maintain perpetual fires in community hubs or else seek a flame from neighbors or others; such perpetual fires often burn for years or decades between extinguishings). One element helping make fire more practical is that lamps have been available for almost 50,000 years now (perhaps longer).""


""#2: Much of the humanity of this time are 'modern' humans, and have been spreading throughout the world (perhaps displacing older types of human ancestors) for tens of thousands of years by now. These 'modern' humans are so-called because they are basically as intelligent and behave much the same as the humans of the 20th century would under similar conditions.


The humanity of this period may have possessed brains roughly the same size as 20th century man's for close to 800,000 years by this point.""


""#3: Food seems to be plentiful during this time-- at least in some locations around the world. This could help make for a population boom before, during, and after this time, at least in the more fortunate locales about the globe. Abundant and easily accessible food would also allow people more time to experiment, innovate, play-- and make war.""


""#4: Besides the possible cornucopia of natural food sources perhaps available by now to some (if not all) of the world's population, there's also signs of agriculture and husbandry efforts underway in at least one spot near one edge of the swollen southeast asian peninsula (the Solomon Islands), going back at least as far as 3,000 years before now, and perhaps even 100,000 years in other places (if you count the earliest efforts with breeding wolves and horses for various purposes, including as contingency food supplies).


Dogs and horses have been domesticated for quite some time in various regions. Both are used at least as contingency food sources. Both are also used as pack animals and to pull sleds of various sorts. Horses are sometimes ridden (though the practice may be unusual), dogs are hunting and combat companions and perimeter guards for camps. Pet monkeys (sometimes highly trained) also may exist.""


""#5: It's possible that the people of 22,425 BC possess quite sophistocated clothing, body art, and personal accessories, as well as jewelry, fishing and hunting nets, ropes, cords, and string by this time-- and perhaps have for at least a couple thousand years already. Musical instruments such as flutes have existed for at least 25,000 years by now. Man-made housing has existed for more than 375,000 years. Food and drink containers have been in use for at least around 80,000 years, perhaps almost half a million. True pottery has been in use for at least around 10,000 years already in Asia.""


""#6: Humanity during this period (and perhaps for hundreds of thousands of years before relating to some items) displays skills of producing and deftly wielding projectile weaponry such as javelins and related gear, as well as knives, and bows and arrows (likely all stone-based or tipped) (note that simple bows have been in use in some spots for at least 7,000 years by now). People have been hunting big game and constructing animal traps for more than 20,000 years by this time (as well as shown more planning and forethought in their travels than before, which suggests at least memorization of terrain, if not a crude mapping of same; keep in mind humanity has been creating rock etchings and paintings for at least tens of thousands of years by now, in some locations).""


""#7: Prototypical market economies and related trade sprang up more than 10,000 years ago in some spots around the world.""


""#8: People of the period may enjoy significant amounts of trade and information exchange with others over vast distances-- perhaps even across the oceans to include virtually every continent on Earth (lowered sea levels have made it possible in some places to reach remote continents walking across land bridges, such as between Asia and North America, as well as via island hopping and seasonal sea ice crossings; but seaworthy craft are and have been available for maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of years, as well).""

&gt; Sounds like rationing to me.

Rationing is the more-or-less equal distribution of a good where demand exceeds supply. Think of gas in the 1970s, or food in WW2. In this case, there is lots of steroids available, just no longer for free - thus it is not rationing.

&gt; Being permitted to pay for one's treatment instead isn't relevant.

Yes, it is. You are not getting refused a treatment - it might just not be the newest and shiniest. In European healthcare systems, you are paying for a basic level (e.g. metal fillings for tooth cavities), but can opt to pay for higher-level medical treatments (as in - for example - ceramic fillings). Under no circumstances you are forced to live with the cavity or forced to get your tooth extracted if a insurance decides so. 

You essentially pay the difference between the basic and the high-level treatment. The option to do so is IMHO essential for the well-being of our health providers (e.g. doctors) as well as for the ability to survive of our health insurances.

&gt; Because according to the article itself, the working alternatives aren't workable for all.

Well, it's an opinion piece. I let the scientists decide on what works and what not - obviously they decided steroids don't work.

quote: ""What concerns me is that to pay for these treatments, specialist clinics which offer vital services are going to be forced to close""

That's the real reason for the outcry: Some people will loose their profits. 

&gt; I'd assume that getting the drug itself is likely best for those people on it, as the doctors prescribe it for them, otherwise the doctors would be prescribing less than good health care. 

I've got bad news for you: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=doctors+pharmaceutical+corruption

Many doctors don't decide on a treatment on the grounds of what is best for you, but on what is best for the bottom line. Why should a publicly funded health insurance pay for extremly expensive medication if there is a more economic medical solution?

&gt; In this situation, a government bureau is deciding what's the best treatment for these people, not their doctors.

You forget the part where they've decided based on scientific studies. 

&gt; cheaper less effective

cheaper != worse. If you are not Pfizer, that is. 

&gt; health care system isn't managed by what's best for their patients.

It isn't. It is designed to give basic health care to everyone. It's fairly efficient in this goal, hell, it tends to do even more: in Germany, they even pay for yoga courses, taxis to go to the doctor, housemaids (in case of temporary disability), and travel vaccinations, three areas where I think personal responsibility (and private financing) would suit the cause better.

Nobody is entirely good or entirely evil.  Sometimes Hitler must've spoke about his favorite flavor of ice cream, or the weather, or social policies unrelated to the genocide and conquest.  And on his thoughts on those matters, I'm ambivalent or even positive toward his positions.  And if someone as abhorrent as Adolph Hitler can have said something right once, certainly malcolm x, who as far as I know never killed a single person, may have said something right once, and it's probably best to argue against his arguments and not his character.

The Constitution has a higher power, the people of the US and that is obvious in the fact we can amended the constitution in any way we want.

You're just making a case for amending the constitution when it comes down to it because most people want a strong central government to balance power vs the states.

Too much state sovereignty leads to inefficient micromanagement of the nation and you can see we first tried this strong state model in the Confederate State of America and it failed horribly.

As much power as you grant the states you need to grant the federal government about the same amount of power. We need oversight that reaches over multiple states and we need standardized currency and other things that we would lose by making the federal government too weak. 

Plus we would become militarily impotent and in general unable to tackle large scale problems like getting to the moon or winning WW2. It takes a strong central government to accomplish large goals like that. States would spend 10 years debating on who should pay what and Hitler would have ruled Europe and eventually asia. 

We already have a do nothing government and in my opinion much of the problem is pork barrel spending to get contracts into your state. 
Congressmen have EVERY incentive to vote for any bill that spends money in their state, good idea or not and that's how many of them vote. 

States are also responsible for the current run down public education system. They are responsible for all those abusive cops. It's just too easy to stock your state with loyalists and do whatever you want while hiding your intentions. Take Jeb Bush and his convenient shortage of voting machines only in the highly liberal areas. There is just too much power and too little oversight and while the Feds do fail at their job sometime they are doing no worse than state politicians and we nee a check and balance between state and central power or we're doomed. 

People in a democracy have the right to vote any bill they want. It's the duty of the people to take those unconstitutional laws to court. Like it or not it's not Congresses job to ensure the bills are constitutional, it's the judicial branches job.

At this point there are really two distinct and highly identifiable populations within the USA.  The first and largest group comprises of those who watch daytime TV shows, are superstitious and easily manipulated by religion and propaganda.  The second group are the forward thinkers who are increasingly less religious, look beyond the messages presented by the media, seek intellectual fulfillment and personal growth.

When you think about it, the primary goal of the Government is to maintain the standard of living, happiness and security for the *majority* of the people.  Raising the general standard of education across the board is only important as far as is necessary to maintain the general standard of living.  That is to say we only need to be as educated to the point where the US economy can compete globally.  

This is as it should be as there are very real dangers with having an educated populous.  For example, people would stop doing ""ordinary jobs"" and start questioning the Government and each other on literally every aspect of life.  To be frank, it's a sad but true fact that until civilization transcends the need for work we need a substantial ""fat dumb and happy"" percentage of the population.  It might sound arrogant and politically incorrect to say so but there isn't really an alternative.

It's my belief that there's no such thing as a sustainable classless society because in the first place humans are not made equal, and second, human nature causes all of us to try and get a leg up on our neighbors - hence the failure of communism and fascism.

I've been thinking about this whole intellectual class division a lot recently.  In fact, at this point, my wife and I are pretty much resigned to leaving the US for Europe where at least religion plays a lesser role.

One idea I have thought of would be to turn the tables and create a kind of ""Church"" for forward thinkers (ie Reddit readers).  In this Church you would of course have to leave your religion at the door.  

The idea would be to build an organization as powerful as the Catholic Church for the ""rational"" minority.  The organization would help binds us emotionally, provide comfort and support, a wealth of resources and a platform for moving society forward in the way we all want.

Yes it's a pipe dream but I for one would love the support of a power base of rational, intelligent, free thinkers.  Right now I'm living in a world where a large majority of people I interact with never read books, prefer Oprah to Frontline, and quite honestly, I am afraid to mention my lack of belief in a supernatural deity at work for fear of ruining my career prospects. 

I have some ideas how to organize this but the main problem is that we free thinkers are in many ways just as fat dumb and happy as everyone else.  We won't get off our well paid, intellectually stimulated asses to do anything about it. (Well apart from to bitch on Reddit :)))

This isn't the army and you can quit whenever you want, but its best to plan on spending the whole 2 years there. Sometimes you have the option to extend for a third year

The first app is about 15 pages, lots of short y/n questions and a few essays. After you submit that with references (who have to write a letter of recommendation for you) they call you in for an interview. This will be like a lot of job interviews in a way, but there is a quite a bit of psych eval in there too. They need to know you can handle dealing with foreign cultures, foods, and how well you handle stressful issues like loneliness (expect to be isolated from western culture for at least a few weeks at a time), poor health (you will get sick), and other things like child beatings (common discipline in poor and third world countries). 

They will also check your experience to see if you qualify for any of their programs. I expect you would do well in SED or ICT (Small enterprise development or Information and Communications Tech), but they may ask you to work on some more projects to get more experience first. One of my buddies did well in the interview but didn't have enough relevant skills so she was advised to work as an emt for 6 months. After that she qualified for the health program.

One the interview is done, you will be sent medical, dental and psych evaluation forms. If you have good insurance, in good health,  and are on the ball, these can probably be completed in a couple months, but expect it to take more. Mine took nearly a year because I had dental problems, crappy insurance and had seen a school councilor for depression in the previous ten years (after getting the college to fax my file, PC decided there wasn't anything to worry about.

If you have decent insurance and are in good health, it should cost more than a couple hundred to get the physical and so on, and you will be reimbursed for that. I had to spend several hundred more because of lack of and shitty insurance. It will also cost some time and stress. 

How physically demanding the job is depends on where you go and what you do. I will say maybe. My job was not physically demanding in itself, but living in the sahara and dealing with 125 degree temps for three months on end when you can't afford a fridge or AC (or live in a remote village where there is no power) can be stressful. However some volunteers end up in a tropical paradise where they can spend 4 hours a day lounging on a beach drinking cold booze (My country was moderate muslim. Booze was not available to buy anywhere. I ended up brewing batches of brousse wine in old 5-gal veg-oil drums)

Generally student loans can be deferred, and you may be eligible for assistance in a masters program afterwards, plus non competitive eligibility for govt jobs if you complete your service.

As far as your choices, generally you can choice where you go, when you go, or what you do, but you only get to pick one. I said I wanted to go to Eastern Europe, but I insisted on being a computer guy or i would have to postpone service for a few years. I did end up as a techie, but was sent to saharan west africa. It ended up being a very enriching two years.

You will be paid a local living wage, which for me meant living comfortably on approx $200 a month. an additional 200 something gets put aside for a completion bonus. Stay the full two years you will get roughly $6000

And regarding the emotional toll, yeah. Probably. It depends on so much. I went a little batty living in isolation, but did well when transferred to a nearby small city.

From wikipedia:
&gt;Libertarian socialism is an ideology with diverse interpretations, though some general commonalities can be found in its many incarnations. Its proponents advocate a worker-oriented system of distribution that radically departs from capitalist economics (socialism).  They proposed that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the liberty of individuals and minimize concentration of power or authority (libertarianism).[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism)

From flag.blackened.net:
&gt;It is recognized that there are authoritarian systems and behavior, distinct from libertarian, or non-authoritarian ones. Since capitalism's early beginnings in Europe, and it's authoritarian trend of wage-slavery for the majority of people (working class) by a smaller, elite group (a ruling, or, capitalist class) who own the ""means of production"": machines, land, factories, there was a liberatory movement in response to capitalism known as ""Socialism"". In almost every case, the socialist movement has been divided along authoritarian, and libertarian lines. The anarchists on the libertarian side, and the Jacobins, Marxists, Leninists, Stalinists, and reformist state-socialists on the authoritarian side.[2](http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libsoc.html)

From the letters of [Bartolomeo Vanzetti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanzetti):
&gt;After all we are socialists as the social-democrats, the socialists, the communists, and the I.W.W. are all Socialists. The difference -- the fundamental one -- between us and all the other is that they are authoritarian while we are libertarian; they believe in a State or Government of their own; we believe in no State or Government.[3](http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html)

Now whether or not you personally agree with libertarian socialists on the results of their proposals, I think it is very clear that they do not believe themselves to be advocating the ""sacrifice"" of the individual for the ""greater good"".  Rather, they are proposing that their form of socialism would maximize individual liberty.  This result may, indeed, turn out to be for the greater good, since a society in which individual liberties are maximized could be viewed as the greatest good for the greatest number, but this in itself hardly constitutes sacrifice of the individual.",1,t1_c0bn9o7,False,Anarchism,t5_2qh5j,[deleted],c0bn9o7,0

The human brain generally makes for a very biased and and quirky computer, especially when trying to understand massive interrelated and recursive systems like economics, and considering that each one lasts no longer than 75 years on average with no real way to download all the data from centuries gone by, the brain keeps gravitating to the same overly simplistic yet easy to understand model socialist models which seem to be price controls and government rationing. This sort of thing didn't work for Diocletian, it didn't work during feudalism when peasants were rationed their food, it didn't work for North Korea Cuba, Soviet Russia or any of its states. The fact that people can look around the world and see failed macro-socialists models, and and yet look at a non-functioning, non-private US model, declare it ""private"" and thus determine that the answer is a more pure socialist model, is what is absurd to me. 

This is inevitably countered by claiming that everyone else, including all of Europe, has a non-private yet vaguely defined ""Universal Health Care"" system in place which we should some how model, which I have two issues with. 

1) I find this argument to be highly semantic and a bit disingenuous. Again we do not have a free market system, and ours show many more similarities with some European systems than with a free market. Yet somehow, it is the European systems are touted as socialist universal health care, and thus the answer, but are really little different than ours. Americans in general just don't know, so I don;t blame the conservatives for falling into this trap, the conservatives think that Europe is socialist, when in reality we are more socialist than many of them, but I digress.

Take the Netherlands for example, [from their ministry of health webpage](http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/)

&gt;The system is a private health insurance with social conditions. 

First sentence, and all this time I thought we were the only industrialized nation... It pays not to listen to talking points and look into things for yourself.

&gt;The system is operated by private health insurance companies; the insurers are obliged to accept every resident in their area of activity. A system of risk equalisation enables the acceptance obligation and prevents direct or indirect risk selection.

Slight difference, won't reduce cost but increase it though.

The rest from Wikipedia:

&gt; All primary and curative care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from *private compulsory insurance*. .....For all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of *obligatory* health insurance, with private health insurance companies...

Sounds familiar... kind of like ours, but like with Mitt Romney running it.

&gt; Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the long term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation.

Medicare? Is that you?

&gt; Everyone earning less than a certain threshold income could make use of the public insurance system. However, anyone with income over that threshold was obliged to have private insurance instead.

And Medicaid shows up to the party!

&gt; ....the Dutch system provides a special opt-out clause.

Apparently the system is not so universal afterall.

Honestly with other than laws saying the insurers cannot reject anyone, unlike ours where we put that onus on the hospitals, this is pretty damn closer to ours than the British Scheme, yet it is magically ""Universal"" and they have progresse to a social system, unlike the United States, which you claim is remotely operated on a free market. Again my point here is that, we are remarkably like many of the systems that are inplace in europe, far more so than being on a free market. I request you not put the blame for our situation on that fact, I certainly don't

2) As I noted earlier, all systems I look at induce inflation at higher rates than for other sectors. No matter what else the current state, or how much those countries spend per percent of GDP. This is not sustainable.  Medical spending may be at 10% GDP now, but not in 10-20 years. Even the US was at 7% in the 80s. Looking at historical data suggests that these socialized and partly socialized (like ours) systems keep growing and growing, taking more and more taxpayer funds, or inducing inflation, all of which have been a characteristics of non health care related all social systems in the past.",1,t1_c0bnei9,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,redditer43,c0bnei9,0

If your question is; Can a new form of protectionism help us save our own markets? The answer is quite doubtful - generally trade barriers don't work in the long run and history has been replete with examples of why. 

The most effective way of restoring our own markets its via currency reform. As long as emerging nations can effectively game the currency markets (set a fixed price exchange that is artificially low), then these problems will persist.

However, fixing our money would require real hard work....while coming up with a ""Cap n Trade"" is relatively easy (but only fixes the symptoms not the cause of the problem).

OF FORTRESS EUROPE!

2022 -A new European order
Robot guards patrolling the border
Cybernetic dogs are getting closer and closer
Armoured cars and immigration officers
A burning village in Kosovo
You bombed it out now you're telling us go home
Machine guns strut on the cliffs of Dover
Heads down people look out! we're going over
Burnin up! can we survive re-entry
Past the mines and the cybernetic sentries
Safe european homes built on wars

Keep banging

We got a right , know the situation
We're the children of globalisation
No borders only true connection
Light the fuse of the insurrection
This generation has no nation
Grass roots pressure the only solution
We're sitting tight
Cos assylum is a right
Put an end to this confusion
Dis is a 21st century Exodus
Dis is a 21st century Exodus

Burnin' up can we survive re-entry
Past the landmines and cybernetic sentries
Plane, train, car , ferry boat or bus
The future is bleeding coming back at us

The problems being discussed in the report which come down to the the unpredictability of wind energy and the extra cost due to the reduced economies of scale for non-renewable energy plant. Note that tides are predictable but they may not coincide with demand.

However, this seems to ignore the dynamics of the power market which divides the days into one hour slots and the capabilities of plants. Gas is wonderful because you can bring a Gas plant up to speed in minutes. Nuclear is the worst, you really don't want to spin-up the plant in less than an hour or so. So the report suggests that you would end up with big spikes.

So what do with the spikes? Well there is already a power connection between the UK and French Grid systems as well as one planned with the Nethlands (http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/interconnectors/). There are a lot of continental Europeans who like to pay a premium for 'green energy'.

What to do with the rest, well one popular method is to sell power 'overshoots' to high usage industries. Aluminium comes to mind here. As for the problem of thermal stations, it really comes down to UK power generation techniques - large stations in the middle of nowhere offering economies of scale but with associated transmission costs and thermal wastage.

Yep that last one is interesting. In many other countries they still have smaller thermal plants for the cities. Not only does the plant provide power, but it sells of the waste heat by providing district heating/hot-water. This means the plant isn't just selling power, it is also selling thermal energy which helps justify its existence when there are insufficient power customers.",2,t1_c0bngl9,False,energy,t5_2qhkd,hajk,c0bngl9,0

Implementing traditional security protocols there was out of the question, the biggest devices run zigbee but I target the tiniest ones like [mica2](http://www.xbow.com/products/Product_pdf_files/Wireless_pdf/MICA2_Datasheet.pdf).


At the moment the ""standard"" for security is [TinySec](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/tinysec-sensys04.pdf). I have designed+implemented my own solution which compares well with it. I tried to improve the security provision without any significant difference in energy consumption.

I'm using [TEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm) for encryption which I think fits much better than SkipJack or AES-128 and it provides very nice security features (128 bit keys, 8 bytes block size, very resistant to cryptanalysis etc). I'm also providing a key management scheme (TinySec does not solve that problem at all) and the whole thing is nicely designed with its MACs etc.

As for the DSLs, the think is that I'm confused by what is available to the consumer at present and for the future.

As far as I know the aDSL2+ modems get up to 24Mbps and the next technology is not consumer-orientated. I'm looking for some sort of survey paper that would analyse technologies and how they perform over various distances etc. I'd also like to know some more info on how to fine tune a DSL line (I've spent quite some time trying to get me 24Mbps line to sync at 19MBps, originally it was syncing at 16 or so).

Eight people of race A converge upon Locality 1, a locality they are not from. They attack a gathering compost mostly of people of race B, call those among the attacked that are race A that do not support them ""race traitors"", and demand that they leave, because they are in a space that these interlopers of race A have deemed only to be for those of their race.

I really can't call that anything but racism.

This is really a step down from Smack a White Boy original, which, while it had a very race-baiting name, was attacking a Stalinist party. Is APOC just going to cut a swath through anything that isn't POC in anarchist/leftist politics? They've already called Food Not Bombs out as a ""white supremacist organization"", and made overtures that look like the plan on disrupting that convergence -- what's going to be after that?

This whole thing is just an e-fucking-normous clusterfuck on so many levels.

* In the past, APOC has derided CrimethInc for having convergences in the woods or places where POC conceivably cannot easily get to. Now, APOC is deriding CrimethInc for having a convergence in a city in an APOC-claimed POC space. Does that mean APOC wants CrimethInc convergences to happen in the suburbs or something? If neutral space is bad, and POC space is bad, that honestly seems like the only option. Of course, APOC has already made clear that the only non-POC space in their book is Europe. Oddly enough, I don't believe there were any First Nation folk in the group that ""evicted"" CrimethInc.
* APOC is totally ignoring any class analysis of gentrification. There are a great many white Pittsburgh anarchists, including many of the Convergence organizers, that have a lot of trouble dealing with rising rents and gentrification. APOC ignores and even mocks this, claiming that only POC are negatively affected by gentrification, and any non-POC existing in a POC space is an example of gentrification. Furthermore, a great many APOC organizers are incredibly class privileged, but APOC seems to ignore this spectrum of privilege in its analysis, as well as nearly every other spectrum of privilege (I'm getting this impression from *An Open Letter To White Progressives*, which, since it was read at the CrimthInc attack, I'm assuming is APOC-endorsed. Correct me if I'm wrong).
* Philly APOC (the group that actually attacked CrimethInc) claimed that Pittsburgh APOC had asked them to come. This is a lie. There is not organized Pittsburgh APOC. Nobody in their raiding party was from Pittsburgh. 
* APOC claimed that the convergence was in a POC neighborhood (Garfield). It was actually in an Italian neighborhood (Bloomington, I think, but I could be getting the name wrong). I've heard somewhat unsubstantiated reports (though from sources I trust) that after/before the CrimthInc action, APOC did an action protesting gentrification at an art gallery -- that was one of the only POC-owned art galleries in the neighbourhood. They also told a pizza shop to ""get out of the neighbourhood"" -- even though it had been there since the 60's, and was one of the only places that delivered in Garfield (the POC neighbourhood nearby). APOC repeatedly has claimed that the community was not consulted and didn't want CrimthInc there, but the neighbourhood has a 30+ year history of hosting radical spaces, and most of the locals that CrimethInc folk talked to were supportive. APOC seems to just be claiming whatever is convenient with almost complete disregard for fact.

This was just a pointless action. APOC admittedly had no desire for dialogue or for anything constructive to come out of this -- the only suggestions offered were ""go back to Europe"", and their only stated goal was to disrupt the Convergence. It should be noted that they were clearly only trying to ""disrupt"" rather than ""evict"", since this action happened the day before the last day of the convergence. If they had wanted their ""eviction"" to mean anything to the community, they would have done it earlier. The way they timed it, however, allows them to claim success for ""evicting"" CrimethInc, since everyone was planning on leaving the day after their ""eviction"".

Well, if you're buying private insurance, that's what you're doing. Healthy people, who pay premiums but don't require a lot of health care, are effectively paying for the care of the unhealthy people who buy insurance from the same company.

&gt;Just because some, or even a majority of people are willing to hand over their money in return for government run health care doesn't mean I should have to.

No legislation in either the U.S. Senate or the House has proposed ""government run healthcare"" as you call it. All plans involve the private delivery of health care, paid for with government-provided insurance that is funded through taxation. As to your feeling that you don't feel you should be required to participate in a government-provided insurance program, why should I be required to participate in a society in which health care is a for-profit business just because a majority of people are willing to hand over ever-increasing amounts of money to the private insurance companies?

&gt;It's my basic human right not to have my money extorted even if it's to save someone else's life.

You want to go back to the state of nature? Fine. But this is a civilized society and we all must contribute to the collective good. We can either compete with each other for health care, or we can collectively support each other's well-being. And unless you're super wealthy, do you really think you'd pay more in taxes under a public insurance plan than you do now for private insurance?

&gt;Some European countries take 50% in taxes and they're still finding that it's unsustainable.

Well, in America we don't tax the rich nearly that much and it's completely unsustainable. The national debt is soaring.

In terms of how sociology folks got entangled - it is all about research funding. The UK government started to encourage cross-departmental research. Since sociology depts have limited research funding, they started to suck off CS departments by pretending they had something to offer that was relevant to CS. There were many ""research initiatives"" that had (in my opinion) eye-wateringly fluffy titles. In fact, it was not just sociologists. Many leeches from other depts wriggled their way in, with the claim that the cross-departmental collaboration would ""enrich"" the CS dept.

One great example is a professor from the department of history who decided CS was overrun with people inventing new things, and the focus should switch to spending more time ""respecting and studying the past"". I asked him why I would want to do research into paper-tape and punched-card readers, when there were still many new and more important challenges ahead. The head of department stifled a giggle, but then told me I had to show more respect to the ""experience of our new colleague"".

Another example, one of the CS professors fancied a woman in the ""librarianship"" dept and somehow got her a position doing user interface research. Since she knew nothing about user interfaces, the research soon veered off into showing pages from children's books on computers. The ""added value"" was that the text could be presented in multiple languages.

Alas, they couldn't get this working (not surprising as none of the researchers were technical) and so narrowed it down to only showing children's books written in one language: welsh. This narrow focus meant they didn't have to do much, and also meant that one of the unqualified researchers could remain on the project since he had ""specific skills"" to offer (he spoke welsh).

None of it actually advanced knowledge as far as I could see. I am sure any decent programmer could have done in one month what this team did in three years.

Oh - I almost forget - in addition to sucking up plenty of UK research funds, this team then paired up with a couple of other universities from different EU countries so they could apply for large EU cross-border funding. Since the EU was looking to strengthen ties across countries, this money was handed over (and wasted) readily. The universities they tied up with seemed to be doing quite different research - but it didn't stop them flying around the EU to visit each other and come up with (breathtaking) reports showing how the collaboration was working.

In the meantime, plenty of real computer scientists in the department were struggling to get funding - and had a harder time attracting research students (because their research involved hard work rather than simply playing).",3,t1_c0bnplt,False,programming,t5_2fwo,springy,c0bnplt,0

So do you see many, say, Europeans or South Americans or Russians, or Chinese, or Japanese, etc. with circumcised penises?

No. Most of the world views the circumcision of a healthy boy as repugnant.

&gt; The dogs you see with cropped ears generally [wouldn't have had] the health issues you're talking about. And the first ""advantage"" for ear cropping, not being bitten by another dog is a bit of a stretch don't you think? Unless your dogs routinely engage in illegal fights.

**Your comment can be mirrored for circumcision**:

The males you see with circumcised penises generally wouldn't have had the health issues you've alluded to. Medically cited ""advantages"" for circumcision, such as protection from STDs, is a bit of a stretch, don't you think? Unless your young child is engaging in sexual activity without a condom. After all, according to an [11 year study in New Zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract), circumcision makes absolutely no difference in the risk to STDs in a developed country, and [a recent mathematical model](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490F-44F5-AC5E-17893A3764BA.asp) found circumcision to be unimpressive to the point of being useless in curbing HIV in South Africa.

How about phimosis? Genuine phimosis occurs in [1% of intact men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis#Incidence).

How about urinary tract infections? [Girls have a 6x rate of infection than intact boys in the first 6 years of life](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/), [*Israeli* studies](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/) indicate that circumcision increases the risk of UTI in the week of healing, and there's not much of a difference between circumcised and intact adults. At best, [100 boys would need to be circumcised to prevent 1 UTI](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/circumcision.htm), and UTIs are quickly and cheaply solved with an oral antibiotic, anyway.

How about hygiene? It's harder for women to keep themselves clean than men; there's lots of feminine hygiene products used around the world, but male hygiene products? Not so much (besides a shower---not even soap is really necessary). This one is just nonsense.

Penile cancer risk much reduced, at least? [Nope](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/). It's extremely rare anyway.

At least women get protected from cervical cancer? [Even Israeli scientists dismiss that claim](http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar03feb-11.pdf).

What many people think of when they hear socialism is state socialism, which many radical left socialists would consider state capitalism rather than true socialism.  This is the view I take as well.  I'm not going to get into a no true Scotsman type argument, it may very well be that advocates of state systems truly believe it is the best way to bring about socialism, but many socialists believe that, whatever the intention, state socialism will always become state capitalism.

What we have in the West is basically a hybrid of market capitalism and state capitalism; a pure market capitalist system is probably impossible, and exists only in the dreams of libertarians and anarcho-capitalists.

Within capitalism, there are advantages and disadvantages to using the state or the market, and which is more effective depends on the particular industry.  The market alone does not deal effectively with externalities, but the market does deal better with applying new technologies and improving productivity.  Every developed nation began its development with heavy state intervention, which is necessary to establish basic infrastructure, education levels, etc. needed before a market system can really work.

From my perspective, and the view of many leftists, capitalism itself, however, is the problem, not simply the market as a means of implementing capitalism.  Capitalism itself, in state or market forms, can be generalized as the idea that the good of society is defined in a utilitarian way around maximization of production and capital accumulation; that is, capitalism sees capital itself, rather than a broader conception of the social good, as the predominant interest.  This same fixation on production is present in both liberalized market capitalist systems, but was also there in Stalinist ""Communist"" states which used central planning to develop.  We see this reflected today in virtually all political debates, where it's never enough to justify a position as simply it's morally right, or just, etc. but where everything must be justified by a utiliatarian logic according to the needs of capital.  An obvious example is eduction; education should be regarded as a good in itself, necessary to help a person to understand the world, be a good citizen, be a part of the intellectual traditions of their civilization.  Today, however, it's simply a form of job training.

What's the alternative to capitalism?  I couldn't give an exact blueprint of what a socialist society ought to look like, but in general terms it would be a more democratic form of society where the economy – whether using market or state forms of organization, or some other form – would always be ultimately subordinated to actual social needs expressed through democratic institutions.

There are several reasons we don't have this already, despite having formally democratic institutions.  One is the nation-state system, which forces states into competition for military advantage, which therefore often requires placing the economic basis for the military above other needs (or, for smaller and weaker countries, placing economic usefulness to a powerful patron state above other needs).  That's basically what went wrong with Communism – Stalin advocated ""socialism in one country,"" abandonment of internationalism, and it followed from that assumption that the USSR needed to industrialize as rapidly as possible, at whatever human cost, to gain the means to defend itself; Mao's China took this even further into an even more conservative, xenophobic, rabid nationalism, which of course has now become a largely market-capitalist state.  This is also part of why Europe has done better than the US in terms of developing a welfare state; since World War II, the US basically took over responsibility for the security interests of the developed capitalist world, which allowed the other developed capitalist states to devote more resources to social spending rather than military spending.

Another, of course, is ideological, which gets into a very complex area which I cannot do proper justice to here.  The problem is not only the vulgar fetish for the market, but the more general ideology of capitalism common in both market and statist systems.  Part of this is that, with the decline of religion as a serious, politically significant ideology in most parts of the world, there's an idea that we can have a form of state and society which is somehow morally neutral, above any particular culture, etc.  Once we adopt that idea, it's a short step to the notion that common social aims should be defined in the most minimalistic and ultilitarian way possible.  In practice, however, capitalism is not morally neutral; it tolerates different cultures by distorting them into something merely aesthic.  The more we bring in the state, the more we get the discipline of law and bureaucracy; but the more we use the market, the more we get equally ruthless market discipline, which forces people to conform in order to successfully compete, and punishes even more mercilessly through exclusion those who do not conform.

Finally, another is the nature of property and the actual, objective political power which always necessarily follows from control – whether through private ownership or through the state – of the productive means of society which people depend upon.  The obvious recent example, of course, was the bailouts; lost in the debate over whether or not failing private corporations should be bailed out at taxpayer expense was the more fundamental question: why are such vital areas of the economy, such as major financial institutions, controlled at all by private profit-seeking owners with little or no accountability to the public?  But those who control the institutions, public or private, which control vital aspects of the economy, are always able to translate that into political influence.  That's one major reason I don't by the ""small government"" libertarian line; in practice, so long as capitalism exists, the owners and controllers of capital will possess enough political influence to force the government to socialize their costs and risks, while profit continues to be privatized.  Similarly, we see the enormous propaganda campaign in the US by the private insurance industry to protect the very profitable status quo.  Even if you get rid of more overt means of corporate influence, such as campaign contributions, capital can still exercize influence through threats of divestment, layoffs, and capital flight.  There's also, of course, the media problem; which actually gives a good example of the false dichotomy of market vs. state.  It was the deregulation of the media in service of market principles during the Clinton era which allowed the consolidation of media ownership by a few owners; and it was in part because of that stifling of diversity among the media and its control by major multinational corporations with other interests that the media was extremely tepid and submissive towards the Bush administration during his first term, most egregiously going into the Iraq War.  So, in other words, deregulation and the ""market"" helped to create a media even more compliant to the state.

Ok, that was long, and I'm sure even other leftists will disagree with some parts of that, but that's basically my view.",3,t1_c0bnumy,False,DebateIt,t5_2r2rb,[deleted],c0bnumy,0

Yes, we have UPS, Fedex to compete with the government mail, but in the early days of mail companies were being formed and bankrupt on a regular basis. It made sense economically to have a guaranteed service that isn't going to go anywhere so that other businesses could build around that utility. Theoretically nowadays you could remove the USPS and the FedEx/UPS could take up the slack but that wasn't the case in the past. The internet of course is the best example of how a common utility has allowed other businesses to thrive. 
If health-care was something that businesses no longer had to worry about the potential for small businesses to thrive is greatly increased (yes potentially on the backs of larger businesses because someone has to pay for the healthcare......).

Ours (we use European honeybees) don't like foreign intruders in their hive, biological or otherwise, and will work to clean out even a dirty box.  You can even get them to control mites on their own by sprinkling powdered sugar in a hive, which is what organic beekeepers do if I'm not mistaken.    

IPM is applied in some senses, even if the beekeeper isn't educated in IPM practices.  Scouting (the first step in any IPM program) happens regularly.  Diseased hives are isolated from healthy hives.  Hives are kept as healthy as possible to deter pests and diseases.  However, we take preventative measures when it comes to mites.  We use a miticide, but it is not a spray.  Basically it's a systemic pesticide we soak into small cardboard strips.  It isn't potent enough to kill bees, but it releases a gas that will kill mites.  The bees keep away from the mite strips in the beginning, but once the pesticide has dissipated and since they are hygienic and don't like intruders in their hives, eventually they'll tear up and remove the cardboard.  

I think beekeepers adapt to modern technologies and techniques readily enough.  Every beekeeper I know subscribes to beekeeping journals, and they are usually investigating all sorts of new technologies and techniques.  As with any agriculturalist, getting beekeepers to adopt something new takes demonstrating a very clear advantage over their current practices.  That this doesn't happen often is more a testament to the practices that the industry has developed than it is to their lack of forward thinking.

UK system is known to be one of the worst in Europe, at least one of the most expensive ones for the customer.

The limit on which things the Social Security covers (in Spain) does not depend on the extra years of life it will give you. It's usually decided by the government, and there are usually frequent modifications to **add more** things that get covered by it, and that didn't before. Obviously the cost of the treatment is the most important factor to decide, but there are also other things that are put on the balance to make a decission.

Plus, you still have the option of going for private insurance if you want. The difference here being, that private companies have to compete with the *free* Social Security, so they either give a good value for money, or they're out of business.

Remember Social Security doesn't have ANY marketing costs or anything of the kind, as it's free. So the costs are REALLY low, and private companies have to keep up with that - and they do pretty well. Just so that you can make a picture of how messed up the US system is.

If you want facts, here you go (I'll compare to Spain, as this is where I live):

* WHO Chart rating the health care systems in the world

Spain: 7th

US: 37th (you're down there with Costa Rica or a dictatorship like Cuba).

* Performance chart of the world's health care systems

Spain: 6th

US: 72nd (with the likes of Bosnia, Argentina, Buthan, Nicaragua, or... Iraq!!)

* Healthy life expentacy chart from the WHO

Spain: 5th

US: 24th

* Chart showing the COSTS of the health care system in each country

US: 1st

Spain: 15th

Despite being one of the worst health care systems in the world, it is, by far, the most expensive one.

I find abortion distasteful.  I know that sometimes it is the best option available.  Still, that embryo would be a child.  I'm not for murdering doctors or even making it illegal.  If there are no major medical complications, it is wrong to snuff out life to avoid the consequences of a choice.

1 Stay in school, do your homework even if you're smart enough to know everything. Your teachers will probably mark you down for not doing the work even though they full well know you're smarter than everyone else. It's worth it.

2 Study what you are interested in, passionately. Get through what you're not interested in and don't let that get in the way of what you are interested in.

3 Go out for a walk, bring your ipod and some good music. I like Bjork and some of her stuff just puts a huge smile on my face while going down the street. Find different places to go, or take a sketch pad and draw the woods or houses.

4 Be outgoing, definitely talk to people and build your social skills. People are fun, they do not hate you as much as you may think they do.

5 You're perfectly good looking, not fat, not ugly, not short, etc etc. People really don't care so far as you're not annoying.

6 Be happy, you live longer. Problems go away, realize that and moreso try to come up with and enact solutions quickly.

7 Don't play too many games. They won't kill you but once you're to the point that you're not even interested in the game, you're just playing in boredom, then stop. Read too, but read only what you like by authors that intrigue you. If 20 pages of a book doesn't make you want more, return it for another. For science, I like Michio Kaku and Richard Feynman.

8 Be healthy. Excercise, but do something you like or intrigues you. Do not just excercise but challenge yourself, get goals, etc. Make it fun but challenging.

9 Use technology to help you. For example, I keep notecards around everywhere and write down everything that I want, want to do, have to do, etc. Organize these ideas in some spare time, use google calendar and tasks to organize them and accomplish them. Find everything you want to improve in yourself, think of ways to do it, and do it.

10 Do not let technology stop you. A lot of times the prescribed or general way to do something is not that appealing or fun or is lacking just the right settings. Find another service or find a way around your hesitations. Make things simple and suited for you, otherwise look for ways to solve them.

11 Eat healthy, this helps your brain work at most efficient, makes you happy, prolongs life and reduces medical costs and is generally cheaper. Also eat less.

12 Stimulate your brain. Reddit is a start, but do some hardcore subject exploration too. Something out of a class but as in depth as you would learn in class

13 Have fun, do not be afraid to have fun and enjoy what you love to do. I love music, it's my hobby. I guess have a hobby. Spend a reasonable amount of time and leisure on it. Actually, do this instead of leisure, or moreso instead of tv.

14 Interact socially. Really, build some best friends. I have around 5 bestest best friends and around that are another 20 people I am terribly close with. Self actualized people statistically have fewer friends and they are closer friends. Be nice to people you don't like but don't waste time on them

15 Look up anything you don't know as far as it keeps your interest and intrigue

16 Look for role models. People who live their life in such a way that you hope to import their traits into yours. Look for them in more than just one field, in science, politics, culture, technology, etc. Look at these peoples lives and see what they do to help them be successful.

17 Don't smoke or do drugs. This is definitely a personal one for me. Cigarettes are plain a waste of money I don't have. Drugs even moreso. The time it takes to build the social empire of drugs is a drain I cannot afford against the things I want to do, especially because I do not find those people stimulating or heading anywhere with their lives. That is not to say people who do drugs cannot be successful, or that drugs are bad. I find them not in line with my personal interests 

18 Find people who are interested and stimulated by the same things as you, and use them to propel your own understandings and interests. Just because someone is not interested in the same things as your does not mean they cannot stimulate you, moreso they can even challenge you. I guess find people who are deeply interested and cultivate them to do research in the areas you are not interested in. This sounds like using people... it's not meant to be. For example I friends who are interested in comics and classical literature which I am not. On the other hand, listening to them discuss it is very deep and also lets me find out about the important things and ideas going on in those fields.

19 In terms of love, do what you want whether that be monogamous or more open ended, but only do what you want. Don't worry about social pressures and be happy. Also do not worry if it doesn't come, especially for the more monogamous end, people under 25 are much less interested in relationships and much more interested in sex. Don't be too prude but don't pass up a good chance. Don't worry about being awkward, the worst they can do is not like it and you can learn a world of information.

20 Ask for help. If you want to know how to do something, ask a friend that may know. Google it. Go to or call the office and ask how the program works. Ask, figure out how the system works, and then solve your problem.

21 Be realistic about reality. The jews don't control the media, racism is stupid, there is no cure all fat loss program in 15 minutes. If you don't know something, realize that, look around, form opinions, and get information from many sources. Test what you can. When you do know something, argue for it and see if you really know it and find out what you didn't know.

22 Be open to discussion. The worst thing is to discuss something with someone and they tell me they don't care, or they worse yet they are too sensitive to the topic to want to discuss it or close minded. For example my ex always told me I was too serious. I countered I had a playful affront but considered everything very seriously, whereas he has a negative demeanor and does not thing about much very deeply. He refused to even try to counter my argument.

23 Explore the world. Sometimes economically this is not possible, but at least make trips to the closest parks and cities. Some of the best things of my formative years was going across america and europe. Explore things with more than just the mind but physically, such as playing in the woods, building legos, or exploring displays at museums.

24 Share your enthusiasm. Those people worth keeping around want to hear it and will teach you something back.

25 Save up. Don't get a job if your parents are rich enough, it's a waste of time in menial service although it gave me great people skills. Save a significant portion of any money you get (25%+), spend less on eating out and let your parents pay for your food (or invite your friends to a dinner you cook, this really isn't something my peers were mature enough for until college though). Save this money for the interest you can get as well as a safety net. Do get a job if it will help your career or studies (internship, lab job, etc)

26 If someone is angry at you, it doesn't matter. Get what you need from them (or if a job, let them get what they need from you), and try to make your time together as pleasant as possible. Keep your cool, count to 10. I was at the airport and I missed my flight. My mom wanted to yell at the person helping me bc of the lines, I just wanted her to book me onto the next flight. There was nothing that woman could do about the lines, if she was that powerful to control lines at an airport, my god the airport was not utilizing their resources properly.

27 Your parents love you (hopefully) and want you to succeed. Any problems they give you are their own shortsightedness or farsightedness. Take their advice you know is true but don't want to listen to, and ignore their demands that you know are getting in your way. Don't lie to them unless it would get in the way of your goals or restrict you, ie don't tell them about the sex and drugs if they are terribly conservative. Ask them for help too.

28 Make mistakes. If you are not sure about something, assess it's risk to damage you in the long term. Don't burn big things down, do play with toothpicks and candles safely. Do try yoga even if it's too spiritual for your tastes, don't expose yourself indecently at work, etc

29 A friend is not someone who tries to coerce you to do things you don't want to do, moreso if they are damaging to yourself. A friend is someone who shows you the world and brings the best of their experiences to the table for you to share.

30 Habits are the biggest bitches in the world. Make good habits now, and work to correct all the ones you don't want, that is a job that takes many years.

31 Life is enjoyable, forget the negative, reinforce the positive, and test all the things you thought were negative again. You don't stop maturing until 25. I am constantly finding myself liking new foods, new genres of music, and many other things I grew up not liking. I am also realize how little I truly like some of the things I try to hold dear from my childhood.

The existing demand of carbon credits in Europe proves this- there are companies in places like Russia, India and China working on projects to reduce GHG emissions by all kinds of means - from the very large scale - like fixing hundreds of kilometers of gas pipelines (methane is a GHG) to using agricultural waste to fuel boilers.

That's per watt *peak*, which doesn't include the capacity factor -- and that's what my whole damn post is *about*.

&gt; Nuclear power costs 5-7 cents per kilowatt and once delivered it costs significantly more pushing up to 11+ cents per kilowatt making it much more expensive than wind and coal. The most important part is nuclear costs are only projected to go up faster while wind, geothermal, and solar very stable costs over time. They require no fuel, no safety concerns and no waste storage. Just imagine if you factor the cost of storing nuclear waste for 100 thousand to millions of years.

5-7 cents per kilowatt sounds way lower than what nuclear costs to build (about $2.33 per watt, as I calculated). Maybe you meant per kilowatt-hour? In which case the cost is about 5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour in total, as you said. Once you've amortized off the cost of construction, of course, the price goes down to less than 2 cents per kWh. This has happened at most of the older nuclear plants in the US, which is why they're such cash cows for the companies that own them.

And how are the costs going to go up over time? Nuclear energy is remarkably resistant to fluctuations in fuel costs; if anything, nuclear will get cheaper as the next-generation reactors start coming into more widespread use.

&gt; So when the oceans rise and our nuclear waste facilities leak... will nuclear really be the cheapest option ? Will radiating our costs turn out to be better than investing in geothermal ?

Hint: you can move nuclear waste if the oceans start rising.

&gt; Most important waste storage can only increase in price[...]

Why is this?

&gt; [...] and thus the price of nuclear energy will always be rising while urarnum sources diminish and projected rates already suggest even at today's rates we will run out of Uranium in 200 years or so.

Conventional waste reprocessing can extend that a lot, while raising the cost per kilowatt-hour of nuclear energy only very slightly. Or use it in breeder reactors; there are several under development. Or use thorium; it can last a *long* time, and it doesn't produce plutonium.

But hey, you know what? In ten or twenty years this discussion will have resolved itself one way or the other; China and India are going forward with nuclear in a big way, and the US and Europe are betting the farm on renewables (backed up, of course, by good ol' fossil fuels).

Arabic is a tough one...colloquial Arabic varies widely among countries; so much so that some speakers from different countries cannot clearly understand each other.  Hence the variety known as Koranic or Classical Arabic, which is very high status and shared by most countries in the middle east.

The 'myth of monolingualism' is that a country should have one language and one culture which all share.  But there is not one...*not one*...nation in the history of time which has been monolingual.  

It is also worth considering the difference between language and dialect.  We have a construct of a language called 'Chinese'.

It was a pleasure to meet you in person in Pittsburgh in April 2008. Having your signature on the margin of my voter's registration card has stirred up an innumerable amount of conversations about you, your policies, and your philosophies.

While these days, I find myself more likely to talk on your economic policies, it is you foreign policy brain I'd like to pick.

Often when I ""get into it"" with folks who are wholeheartedly against any withdrawal from the bases in foreign countries, I hit a road block when it comes to national defense. I tend to deliver a ""pull them all home, unconditionally, over time"" solution, while my opponent warns that withdrawing from any key position, especially those in Europe, would leave us without ""jumping-off points"" for training and possible engagements and ""early warning systems"" which we may or may not also use to warn our allies in the event of an impending attack.

The true believer of your (and the forefathers) foreign policy in me, as well as the arguably brave American, wants to say, ""It's not our right to be there, and we shouldn't be there unless asked, welcome, and probably compensated."" However, I do understand the opposite point that, if we were to have no American military presence--even welcome--in any other country, we could leave ourselves open to a surprise attack which could have easily been prevented or mitigated.

The UK has a number of set aside limits, one of which is that it gets to make its own call in this regard.  So when the EU deemed Hamas a terrorist organization the UK took a lead from how it dealt with the IRA and Sinn Fein and differentiated between the political party and the terrorist al-qassam brigade.  Australia followed suit.  Germany and France both showed a sympathy for the UK's line but weren't afforded the same ability and had to go with the collective EU line.  If you'll note the two links of the respective recognised terrorist groups both cite ""Hamas’s Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades"" differentiating between them and the political wing.  The Brigades are recognised as a terrorist group, Hamas itself is not.  It is the same process which persuaded Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and the IRA council to agree to disarmament and to pursue a diplomatic solution. 

(2)  No, Hamas was formed much later - but if the circumstances leading to their formation had not been in place i.e. peace and mutual acceptance, nor would it have had reason to be formed later.  It is hardly absurd to say that Israel would have been happy in 1967 if it were offered peace and acceptance.  HAMAS IS SAYING THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT NOW.  What is absurd is saying that Israel would have been happy back in '67 but now there is a Hamas in 2009 that the same agreement cannot now be reached even though Hamas is willing on those exact terms.

(3)  Israel did break the ceasefire on November 4th 2008. It was a ceasefire that Hamas had requested December 2007 and been refused.  6 months later they got it - the understanding was that in return for them keeping and marshaling a ceasefire trade restrictions in both directions would be eased.  This did not happen but Hamas still observed its terms launching no attacks and arresting for the first time any [outside forces trying to launch from Gaza](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL103182282).  The Israeli cabinet convened on November 4th and air strikes and a ground incursion was authorized killing several.  Israel broke the ceasefire - it then cited Hamas rocket attacks as a reason for launching Operation Cast Lead even though Israeli intelligence has since confirmed that during the ceasefire [no Hamas rockets were fired at Israel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfFMZ7Y-s_c).  The infrastructure of those that had been trying to prevent rocket attacks, along with civilian residential areas (according to Israeli soldier and international testimony), was then targeted.

My part of my insurance premiums for my family works out to 1.5% of our household yearly income.  This is paid tax free.  My insurance then covers 90% of their pre-negotiated reimbursement rates with doctors, medical labs, durable medical equipment companies, etc.  I pay the remaining 10%.  My kid's well child visits are covered 100% and all vaccinations are covered 100%  My wife had several visits to the doctor leading up to her surgery.  Each of these visits included lab work.  My part of the bill averaged around $11 per visit.  If any of my family requires hospitalization all costs are covered 100%.  There are no lifetime limits to coverage and my maximum out of pocket per year is $500 per person or $1000 for the entire family.

I have only heard of one case of our insurance company declining a claim from one of my co-workers.  This is because he went to a specialized treatment facility outside of our area instead of one in our local area which was more inexpensive.  Our company nurse called the insurance company on his behave and explained that the treatment facility he chose offered a particular treatment that the local facility did not.  The claim was approved less than 24 hours after my co-worker received the initial denial.  

Also I have a health flexible spending account which means I have money taken directly out of my salary and set aside in an account where it can be used only for medical expenses.  The benefit of this is that I don't have to pay taxes on this money.  Out of this account I pay any part of the medical bills insurance does not cover, prescription drug co-pays, and for some over the counter medications such as my allergy medication. 

Speaking of drug costs, my drug co-pays are $5 for generics drugs and $10 for non-generics.  Also some non-prescription drugs are covered if I have an order from my doctor for them.  For instance the over the counter allergy medicine I take would normally cost me more than $10 for a 30 day supply but since I have a script form my doctor the insurance company picks up part of the tab and I pay $10 for a 30 day supply.   Which really lasts more than 30 days since I don't have to use it everyday.

All you need do to see how specious an argument he's made is to look at some other recent BBC articles, like [this one][1] or [this][2] or [this one][3] and [so on][4] and [so forth][5].  This is a needless attempt to smear the credibility of a news organization that doesn't share West's ideological bias, and the more you defend it, the less serious I'm inclined to take you.

you're in the field? thank you for indulging me.


to clear up misconceptions: in other fields, such as engineering computers have not revolutionised them by simply being magical monolothic knowledge gods. 

human ingenuity has simply utilized and in some cases subverted the tools available to do more work and deliver insights in away that can be replicated by other parties.

e.g. word processing making publishing easier. electronic journals making citation and research less time consuming.

hypothetical scenarios possible in present day would be constructing detailed models of European historical census data, including births, deaths through the many sources that historians have methodically and diligently put together, for whatever reason the historian saw fit.


once that HUGE task if it is possible, is done it would be a resource for all interested researchers and so on.
maybe this is impossibly stupid or something everyone has already done and has very little utility in your field apart from the initial cool factor .  i am not a historian.

the computer would not give up a magical answer for any question.


and as pure data can tell stories, when interpreted via  statistical analysis, eg in historical epidemiology, it is still dry. Fields such as history have given a human face to events and trends in human history, where an oral, present witness would be long dead, through very meticulous, very real but very special detective work. the kind we would ascribe to fictional Geniuses like Sherlock Holmes but for very unglamorous  findings because thats how an academic field works.

again maybe alot of data does not exist for obvious reasons.


 in this, example the work of history might stay the same but for some fancy tools. a


other applications include applying social networking models  to [facebook-style] analysis to tribal settlement data and cross referenced with detailed databases containing DNA from ancient humans and modern humans . this is probably being done ]because if i thought of it it's obvious.]  but not collaboratively i suspect but academic research is slow by design, to eliminate perpetuating myths.

some  still ""unknown"" languages might have a chance of being cracked by a historian-mathematician with enough time on his hands and the right tools. maybe even AI?
 
maybe it sounds a little Adam West Batman /BAT computer, but i thoroughly believe that existing technologies invented can greatly be utilised by many fields once they either learn these quite difficult things or they get easy to use like excel. 

one of my dreams is that one of the great inventions of historians would be a kind of VR- simulated fake time travel. 

[or even help with time travel. constructing simulations based around historical timelines to minimise contaminations. i have been told that scientists consider movie-style time travel impossible though so....]

If I were living in Israel I too would be worried about empowering a 1980s Hamas - they've certainly given Israel reason for concern but there are some facts that must be addressed if we are not to be backward looking.  Hamas seized power in Gaza.  When they did so they were told by the international community that they should pursue a democratic diplomatic approach **(1)** and renounce pursuing their goals through violence **(2)** and address their 1980s charter which called for no compromise with Israel **(3)**.  

A big ask for a 1980s Hamas...but it wasn't the 1980s anymore.  Like taking stepping-stones they allowed an election.  UN and EU observers monitored it and judged it fair.  Against some projections, Hamas won.  That squared away **(1)**

They have since requested, received, monitored and upheld their end of a ceasefire.  Let us not rewrite history - whatever we might feel about their previous actions and endeavours they *did not* break the ceasefire, they did arrest non-Hamas militants trying to break it and Israeli intelligence confirms that Hamas's militant wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, launched no rockets whilst the ceasefire held.  That accounts for **(2)**.

They have on multiple occasions said they would accept Israel **(3)**.  This calls for some explanation.  They have said that they will not recognise her but accept her.  Their justification for this is that they do not agree with how Israel came about, that it was formed on Palestinian land and that they were wronged.  For them to 'recognise' Israel would be to concede that Israel had a right to do what it did and they can't identify with this.  What they are willing to do is to say that whilst it was wrong in their eyes what happened - it never the less happened and they are now willing to accept that it happened, that the Israeli state is part of topography and the situation has moved on.  To this extent they have said they will accept Israel; to even work, trade and address her.  That they will denounce violence against her and marshal it, as they have already done.

Realistically if one recognises both sides have their own grievances you have to acknowledge that Hamas has moved on.  They're asked to show willingness to 1, 2 and 3 and they nail it.  Not to excuse past actions but if you don't extend trust when they show willing and keep their word, however difficult it may be,  then peace isn't an objective.  Peace means having to extend trust.  However:

• when Hamas became democratically elected - *they weren't invited to the Annapolis peace talks.*  

• when they kept to their end of the ceasefire - *Israel did not ease bilateral trade restrictions as previously agreed.*

• when they offered *again* to accept Israel on the eve of Operation Cast Lead - *the operation went ahead.*  


Hamas was vilified and the infrastructure which had stopped the very rockets which Cast Lead stated as justifying its incursion was targeted along with the residential areas of the people who had voted for the party.   If the argument of mistrust is now considered a valid one you're arguing for no peace, no resolution.  Certainly if rockets being in range of Israeli cities is cause for no peace then that is an argument for conquest, not peace.  Their range is not going to grow smaller - in fact I'm shuddering at thinking what's in the pipeline for Lebanon because Hezbollah has a far greater range.  That's not to say you're wrong for feeling mistrust - you can't help that.  It is to say that it is wrong to act on it, to distance yourself from reaching a resolution, because you're scared and to create more mistrust.

As bad as they've been Hamas has made steps to earn trust.  Whenever they've done so they've been slapped by Israel.  Here they are restating the conditions for peace.  None of them are outlandish, indeed, they are in complete alignment with what the Geneva convention stipulates must happen anyway.  In that sense they're not even demands; more a sign of willingness and international responsibility - they're certainly not conditions which can be chiseled away without harming the Geneva convention.  

If, whenever positive steps are made, Israel obstructs them then her public perception is only going to continue to rot.  The tide of public support has turned.  If mistrust rules your decision making then I'd ask you to question whether you can trust the direction Israel is currently going in will lead to a better place.  It doesn't look like it.

From [Why on the left](http://www.2pass.co.uk/goodluck.htm)
This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world; however, there is a perfectly good reason.

Up to the late 1700's, everybody travelled on the left side of the road because it's the sensible option for feudal, violent societies of mostly right-handed people.

Jousting knights with their lances under their right arm naturally passed on each other's right, and if you passed a stranger on the road you walked on the left to ensure that your protective sword arm was between yourself and him.

Revolutionary France, however, overturned this practice as part of its sweeping social rethink. A change was carried out all over continental Europe by Napoleon.The reason it changed under Napoleon was because he was left handed his armies had to march on the right so he could keep his sword arm between him and any opponent.

From then on, any part of the world which was at some time part of the British Empire was thus left hand and any part colonised by the French was right hand.

In America, the French colonised the southern states (Louisiana for instance) and the Canadian east coast (Quebec). The Dutch colonised New York (or New Amsterdam). The Spanish and Portugese colonised the southern Americas. So The British were a minority in shaping the 'traffic'.

The drive-on-the-right policy was adopted by the USA, which was anxious to cast off all remaining links with its British colonial past

Once America drove on the right, left-side driving was ultimately doomed. If you wanted a good reliable vehicle, you bought American, for a period they only manufactured right-hand-drive cars.

From then on many countries changed out of necessity.

Today, the EC would like Britain to fall into line with the rest of Europe, but this is no longer possible. It would cost billions of pounds to change everything round.
The last European country to convert to driving on the right was Sweden in 1967. While everyone was getting used to the new system, they paid more attention and took more care, resulting in a reduction of the number of road accident casualties",56,t1_c0bov7g,False,reddit.com,t5_6,thorium,c0bov7g,0

For me, it was all about motivation, incentives and misdirection.  I'd been a mild smoker (half pack a day) for 20 years and had quit cold turkey 3 years ago. My motivation and incentive at that time was mountain biking.

I faltered this year, and started again in March, back to half a pack a day. I decided to stop when it became the first thing I'd do in the morning.  This time around, 3 things helped:

1. Motivation: health = Working out and running and sports.  Started at half an hour each day.  Clears the lungs, makes you proud when you wake up the next day, not hacking, but feeling so much better.

2. Misdirection: Black, salty, european licorice.  The worst-tasting you can find. Licorice is actually used a flavoring in cigarettes, so having some of that nasty taste does help alleviate some part of the craving. I've since grown quite fond of the stuff.

3. Incentive: date with a cutie.  Smokes are crazy expensive here in Canada, and a half-pack a day habit easily costs $150/month.  So I bought 2 tickets to Cirque du Soleil, set 3 months after the quit date.  If I have a smoke between now and then, she takes whomever she wants on that date, she sees the weakling in me, and I miss out in so many ways.

Apologies if I came across as condescending. That wasn't my intention. I know US hospitals have the latest tech but I balk at the idea that people have to actually pay at a hospital and there’s always the chance that your insurance company will do their best to fuck you. The first time I found out about the American healthcare system was way back during that Friends episode where Joey gets a hernia and won’t go to the doctor. Pure confusion. I wasn’t enjoying the jokes so much as asking over and over again what the hell was going on.

Funny thing. Just graduated with my BSc. Applying to begin studying medicine September 2010. Fingers crossed.  

&gt;So... what if you were 78 years old, and a treatment that costs 38,001? What's going to happen to you, then?

Depends on if the treatment is worth it. As in if it will give me a reasonable number of years more and a decent quality of life, I'll get my treatment without much of a wait. You are placed in the waiting list according to how life threatening your illness is. Tough decision and I’m not looking forward to making those decisions but nobody is going to allow your cancer to grow twice in size if the doctors know that’s what’s going to happen during the wait.

If I decide I’d rather pay out of my own pocket for treatment? I’ll fly to India. Treatment will be dirt cheap and top notch. There are a dozen medical tourism destinations for me to choose from. Then again maybe I’ll pay £50 and fly to one of our eastern EU neighbours and go private there which would still be dirt cheap and of exceptional quality. Or of course I could pay for private treatment in London. Government run healthcare does not destroy the private industry.

From Forbes.com:

(1744-1812) Meyer Amschel Rothschild:
Meyer Amschel Rothschild helped invent modern banking by introducing concepts such as diversification, rapid communication, confidentiality and high volume. The superlatively discreet foreign-exchange banker diversified from the very beginning, selling antiques and procuring loans. Remarkably, Rothschild was willing to cut into his own profits in order to secure future business.
And, earlier than most, he understood that time and information meant money, and he pulled out all the stops to remain in constant contact with associates across Europe. That network came in handy when he helped finance England's war effort during the Napoleonic Wars. Rothschild institutionalized his bank with a far-sighted will that ensured the continuation of his business. Considered a founding father of international finance, his banking empire--thanks to his five sons--had expanded to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples at the time of his death.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Afghanistan_opium_poppy_cultivation_1994-2007b.PNG

The Forbes family of China and Boston, of which US Senator John Forbes Kerry and John Murray Forbes are members, amassed a huge fortune in the China trade, initially trading North American furs and manufactured goods for tea and other goods from China.

Forbes also made a considerable fortune smuggling opium during the Opium Wars. The British wanted to keep a monopoly on supplying the Chinese with opium grown in India. However, during the Opium Wars the British ships were prevented from delivering their cargoes of opium and American ship owners such as Forbes, who could sail the final miles, made great amounts of money delivering the cargoes for the British. Forbes family members later engaged in other merchant banking and railroad investment projects around the world.

Born in France, John Murray Forbes entered the China trade at the behest of his Perkins uncles, and after his brother Tom Forbes died, and thereafter John Murray Forbes was mentored by the Chinese merchant Houqua who considered Forbes to be like a son. Following John Murray Forbes into China were several brothers and cousins, including Francis Blackwell Forbes, the great grandfather of John Forbes Kerry. The Forbes family lived and traded in China at first due to a family connection with the Perkins family. Later, some of the Forbes family sold their China trading interests to the Russell and Company, a shipping empire which was headed by Robert Bennett Forbes, and was later associated with Yale's development and endowment. Yale's Skull and Bones society was founded by William H. Russell, one of the members of the wealthy Russell family, in 1832.

The Dictionary of American Biography reports that the noted American ship captain Robert Bennet Forbes played ""a prominent role in the outbreak of the Chinese Opium War.""

Several of the Forbes family cashed out of their dealings in China after the Opium War, and reinvested in Europe and the United States. Some of the population growth of Chicago and Midwestern Plains states in the middle to late 19th century was due to John Murray Forbes' railroad projects in Michigan and Chicago. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., from Chicago west to the Pacific was built by John Murray Forbes who had perhaps a reputation for sound financial management amongst the railroad tycoons of the day. In 1879, William Forbes, son of John Murray Forbes, risked the fortune to financially back Alexander Graham Bell's telephone company, and become president of the company, a risk which paid off. William Cameron Forbes used his wealth to become Governor General of the Philippines. His niece Ruth Forbes Paine Young tapped her Forbes family inheritance to finance the International Peace Academy. Her husband invented the Bell Helicopter used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In a tiny footnote to history, Ruth Forbes Paine Young's son, Michael R. Paine, and his wife Ruth Paine, allowed Maria Oswald, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, to live in their house as a family friend, and Oswald's rifle was stored for a time in the Paine's family garage.

...

The Step-brother of William Huntington Russell , Samuel Russel is a prominent member of the Russell family who ran a opium trade in China. (Russell &amp; Co)

Note about Skull and Bones :
It all began at Yale. In 1832, General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso
Taft put together a super secret society for the elite children of the Anglo-
American Wall Street banking establishment. William Huntington Russell's
step-brother Samuel Russell ran ""Russell &amp; Co."", the world's largest OPIUM
smuggling operation in the world at the time. Alphonso Taft is the Grandfather of our ex-president Howard Taft, the creator of the Forerunner to the United Nations.
Only 15 seniors are picked each year by the former graduating class. They are required as a part of their initiation ceremony to lie naked in a coffin and recite
their sexual history. This method allows other members to control the individual
by threatening to reveal their innermost secrets if they do not ""go-along"".


Note about the clipper (ship) ""Samuel Russell"" :
She was named in honor of a friend of the Low Brothers, Samuel Russell, a senior member of the American firm of Russell &amp; Co., operating in China, who was a one time partner of the Lows. The ""Russell"" as she soon would be called by many, was 174 feet in length, 34 feet, 4 inches in breadth with a depth of hold of 20 feet. A red and white ribbon streak ran along the waterline of the Russell's black hull.

Perhaps because people who try to explain it are pompous, self important twats. 

&gt;There is invasive government and non-invasive government. Non-invasive government is the type where you do pay tax to support it, but that's all you do, it has no other intrusion into your life.

I don't know how you're defining ""non-invasive"" in such a squirley way, but I certainly consider the government demanding a bigger cut of my pay check to be ""invasive"". I worked for that money, and I'd like to decide what I want to do with it. Trust me, I know far better than a Washington bureaucrat where that money should go. What is it about Europeans that makes them want to give up their rights and income to government bean counters? Do they really feel so insecure in their personal decisions that they can't manage their own lives? (See, I can do hyperbolic, douchey criticism too!)

&gt;Examples of government like this is social security, welfare, and public health insurance. The government can't find out anything about you unless you use these systems, and even then it is kept strictly withing the program and not shared with any other agencies.

Not only is this off topic (""invasive"" means a lot more than just knowing things about you), but it's also wrong. Your entire finance history and identity can be stripped away just by your SSN falling into the wrong hands. 

&gt;The kicker is that these non-invasive programs generally help the poor, old, sick and disadvantaged.

The Soviet Union ""helped"" all of its disadvantaged people. In fact, it told people where they could work, what they could buy, what they could eat, wear, say, etc. It also fed the hungry, housed the homeless and healed the sick. It also crushed the aspirations, happiness, dreams and (in the case of tens of millions of people) lives of its citizens. If you seek to resurrect a socialist state I suggest you take your plans elsewhere. 

&gt;Invasive government is government that you pay for with your tax dollars and the government program in question is designed to spy on you and keep track of you. Examples of these programs include the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Authority, and other such programs. Each time your government creates a new three letter agency, you give up more and more freedoms.

You're creating a false distinction where none exists. Any expansion of government must by its very nature come at the expense of the pocketbooks of the people. Because people work to make money, and because money is the basis on which we provide for ourselves any government imposition of new policies and taxes is an invasion of the sanctity of that person's life. As a consequence, any additional services provided by the government must be so desperately needed that they can overcome the negative effects on the freedom and economic welfare of the people of the country. Nationalized health insurance will not make health insurance less expensive (again, insurance companies have only a 5% profit margin as is), and as a consequence will not help to provide more people with health care. What needs to be changed is how health care is delivered, and how easy it is to start a health care co-op or private insurance company. More choice and better delivery is the solution, not additional government intervention and expenditures.

If to you, as it does to so many others, ""Better"" == ""cheaper""... then yes, those other countries are ""Better"". Oh wait, what was their tax rate again? How much of those taxes go towards health care?

The proof is in the pudding, if an abundance of advanced equipment was 'better' than why are we sicker, and dying earlier, and paying WAY more for the cost? What's the motive for owning expensive machines here vs. there? Here? Profit. Ever wonder why hospitals advertise their Open MRIs on TV? I got very sick in a small city in Germany once, I was given an MRI and an endoscopic procedure, without an ounce of waiting. I was born in a Scottish hospital, my mother was allowed to stay the recommended amount of time instead of getting the boot by some insurance company. In both my experience, my parents, and many of my relatives, you don't want to get sick in the US. I was BLOWN AWAY by my German hospital stay, the facility was top notch, didn't smell of death, and I WAS the ER patient. Literally, THE patient for about 2 hours, and this was in Stuttgart, not a little village. Honestly I thought I must have been in heaven, my nurse was a stunning 24 year old blonde girl in the little white hat and skirt. I was waited on hand and foot, total cost: zero.

&gt; That's a complicated issue, one that I would argue is much more related to the genetic makeup of the population than it is to healthcare issues.

No, it's not. You're deluding yourself. The countries that beat us like the UK and other parts of Europe have HUGE immigrant populations and a high degree of variance (higher so than here, huzzah!)

Our lives are shorter because much of our population never gets preventive care, or they put off taking the more expensive medicine, or half a pill, or waiting until it's so bad that they are beyond rescuing. 

The insurance companies have a fundamental flaw that makes their continued presence untenable:
They cannot be profitable unless they are huge, and there are few of them. This is not true competition. They cannot be profitable if they don't have the ability to say no either. For example: State Farm pulling out of Florida.

We pretty much invented fast food and revel in it as well as soda and other extremely unhealthy products because we have a market for them.  We have spread this all over the world and Coca-Cola is one of the most well known names/symbols in the world.  They are easy and cheap to produce and as a result the stores and facilities that sell them can be expanded rapidly.  

Our infrastructure and working hours aid the problem by generating more of a market for ""drive-thrus"" and extremely easy and quick (and often unhealthy) meals.  The nature of our cities and towns and land is such that many must own vehicles to travel and thus walk or bike much less.  Many of our cities are extremely unwelcoming to bikers.  

We certainly do consume lots of everything but when it comes to alcohol we have some of the latest starters in the western world.  Most Europeans drink alcohol with meals and such from a very early age, as I mentioned before, yet most Americans start in late middle school or high school or even college.  If it was simply due to gluttony why would we not be consuming alcohol with every meal at the dinner table?  Instead our alcohol culture often centers around alcohol as a ""social"" drug where you get together for the sole purpose of consuming large quantities.  That behavior does not fit very well into the behavior of gluttons it fits in much more closely with illicit drug users.

Did the Catholic and Protestant churches in Germany of the time rebel, en masse, then?  It wasn't an official theocracy, but the Nazis had the tacit support of the two biggest churches.  Had that been withdrawn publicly, it would have been considerably more difficult for Hitler to obtain power than it was otherwise.  Whether he personally believed or not is honestly immaterial.  What matters is that an entire nation of 80 million people, roughly 90% of which were either Catholic or Protestant, went along.

&gt; That doesn't take away from the fact that they were indeed atheists though.

The question isn't whether they were atheists, but whether their barbarity can be traced back to the fact they were atheists, rather than some other aspect of the belief systems they practiced.

Did the Khmer Rouge kill all the educated in Cambodia because they wanted a nation of non-believers or did they kill them all because they wanted to force the nation back to agrarianism as part of a CLASS struggle?

Did Mao and Stalin kill all those people in purges because they were atheists or because they wanted to consolidate their hold on power and remove rivals?

Did Hitler kill all those Jews, homosexuals, gypsies and bolsheviks because he was a bigoted lunatic with delusions of grandeur or because he was a closet atheist?

You know the answer to these.

&gt; The point of the charges against Kim, Mao, Hitler and all, that you can have secular values (with no God or Religion required) that enable totalitarianism, ruthless control, suppression of freedom, and a murder count in 1 century, higher than all the religious wars of history.

OK, I'm going to try to be nice about this, so take that into account ...

The entire population of Europe in 1200 was less than 10 million people.  A massive, society spanning undertaking like the Third Crusade, that took the resources of three kingdoms and the whole Catholic church to pull off ... fielded 200 000 men on the Christian side.

To put that in perspective:

Canada, one tiny little Commonwealth nation, had 8 million people in 1914 and fielded 650 000 men to the fields of France during WWI.  Russia fielded 12 million men.

No fucking shit the death toll completely eclipsed anything prior.  Every last man, woman and child alive in 1200 could go to war at the same time and you still wouldn't even remotely approximate the number of people in the field during WWI.

edit: I'll add that nationalism and the various international treaties fueled both WWI and WWII, so that rules them out as ""atheist"" causes.  Simply being secular affairs doesn't make them atheist.

Instead, in April 1204, the Crusaders of Western Europe invaded and conquered the Christian (Eastern Orthodox) city of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. 

Laughably, the fall of the Byzantine Empire, which had held back the Muslims/Turks for centuries was greatly helped by European ignoramuses and short-sighted clowns who sacked the capital and weakened the empire.  Yay Crusaders!

&gt;Speros Vryonis in Byzantium and Europe gives a vivid account of the sack of Constantinople by the Frankish and Venetian Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade:

&gt;&gt;The Latin soldiery subjected the greatest city in Europe to an indescribable sack. 
For three days they murdered, raped, looted and destroyed on a scale which even 
the ancient Vandals and Goths would have found unbelievable. Constantinople had 
become a veritable museum of ancient and Byzantine art, an emporium of such incredible
wealth that the Latins were astounded at the riches they found. Though the Venetians
had an appreciation for the art which they discovered (they were themselves semi-Byzantines)
and saved much of it, the French and others destroyed indiscriminately, halting to refresh
themselves with wine, violation of nuns, and murder of Orthodox clerics. The Crusaders 
vented their hatred for the Greeks most spectacularly in the desecration of the greatest
Church in Christendom. They smashed the silver iconostasis, the icons and the holy books of Hagia Sophia, and seated upon the patriarchal throne a whore who sang coarse songs as they drank wine from the 
Church's holy vessels. The estrangement of East and West, which had proceeded over the 
centuries, culminated in the horrible massacre that accompanied the conquest of 
Constantinople. The Greeks were convinced that even the Turks, had they taken the city, 
would not have been as cruel as the Latin Christians. The defeat of Byzantium, already in 
a state of decline, accelerated political degeneration so that the Byzantines eventually 
became an easy prey to the Turks. The Crusading movement thus resulted, ultimately, in 
the victory of Islam, a result which was of course the exact opposite of its original intention.

Granted, a substantial portion of the populace is ill served by the expectations of a liberal society.  I would like to say that guaranteed safety nets would just encourage the worst decision making possible, but that hypothesis isn't supported by European countries where native population growth is often at sub-replacement levels.  For some reason they allow immigrants to monopolize public assistance though.

Another form of deregulation we need is over medical boards.  We have a severe scarcity of non-emergency medical providers.  It shouldn't take a three year residency to know how to avoid a line infection.   The formulaic oversight of simple outpatient procedures drives up the cost of basic medical care obscenely.  How many thousands of dollars does it really need to cost to get tetanus shot after stepping on a rusty nail?  Due to liability concerns, health care is sometimes seems more accessible and more cost effective in the developing world.

The best kind of zero-liability healthcare is self-medication.  If idiots disregard safety labels, what have we really lost?

While I doubt it has been completely amortized, yes I agree you are substantially correct in this regard. There is no explanation in the cost of the machine alone.

Let's figure that just 3 patients a day use it, that's 1000 per year roughly. If only $1000 of the fee for each person (a rather small fraction, most cases) were paid towards the cost of the machine, that's a million bucks a year. Since they can do up to what, 30 scans per day, at many places around the clock, and since $1000 doesn't even tend to be a third of the fee at most places... even if they were valued at $20 million, they could pay the things off in a year or two. This is faster even than the rate of equipment upgrades.

And, as you said, the imaging tech and doctor don't split $12,000 between them. We can figure in the hospital wanting their cut, a large electrical bill (they're what, 3 phase and draw alot of juice), we still can't get up that high.

On the other hand, if it really costs them $1000 per scan, and if the insurance company fights with them only paying back 1 in 12... they'd raise it that high, wouldn't they?

And it's not just that. But now they have to hire people to argue with the insurance companies. There are salaries to pay, more office space to lease.

I think we can explain the $12,000. Granted, neither of us like the answer, but there is an explanation and it's not ""profit"".

&gt; Now, socialized medicine on the other hand is a landslide success in a number of other countries. 

Depends on how you measure, doesn't it? You might measure in how healthy people are, but I dare say that even without socialized medicine, most of Europe would remain healthier than we are.

You might measure satisfaction, but let's face it... people are always happy with the status quo. They'd be happy with it here, if the democrats didn't need another issue to clobber republicans with. (Personally, I'd rather they clobber them with warmongering and fiscal mismanagement... but the democrats want to do those things as well, so they need a distraction.)

And then we could measure in ways that no one else would like, but that I personally find appealing. Let's measure how much personal responsibility people in those countries take for themselves. Let's measure the erosion of their liberties, at least for the places that used to have them. Hell, let's measure the erosion of adulthood itself. What kind of score do you think they'd get on those, by the way? 

Is there enough benefit to socialized medicine to outweigh all that? I'd be lying if I said that you couldn't bribe those things away from me... but I never thought people could be so... [shrug] ... cheap? Short-sighted, maybe.

&gt; You might think I have some bleeding heart, half-brained, lazy socialist agenda, but it might surprise you to learn I'm actually just really pissed off at being ""legally"" robbed of the difference between what that procedure actually cost and $12k.

This is becase it's profit-based, so there are so many people who must get paid between the patient and the companies that things get awfully expensive (marketing, etc.). I'm making up the numbers, but as others have said, something that costs $100 could end up costing $1000 to the patient.

This also means that, despite being so expensive, there's **less** money to pay the doctors, and thus there are less doctors available. That's why you suffer doctor shortage.

Here in Spain (sorry it's just the example I know best, but I know it's even better in other EU countries), the doctors are *VERY* well paid, yet there are enough of them to cover almost everything. Money is only spent in: a) Paying for the hospital manteinance and equipment; b) Paying the staff salary. That's all. You get the occasional long waiting times here and there in crowded cities when in critic times of the year, but it's usually quite smooth and wait times range from 0 to maybe 30-60 minutes if you're really unlucky or happen to go to a hospital with some sort of staff problem.

From my own experience, you usually go to the hospital, tell the ""receptionist"" nurse what's your problem, and then just show them your Social Security card. If it's an emergency, they'll get you in queue in a second. If it's not, they'll usually try to give you an appointment with your assigned doctor if he/she is available (it'll usually be more comfortable for you), at a determined time (say, 17:00). So you go home, and just go back at 17:00 and sit in the waiting room, and the doctor will call your name in minutes.

And you don't need to be carrying a cent in your pocket for this. Just your Social Security card, which will grant you free assistance in any hospital in the whole country (as they have a global DB to check your number when you check in).

Personally, I would be really angry if they ever tried to remove or limit our Social Security system as it is right now.

Edit: Oh, and please don't use the UK system as a comparison.

I live in Spain. Here social security cover everything. It is unthought of to pay for a doctors visit or even an operation. The fact that you can have multi-thousand dollar bills for basic care blows me away. Social security even cover a good part of the cost of medicine you buy at the farmacy if your doctor gives you a prescription. Even if you are not European and have an accident in Spain, I cannot imagine the hospital charging you for care. They simply dont have any sort of payment facilities, it doesnt compute.
That said, you can also have private medical insurance (which is not very expensive) which allows you to go to private doctors and choose what day and at what time you get your appointment (with greater liberty than through social security). I have private health insurance and still, in many ocassions, go to the social security doctor.

I'm currently in the middle of a 3 month bike tour through europe, logging over 2000 miles in the past two months, and I have to say, in continental europe there is a huge divide between countries in terms of respect and consideration for people on bikes. 
For instance, Portugal had no shoulder lane for the most part, and the drivers weren't that great, but they would give about 2ft of passing space on average, with a few honks now and again. Spain had a nice clean shoulder, and very respectful drivers. France had a potholed and unridable shoulder, the occasional bike path, and drivers that seemed intent on cleaning the side of their car with your bike. Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland all had posted bike routes, both on and off road, and the drivers would be very patient and wait for a clear and safe spot to pass. 
In NJ, PA, and MD, where I ride and live in the states, the attitude of the drivers is varied. You get the feeling that people are in so much of a hurry that taking an exta 10 seconds to pass safely is out of consideration sometimes.

*""Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had been a response to an Israeli military raid in the West Bank city of Nablus at dawn on Tuesday""*

[Islamic Jihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine) is not Hamas, in fact Hamas were in the process of [arresting such militants](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099318.html) trying to operate in Gaza.  Israeli government spokesman [Mark Regev](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SILJxPTqjAM) later confirmed that Hamas fired no rockets during the ceasefire.

&gt;**Hamas does not recognize Israel.**

Hamas leadership has said several times, to many people, that they are now willing to accept Israel.

&gt;&gt;displaced refugees are allowed to return to homes

&gt;**This is unrealistic. Israel is unprepared and unwilling to suddenly take in such large numbers. You can argue until the cows come home about what is just and what is legal, but if peace is conditioned on an unrealistic goal, then peace is impossible.**

The only thing making it unrealistic are the people protesting it.  If however you are saying that 'legal' and 'just' cannot be achieved then it is clear where the problem lies; you're arguing for an illegal and immoral resolution i.e. suppression and capitulation, or no resolution at all.  Your way of thinking is part of the problem, not part of the solution.  You're also trying to say it is unpractical.  Unpractical?  Really??  'Practical' would state that many would choose to stay in a recognised Palestinian state, practical says that much of the land from which they'd been removed would be back in Palestinian hands anyway if they went with 1967 borders - which moderates on all sides say is doable.  'Practical' also shows that many regions have taken in massive influxes of populations and prospered...Israel on independence for example.


&gt;&gt;Back in 1967... the only difference between then and now can be put down to one thing:

&gt;**War. The 6-day war started when Egypt closed the straits of Tiran and lined up a thousand tanks on the border, to provoke Israel. If we now scale things back to pre-1967, this time Egypt won't line up 10,000 tanks on the border? Why do you believe that forward progress will be made by going backwards in time?**

Hardly going backwards, you take what positives you've garnered.  I like to think of it as 'moving forward through gaining historic perspective'.  But backwards?  No, like, oh I don't know, the peace treaty with Egypt.  If the land was enough in 1967 but isn't enough now, even though it would mean peace treaties with not just Palestine but the 22 state Arab League, then you can either argue for a need for a buffer zone (mistrust) or that you've become attached to the land seized since then (greed).  (War) is just an extension of (mistrust)...or there has been conflict since then so there is less reason to trust now.  That has already been addressed but to surmise if mistrust is the break on the process it can only be relieved by beginning to trust is encroaching quantifiable measure.  So when Hamas becomes democratically elected they're entered into negotiations like Annapolis.  When Hamas asks for and holds up a ceasefire trade restrictions are lifted as previously agreed as a condition.  Neither of these rewards were forthcoming so 'mistrust' is hardly legitimate when steps to empower trust are not taken whilst justification for mistrust is consolidated.

Like I said elsewhere, I can empathise with mistrust but you can't afford to let it dictate, otherwise things will never get better.  Certainly mistrust has led to things getting progressively worse.  Not only that but what is enough of a buffer?  Paris had 300km between it and Germany but it still became an open city and had 2 World Wars fought on its territory.  If France had taken that route after WW2 then Germany would be somewhere in the Urals now.  If it had not taken that route after WW1 one could almost argue the second would not have happened.  A little bit of trust goes a long way.  Neither France or Germany fear invasion from each other anymore and not because of buffers or Maginot lines.  You really want to argue that Israel needs a buffer...does the buffer get bigger as technology gets better.  An argument for an Israeli Euphrates Delta won't do you any favours.  

...or you could go with trust, legality and justice.  You moved people off their land - you allow them a right to return.  Saying that there's no more room for them is a silly argument.  There's room for Israeli [Aliyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Statistics), there's room for 3.4 million people since conception?  Then there's room for the indigenous people who were since spurned.

&gt;**The big issue is the return of the refugees. I think it is unrealistic to expect that Israel, 7million people, of whom 25% non-Jewish, to take in over a million Arabs, most of whom voted for Hamas.** 

Thank you.  At least I finally got an answer from someone.  We might not see eye to eye but I appreciate that.

You're right, I agree with you.  Not that it is unrealistic but that massive return of an Arab/Palestinian people is, I believe, the perceived problem.  It doesn't have to be but those that identify Israel with an ethnic identity (Judaism) and not a civic identity (Israeli) realise that Israel would not cease to exist in 20 years if it was allowed....but it wouldn't be a Jewish state just a state with a massive Jewish population and where Judaism is protected - just as the League of Nations intended with Palestine before Israel was formed from within it.  Unlike in Northern Ireland where Sinn Fein could play a waiting game because Republican babies were outnumbering Loyalists and Downing St had promised they'd recognise a referendum, the opposite is true in Israel.  An inconvenient domestic Arab population is already growing.  Right to return would be one hell of a catalyst.  The alarming thing for those who would play down peace is that they realise if this turns into a democratic or a diplomatic battle *- the oppressed guys with no army ultimately win!*

There's a countdown - the Arab population is growing.  That's the Neo-Zionist conundrum.  Keep democracy and go for peace and, given time, the neo-Zionist goals are lost at the polls.  Israel forms into a state with civic identity, not Arab or Jew, but Israeli.  So something has to give: democracy or peace or a combination there of.  Giving up peace means war, land grabs, expulsions - everything ethnic cleansing.

It's not a problem for moderate Israelis, post-zionist Israelis, humanitarians.  They're ok with Israel being a state for Israelis; Arab, Jewish, whatever.

That they voted for Hamas is neither here nor there...Hamas is saying that it will accept Israel and is willing to put down arms.  The 1million+ Arabs equally would have to live with Israelis who had served with the IDF and voted for Lieberman.  Or how France, Holland, Belgium and Germany integrated their economies in [1957](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community) just 12 years after one of the bloodiest conflicts the world has ever seen.  It's called moving on.

&gt;**If you condition peace on that, might as well give up on peace.**

Actually it is simpler than that.  The majority of the people on both sides want resolution.  The Arab states certainly want a resolution, their biggest threat is domestic and this crisis creates lots of internal groups from Islamic Jihad to Shia elements with backing from Persia.  Find an amicable resolution and their raison d'être vanishes. The world community wants a resolution; those outsiders involved in the region with troops committed need a resolution.

There are however some people on both sides who will never want a resolution.  Maybe some hardliners Arabs in the Izz ad-Din al-qassam brigades or the Islamic Jihad.  And in Israel it is those resolute [neo-zionists] that can't have both peace and democracy without losing their ambitions.   Certain big business capitalists have already eyed redevelopment contracts in Palestine - Gordon Brown wrote an empowering paper on it whilst still Chancellor.  They wouldn't want to see resolution either if there's a profit - just like contractors don't want to see the end of an Iraqi occupation either.  But these are minority groups, and forewarned is forearmed.

If you condition peace according to these people...we'll never have peace because they don't want it.  If we condition peace to the rest, the giant majority, then it is very much achievable.  Already people are being won over.  Hamas for example, hard line of the hardline in the 1980s, has said that things have changed and that if the Geneva Convention is recognised, meaning a return of East Jerusalem and a civilian right to return, and that they can agree on 1967 borders, then, in their words, they'll 'accept Israel'.",2,t1_c0bpw3s,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,[deleted],c0bpw3s,0

We currently have problems with our medical system providing bad care, because of bad regulation AND because of corporate corruption. A lot of regulation unnecessarily increases cost, for instance, under Obama, it is now being required every medical office have complete electronic records. Not cheap for those who aren't as modern. Why is this being imposed?

The system is fucked. Any conservative and any liberal and anyone in between will agree to that. What is in dispute today is.. should the market be more free? (there's good arguments for LESS regulation) or should we have a social system( again, good arguments for this too).

The problem I have with the latter though is this; people are so populist about it, people are so angry, hurt, and saddened by our current state of affairs, it doesn't really matter to them what social system gets put through. To them, any social system is better than our current one, and that's not true. Things can always be made worse. Always. And that's our problem a lot of the time. People get angry and they vote and support the titles of bills or the general philosophy behind the bills, never the details of the bill. They're the angry mob, and they want answers dammit, they want a solution. And corrupt politicians (Dem or Rep) and their corporate masters are more than willing to sate them with a steaming pile of shit every time.

And no matter how corrupt and insurance-industry-influenced the public option bills are, this ""public option"" crowd is going to go for it, they'll ignore whatever problems even they have with the bill simply because they think a government solution, even a horribly executed corrupt solution, is better than what we have. And while they ignore the corporate corruption of their very bills on one hand, they'll lash out at any critic as a ""conservative shill"" in order to discredit any civil debate about it. They have become an incredibly polarizing force. I see them in public, I see them online, even on reddit. And the failure of understanding these people seem to have is; once a system is generally in place the people and the government rarely do away with it no matter what problems it has.

If we were talking about a true single payer option here, where Anthem and their ilk weren't invited to the table to shape the bills, I'd be going YAY SOCIALISM too. I'd join a protest pushing for it, I'd be doing and saying all i can, for whatever it'd be worth.

But that's not what is going to happen. What's going to happen is going to be a clusterfuck and a disaster. So while i tend to be liberal minded on medical care, i'll be damning the ""public option"" right along side the republicans, and libertarians, etc. My reasoning may differ slightly, but frankly.. a freer market is a better option that the currently proposed public one. IMHO. And until single payer is on the table, it will continue to be.

This might all be slightly off topic but the reason I say this is this: I keep seeing these submissions to reddit showing the absolute nasty side of current system and the people that it truly harms, it evokes anger. Anger at the current system. Anger at the corporatism (that gets mistakenly labeled capitalism or ""free market"", which it is not). And the proposed solution is never anything in great detail. It's always just ""socialism"" ""public option"", as if socialism is infallible. As if a public option couldn't be worse, that 'it is an impossibility. There's a guy, username alludes me currently, who enters into almost half of the social medicine debates on reddit and posts this huge list of GDP % spent on healthcare by various nations along with mortality rates etc..everyone votes him up and cheers him on, because the social systems in other nations happen to spend less that we do in america. Again, no one looks at the details of how and why, they just assume a social system, ANY social system will be inherently cheaper for the nation as a whole. He doesn't seem to understand the correlation doesn't entail causation between type of system and cost of system. And i see that problem here. People assume merely b/c the government gets involved it'll be the magic bullet. Cost will go down, mortality rates go up, etc.. and while I hope that's the case, it doesn't mean it will be. Hoping for something doesn't make it so. I'm not asking anyone to jump to the free market viewpoint, I'm not asking for people to stop cheering on a public option. I'm just asking for people to get their head out of their ass. It's sickening to see liberals jump behind simpleton banners and slogans like good little lemmings.

&gt;the run from the insertion from disk thing CAN NOT be done legally, so unless you're talking about an ideal world where patents and copyrights don't exist, this is a non issue.

The ideal world are most countries outside of US, including most if not all of EU.

&gt;What Mint does is legally dubious in a number of countries and if they were a for-profit company I'm sure they would have been sued by now. 

Mint has two version: the regular Mint and Mint Lite. The later is Mint without codecs.

&gt;Furthermore I have a problem with people using distro's built off distro's that's built off distros which is what Mint is. The code is going through too many peoples hands. Go back to where it's more stable. Debian or an Ubuntu LTS. Noobs shouldn't be using flaky crap anyways. It'll just make their lives harder in the long run.

Good for you. Regardless of the fact that Mint might be (and from my experience is) somewhat less stable, I'd recommend it over Ubuntu to anyone interested in Linux any day (unless I'm there to install everything for them in the first place).

&gt;Scouring the web to install Flash, Quicktime, and codec megapacks is a reality for any windows user. Same for Mac users. 

Absolutely, BUT only for those people who need all those codecs, i.e. guys who already know how to pirate films or click icons other than that of Apple or Windows on movie preview sites. Flash installation is pretty much simplified to clicking one button upon prompt and saying YES a couple of times (which is precisely not the fact with DVD support on Linux).

Either way, those people already know what they are doing on some basic scale; we're talking about people who can't tell the internet from their browser and are challenged by pressing the EJECT button on their DVD player, which is admittedly the vastest majority of users. Try telling them that Synaptic and looking for a lib is not all that hard. Most common tasks for these people are reading their emails, listening to their MP3s, watching DVDs and, for a minority, going to YouTube. Currently every single one of these tasks, except the emails, is practically speaking impossibily difficult for them even on Ubuntu.

&gt;And i'm sure if they don't know how, they'll ask someone who does or who will find out.

Wrong. There are a plenty of surveys on this sort of thing done by the FSF (unless it was EFF). Most of them just go back to Windows.

&gt;I mean seriously, Linux users are already saved a TON of time by the fact the install takes less than 30 min, and the install generally comes with all the software you would need (instant messenger, office suite, firewall, mail client, archiver, gedit, etc.. the list goes on).

Of course. This is one of the strength that Linux distros have and it's absolutely great. People like this sort of thing, but it doesn't change anything about the fact that they cannot watch their favourite season of Friends because the said lib is not installed.

&gt;On top of that they don't have to go find and download a spyware cleaner, an antivirus, etc.

Those usually come preinstalled, not that the user knows what they're doing anyway.

&gt;They have a lot more time on their hands, I'm sure 10 min at google.com searching ""How do I install codecs on Ubuntu"" isn't too much to ask being a legal requirement to not include them and all. Or ask in IRC or a mailing list or a forum.

Yes, it is. You're asking them to know what Google, Ubuntu, codecs and installation are. Look, I see that you are obviously a passionate Linux use, as am I, and I also see that you've never dealt with customers before. I worked in IT Quality Management for a bit, usually taking care of somewhat tech-educated people, with at least a university diploma to backup their intelligence, and it was still a pain in the arse explaining concepts to them that you would take for granted. I can tell you for a fact that none of them had a slightest clue what fragmentation is and why it is a good idea to defrag your drives (or for that matter your favourite IRC). Now we are talking about businessmen, engineers and other folks working with computers 8 hours a day. A mate of mine worked in an electronics retail shop selling parts to ""common people"". His experience was a good deal more frustrating with people returning computers, because ""they let their child play around with the mouse"" and didn't know how to put their taskbar back into the bottom of the screen again. This is not a solitary case, but a routine.

Now we can all start hating major retailers for not selling computers with Ubuntu on them for being Microsoft's lapdogs and all the rest of it, but unless we can simplify these three basic tasks (mail, music, DVDs), we're doomed for failure. Best Buy, or whatever you've got on that side of the pond, doesn't want to waste their money explaining how to go into Synaptic and install this and that package; it's a waste of their employees time. Little wonder that they only sell Windows notebooks.

I think that GNOME, in particular, has made a huge progress in the past years making the overall use of Linux a lot easier than that of Windows. Clicking the little icon and browsing for the programs you need is a good deal easier than anywhere else. Those are the small things that are holding it back from everyday use by your average user and unless we get it right, the ""year old Linux"" will never come.",0,t1_c0bpzaw,False,linux,t5_2qh1a,nickpick,c0bpzaw,0

Publicly listed companies aren't the same as a system of profit-sharing. Employees would have to buy shares with their wages. I'm talking about them deserving shares in addition to their wages. So, moving away from the wage slavery model and employees subsisting on crumbs for their entire career.

&gt; Your idea about a ""federally-adopted system of profit sharing"" is truly terrifying. 

Well, freeing slaves was terrifying to Southern slave owners. Democracy was terrifying to European monarchs. Eventually it ended with them getting guillotined because they simply could not stomach giving up their power and their authority. That doesn't mean they were right. They were just drunk with power, as are private business owners today. And they abuse this power, just like kings did.

&gt; You want to force business owners to give up ownership of their companies?

They would still own them for a long time. Maybe even for most of their working career. Like I said, it would be gradual. You can't take any of your wealth into the afterlife with you. 

&gt; If I have 100% ownership of my business and I don't want to sell stocks to the employees who have been with me for 20 years then I don't have to.

Is this you throwing a temper tantrum? ""I don't wanna! I don't wanna! Waaaaahhhhh!""

LOL. Forgive me. 

If the law said you had to, then you would have to. I can only imagine the kind of popular support an initiative like this would garner. I realize that may scare the crap out of you, but it's fair, whether monarchs want to acknowledge it or not. 

&gt; It is unfortunate when a 50-year employee is fired, but c'mon if you've been working for the same company for fifty years you've either already gotten stock options or you're retiring anyway. That employee may have been instrumental in the success of the company and if they have they will most likely have benefited through a much higher salary.

Crumbs. Food scraps. Not good enough. They have a stake in the company. They deserve a share and a say. Marx made the point that wages are kept as low as they can possibly be kept while still keeping an employee. Their compensation is not the amount they deserve, in reality. 

&gt; The difference between what you're proposing and this is that right now, the company will decide when to give shares, not the government.

Right. Even patents right now are only good for a limited time. There's no reason an individual should be granted perpetual ownership of a company. That's not fair. Just like the government insures employees have certain rights, they should also insure more rights, like the right to vote on things in their workplace and to share in the profits.",1,t1_c0bpze2,False,DebateIt,t5_2r2rb,cometparty,c0bpze2,0

Normally, the knife lies on the plate at a slight angle, blade facing inwards, and the diner eats with the fork in his right hand and his left hand in his lap.  Then, when he needs to cut something, he switches his fork into his left hand, picks up his knife with his right, cuts the offending foodstuff, and then switches back, whereupon he continues to eat with the fork in his right hand his left hand in his lap.

Now, in Europe -- I can't speak for Britain, but certainly in France -- this is horrifying.  Your hand in your lap while you're eating?  Gross.  The rules are much simpler: your knife is *always* in your right hand, and your fork *always* in your left.  The knife is used not only for cutting but also to push food onto your fork.  It's a superior method in virtually every way, save perhaps one: you primarily deliver food to your mouth using your left hand, which for most people is the non-dominant one.

Personally, having been raised that way, it never seemed strange.  Sometimes very small children will eat with just a fork in their right hands, but as soon as you're of a certain age you eat with a knife.

Americans frequently won't even set a knife at the table if the thing you are eating is not perceived to require cutting, e.g., salad or spaghetti.  Europeans *always* set a knife, because most of the time, you're actually using the knife to help you get food off the plate and onto your fork anyway.

While the term has been attributed to Latin per centum, this is a pseudo-Latin construction and the term was likely originally adopted from the French pour cent. The concept of considering values as parts of a hundred is originally Greek. The symbol for percent (%) evolved from a symbol abbreviating the Italian per cento.

However, extrapolating historic trends would not be useful to the future of the housing market.  The past 60 years saw the U.S. coast on an artificially high currency bloated by a headstart going out of WWII and deficit spending.  Ballooning population led to several luxury housing markets developing in what was previously the middle of nowhere (Aspen/Vail, the Florida panhandle, Las Vegas).

Moreover, the models cities have taken has shifted.  The introduction of the car saw the ""Chicago model,"" with a central city expanding outward in concentric circles.  A few major metro areas followed the ""Los Angeles model,"" with separate communities growing into each other (like Southern California, Dallas/Ft. Worth, the NC ""research triangle"").  Now we're seeing development in two specific areas that may not be sustainable:  Along interstates (again, the Florida panhandle is instructive) and in ex-urbs (rather than concentric suburbs like Chicago, a continuous vector of suburbs off in one direction moving away from tax bases).

I think the U.S. will be left with a lot of houses that are worth a lot less than they presently are unless rich people in other countries are interested in keeping the markets afloat.  Even still, foreign interest only extends to places people would like to spend time (Las Vegas/Henderson, Colorado, Beachfront property).  The ex-urbs of mid-sized American cities are not a particularly appealing investment as they require a lot of energy to get into the cities and don't offer some intrinsic value by spending time there (you don't get to sit on the beach, etc.).

Mortgages will be much higher and perhaps more selective in the future for desirable properties (the central cities of major American metro areas), while I think we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg as the rich jump out of the ex-urbs like rats from the Titanic.  We'll see gentrification in well-managed cities (the ones with great public transportation, municipal services, strong industrial sectors) and ghettoization of the previously-nice McMansion areas.  Like Europe, the affluent will want to be in the inner city in a few decades.

So, if you're investing in a slowly-gentrifying part of a major city (Chicago, Seattle, Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver, etc.) then yes, I think it can be a good investment.  If you're looking for the short savings on a suburban or ex-urban cul-de-sac McMansion, that may not hold its value so well.",2,t1_c0bq4d8,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,Taughtology,c0bq4d8,0

Also, what really sets Lambics and Gueuzes apart is not the spontaneous fermentation or the really neat open fermenters (or even other things that you didn't mention like the use of a large amount of unmalted wheat and aged hops) but the government protection that Belgium/EU places on these styles.

1426011190,t3_97oq7,,True,,1249503352,0,,2,True,t1_c0bpze2,0,"&gt;I actually think monarchy is much more fitting, since we're talking about private ownership, which predominantly (though not always) means individual ownership.

Calling private business ownership monarchy is disingenuous. The parallel is not as clear and straightforward as you seem to claim. I can see how one may interpret it as one, though only in a loose semantic sense based on the fact that ""one"" person is ownership of said company. However, monarchies tend to have a feeling of *absolute* power attached: the businessman can do whatever he deems fit with his company and those within, for they  are *his* to do with as he pleases. Just as we, as citizens of our nation, are the nation's to do with as the nation pleases.

If it became constitutionally illegal to say ""The flag sucks cock"" and the law stated that those who said such should be jailed for three months, then the government can do so. There is *no* higher power that can stop this. The only way this would change is if the nation itself -- represented by the government, ruled by the people in America's case -- decided to change it. This is the right of a sovereign government, which in the case of monarchy is placed in one man. 

What we see in business is something different. A businessman, no matter how much clout he has in a company, cannot keep you detained in the basement for saying anything, no matter how offensive he deems it. Nor would a business owner be able to put someone who displeases him to death. This isn't because the owner fears rebellion of the people, or that neighboring companies would wage war, but because there is a *government* overarching the company, which states that such things are illegal. The government is what guarantees and decides such things rather than the business owner. All the business owner can do is decide to no longer *employ* someone. While this can fill the shoes of a metaphorical death (firing) and dissipation of property (office supplies) by the state (business), it does not speak about the situation honestly. Instead, we have a highly biased model which insists where it should not. As it does here:

&gt;And they abuse this power, just like kings did.

How do they abuse their power? And, for that matter, *what* is this power that they ""abuse""? The only obvious power is that ownership: they own a company, they run it as they deem fit. 

&gt;Well, freeing slaves was terrifying to Southern slave owners. Democracy was terrifying to European monarchs. 

And the thought of someone laying claim on the table I made with my own hands is terrifying to me. For this point to be worth anything at all, you need to step back and realize that we're talking about *property* rather than government (so the European Monarchies are a bad analogy) and a piece of property which is *not* human (unlike slavery).

If we wish to take the argument and compare it to slavery, it might be fitting to specify *how* it's like slavery. This analogy misses a ciritical component: the alleged slave is still free. Anyone can leave a job to work for themselves, *set up* a co-op that works exactly you describe or another job that behaves according to a more traditional schema. No one is locked into a system at all. Instead, they can go  wherever they wish to and allocate their resources however they please in order to make money. 

Who are you to say someone *can't* go into a job without taking on the responcibility own *owning* a segment of it? There is stress associated with ownership of a company. As others have said, business owners stick their necks out. It's *them* and *their* livelihood on the line if it fails. They have a great deal of *personal* stake in the matter. What if I don't want that sort of personal stake? What if, when the company goes under, I want to be free to go off and say ""I worked hard and did my job well,"" without having the failure of a company *which is mine in part* brought back in  my face? There is liberty there. More so than in a system of forced responcibility.

&gt;They would still own them for a long time. Maybe even for most of their working career. Like I said, it would be gradual. You can't take any of your wealth into the afterlife with you.

The last point is rather moot, unless you want to start attacking someone's right to bequeath property after someone dies. 

Aside from this, the original owner placed a ton of risk when they began their business. Why should they have all of the risk and hard work in the beginning and none of the benefit at the end? It's one thing to see company shares vanish before the might of a hostile takeover and shrewd maneuvering, and another to see it *given* away because of some strange sense of equity. One is a risk business owners can expect, the other is a slap in the face.

&gt;Is this you throwing a temper tantrum? ""I don't wanna! I don't wanna! Waaaaahhhhh!""

It's a legitimate question for anyone who has believes people have a right to their property. If I came before you and demanded that you turn over your possessions at the point of a gun, would you be throwing a tantrum if you resisted? This is precisely what's going on if someone made a law to strip ownership of businesses from the owner to the workers. This is what happened when the government decided to strip away land from Native Americans. This is also what happened when the government decided to take slaves away from slave holders and levy taxes. There needs to be justification that extends beyond the barrel of a  gun or the end of a law. If it came down to a game of numbers or force, there would be no need to debate. So appealing to the authority of law or the majority to determine what is fair seems rather weak.

&gt;Crumbs. Food scraps. Not good enough.

Who are you to decide what is or isn't good enough? As I mentioned before, there are people who don't want the responcibility of owning a business. Why should they demand the perks of a risk they'd rather not take? Why should they be forced to take a risk they'd rather not have in order to earn a decent wage? 

&gt;Marx made the point that wages are kept as low as they can possibly be kept while still keeping an employee. Their compensation is not the amount they deserve, in reality.

In a healthy system, this isn't a bad thing. To shift the paradigm a bit, the commodity employees sell to employers is hours of time. If the employee sells their hours of time for too much, no one would want to purchase it. If they sell it for too low, the employee can't earn a living. Should we give bits of profit to the paper maker who makes the paper a company uses to work? They provided their service -- the paper *and paper making* -- and they get a discrete payment with no holding in the company.  Employees tend to have a greater stake, but still not a perfect stake because they are shielded from risk. If the company goes down, the paper maker looses a client and an employee lost a job. The employer *lost property* and all the investments made into that property. 

&gt;Right. Even patents right now are only good for a limited time. There's no reason an individual should be granted perpetual ownership of a company. That's not fair. Just like the government insures employees have certain rights, they should also insure more rights, like the right to vote on things in their workplace and to share in the profits.

Patents are given so that inventors can benefit from the concept of their invention. They made a new type of apple slicer. They are given exclusive rights to make more slicers for a set amount of time and profit from it. At no point is the actual slicer taken from them, let alone taken and given to the factory that made slicers *for* the inventor. It's given to the people to use the idea as they please. Why should something as novel as removing ownership rights and granting it to a subset tangentially involved in the piece of property become the norm? Should renters eventually become owners of a property, no matter how much they loved to tend the garden? Why should the renters be forced to keep a fancy garden at all if they don't want to?

Liberty is a tricky thing, especially when paired with ownership rights and economics. But I think *forced* ""democratic"" business models take things way too far. Especially if we tread into the mire of relationships between companies. If a company is under contract to perform services for another company, temporarily, does the employed company an employee of sorts who has a say in how the employer company runs? Why should *that* be fair? Do maids have a say in the households they clean, as they're employed by the owners for a time?

&gt; At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of some industrial and military significance. A number of military camps were located nearby, including the headquarters of the Fifth Division and Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's 2nd General Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan. Hiroshima was a minor supply and logistics base for the Japanese military. The city was a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops. It was one of several Japanese cities left deliberately untouched by American bombing, allowing a pristine environment to measure the damage caused by the atomic bomb.[citation needed]

The thing is, we already had been firebombing cities in [Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II) and Japan, killing about the same numbers of civilians as Little John and Fat Boy.

http://www.bookmice.net/darkchilde/japan/fire.html

&gt; The Japanese later listed over 83,000 dead in the attack [on Tokyo]; over 40,000 wounded and a total of 15.8 square miles of the city were burned to ashes with the destruction of 265,171 buildings. The intensity of the fire was so much that the water in the rivers reached the boiling point.

&gt; The bombing was continued and within ten days 32 square miles of Japanese cities basically ceased to exist. Bomber losses decreased during the process. By the end of April, 11 more square miles of cities had been destroyed. One and a half square miles of Yokohama, three and a half square miles of Kawasaki joined the areas destroyed.

After four years of war and [hundreds of thousands of US casualties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties), and all the atrocities committed by both the Germans and the Japanese, and the millions of Chinese casualties, nobody really gave a fuck about killing a few tens of thousands of Japanese. The context to consider a-bombing a couple of Japanese cities as an atrocity just wasn't there anymore.

The other factor rarely mentioned as motivation for the bombings is the Soviet Union. We already saw what Stalin did in East Europe, and we weren't about to let that happen again in Japan. If we had waited and planned an invasion of the archipelago, we might have ended up fighting Russian soldiers for northern Japan, or at least sharing victory with them, and possibly sharing control of the Pacific.

edit: Almost forgot... and so the second bomb was more for the Soviets than the Japanese, to make them think we had a larger supply than we really did, because we knew they were working on their own bomb.

&gt;1:42 ""Mr. Stewart's main point was that if the Japanese were warned, quote, then I think it would be okay""

That was not his ""main point"" at all.  These were his exact words, ""I think if you drop an atom bomb 15 miles offshore and you said 'the next ones coming and hitting you' then I would think it is okay.  To drop one on a city and kill 100,000 people, I think that is criminal.""

Very interesting that the presenter then interprets this statement as being primarily about a warning, leaving out the rather relevant difference that Stewart's first scenario involved a threat that kills no civilians and the second involved killing 100,000.  I think it is entirely reasonable to suggest that the number of civilians killed plays a rather important factor in Stewart's rejection of the action, even if this factor apparently played no important part for the presenter.

The presenter goes on, 

&gt;1:47 ~""America dropped a bunch of leaflets to warn them, which included the names of a bunch of cities as well as Nagasaki and Hiroshima"".

That, Mr. Presenter, is called propaganda.  It is essential to the nature of such ""warnings"" that some of them be genuine and most of them not, so that they can disrupt the morale of the enemy country as potentially credible threats without giving detailed plans of actual attacks.  Are we honestly supposed to believe that the average Japanese civilian was going to act in accordance with every propaganda leaflet dropped by the US during that war?  Should the allied soldiers in Europe have dropped their arms and surrendered because the Nazi's offered [really good health plans](http://tinyurl.com/l93462) in their POW camps?  Get real.

&gt;9:22 ""Hiroshima was not a purely civilian target""

Ah, but it was a civilian target, thank for at least having the bare minimum of integrity to admit that much.  And btw, New York city manufactured military goods in WWII, so hey, if someone wants to bomb it and hundreds of thousands or millions of civilians, all the more power to them.

&gt; 10:20 ~""Japan never would have surrendered to a demonstration, we know because they didn't surrender after the first bomb""

Yeah, so it takes a bit of time to formalize a surrender and convince a crazy emperor that it must be done.  All subsequent evidence shows that the entire country of Japan was in shock over the devastation of the first bomb and coming to grips with the reality of the existence of such a weapon, and we dropped the next one 3 days later.  Also, if they wouldn't have surrendered to a demonstration because, as the presenter suggests, they didn't even surrender to the first bomb, why the heck did they surrender to the second?  Remember, these were fanatically-crazy-zombie Japanese, at least that is how you portray them, so I'm still very confused as to why they didn't ""fight to the last man"" as you actually suggested they were trying to.

11:50 ~""Japan would have surrendered without the atomic bomb, and it might have taken [millions of lives on both sides]""

And if wishes were horses beggars would ride.  You can't credibly speculate on what ""might have happened"" when justifying an action that ensured it didn't happen 60 years later.  I can say ""Japan might have surrendered on August 10th without either bomb"" and give about as much evidence to support this idea that the presenter did (i.e. none).

12:00 ~""The US had already wiped out huge portions of large cities, none of that worked but the atomic bombs did""

So... if the actual loss of actual people and infrastructure wasn't what caused the surrender of Japan, but rather the existence of a ""new and terrible weapon"" according to the emperor.  So, this leads us back to the question, why exactly would a demonstration not have sufficed?  Oh right, because they were crazy-zombie-fanatical drones with no logic or reason, they were evil yellow skins who only know how to respond when you kill hundreds of thousands of them.

Their navy was destroyed, 85% of major cities had been reduced to rubble, industrial/war output was down to almost nothing and most of the civilian population was starving.  Add to that the fact that Russia was joining in and Germany was defeated leaving our full war machine to attack Japan, it's very likely the war could have been won with a simple blockade at that point.

Having said that, I feel that it was absolutly the correct decision to drop the bomb.  First off, I do believe that even though an invasion of the mainland wouldn't have been necessary, it still saved hundreds of thousands of lives (especially Japanese lives that would have been killed in firebombing raids) from further months of desperation fighting.  Second, it cemented the United States as the clear victor of WWII.  While this is clearly beneficial to the US, it is also good for the world in that there was a clear and decisive end to The War.  If the bombing didn't happen, it is possible that we would have had to go to war with the Russians over control of Europe and spheres of influence.  At the end of The War, the Russians had a much larger military presense in Eastern Europe and could have easily pushed their sphere of influence further into Western Europe which had the potential to prolong the war even after the Axis Powers had been defeated.

Drug companies are private organizations, of course they're going to be looking out for their own interest. From a monetary standpoint, it makes a great deal of sense why malaria, yellow fever, and similar diseases haven't been eradicated yet--it's just not worth it. There's enough research done by universities such that a drug company could buy up a patent and begin mass-producing drugs to deal with these diseases, but the bottom line indicates that it's just not possible.

Think about what pharmaceutical companies make money on. It's marketing to the quick-fix culture of most of Western civilization. You have high blood pressure? Have a pill. Trouble sleeping? Take another pill. Aching? More medicine. The whole cycle is absurd--you take caffeine in the morning to stay awake, Ambien at night to help you sleep. You eat fried foods and fatty red meat, and take Lipitor to lower your cholesterol.

The problem is really in the patent system, not in the drug companies. A drug company generates profits by protecting patents exclusively--not by developing or manufacturing pills. If the patents were gone, there would be no drug companies. Additionally, the 14% figure is huge when it comes to innovation. Drug development is extraordinarily difficult inherently, getting a viable product is extremely rare given FDA/EU regulations and so forth. Keep in mind that most research directors for these companies are PhDs or PharmDs, and they don't exactly command small salaries. I received an offer from a pharmaceutical company for an internship in which I would be salaried at $960 a week. I haven't even graduated college yet, and if I were taking it as a job it would be $48K a year. And keep in mind, this is a wage given to stay competitive.

* 500+ year active history in trading, diamonds, multicultural, urban design

* Netherlands has one of the densest train network in the world. You can say that The Netherlands effectively is a city, with Amsterdam as it centre. Most other towns reachable within 2 hours by train
* Decent metro network, bike allowed to take
* Schiphol Airport is very good reachable by train, bus, car
* People are internationally minded (95% speak English well), comparable with New York (New York once was called New Amsterdam untill the English traded it for Suriname)
* Several [World Heritage](http://www.werelderfgoed.nl/pages/en.php) sites present in near area
* Housing is OK, several campusses available scattered around city
* Two universities (University of Amsterdam and Vrije Universiteit)
* Financial capital of Netherlands, as well as cultural, business, ICT and tourism
* If you like urban design, Netherlands is the place to be: [Delta works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltawerken), [Canals of Amsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam), [KeukenHof](http://www.keukenhof.nl/index/en/), [Aflsuitdijk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsluitdijk), [Flevoland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland) (A state completely claimed from the sea).
* People here generally are hospitable, direct, open (email me and i'll offer you a beer and guide you, or answer any question)
* Our national holiday ([Koninginnedag, April 30th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koninginnedag)) is free trade &amp; party day everywhere
* You can see much of the country by bicycle if you like to camp out. Staying a few weeks longer for a camping trip by bicycle is cheap, you can get to see very much small idyllic towns. Much culture and history very closely packed, Netherlands is one of the densest countries in the world
* Lot of classic and modern art museums (Painters like [Vincent van Gogh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh), [Rembrandt van Rijn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_van_Rijn))
* You can buy weed and hashies if you are 18+ years in coffeeshops

not true. Lots of people do. It's completely optional.

&gt;You'd be strongly incentivized against letting your house burn down, because it's better to owe money on a house you can live in than to owe money on a smoldering pile of ash.

House is the collateral for the loan. If you stop paying the loan, the bank gets the house -- whatever condition it's in. There is nothing else they can claim besides the collateral.

&gt;So you'd call the fire protection service that you were subscribed to and give them an order to come protect your house.

right... because you are at home all the time, just in case this happens.

&gt;And again, without bankruptcy, no easy way for him to duck it if you win.

So out of curiosity, what do you do with the people who genuinely can't pay? Let's suppose the crazy neighbor from your example not only lost all his equity in the house but also lost his job and savings due to the recession? If he can't declare bankruptcy, what do you do with him?
Also, if there is no bankruptcy for individuals, would there still be bankruptcy for corporations? If the answer is no, would the shareholders be liable for the debts? [As an aside, a significant number of american settlers were escaping from their creditors back in Europe.]

&gt;It's not necessary to socialize/populize the services you mentioned (police, fire, basic health care, etc); doing so is just an easy answer to a complex problem, and is, more than anything, a sign of simplistic (and ultimately, unrealistic) thinking.

On the contrary, it is the recognition that world is more complex than a school textbook would have you believe. Pure ideologies do not work. You, however, seem to think that ""privatize it"" is the answer to every problem.

&gt;And it's been proven time and time again that most populized/socialized systems just don't work.

False. Every developed country with socialized medicine (UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Australia -- you name it) has better health care outcomes and lower costs than the US system. That's a fact. If you cannot acknowledge it, we have nothing further to discuss.

&gt;As to your ""hybrid"" solution: There is no universal definition of ""basic,"" and once you establish ""basic"" healthcare, it will only continue to grow, and the proponents of the growth will be happy to borrow a phrase you've used: They will tell us it's being done by necessity.

Agreed, but now we are just negotiating where to draw the line. That can be settled through the democratic process.

&gt;Just look at ""basic"" education, which now covers K-12, college, and is looking to expand downward to preschool. Insanity. Utter insanity.

College is certainly not free in US and neither is daycare for preschool children. And just to make sure I understand what you are suggesting, do you want to get rid of public education?

&gt;Subscriptions would be a g model for police protection and fire protection, as well as basic health care... Insurance is a great way to handle advanced health care, accidents, and the insurance model would also probably would well for fire protection (though not likely for police protection... maybe for advanced police services).

So somebody who cannot afford the subscription does not get police protection? Also, what constitutes ""advanced police services""? Are you really so callous as to make the victims pay police for protection? Isn't this the kind of ""protection"" I can get from the mob?

&gt;Charity, of course, is the free market's way of making sure the apparent scads of ""disadvantaged people"" don't get left behind.

Are you seriously suggesting that charity is the way to solve health care crisis? That doesn't seem to be working for 50 million americans. In your reply you have demonstrated sociopathic callousness and indifference to the suffering of others. You would have me believe that you are a charitable person?

&gt;They are, however, voluntary, and not funded by coercion, which is really the important factor. 

I think you are confusing coercion with democracy. Sometimes democratic process will lead to decisions you don't like (for example, I don't like that the speed limit is 65mph).

Google for the ""8.2k cooling"" and the ""Younger Dryas"".

Neither of these events are known to be global.  The 8.2 ka event had some global effect, but the evidence for remarkable rate of change comes mostly from Greenland; and the Younger Dryas had much less strong impacts outside of Greenland and western Europe.

Also, both of these rapid cooling events were likely triggered by meltwater pulses from glacial lakes interfering with the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.  I know of no method to cause a similar upward jump in temperature above the planet's steady-state temperature.

**Edit**:  Oh, another thing to point out is that the planet was undergoing a deglaciation during the time of these events, which is what caused the meltwater pulses in the first place.  Because they didn't change the planet's thermodynamic budget beyond transitory effects on albedo, they were pretty much bumps on the road to a naturally warmer climate.

To a degree, yes it is.

Europe (especially UK, where I live): not so much wilderness and a recognition that we need to look after what there is - organic farming has been proven to be enormously more beneficial to wildlife and can still provide us with our food.

  I've been to the Hiroshima Memorial Museum and seen the actual documents signed by the likes of [Albert Einstein](http://imgur.com/Oi9ce.jpg) (sorry for the poor quality of the picture) who were suggesting that it was a bad idea to drop the bomb on Hiroshima.  

  [Others](http://imgur.com/HMGHk.jpg) were worried that things in Europe would have gone so well that the U.S. wouldn't have the opportunity to let this ""new weapon...show its strength,"" in the words of the Sectretary of War at the time.  I have other pictures of actual letters written to the then U.S. administation from the very scientists who helped to develop the Atomic Bomb imploring them not to use it.

  Many deplorable events have happened, and I'm lucky not to have been any closer than California to Oklahoma during any major ones, but I feel more stongly about this one event which happened so much more quickly to so many more people who couldn't have even conceived of it, whose government didn't even have the opportunity to warn them against it, than I have against the other many atrocities that have happened before and since.  Hiroshima should have been the end of Nuclear weaponry, and the fact that it wasn't is perhaps the greatest tragedy of all.",0,t1_c0br1im,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,tronk,c0br1im,0

The only reason to compile such nonsense is to use as an excuse to promote pretentious and short-sighted policies that don't take the full scope of causes and consequences into account, because the authors lack the intellectual capacity to do so.  

Take a look at infant mortality.  Sparta had very high infant mortality, but this is a reflection of the greatness - not weakness of their society.

I used to hold Harvard in the highest esteem, but lately I'm convinced that it's become a second-tier institution.  It used to be like Chicago, all old men in tweed jackets and bow-ties who knew what was up and weren't afraid to let you know it, like Zeus hurling thunderbolts from on high.  Now the intellectual climate at Harvard is fagtarded garbage and some random lesbian writing a dissertation about her vagina gets put on the same pedestal as Albert Einstein there.  (the article is an example of what I'm talking about)

If people like the authors got their way, things would be even worse.  Countries in Europe have solid statistics because they don't (or didn't used to) have shitloads of crackhead niggers and spics to make the statistics look bad.  (it sounds racist, it is racist, but it's true!)

I mean, intellectual midgets are going to be like, you're racist and therefore not worth talking to, but it's really the midgets who aren't worth talking to because they're closed-minded hypocrites.  And yet it seems impossible for a man to be in a situation where he's not surrounded by them.

The campaign was disastrously ineffective – considering the amount of money that went into it. It was so ineffective that the Bill&amp;Melinda gates foundation pulled funding.

Looking back, the Penguins got the best end of the deal there by FAR. Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson were fan favorites and keys to their two cups, while Grant Jennings was a decent (albeit not overwhelming) defenceman. They gave up John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski, and Jeff Parker. But hindsight is 20:20. At the time, this seemed like much more of a gamble.

Cullen was leading the scoring race at the time of the trade (with over 90 points, and would finish with 110 for the season) and had had a 90 point season the year before. Zarley Zalapski was a former 1st round draft pick (4th overall) who had 48 points with the Pens and a solid hip check, but had begun to rankle under Bob Johnson's system (requiring a change of scenery). Jeff Parker was a throw-in, but he was mid-twenties D-man with the looks of potential.

So, let's call Parker and Jennings a wash. The Whalers traded a fan favorite but (they thought) peaking centerman for a younger, faster scoring leader. Zarley Zalapski was a scoring d-man, while Ulf was always a punisher, so that was more for taste than quality, but still considered a move up in the offense department. In Pittsburgh, many thought that this could have been a major bust.

But Francis turned out to be FAR from over in his career. Ulf never made a difference in goals for, but his ""borderline"" dirty play helped give some grit to the otherwise finesse-heavy Pens (and later, the Rangers). Jennings proved a capable player who would remain in Pittsburgh for another few seasons before quietly fading into the minors.

Cullen's best days were behind him, however. He finished the next season with 77 points, got injured, and never got above 55 points again. He also suffered from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which caused him to retire early.

Zalapski had two solid seasons with the Whalers (57 and 65 points) before becoming injured. He was traded to the Flames, never regained his scoring touch, and bummed between the NHL, minor leagues, and European leagues, where he still plays.

Jeff Parker played four games for the Whalers before becoming injured and retiring.

I accept your counter-arguments, and will bear them in mind next time I'm over. I must confess, my experiences of America have been for a fair part less than wonderful. Don't get me wrong - as I said previously, I *know* that my initial statement was a gross generalization - I've had some fantastic experiences while out there, but some experiences that have been so negative they've seriously dented my impression of the country as a whole.

When I lived in Chicago, it was from the age of 7 til 17 - I lived in white suburbia north of Chicago, where there were sidewalks where you would not see a soul, *ever*. The city I lived in had no center, no business district, nothing - a couple of supermarkets dotted around, and a mall a 20 minute drive away, filled with the same stores you see everywhere else. As for community - there really wasn't any - everyone lived in their McMansions, drove their kids to school half a mile away, and commuted to work downtown - if you wanted to meet people, the only place in town was the church.

As for my adult experiences of America - they've been far better, admittedly, than my childhood there, but something still lacks. I've principally spent time in Charlottesville, VA, New York, Boston, Denver and LA - the cities are busy, and full of people, but there's no conversation, no interaction beyond the superficial. In the setting of the majority of various clients I've worked with, the tendency is towards very formal, utterly work-oriented interactions, with no personality behind them.

Ultimately, I suppose the principle difference between American culture and European culture that has really defined America for me is down to the level of sociality. Brits are seen by Americans as being uptight and reserved - they are - but when they open up, they really do - crack a Brit's crusty outer shell and everything comes spilling out. Americans are superficially very, very open, but damn near impossible to know beyond that superficial level (again, I know this is a generalisation, but it's been my experience of them).

Anyway - I'm not criticising America - I'm criticising the modern tendency to dismiss real world community as irrelevant - it's a genuine shame, and it's not a uniquely American phenomenon.",0,t1_c0brcuu,False,WTF,t5_2qh61,[deleted],c0brcuu,0

**Part Eight: Kazakhstan**

It was a nightmare getting here. More problems at the kazak border, arriving late at night, helpless in the hands of cowboy taxi drivers, counting on the good will of people.

that you can draw a line in the dirt, build a fence and create 2 separate worlds. this is what the border was, a division between eastern and western empires, where both Chinese and European expansion had faced each other over
thousands of years and finally? stopped.

I write some observations on the way to Almaty, Kazakhstan’s capital:

squat white houses with tin roofs.
flat plains. the sun glowing between clouds. Dramatic.
police checkpoints.
automatic weapons.

Arriving at midnight and stumbling into a hotel room without any kazak money, without any food all day, exhausted and grimy but unable to sleep. I watch Bay watch in Russian before falling into to a nervous doze.

then the next morning, the first few hours in kazakstan like coming awake from some year long dream. I wandered around peering in astonishment at slabs of cheese and chocolate bars, gorging myself on bread and milk.

Almaty itself, broad tree lined boulevards scattered with reds and yellows. sculptures hidden among the many parks - huge soviet inspired creations half emerging from stone, blotting out the sky. I was out of place again, but this time because of my scruffy attire and my backpack - a terrible giveaway. I was targeted by pickpockets on one of the buses, but they were too clumsy. There were 3 of them and they tried three times, jamming me between them. I was so furious by my own helplessness that I threw the third
one across the bus and scrambled out at the next stop, cursing myself for forgetting the word for thief in Russian, (its vor, by the way).

But I had to leave. I got my visa, painless but expensive and left after only 2 days for Uzbekistan.

Never take the night bus. The bus was ancient, a disgusting old thing, crammed with travellers of all descriptions. After only 10 minutes from leaving the station, we stopped and the driver let on at least 20 more people, gypsies and villagers, who filled every conceivable space, crouching in the aisles and the doorway. I dozed again, understandably nervous, travelling by myself, not understanding what was being said. There had been stories of hold ups on this road.

At three in the morning the bus stopped in the middle of nowhere and the driver ordered everyone off. In the confusion I was pick pocketed again and this time he took everything from by back pockets. He was a fat oldish man
with thick fingers who said ""Da Da Da"" - yes yes yes - as he squeezed past. I discovered it immediately and confronted him, but forgetting the word for thief again, (VOR VOR!) - just yelling and pushing him and got everything back. Amazed at my own stupidity.

4 o’clock in the morning and onto a different bus, this time standing in the isle, completely paranoid and wishing for dawn.

It came painfully slowly, passing checkpoints we made our way into Shymkent - still in Kazakhstan - with ""Only You"" by Elvis playing over the loudspeakers. the bus stopped again, not to go further. I knew by now, my ticket to Tashkent was useless; I stuck with other travellers going to Uzbekistan and raced toward the border.

And it was somewhere here, in the complicated maze that separated the Kazak and Uzbek bureaucracy that I took a step back in time.

For Uzbekistan is frozen somewhere in the 60s or 70s. every car is a 30 year old Skoda or Lada, the corner stores have big old scales, glass fronted counters and coca cola in glass bottles. the bread is 10cents and stacked like gold bars on the shelves of cool stores. the metro stops are beautiful, vaulted ceilings covered in marble and paintings. in every park old women sell ice-cream and tea that pours out of enormous contraptions for 5cents.

There is no citizenship of Gaza or the West Bank as it is not an independent state. Apart from that Israel will frequently not even allow Palestinians to return to the West Bank or Gaza even if they have been away for some time.

The point is not that Israel is not allowing millions of descendants of refugees to return, the point is there would not be millions of descendants if they had allowed them to return in the first place. And yes, of course there are precedents. Descendants of refugees return to their former countries all the time, like in Eastern Europe and all over South America after a dictatorship has been removed.

American Christianity, is often used more to justify power, than to follow Jesus. This has been true of European Christianity before there was a US.

Not to say there aren't lots and lots of effective manifestations of Christians living the life, walking the walk, and the Holy Spirit manifesting through them. We don't hear very much about them, but then that is the nature of humility, as well as the nature of the worldy powers that oppose them.

Consider this analysis from [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/200704--.htm)

&gt;So, for example, the U.S. has often been bitterly opposed to Christianity. That painting (points to a picture) is an illustration of the hatred of U.S. leaders for the Catholic Church. It was given to me 15 years ago by a Jesuit priest. It is a painting of the Angel of Death on one side with Archbishop Romero, who was assassinated, and right below are six leading intellectuals who were murdered by an elite U.S.-run battalion. That framed the decade of the 1980s: Romero was assassinated by U.S.-backed forces in 1980, Jesuit priests in 1989 and, in between, the U.S. carried out a major war against the Catholic Church. Many of the victims of (President) Reagan’s efforts in Central America were nuns, lay workers, and for clear and explicit reasons, which you can see officially stated, like the famous School of America, which trains Latin American officers. One of its advertising points is that the U.S. Army helped defeat liberation theology, which was a dominant force, and it was an enemy for the same reason that secular nationalism in the Arab world was an enemy – it was working for the poor. This is the same reason why Hamas and Hezbollah are enemies: they are working for the poor. It doesn’t matter if they are Catholic or Muslim or anything else; that is intolerable. The Church of Latin America had undertaken “the preferential option for the poor.” They committed the crime of going back to the Gospels. The contents of the Gospels are mostly suppressed (in the U.S.); they are a radical pacifist collection of documents. It was turned into the religion of the rich by the Emperor Constantine, who eviscerated its content. If anyone dares to go back to the Gospels, they become the enemy, which is what liberation theology was doing.

I consider myself at least somewhat experienced when it comes to finding channels and have been honing these skills for the past years. I would say also that your problem is the most common problem that people have when they feel 'stuck'.

On to the advice:

This might sound impractical and not much of a good advice, so I'll get it out of the way first: make sure you have some money and, if it helps you, a backup plan to travel home and find a quick job to not starve. Then, just go to a big city somewhere. Or a town, if you prefer. if it's abroad, research the situation of visa's and such. In many cases you can go anywhere and stay for three months at least, and that's plenty of time to get some new ideas, learn how to be adventurous and see if the place you came to is worth coming back to. It might also make you realize you don't crave adventure quite as much as you thought. I think many people have the ideal of adventure because of cultural influence. It's not for everyone though.

Now, more practically on to the channels. 

1. Join CouchSurfing.org . It's a huge network of people all over the world who not only travel, but love nothing more than to accept travelers. In the first place, this will give you a place to stay wherever you go. It's quite possible to find 'couches' for long periods, and if you take a bit of time you can string them together and stay in a place for weeks, if not months, hopping from couch to couch.  More importantly, you will simultaneously build up a network of friends and acquaintances  that can help you get a job, see great stuff, feel part of a group and even at home. And all that in weeks. As a springboard to greater opportunities and great friendships I have not found anything better.

2. Join local clubs of your interest, and if necessary, find the 'pockets' of foreigners that inhabit many parts of the world, especially the big cities. These people can be found at hostels, but also through CS and language schools. There are usually also cafés where some others like you might congregate. Found out where these places are! While hanging out with them too much might hamper your assimilation in the new place, and put you in a bubble, especially at first they can be great help with the oddities and tricks that true locals might not know or care about.

3. Wander. Especially in Europe it is quite possible to hitchhike (although more difficult if you're older), but you can also take short flights, carpool, and of course stay at hostels. Basically, look for any situation where you are naturally 'forced' to interact with locals or other people who might be knowledgeable.

Ultimately, all these 'channels' serve what another commenter said: you won't discover opportunities until you go somewhere. Keep yourself from wanting to plan it all ahead, because then it will just be like a vacation. Take the risk of jumping into these situations, and engaging with the people I mentioned, and great stuff will come. It always has for me.

Personality might have some effect, yes. If you're a horrible person it's probably going to be more difficult to get into these networks. But I'm not the most social of people and I'm continually amazed at how things go. 

I'm currently in Sao Paulo where I came pretty much on a whim. I don't speak portuguese and have a very limited budget. First three weeks I couchsurfed, then things just happened. I found a cheap apartment, I have a whole bunch of true friends, both locals and other foreigners, and some social circles to call my own. I have a number of possible jobs to get when I return here (have to go back to Amsterdam for a bit), either through friends or information I now know. It al just... happened.

&gt; the point is there would not be millions of descendants if they had allowed them to return in the first place

Also, there is no precedent of countries preventing refugees from having citizenship just to prolong the conflict, as the Arab countries are doing with the Palestinian refugees.

After a prolonged and unsuccessful period of therapy, Jung told Hazard that his case, like that of most alcoholics, was nearly hopeless—the only possibility for a cure was through spiritual conversion.[9][10] Back in America, Rowland Hazard joined the Oxford Group, a Christian Evangelical association.[11] The group advocated finding God through a spiritual surrender, moral inventory, confession of defects, elimination of sin, restitution, reliance upon God, and helping others. (Bill Wilson later gave credit for the concepts behind Steps Three through Twelve to the teachings of Rev. Samuel Moor Shoemaker of the Oxford Group.[12][13]) Through the Oxford group, Hazard underwent a spiritual conversion and achieved his long hoped for sobriety.

Implied was a horrific war of tens of thousands of warriors over many years.  Tribes could send hunting parties into the State, but long term camping was strictly forbidden.

To explain, geographically Kentucky was strategically vital even through the US Civil War, because it was the essential crossroad of both East and West, and North and South.  Whoever controlled Kentucky dominated North America East of the Mississippi.  As far as the northern and southern tribes were concerned, it was off-limits.

This was vital to the westward expansion of the Europeans, because westward routes through the North and the South were blocked by these tribes.  But right then, the colonies received new immigrants, some of the toughest of the Europeans, the Scots Borderers, lowland Scots, and others who had been expelled by the English.

These were the ""frontier founding fathers"".  They moved into empty Kentucky, and built forts.  And the Indians could not dislodge these very tough people, despite pitched and bloody battles.

But the question remains about that great war, a war so horrible that an entire State was needed to keep the two armies apart.  The colonists soon learned how brutal this kind of war could be, when they fought the northern tribes in Pontiac's Rebellion.  Savagery and butchery on both sides.

The lead story a few nights ago on ABC, NBC, and CBS' nightly newscast was:

* Obama's ""Beer summit""

Now, this might be appropriate to highlight for 3 minutes at the most, but these networks spent nearly 1/3-1/4 of the broadcast dedicated to this issue that had been pounded into the ground for days.

Fortunately, I was refreshed to see *The News Hour with Jim Lehir* lead the newscast with a lengthy segment about the [Spanish barracks bombing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8173727.stm) in Burgos. I would argue that ethnocentric view of the MSM networks is taken on purpose, to distract from *real* issues, like health care. 

So I don't buy that it's only Republicans who have an interest in preventing meaningful health care legislation. It seems that the corporate media is genuinely trying to prevent this, when they've sucked Obama's cock on nearly everything else. I wonder **why**?

People have begun using the term ""blue dog"" quite frequently in recent weeks -- to differentiate between the ""good"" and ""bad"" Democrats. But when you look closer, you see that members of both parties are in the back pocket of corporations and are voting against your interests, so where does that leave people? Conspiracy. 

They so firmly believe in the false dichotomy generated by the two mainstream parties, they see their agendas as being opposite -- but how different are they? Gay marriage still hasn't happened; we have a continuing ""war on drugs""; the war machine is still turning in the middle east -- how different is life for most Americans than when George Bush was in office? Sure, I like Obama more, but things haven't changed on a personal or social level for most Americans.

I'm not expecting things to change in six months, but when Democrats have been walking an eerily similar line in policy as Republicans for eight years, it pretty much zeros out any credibility for either party.

What if the solution to global warming doesn't fix any of these problems?   What if we end up paying some company like exon 1 trillion to filter CO2 out of the air?  We've solved very little in terms of biodiversity loss.  Agreed?

no argument there.

It benefits the customer to tip fairly rather than excessively because collectively it improves the quality of service. 

While you claim that non-tipping works fine in Europe, I've never had worse service than in my travels there. And why would it be excellent? Servers get mediocre wages with little or no added incentive.

When there are more connection points, it's easier to arrange an alternative route. Those points will also have more storage available, because that's required when switching modes. As a downside, loading the cargo in another mode of transport will delay the total time a given object is underway. The flow of resources should be just as fast, and more resilient: if a train breaks down, you can have trucks as backup measure. If you already rely on trucks completely, and ff prices rise (as they inevitably will), you're up shit creek without a paddle.

&gt;The sudden affordability of the car

The sudden affordability of compressed energy in a convenient package, i.e. petroleum. Which is a one-time only bonanza, and will be not affordable anymore just as suddenly. Gradually rising tax is just a way to smoothe the transition on our own terms.

&gt;You're making a ethos argument here, not a logos one.

No. Dense living allows for more energy-efficient transportation. That's why cities exist.

&gt;... That has got to be the single most absurd thing I have read in weeks.

Drop thousand accountants and bankers with a trillion dollars on an island. Drop a thousand shipwrights and mechanics with materials to build a ship on an island. Guess who gets home first?

&gt;More sophisticated systems cost more -- especially when that sophistication is being applied to ecological standards. The more sophisticated the system, generally, the more costly it is.

Earlier technology often was cheaper ánd more ecological, by necessity. The reason that more advanced technology is more energy expensive, is that energy hasn't been a limiting factor in the last century and there was always more available at a bargain price. Now it's time to focus our efforts on efficiency gains, and a ff tax will stimulate that.

&gt;Thank Cthulhu you're not in charge of things. No. That's absolutely absurd. The level of social injustice and turmoil you're recommending in so blithe a manner says to me that you have no clue what you're discussing.

Shub-Nigurrath is on my side! It will inevitably happen. The free marketeers' approach is just to wait until depletion naturally makes the ff prices rise, at wich point the same turmoil will happen, but the other taxes will still be at the current high level.

&gt;And whenever the rates are raised, the effects are as I describe.

As an example, see other places where ff taxes are higher. In Europe, car engines are just much more efficient as a result of consistently higher taxes.

&gt;... a guarantee of disaster.

What's the argument? Taxes are already levied. It's just changing a number in the calculation from eg. 0,5% to 5%. When cleverly applied, it can eliminate other taxes. It's a breakeven, in the worst case.

&gt;Actually, humans are better adapted to desert environments than they are to temperate climates. Barring access to water, LV and PHX are better places to situate a large population.

Given the right adaptations, which will not happen as long as ff are that cheap.

&gt;Again, that's an ethos argument, not a logos argument. You're trying to take the moral high ground on an entirely practical discussion. It's... a flawed approach.

It's an entirely practical argument, based on energy costs. Lifestyle is a choice subject to practical constraints: arguing that reality should adapt to support lifestyle choices is absurd, and ironically a moral argument where you value the personal opinion of the persons involved higher than the objective energy costs of a house in the suburbs vs. one in the city.",0,t1_c0bsa6y,False,science,t5_mouw,silverionmox,c0bsa6y,0

I'm really unclear on exactly what it is you're on about.

Apple does not sell Leopard for use on mass-market PCs. Apple does not support Leopard on mass-market PCs. Apple specifically sells it for upgrading your fully-supported Mac.

Since that is the case, **why on Earth are you attacking Apple for not supporting hardware that they've specifically stated isn't supported?** And while I'm not sure what you're referring to with regards to Apple breaking Hackintosh compatibility (link please?), there is **absolutely no contract** that states that Apple needs to support third-party computers.

&gt; Additionally, although the components are the same as you find in low-cost ""PCs,"" Apple has decided to significantly increase the price of the hardware.

Whenever this argument comes up, I've managed to spec similar Windows hardware at within several hundred dollars. Since Apple has positioned itself as a premium product, it's reasonable for them to be more expensive. Even the Mac Pro, while overkill, is actually not hideously overpriced if you actually look at what hardware they're using (those Xeon Nehalem chips are not cheap!)

&gt; Windows is clearly superior in that it supports far more hardware than Mac does.

This is a very strange argument for superiority. If you're looking to install Windows on every computer you see, I suppose it's true. I seriously have never wanted or needed to install Mac OS X on everything with a CPU, so Windows is not superior for my needs.

&gt; Microsoft gets attacked for even including its own browser with Windows without offering users a choice of competing products. How can Apple get away with this? How can Apple get away with things such as breaking the ability for competing mp3 players to sync with iTunes?

I'll give you this one. While the original anti-trust suit was specifically dealing with illegal practices Microsoft was participating in, I'm really not sure what the EU is on about with Windows 7 and IE (and before that, XP and Windows Media Player). Since Apple has a near-monopoly in MP3 players, I'm also interested to see whether or not there's any fallout from them attempting to break syncing with the Pre - but iTunes started out as compatible with many manufacturer's third-party MP3 players and I'm not sure what the problem with the Pre is.

&gt; Why is it that while Apple has done significantly more to intentionally break competing products and force users to stick with its entire line of hardware/software/devices, it doesn't gather the same criticism as Microsoft? Why has no serious anti-trust suit been filed against Apple over their obvious moves to eliminate competition?

There's a difference between selling something as a monopoly in a competitive marketplace and just being the *only one* that makes a widget. Apple is the only one that makes Macs, and they're allowed to protect their Mac-making business. Microsoft is not the only one who makes computer operating systems, and they strong-armed manufacturers into helping maintain their monopoly. If Apple had 90% of computer market share (measured in units) and performed illegal tactics to strong-arm retailers into keeping only Macs on shelves, they'd be in trouble with the government as well.",8,t1_c0bsb9x,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,rufosanch,c0bsb9x,0

The economy is in such a bad state they have to action that last resort.. that a few months back was suggested as last line of defense type of action.

To answer the OP, I don't think that there is such anger here in the UK directed at the banks, so much as irritation that our Government is stupid in the way it blindly follows the US in all it's mistakes. It's more just disappointment in the banking industry atm and possibly a  level of realistic guilt from those who overstretched.

The BoE has had a good reputation having not caused trouble before; and it's also distinct from the auditors that should have caught the unsustainable activities. It's also not thought of as an independent greedy representation of other interests but just a dull element that is there to meet .gov targets to bring stability in the economy.

Similarly the ECB isn't particularly considered the villain but then most people have little idea what it does beyond it being one step beyond the national banks.

I'd suggest much of the anger here is directed at the US government and if at any central bank then the FED itself.

If the public did rise up here or in Europe it would likely be Government that would get it in the neck first.. it's institutions letting us down that has people riled atm. Maybe banks might see future demonstrations of anger in the form of loss of confidence, withdrawal of money etc.. but far more likely it'll be the Labour Government getting kicked in the nuts when the General Election happens next year, rather than calls for dismembering of the BoE or ECB.",1,t1_c0bsc0w,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,davidpbrown,c0bsc0w,0

The only way to do it is through the operator's &lt;&lt;photo transfer&gt;&gt; service, which costs $2/photo."" Similarly just about every other functionality of that cell phone that the operator believed that they could charge for was crippled so that they did. This is somehow an inherent part of the SIM-less CDMA telephony system, where you're pretty much stuck with buying a handset from your operator, and you usually get it for close to nothing, but then pay thru your nose for services. (it seems like you end up in a much worse situation in the US as a consumer, and yet US operators seem to be making less money than their European couterparts)

Anyway in Europe you always had this option too - you get like a Vodafone-branded handset if you want to get a subsidized phone from your operator and the minimum crippling that you'll get is that SIM cards from other operators won't work at all with your phone. Actually I don't think I ever saw any extra crippling being done on phones in Europe, but I guess it's possible. The difference is that you can always go to like a computer store and get a completely unlocked phone that you can use with any operator, no restrictions.

Now this is utterly impossible with Apple! Doesn't matter who your operator is or where you got your phone, you still have to go through the Apple store to get your apps, you still can't freely use VoiP applications if Apple doesn't want you to, etc. Is tethering now possible?

We're talking about the sum total of all human history.  Multitudes of separate and disparate societies that vary from one another in many ways, which hold one thing in common - no acknowledgement of this idea that an interest in the same sex means, with high probability, that you are not interested in the opposite sex.  How do you believe these early societies arose?  How was it that all of these separate societies, developing entirely separately, all conspired to deny and defeat a foundational aspect of human nature?

&gt;Your examples are relevant but I don't agree that they prove the point you're putting them forward for: that this is a true/r representation of free sexuality.

I did not claim they proved my point.  As I very clearly said, they are but one example that is repeated over and over and over in each and every single society created since man evolved from our common ancestor with apes as far as we know.  I just gave one example.  You can pick ancient greece, the anciest Far East, native American tribal customs, south american native societies, African tribes, all of European society leading up to the Victorian era, absolutely any one of them.  They all feature an acceptance of the universality of sexuality that only Victorian and post-Victorian cultures have ever denied (with no evidence, it should be noted).

&gt;Those children in your Papua New Guinea tribe have no choice about engaging in homosexual acts, it doesn't demonstrate that that's their natural preference at that time.

That is true.  However, if the will of the children were being violated (there is no indication that it is, no account I have read of claimed the boys were forced to engage in anything they didn't care to, in fact it was the choice of the boy when to leave his mother and enter into the communal hut) the society would quickly change or be dismantled.  Those that decide the future of the tribe are those who went through the experience themselves and would have the power to change it.  It might persist from sheer social pressure for a few generations, maybe even many... but to think it would persist for thousands of years is a bit far-fetched.

&gt;I didn't say there was an intrinsic difference, don't put words into my mouth, I said a preference was set relatively early in life.

I'm not putting words into your mouth, I am talking about the general impression of society and the ideas suggested most commonly.  And even if you believe a preference is set early in life, you believe that the preference is so strong that it does instrinsically change them.  For instance, if a man freely has sex with another man, you would claim that, with quite high probability, that he would have no interest in having sex with a woman, correct?  That is the basic definition of the homosexual preference, is it not?  That is a difference between a man who you would predict there to be a high preference that they would be interested in having sex with a woman.  One is gay, the other is straight.  Both sides are different from one another and have their preferences.  It's a nice and neat proposition, but it doesn't work.  Large numbers of people, even in this society that has done everything in its power to make people fear homosexuality, same-sex experimentation is extremely common, especially in early puberty.  

&gt;Can you show examples that don't involve pederasty and entrenched societal sexual customs where there is the sort of lack of preference you suggest?

OK, how about the far east?  Samurai, soldiers who usually worked for feudal lords, frequently formed close relationships with adolescent boys.  Neither the samurai or the boys were considered different in their preferences from anyone else.  It was acknowledged that adolescents of both genders were sexually attractive and anyone in the culture was likely to be attracted to them.  The same was true in ancient Greece, and the societies that grew out of them, all of them all the way up to the Victorian Era.  Sex also had VERY different roles in those societies than it does in ours as I explained.  They also had no concept of 'child' and 'adolescent' and 'adult' being intrinsically different either.  We have biological evidence for that, however, at least that children and adults are different.  The distinction of adolescents from adults was primarily created for socioeconomic reasons, though.

It's a huge subject and it's much easier to look for counter-examples.  Can you come up with just one?  A single culture in pre-Victorian times that acknowledged and led itself by this extremely strong preference that people cannot change?  Any culture that would think ""There is almost no chance at all Mr. X would have sex with another man, because he has sex with women""?

The impact of accepting this idea has also impacted friendships.  What were called platonic romances are an entire class of human relationship that we have simply banished from existence.  It was non-sexual but consisted of same-sex friends pledging their love to one another and 'courting' one another in a sense.  We can't tolerate such a thing of course because we have to establish the fictional idea that men can't have those feelings for other men without setting themselves apart and rejecting women, but it was common for thousands of years.  Latin cultures, and some European cultures, still retain some of the effects of the older societies in the way that same-sex friends feel comfortable holding hands, hugging, kissing, and being physically affectionate with each other.  As the idea of concrete orientations as an important and determining characteristic of a person becomes more ingrained and spreads further, those things die off, both out of fear of social reprisal and also out of the individuals fear that they might ""be gay"" and just not know it.

But I do think people in America, on both sides, are completely out of touch with reality:

In 2000, the population of Denmark was 5.3 million. In 2000, the population of the US was 281,421,906. Denmark has 1.8% the population of America. It is a lot easier and cheaper to give healthcare to 5 million people than it is to give it to 300 million people, and I feel that a lot of people are ignoring this point. The sheer size and scope of the bureaucracy to handle that is staggering, and it's not really fair comparing the gigantic US Federal Government to a small country in Europe.

The fact of the matter is, people on reddit see state-sponsored healthcare working in Denmark and Sweden and assume that it will work the same way in America. It won't. It can't. If our individual states handled healthcare in a way that individual EU nations handled it, it would have a much greater chance of not being a complete nightmare. But no one wants to let the states handle it, we seem to be of the mentality that it's the Federal Government or bust. I'm wary of putting that much trust and faith into the Federal Government: I mean look how well it's fucking up Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, Cash for Clunkers, and whatever else you want to mention. I don't have any faith that they'll take care of me or my family any better than a sleazy insurance company will.

People also seem to forget that America is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse countries on the planet. What works in a small country where most of the population shares the same ethnicity and religion will most likely not work in a large, continent-spanning country where the largest religion only has a 20% majority. People here have different beliefs, ideals and mindsets, and these beliefs vary based on region. Following a one-size-fits-all approach for such a diverse population is folly.

So to answer your question, your country isn't an evil socialist state. Your country is doing socialism and capitalism very well; better, in fact, than America is doing either. And that's why I don't think it will work in America: We can't seem to get the philosophy that has defined this country for the past two hundred years (capitalism) right, we certainly aren't doing socialism right, because in our fucked up American socialism, the people who own the means of production are the ones getting all the benefits.

You either get your power from APS -- in which case you're pulling from the nation's largest nuclear power plant -- or you're pulling from SRP; in which case you're pulling directly from hydroelectric resources.  SRP's actually the cheaper of the two, as well.

True, but irrelevant.

&gt; The free marketeers' approach is just to wait until depletion naturally makes the ff prices rise, at wich point the same turmoil will happen, but the other taxes will still be at the current high level.

You have no idea what you're talking about.  You clearly don't understand how natural transitions within a marketplace occur.  I'll give you one example of the kind of ""turmoil"" you're talking about, which **actually** occurred here in the US back when oil prices were at $140/barrel -- just a couple of years ago, remember:

There is this thing called the Fischer-Tropsch process.  It takes hydrocarbons and converts them from one state, to another.  In specific, it is used to convert *coal* into *gasoline* or *diesel* (with the byproducts being a syngas which is wholly fungible to natural gas, and CO2 -- which could be dramatically mitigated by the introduction of free hydrogen into the reaction.)  Several F-T plants were put into construction during that period; and the reason for this is simple:  the F-T process, with coal at today's prices, is only economically viable when oil is at $65-$80/barrel.  

There is enough coal in the proven reserves to match the expected traditional coal use **and** provide for the F-T process at the expected rate of increase of oil consumption (exclusively from coal, mind you; i.e., we just give up oil altogether) -- for more than three hundred years, maintaining it at that same equivalent of $65-$80/barrel.

Now, algal biodiesel as we know it today is economically viable at $100/barrel.  There's significant work being done to reduce that price point -- for a good reason.   Making it cheaper than the current oil price would be a literal license to print money.  

Whenever you have a slow, centuries'-long gradual increase in prices, the one thing you ***do not have*** is ""turmoil"".

&gt; Lifestyle is a choice subject to practical constraints: arguing that reality should adapt to support lifestyle choices is absurd, and ironically a moral argument where you value the personal opinion of the persons involved higher than the objective energy costs of a house in the suburbs vs. one in the city.

Of course I can. By convincing the other wage workers you're working with to take over the means of production.

The problem is that you will oppose the means by which we can reach anarchy (ie revolution) because you need to defend the right of the capitalist to exploit the worker. As such, you have already put yourself in the opposite camp in regards to achieving anarchy.

Once Anarchy is achieved, I wouldn't care less what you did as It's unlikely that your attempts to become a wage-slave would lead you anywhere, when no capitalist companies exist.

&gt;See? You get what you want, I get what I want. What exactly is so bad here?

You miss the part where all workers of a company are convinced of their exploitation and then justly take over the means of production and run it themselves.

&gt;Not at all. I said he can produce products on his own and he can sell those products for income. He can be independent and not be a wage earner.

He can only do that when he own his own house and his own workshop/farm. If everyone had this capability, then capitalism would have collapsed already as wage-slavery would not be preferred. It is in fact for this particular reason that the EU Enclosure movement and the US land monopoly used state violence to help the initial stages of Capitalism. Nobody wanted to work for wages ""voluntarily"" when there *was* an alternative.

&gt;I agree. But some people do have this option, and in anarchy, you must allow it. For those who don't have this option, you are absolutely 100% more than welcome to fix the problem and get this person a job.

Again, unless everyone has this option, then you cannot speak about how an alternative exists and ""voluntary"" wage-slavery. 

&gt;In anarchy, you can set up anything you want. In anarchy, almost everyone will be born into a home that their parents live in. Their parents could be farmers and be self-sufficient cultivators.

I don't know this utopia you speak of where all parents own their own houses and are self-sufficient. How do you make it happen?

&gt;But if they don't accept your arguments, then as an anarchist you must step away from them, get out their way, and let them do what they want and become a wage earner.

Study history. See how many of these children preferred to go become wage-slaves. Again, learn about the enclosures and the history and rise of US Capitalism. Read goddamn Tucker fer crying out loud.

&gt;But dismantling the state does not dismantle free trade. People can still trade with each other, which means they can still enter into wage contracts if they want to.

No it does not. But the way a revolution occurs, defines what kind of free trade will be happening and what kind of mentality people will have. In a syndicalist revolution, people are very likely to quickly switch to collectivism (as is what happened in the Spanish revolution) and ignore money altogether as they are not needed when you distribute according to need.

&gt;For example, if someone wants to earn more money at a coop, then he can quit his wage earning job and work at the coop. If the wage job pays more, then he can leave his coop job.

You still have no grasped that the very act of having an anarchist revolution will mean that capitalist firms will be collectivized.

You insist on simply going from here to then. without thinking of the process that will lead us to that time and place.

&gt;But your ideal society cannot stop wages from appearing unless there is an authority in place to stop them.

My ideal society will not even come into being unless people have internalized a dislike for private property and usury.

1. Intel Macs and normal PCs aren't quite identical; the regular PC world has been slow to pick up [EFI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface) which is necessary for the OS X boot sequence Apple designed (although, obviously, people have hacked methods to do this from BIOS).  Additionally, while you claim Apple increases the price of the hardware, actually comparing equipment debunks this myth for the most part.  Apple typically uses faster RAM, for one, and most Windows laptops don't (by default) include features such as Bluetooth, the Sudden Motion Sensor, backlit keyboards, LED backlit displays, MagSafe power adapters and stuff like that.  Granted, you may not *want* these features, but it's a bit unfair to compare costs without including such things, don't you think?

    For instance, I just configured a Dell Studio 13 equivalent to the $1499 Macbook Pro, and it cost $1454.  The Dell had a faster HDD than the Mac (7200 vs. 5400 RPM), but Dell is also bigger, heavier, has shorter battery life, lacks an aluminum enclosure, and lacks the aforementioned SMS, backlit keyboard, and Magsafe connector.  Although you might not want everything you get with the MBP, I don't see how you can deny it's priced competitively.

2. I think pretty much everyone who complained about Vista's driver issues shut up around, oh, two years ago.  However, as for your point that OS X doesn't support generic PC hardware: that's kind of a silly argument considering Apple has never claimed or attempted to support this.  Apple's business model is to be a hardware *and* software company; they use hardware sales to support software development, which is why Snow Leopard will cost $29 to Leopard owners.  Just as in (1), maybe you don't want or like this, but it's their option.

    Or let me put it this way: The Xbox 360 and the PS3 have very, very similar hardware (Xenon was based off Cell).  Should we expect Microsoft, then, to release and support a version of Dashboard that launches Xbox 360 games on the PS3?

3. Microsoft wasn't attacked for including its browser with Windows; a browser is pretty damned important.  They were attacked for making it virtually impossible to remove, or to completely and reliably change your default to an alternative.  Microsoft has since improved this and made it less difficult to remove IE.  Meanwhile, on OS X, removing Safari is a snap: drag it from /Applications to the Trash icon in your dock.  Granted the EU is going a little crazy with the whole browser ballot thing, and in all fairness it should be applied to OS X there as well, but it's an asinine idea in the first place.

4. There's no reason Apple should be required to make/let iTunes sync with other devices, given that they make the software, but yeah: the whole FairPlay requiring an iPod thing was fucked up.  Fortunately, they're pretty much DRM-free these days, and on a Mac or PC, if your audio player can act like an external drive, you can just drag songs from your iTunes library to it.  Their arbitration over the App Store, though: that's pretty fucked up and probably going to have to change pretty soon.

The tone of your first two points seems to be ""OS X should run on generic hardware and Apple are bastards for charging $45 extra for a few hardware features.""  This is a matter of opinion, I suppose.  Point (3) is based on inaccurate information, while point (4) was fairly notable back when Apple used DRM; now, though, I'd say the App Store is the more pressing issue.",2,t1_c0bsr6w,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,[deleted],c0bsr6w,0

even the 'multiculturalness' of new york is way overrated and exaggerated. it's much more racial here than london, even more than austin or atlanta, ga! most of the foreigners in new york are caribbean hispanics (puero ricans, dominicans, etc) who basically just set up there own communities in new york. i know people accuse the indians of doing the same thing in london but it sure didn't feel as severe as new york.

moving depends on a few things: your career, your personality type and if you know anyone (just 1 person could make all the difference).

&gt;Of course I can. By convincing the other wage workers you're working with to take over the means of production.

But given that they are already willing to work for wages, how do you stop them?  If you are an anarchist, you won't.

&gt;The problem is that you will oppose the means by which we can reach anarchy (ie revolution) because you need to defend the right of the capitalist to exploit the worker. As such, you have already put yourself in the opposite camp in regards to achieving anarchy.

That is not anarchism.  That is authoritarian.  If you outlaw *any* form of trade between consenting individuals, be it coop trading, or capitalist trading, then you are an authoritarian, because the only way you can stop certain trades from taking place that allow both sides to make gains is by having an authority to stop them.

&gt;You miss the part where all workers of a company are convinced of their exploitation and then justly take over the means of production and run it themselves.

You miss the part where that doesn't have to occur in every company.  In many cases the workers will not want to own their own companies for whatever reason, and would rather earn wages.  You keep mistaking what you want others to do, and what you think you can convince others to do, with what they will actually do.  You seem to not understand that gains can be made by not owning a company, but earning a wage instead.  Many people would gladly make a wage than run their own company, even if they had the choice.  For some reason you want me to think that taking a wage paying job is the last thing anyone would choose.  That is incorrect.  You can easily see your errors by merely considering all the self-sufficient farmers who lived in the countryside who voluntarily left their farms to take up wage paying jobs in the factories in and around the cities.  Nobody forced them.  See, you have to look at what people do before you can claim to know what the optimal choices for people are.  Don't presume to know what's best for people until you ask, or observe.  In many cases, wage jobs are SUPERIOR to being self-sufficient.

&gt;He can only do that when he own his own house and his own workshop/farm.

That's how society began.

&gt;If everyone had this capability, then capitalism would have collapsed already as wage-slavery would not be preferred.

But people started out as self-sufficient farmers, and voluntarily left to go work as wage earners.  Self-sufficiency collapsed.

&gt;It is in fact for this particular reason that the EU Enclosure movement and the US land monopoly used state violence to help the initial stages of Capitalism.

Irrelevant to our discussion, which is anarchist theory.

&gt;Nobody wanted to work for wages ""voluntarily"" when there was an alternative.

Yes they did.  Millions of farmers had the choice between staying on their farms and being self-sufficient or leaving their farms and working for wages.  If you look at what actually happened, like if you actually read history instead of just demanding that I read it, then you will see that there was a huge voluntary movement away from privately owned self-sufficient farms and workshops, to wage labor in the factories. This happened in the American northeast, south, and midwest, as well as in Europe, China, virtually all over the world.  When people are given a choice between being self-sufficient or being a wage earner, many people willingly chose to leave their farms and workshops to go work in the factories.  This was such a prevalent movement that I find it extremely telling that you willingly choose to ignore it.

&gt;Again, unless everyone has this option, then you cannot speak about how an alternative exists and ""voluntary"" wage-slavery.

To ask that everyone be given the same exact options before they are allowed to choose is like asking that pigs first have to fly.  Look, just consider the world, you know, outside your basement.  Some people are born in the desert.  Some people are born in lush forests.  Some people are born in prairies.  Still others are born near the ocean.  Each one of these people face stark realities that no capitalist or anyone else is responsible for.  Not only that, but more importantly, people are born with varying abilities, with varying desires, wants, needs, and drives.  Nobody can nor should have the exact same alternatives before I presume to decide whether or not individuals can decide to work for themselves or if they work for others for a wage.  Some people, by the fact of mother nature alone, face death or working for a wage.  These circumstances are not caused by capitalists, anymore than a socialist country is the cause for why someone is born in a very barren location with little to no food.  The Earth is not all fun and roses.  Some places are very dangerous and harmful to man.  The key thing is that everyone is free to trade and free to make any choices they want in order to alleviate their predicaments. 

If you were an anarchist, and not a totalitarian, then you would have allowed people to find any means necessary to better their situation, including the willingness to work for wages and not own their own farm or workshop or whatever else.

&gt;I don't know this utopia you speak of where all parents own their own houses and are self-sufficient. How do you make it happen?

Capitalism.

&gt;Study history. See how many of these children preferred to go become wage-slaves. Again, learn about the enclosures and the history and rise of US Capitalism. Read goddamn Tucker fer crying out loud.

You study history.  You study how many self-sufficient farmers willingly left their farms to go work in the factories for a wage.  The number will knock your socks off, but that would only be if you were intellectually honest and consistent, which it doesn't seem you are.

It's not the age. It's the rationality. It's the fact that you realize how immense and amazing it all is and how it all got there where as a religious person would be capable of doing such a thing, but they usually see something worth appreciating and see god in it instead of letting it sink in and bringing them more comfort than belief in god ever could. (run-on) I've never actually met a religious person who feels that wonder, but I have met other atheists who do. 

I was lying on the rooftop of our hotel in Vienna watching the sun set over the city during my school trip to Europe this summer and I started talking to a kid about how amazing it is that each one of those dim specs you see in the sky is a star about the size of our sun. We got talking about it and I'm sure you have all had conversations like this before. We talked for 4 hours. Until 3:00 am. We talked about anything from politics to religion. We even had a conversation about this very topic. Turns out, he's an atheist as well. We had to go back down from the roof when all the other kids up there did because we didn't want to be alone up there, but we really wanted to stay longer. That was one of the highlights of my life and I will never forget it. 

That wonderment you feel when you realize how amazing the universe/world/anything is is shared by most of us. I would say Atheism is more eye-opening than anything. I try to miss being a Christian, but I just can't. My ""god shaped hole"" is overflowing with wonder and that's something a religious person can't experience.

Rural meaning I live in a village of 3,000. The closest movie theater or sit-down restaurant is a 30 minute drive. The people here are for the most part ignorant to the idea of a larger world around them. They believe their options are only as broad as village they've never traveled more than 50 miles from. I was never one of these people.

Throughout high school my teachers, principle, guidance counselors, etc. always told me that I was meant for bigger things, always talking about my potential. The conversations were all directed at me but based on my teachers desires, never once were my aspirations taken into consideration. My classes were picked for me, I never had a say in my schedule I was always put into classes that would (according to my guidance counselor) ""provide as a transport to fulfilling my real potential"". I hated that, every time I heard it I wanted to throw down my books and walk out. I was a good student my first two years, I slept in a few classes because of late nights surfing the internet or reading a book that wasn't part of a homework assignment, but I got mostly A's in my classes, no problems. Then as school progressed it became more like a prison, less like a facility for learning. Eventually I ended up dropping out, about 2 months into my senior year. Yeah I could have made it, but it just wasn't worth it. A piece of paper that tells me I'm intelligent? No thanks. I worked full time throughout high school as a cook and made probably 10,000 a year and in my town that's more than enough to live on.

Finally I couldn't take the small town life anymore, I knew there was so much more of the world to see. So I moved to New York. I worked as a maintenance man at a school for a month and then moved up to the school cook. It was a private school on the upper west side of Manhattan so it wasn't like canned mush served with a side of corn. I made from scratch good wholesome food. I loved my job, but I wasn't really comfortable. I still wanted to move on but I couldn't just drop my job, I wanted to at least stay for the end of the school year as to not dick the kids out of a decent kitchen science teacher. But luck was against me and after 6 months I lost my job when the whole recession thing became big news. So I took my savings I had, stayed in New York for another month and then moved back to small town Ohio.

Ever since then I've been restless, I hate it. I don't want to go to college really, I still don't have my GED. I believe in self education through experience more than anything. I can't wait for the opportunity to travel again. Currently I'm trying to save up for a month long trip to Europe. To see what life is like on the other side of the ocean. From there I don't know where I'd like to travel next but all I know is that I have yet to find a place I'd like to settle, a place I can call home. I refuse to give it a rest until I've found such a place. I may never find it, but sometimes the search can be more enjoyable than the discovery.


By the way, sorry for such a long ass response, but this question really set me off, I couldn't help it.

The Mfecane was stopped by the British. 

So, ethnic strife is nothing new in Africa. Africa wasn’t a pretty nice and civilised garden of Eden as some would have you believe. 

Even if you were to believe this story about ethnic wars caused by colonialism, it still doesn’t explain why nations that were not affect by colonialism is in such a sorry state. Two good examples of this are Lesotho and Swaziland. These two are vying for the top spot on the most backward nation on earth contest. 

It also doesn’t explain why other countries (which were also ruled by colonial powers) are so successful. The British had a long involvement in India – yet it is better developed. The same is true for Hong Kong, etc…

There are several nations in Asia which were attacked and completely destroyed in many wars there (e.g. China, S. Korea, etc…) or through total communist oppression (e.g. The great proletariat Cultural Revolution). Yet those countries snapped back extremely fast. 

The blame it on colonialism excuse is getting thin. The biggest reason why Africa is so backwards is African corruption, nepotism, tribalism and crime.

&gt; Trams can adapt to the number of passengers by adding more cars during rush hour (and removing them during off-peak hours). No additional driver is then required for the trip in comparison to buses.

&gt; In general, trams provide a higher capacity service than buses.

&gt; Rights-of-way for trams are narrower than for buses.

&gt; Multiple entrances allow trams to load faster than suburban coaches, which tend to have a single entrance. This, combined with swifter acceleration and braking, lets trams maintain higher overall speeds than buses, if congestion allows.

&gt; Because the tracks are visible, it is easy for potential riders to know where the routes are.

More to the problem, studies on transportation indicate that street cars receive more usage compared to buses.

&gt; Consistent market research and experience over the last 50 years in Europe and North America shows that car commuters are willing to transfer some trips to rail-based public transport but not to buses. Typically light rail systems attract between 30 and 40% of their patronage from former car trips. Rapid transit bus systems attract less than 5% of trips from cars, less than the variability of traffic.

As the goal is mass transit, this seems a rather significant advantage. The only question that remains there is why street cars are so preferred.

 * No culture shock. Latin America is much more similar to American culture. Everyone watches American TV and movies, Simpsons, Friends, etc. English words have been incorporated into everyday life and are the preferred choice for technical discussions, plus it's a lot easier to imitate British/American accents when that's your second language.

 * Sufficiently large educated middle class. Everyone in IT speaks English as a second language, a large number of homes in cities have computers and broadband. There is a substantial population of college-educated professionals who can pick up the job easily enough.

 * Established tech industry. Buenos Aires has been a technological hub for quite some time. Large banks and universities have had mainframe and minicomputer installations since they first came out, offering a lot of computing veterans capable of teaching the ropes to younger people. Many high schools offer specialization in informatics.

 * Corporate culture. Many Indian shops are criticized for being too subordinate to their customers to the point where they will not point out errors in specs or refuse impossible jobs. If anything the corporate culture here is more open than even the States. If something can't get done, it will be known. If brash action needs to be taken, it will be done (although it has its significant downsides).

 * Time zones. The time offset from the States or Europe is much smaller than for out Asian counterparts. This makes the shifts much more attractive.

 * Salary. Usually a third of what an American or European gets for the job, but with people equally qualified. It's a decent compromise between other outsourcing alternatives.

 * Young workforce.

I guess it fits though since you're crediting hunayn ibn ishaq with translating the works of greek philosophers, when the article you link talks about his work in translating scientific and medical texts from greek into arabic. it's quite well known that averroes translated the works of aristotle and plato from greek to arabic and worked with translators to have them translated into latin. For his work, he is credited with being among the fathers of the european enlightenment. You casually assert that his books were burned, yet we have many of his original manuscripts today. 

what is your point exactly? Hunayn ibn ishaq was one of many arab scientists that benefitted from the Muslim civilization's emphasis on scientific and technological advancement. He worked at bait al-hikmah, the house of wisdom, in Baghdad, where it was customary to pay scientists the weight of their manuscripts in gold. You realize he has an Arabic name and translated the old testament into arabic and worked and studied in arabic, the lingua franca of the time. The fact that he was christian is more a testament to the wonderfully tolerant Muslim society of the day that valued scientific innovation above the kind of petty identity politics you are bringing to this conversation.

You cited interesting examples, and afaics they are all from the Bible, which describes things that happened a long long time ago. I would like to specifically know more about the situation today. Why would God, the God of the Bible, accept prayers from people who are misguided? I mean, Muslims obviously believe they are on the right path and not misguided at all, and I can attest to this fact since I live in a Muslim family in a European country, which is predominantly Christian. We all know the basic facts about Jesus and what the Christian religion is all about (well, I know a lot more things than most of my relatives about religions,) so the (Christian) Truth is staring them in the face all the time and ignorance can't be an excuse here. From a Christian point of view my Muslim relatives worship and pray to a false god, isn't that true? Aren't they severely misguided by Satan, because they follow a false prophet? (Ironically, Muslims think the same about Christians with regard to being misguided :D).
So why would God fulfill any of their supplicants, at all? He clearly keeps them stuck in the wrong religion by deluding them, because he occasionally grants their wishes, sometimes he answers with a resounding no and sometimes you'll have to wait to get your answer, which depends on the prayer of course.

And what about natural religions? People who pray to nature to make things happen (rain, crop, relationships etc.) or to avert bad things (drought, sickness etc.), why do they think that prayer works? Of course they think that prayer doesn't work all the time, it depends on the mood of the mountain or forest spirit, the Sun God or the Rain God whether the people are deemed worthy of any rewards...

People who believe that prayers make a difference, that God causes things in the physical world, which he wouldn't have done without them, will always have some kind of justification for why God denies some of their prayers. God is basically in a win-win situation, it's impossible for him to lose. Didn't get what you want? It must be your fault, you have sinned too much without sincere repentance. Maybe God wants to teach you a lesson, he wants to purify your soul or he wants to test your faith and see if you persevere. I agree that all of this makes complete sense and is logical when we accept the existence of a caring, personal God. I used to believe exactly that myself as a Muslim for years. (And no, I didn't start doubting because of unanswered prayers.) So there. Guess I'll better stop writing more :-)

There was incredible strife between ethnic groups in Europe too.

Also, they never had the situation where the current leaders moved out quickly without setting up any economic or political infrastructure.

As for Hong Kong, that was never ruled as a colonial power. The British rented it from the Chinese and when the time was up, gave it straight back to them. There was no time of power grabbing and the rulership shifted from one powerful nation to another.

For the case of India, you make a good point here but there's still tons of corruption and poverty there. They are growing, but they have the advantage of having the second largest population in the world. Also to note, there are plenty of examples of religious and cultural tensions there and bombings are not too uncommon. 

Still, India's growth has proven that it can be done and all the blame should definitely not be placed on colonialism as corrupt leaders, ethnic tensions, and bad economic situations have played a huge part in it as well.

Debate should be based on knowledge, not a desire to ""win"" arguments or prove a point. 

case in point, first you say that ""The Greek classics were translated by Christians (hunayn ibn ishaq), Averroes just wrote commentaries on the translations."" when I called you on it as an example of pure intellectual dishonesty (ishaq translated medical texts, not philosophy) you reply meekly that you just meant greek works. That's absolutely not true, you credited him with carrying the legacy of greek philsophy to the christian west, when it is not clear at all that ishaq had anything to do with either the greek philosophy or the christian west. He was arab and worked and studied in arabic. It was arab muslim society that enabled his great scientific acheivements.

secondly, i'm not sure what your point about ibn rushd is - it's not surprising that al-murabitoon were hostile to his work as they were very puritanical, however, he was celebrated during his life as a judge and scholar and he is celebrated today the same way. Many of his works are preserved in the original. this french guy's claim that they are all destroyed just sort of made me scoff - how does he know none are left? They are in libraries!

lastly, to sorta of underline the sheer intellectual dishonesty of all this, will you please look at the front page of mercatornet.com?

You state that as a fact, not that Schiff is probably right, not that there is a lot of evidence that that Schiff is right, but that he *is* right. Now sometimes we claim things are totally true when there is a very very very very small chance of them being wrong, (eg if I drop this coin in my hand it will fall down due to gravity). This isn't like that though. 

Economics is far more complex than phyics, no-one can, or has done thousands of repeated experiments to show that a theory is correct time and time again. Economics work off a far less evidence, and there are rarely any controls when making observations.

---
Here are a couple of examples, from Australia. Last year in responce to the global economic crisis the government went on a very aggressive spending spree, creating Australia's first fedural deficit in the last 12 years (could even be longer). This involved:
    
 - Thousands of dollars being handed out to lower income families
 - A large amount being spent on infrastructure (such as schools and roads). A time limit was put on schools applying for the funds, so that any building could commence as soon as possible.
 - The result of this was about a $35 billion deficit last financial year, an expected $60 billion deficit this financial year ([figures here](http://www.budget.gov.au/2009-10/content/overview/html/overview_34.htm))

These is very typical keynesian policies, spending a lot during a downturn. At the time I thought that the spending was excessive and poorly targeted. $35 billion is a lot of money, and why give out handouts instead of spending more on infrastructure? However, not only has Australia avoided a technical recession so far during the largest world downturn since the great depression, employment has already began to grow again. 

Another example is the Australian health system. It is a universal health system, with the costs mostly paid for by the government (typically 100% of hospital costs, 75-85% of other costs). There is also a private health care section, but this isn't necessary, it just gets you faster care in the case of elective surgury (elective in this case is surgury that can safely be put off, even if it is very inconvenient such as fixing a badly broken leg, so it is still nice to have).

This is a far more socialized system than in the US. However, many studies and statistics seem to indicate that it is performing better than the US system. For example [Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2007/May/Mirror--Mirror-on-the-Wall--An-International-Update-on-the-Comparative-Performance-of-American-Healt.aspx). The life expentency of Australia is higher than the US (80.62 compared to 	78.06) [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy). Also see a table [comparing health care systems from different countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_compared#Canadian_health_care_in_comparison). From that it appears that Australia is getting better outcomes at a lower cost.

---

Note that none of the points above prove beyond doubt that keynesian policy is correct, or that socialized health care is better than the US system. There are other possible explainations. Australia may have been insulated from the economic downturn because of close ties with China. Or maybe our banking industry is more conservative than the US and European ones, preventing most of the damage the subprime loans caused. With regards to health, maybe Australian lead geneally more health lives than people in the US. There are also less deaths from guns, murder, and wars that could explain the discrepancy in the life expectency figures.

However, you have to accept the possibility that keynesian policies work (or work under some conditions), and that socialized health could be an excellent health care system, just as I accept the possibility that the keynesian policies implemented by the government didn't actually achieve anything, and that there could be much better health care system than the one in Australia.

Your initial post sounded extremely arrogant to me. With the above observations (and many others), it is hard to believe that anyone can claim with total certainty that they economic viewpoints are correct. I think it is worth pointing out that in your post you did the exact same thing as the guy in the video was talking about - you dismissed people with alternate and possible correct viewpoints (""*them*""), not with the words that he used in his podcast, but by calling basically calling *them* evil lying morons:

They exist though repressed, even today. The unscientific decision of the Egyptian government to slaughter every pig in Egypt in response to the swin flu has only served to drive the Copts into greater poverty and now malnutrition (as pig meat was the only sort many could afford). 

&gt;Find me one spanish family that was allowed to keep their jewish or muslim heritage - they were completely wiped out.

They weren't wiped out, but given a choice to convert or be deprived of their property in Spain and move to North Africa. It's abhorrent by today's standards, but understandable considering that those who were oppressed for so long would lash out against their oppressors. To put it within a cultural context you may understand, it's kind of like the treatment of the Sunni in Baghdad now that Saddam is gone. 

&gt;Arab conquests were not characterized by massacre and ethnic cleansing. Distinct ethnic groups and their customs remained intact, unlike how the europeans completely uprooted civilizations upon conquering them.

That's not true. Native language and culture was often replaced by Arabic language and culture in countries conquered by Arabs. The people themselves weren't replaced because there simply were not enough Arabs to populate all those countries. 

There's even an actual word for it: Arabization. For example the rulers of Egypt *could* have kept Coptic language and culture within a context of Islam, but it was supplanted by an Arab identity. This did not happen all the time, though. Thankfully the Persians, although they were not able to hold off against the Arab armies and their religious influence, nonetheless fought very successfully to retain their culture within Islam. It is also my understanding that the Persians very much criticize the Arabs for thinking that Arab culture and Islam should go hand in hand. ",2,t1_c0btahj,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,[deleted],c0btahj,0

People are more than welcome to their opinions, as I am to mine. I believe that atheists are superior to religious nutcases for one reason alone: They are nutcases. Believing the earth is 5000 years old is fundamentally and inherently idiotic.

Wow, nice strawman.  Maybe I don't think all religious people are nutcases because I don't know any religious people who are young Earth creationists who take Genesis (or much of the OT) literally.  I know many religious people who are as fair-minded, intellectually curious and reasonable as any atheist I've encountered on here, many more so.  I find it utterly bizzare that someone can honestly state that they think the large majority of the world is unintelligent simply by metric of one belief.

To contribute to the OP, what I find to be problematic with the culture on this subreddit is the sentiment expressed here (Theism is illogical, therefore all theists are completely illogical, therefore they are all stupid) and the tendency to blame everything bad on religion.  This is relevant to certain degree in the new atheist books, especially some of Sam Harris' books.  They overemphasize the importance of religion in conflict, and as a result make dealing with that conflict seem impossible.  If one posits the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as entirely caused by religion, then it seems natural that we would never resolve it because of how difficult it is to affect religious dogma.  But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not religiously based, it is much more about politics and nationalism, and those are areas that allow some more room for compromise and dispute.  

Likewise when there is a conflict with religious minorities in Europe, for example, everyone is quick to jump on the clash of religion, when the real influencing factor is almost always the economic and social oppression of an immigrant minority group, and the religion factor is a tangent at best.",-1,t1_c0btdx1,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,sibtiger,c0btdx1,0

The Abbasids, who came from the Persian East, were at an advantage in this area when compared to the Umayyads because they had accepted many Greek ideas already.[8] One of the kings of Persia in the 6th century, Noshinvan the Just, had freely invited pagan philosophers fleeing the Byzantines free refuge in his country, thus introducing many Greek ideas into his kingdom.[9] Aided by this knowledge and juxtaposition of beliefs, the Abassids considered it valuable to look at Islam with Greek eyes, and to look at the Greeks with Islamic eyes.[8] Abassid philosophers also pressed the idea that Islam had from the very beginning stressed the gathering of knowledge as important to the religion These new lines of thought allowed the work of amassing and translating Greek ideas to expand as it never before had.[10]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_transmission_of_the_Classics_to_the_West#Abassids)

and after:
[The Abassids moved their capital from Arabia to Baghdad.[14] Here, translation work exploded within the House of Wisdom, a university of sorts created in 830 under Caliph Abdallah-al-Mamun. Al-Mamun had sent emissaries to the Byzantines to gather Greek manuscripts for his new university, making it a center for Greek translation work in the Arab world.[9] At first only practical works, such as those on medicine and technology were sought after, but eventually works on philosophy became popular.[20]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_transmission_of_the_Classics_to_the_West#Baghdad.27s_House_of_Wisdom)

yeah it does sound like thirst for knowledge actually. the religion also openly promotes acquisition of knowledge and glorifies studying the natural world. 

&gt;Article says the experts on that period of history came to his defence, while the attackers were the usual PC brigade more interested in political correctness than factual correctness. And your ""consensus"" exists for Muslim echo chambers and PC panderers only.

actually you got it completely backwards, either that or you're once again purposely misrepresenting facts hoping to wear me out in a war of attrition, waiting for me to stop pointing out your every lie and inconsistency - ""a petition was drawn up last spring by faculty colleagues lamenting its “ideological positions [inconsistent with] the pedagogical serenity and the scientific reputation of the ENS-L”. More importantly, does it matter what the  article claims? It's an obviously biased journalist reporting what french historians and newspapers think about arab history.  

by the way, I freely acknowledge that role that syriac christians played in the early translation of texts. You're the one who insists so adamantly that arabs and muslims contributed nothing on their own.  You come today and say christians practically invented scientific language in arabic and in the same breath claim that direct translations in byzantium were responsible for the european renaissance, well, not only is that simply untrue, but it wreaks of exactly the kind of political agenda you and your propaganda sites are trying to perpetrate - that muslims and arabs have never done anything good for anybody and actually they have done a great deal of harm. Please keep your bat y'eor and other propaganda articles to yourself ok? This is a total waste of time. seriously, does anybody need to read past ""A Jihad Watch EXCLUSIVE essay by Bat Ye'or"" - lol.

Your plan is contingent on zero response from the US or NATO or UN while you take over Africa (somewhat likely) and the Middle East (no fucking way).

You need to start by destabilizing the world economy, bankrupting the US government, cause internal conflict in the EU, and start violent revolutions in China.

You'll need engineers, administrators, accountants, scientists. Lure them from the unstable, former first world countries, and pay them WELL. Execute anyone who is guilty of corruption. Make sure you build universities and labs.

Now you can send ""humanitarian aid"" to the distressed countries like India and China and Europe. They'll need you, and won't do a thing as you take over Mid East.

a) College is worthless unless you know what you're doing. A meaningless college degree (e.g. French Lit) buys you nothing in terms of career options. 

b) College is worthwhile to pick up some useful, marketable skill (e.g CS, EE, accounting, teaching, or whatnot). 

c) Most people don't know what they enjoy at 17. It's impossible to know. First semester courses are generally nothing like working in job in the same field, esp. in deep subjects (like engineering). First semester engineering courses are to doing engineering as memorizing the alphabet is to reading. You usually find out if you're well suited to it after the fact. 

I'd advise you to either: 

a) Just pick something (anything) along your lines of aptitude, go to college, and study it seriously (don't waste college on drunken parties). 

or

b) Get a job, ideally also along your lines of aptitude. It is possible to get perfectly decent jobs with no college degree, and having a job will teach you valuable skills (if nothing else, being able to work and focus for 40+ hours a week). Once you've worked for 2 years or so, go back and get a college degree. Esp. if you were admitted to a first-tier school, see if you can defer your admission (so you keep the spot). 

Mixing the two is not a bad way to go either (work part time, and study part time), but most good schools don't allow that (except for summer internships). 

Someone suggested travel. That's a worthwhile thing to do, but the way they suggested it is dumb ($1500 to putz around Europe). You get a lot out understanding other cultures. You can see yourself with much better perspective (how do other people interact with friends? With parents? Is their way better, or your way, and if their way is better, can you adopt it?). If you do decide to travel, my suggestions are: 

- Do it with a purpose. Get an internship somewhere. Do a semester abroad. Volunteer. That way, you will be forced to interact deeply with people in the remote culture, and make real friends (rather than just booking rooms, navigating your way, etc.)

- Do it in a culture different from your own. America is an outgrowth of Europe. There are difference, but they are pretty shallow. India is a great place to go -- English is accepted, but the culture is very different. Other parts of Asia are okay too, but you don't go as far on English. Parts of Africa do English, but the cultural differences (in the Westernize English-speaking parts) are more shallow. 

- Read about anthropology beforehand, as well as about the culture in the place you are traveling to. If you want to, pick up Pimsleur tapes from the library or rent and rip from recordedbooks.com, and learn some of the language too. Pimsleur will take 6 months at half an hour a day (90 days in theory, but about double in practice, counting repeating some tapes and missing some days).

1426012946,t3_98h7w,,True,,1249746259,0,,1,False,t3_98h7w,0,"I was born in Estonia in a small town called Maardu. There wasn't much, just old factories, a lake, a beautiful church and old Soviet Housing Estates which were occupied by many Russian, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Latvian people.  I lived in one of those estates with my mother and father.  We weren't exactly poor, just always in debt (mainly due to my father's drinking and gambling habits).  My father was a clever man.  He enjoyed history, cooking and could even speak English (something highly dignified at that time) and had a job, but he would drink and go missing for days and then come home unexpectedly.  One time he went missing for a whole year.  I never developed any kind of attachment towards him so I didn't really care.  

All my family and friends were kind, but only when I saw them.  My mother knew they all talked behind our backs and they would never visit us whenever we were going through a difficult time.  I was too young to really understand anything so I spent most of my days outside playing with my friends, skipping school whenever I had the chance and spending any money I had on Mortal Kombat.  I had a best friend who always stood up for me when bigger kids tried to pick on me.  I can recall watching many old Arnold Schwarzenegger films with him and trying to regurgitate lines in English which most likely sounded like 'Engrish'.  

Estonia is a beautiful country with a clandestine heart.  Tallinn has a charming Old Town paved with cobblestone and a new westernised area full of elegant shops filled with attractive, young women.  However, there is a lot of hostility towards the Russian culture.  Anyone who spoke Russian or was Russian always was the last one to get a job, be served or treated with any respect.  I was one of those people.  In Estonia even if you were born there you did not automatically obtain an Estonia passport, but a shitty 'Alien's Passport' which most of my friends and I had.  With this passport it is always difficult to travel which involves tedious interviews with people who hate you and do not want to see you leave the country (ironic, considering they don't actually want a large majority of those people with an 'Alien's Passport' to be in the county).  

So came the year 1998 and my mum informed me that we were going on a holiday to the UK for a week.  I had no idea where she got the money from but I didn't care because I was fucking going to London!  I told all my friends who were cynical at first and thought I was lying; until in August I suddenly disappeared.  It was my first plane journey and I was excited (though not as excited when I got a free cap, A FREE CAP!  Now you have to pay for 'free caps' on planes).  I don't actually remember which airport we landed at but I know we took a long train journey - probably Luton.  We stayed at a hotel in King's Cross.  A week had passed but there was no sign of us leaving.  I began to worry and my mum told me that this was going to be our new home.  I cried for a few days over her evil deception and wanted to go back to see my friends.  After a couple of weeks the Home Office (we would have to sit in Kensington Town Hall for hours before being interviewed) moved us into a hotel which was full of many other immigrants from all over the world.  I started school which was hard since my English mental lexicon consisted of the words 'cat and nose'.  I made one friend who also did not know how to speak English.  We would copy each others' work not knowing that we were both clueless.  

So came the year 1999 and by April I was able to construct simple sentences and knew the English alphabet (a feat which I had accomplished in one night).  We were re-located to East London where I had to move to a different school. I made many friends there, some of which I still keep in contact now with regularly.  One summer afternoon I decided to go to a park down the road from me and was chased by a boy who stuffed grass down my back and shouted 'I know where you live' as I ran away.  Little did I know, that boy would become my best friend, probably more like a brother.  He lived next door to me and his bedroom window faced mine.  After playing Batman on my own he spotted me looking at him through a window and we began talking.  I will always remember the first day I went to his house.  I entered his room and immediately one oh his friends spilled Coca-Cola over his Playstation.  It broke.  I was surprised to learn that by now I was able to fluently speak and understand English and luckily did not develop an Eastern European accent.  

The next five years I went through secondary school, made new friends and skipped school with my best friend to play all the latest games.  We both once spent a whole week-off playing Halo, Amped, Wreckless and Dead or Alive 3.  In 2005 I moved to Earl’s Court and changed schools.  There I made more friends who taught me the importance of getting an education.  I spent most of 2005-2007 going to gigs with my best friend and discovering the joy of binge drinking and ‘emo’ girls.  By late 2007 we had grown out of that fad but still enjoyed bands like Taking Back Sunday, Brand New and Funeral for a Friend.  It was also in 2007 that I had finally received my British passport.  No more living in fear of deportation.  Last year I started at Nottingham University and I am very happy and thankful for everything that has happened to me.  I still talk to most of my friends on a regular basis.  My best friend actually was the one who found this post on Reddit (I’ve been using Digg for the past two years and have never posted one thing.)

From day one the United Kingdom accepted me with cordial arms and had given me a bright future, many friends and food on the table.  I will always try my best to reciprocate for what the United Kingdom has given me, that’s the least I owe them.

also, egyptian government actions have as much to do with islam as american government actions have to do with christianity, that is, empty gestures and token implementations of shadows of religious policy. similarly, the chaldean communities did just fine. Saddam repressed them, but again, it's quite a stretch to call that religious repression. 

contrast with the treatment of religious minorities in any other historical civilization and you'll find nothing comes close. Your trying to apologize for and soften the effect of the spanish inquisition just shows what repugnant depths you'll fall to in order to ""win"" an argument. Comparing a nation-wide complete genocide and mass-exile by use of torture and mass-murder to the iraqi insurgency is really pretty dumb. Sorry to have to call it that way, but it is. 

&gt;That's not true. Native language and culture was often replaced by Arabic language and culture in countries conquered by Arabs. The people themselves weren't replaced because there simply were not enough Arabs to populate all those countries.

seriously? that's your comparison? Notice how argentina, america, australia today all have white-skinned populations, the result of deliberate ethnic cleansing and repopulation by a handful of colonists - that is dirty and evil. It also really doesn't take a lot of people either, so your assertion about ""not enough arabs"" is inaccurate and an obviously yet another lie you simply invented on the spot. 

Notice how Muslim lands still have berbers, turks, kurds, chinese, malays, polynesians, persians, dozens of ethnic groups in india alone, dozens of ethnic groups in africa alone. Oh some of them speak arabic? so did every learned man of europe at the time. It was the lingua franca. And how many of their lands still have their own languages - malaysia, india, bangladesh, turkey, etc? Now think about how much of south america speaks european languages? Their culture and heritage was wiped out and replaced with european ones. there is absolutely no moral equivalence between the way the christian and muslim conquests - you can't even call them both ""colonization""

&gt;There's even an actual word for it: Arabization.

an actual word? sorry but there are a ton of words used by propagadists that are not really grounded in reality, like islamofascism comes to mind.

I suspect you fabricated that assertion on the spot. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89790980

A certain number of them being wealthy does not make the Copts wealthy as a group (unless you have no grasp of statistics). Moreover I never said that they were ""barely surviving off of pig meat."" Perhaps you wish to crack open a medical dictionary and look up the definition of malnutrition.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8185844.stm

From the story: ""Dr Atif Salib, who runs a clinic in Manshiet Nasser, says he is now seeing cases of malnutrition and anaemia in children. Pork was the only affordable source of animal protein.""

&gt;similarly, the chaldean communities did just fine. Saddam repressed them, but again, it's quite a stretch to call that religious repression.

Saddam was actually surprisingly tolerant of the Chaldean Christians. It's the democratic Islam Republic of Iraq that's now making it such a unwelcoming place for them. 

&gt;Your trying to apologize for and soften the effect of the spanish inquisition just shows what repugnant depths you'll fall to in order to ""win"" an argument.

The Inquisition and the Reconquista are two separate things. If you didn't know that I can presume you've little knowledge of the subject at hand.

Moreover, you're confounding the crusades (which was the topic we *were* discussing) and European colonialism. The Crusades were simply a pan-European reponse to Muslim aggression, which started the day Muhammed couldn't get his way and decided to go on a holy war to solve his sect's problems. For example, the Barbary pirates constantly raided Europe since the 11th century and untile the 19th century and captured millions of Europeans and sold them off as slaves. They felt they were justified in doing so because Europeans were not Muslims. Interestingly the Arab slave trade was the precursor to the European one, started before the European one, and ended much after the European one. Mainly because Europeans were sophisticated enough to throw off the Middle Eastern holy books and embrace the Enlightenment.

&gt;Oh some of them speak arabic? so did every learned man of europe at the time. It was the lingua franca. 

Now that's absolute bullshit. I would seriously like to see an academic reference for that. Latin was the lingua franca of Western Europa until the after the Renaissance when French was used as the language of diplomacy.

PS. Even Muslims, non-Arab ones especially, recognize the problem of Arabization. http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/2648/",2,t1_c0btq43,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,[deleted],c0btq43,0

A little far from your native Finland :-) Southern African cuisine had many similarities.  To me Christmas is still about a bbq around the pool.

&gt; So what do you think the best thing about living in the states is?

It varies by location and there are many places you couldn't pay me to live (eg Atlanta).  I live at the southern end of Silicon Valley about a block from the beach.  (The water is the same temperature as the North Sea sadly.)  There is wonderful scenery (good, but not quite as good as what I grew up with).  There are a lot of immigrants in Silicon Valley which makes it more vibrant.

One of the more shallow reasons I moved is that the women are taller.  I am 6'4"" (1m94cm) so height does matter and I used to notice the average height being more between SFO and LHR.

&gt; though is it really the largest software market?

Yes, USA is largest, Japan second and Europe 3rd.

&gt; Almost all European countries have a large amount of UK English speakers

Not compared to their native population.  Things may have loosened up now, but a decade ago if you wanted to sell to France then your software had to be localized into French.  You could sell to Germany but if you didn't localise within a year then they were entitled to a full refund.

&gt; and I hope places like China are learning UK English

I visited China on business in early 2000 and asked my host about it.  He did say that every student in China was taught English and on pressing I determined it was British English.

This leads many of us to find ourselves lost at the end college, where we might have otherwise been lost four or five years earlier and have already figured it out by now.

Two of my friends that were in similar states of being did up and leave- traveling the world for 6months and a year, respectively.  One traveled through europe, then australia, new zealand, japan and korea (6 months) and the other traveled to china, thailand and then settled in vietnam, where he tried to make a living, and find himself (1 year.)

Both of these two have returned with a better sense of themselves.

In the United States and most English-speaking countries, the soft drink is called Diet Coke or Diet Coca-Cola.
In most of continental Europe, the drink is marketed as Coca-Cola Light, but often referred to as Cola or Cola Light. Coca-Cola has tried to discourage the use of these generic terms,[citation needed] and commercials refer only to ""Coke Light"" or ""Coca-Cola Light.""
In French-speaking Canada, it is called Coca-Cola Diète or Coke-Diète.
In Italy, the name Diet Coke was used between 1983 and 1991.
In Mexico, Central, South America and most of the Caribbean it is called Coca-Cola Light. In Mexico, it was introduced as Diet Coke in 1984, but it was renamed Coca-Cola Light in 1991.
In Brazil, it is called Coca-Cola Light - Baixas Calorias. Introduced in 1985 as Coca-Cola Baixas Calorias, it was renamed Coca-Cola Light in 1988.
In many English-influenced non-English markets (e.g., Israel), it is called Diet Coca-Cola.
In Japan, the soft drink was launched in 1984 as Coca-Cola Light, later in 1999, it was renamed Diet Coca-Cola, and since April 2007 it has been called No Calorie Coca-Cola.
In India it is called Diet Coke. After much campaigning against Coca-Cola in India, Coca-Cola still sells well in Chennai and other cities.
In most of Southeast Asia, it is called Coca-Cola Light or Coke Light.

It may ruin most of America's crop land for who know maybe a few hundred years maybe just a couple decades. I suspect if the rapidness of warming is a rough deterministically factor then we'll see a cool period trigger which will be worse than the Little Ice Age if not a full blown ice age. 

Once the arctic ice is all melted it will be hard to deny ocean currents are being severely damaged as well and that leads us to the realization that climate on earth is about to change dramatically. If we disturb the ocean currents weather as we know it changes on earth and all in all they may be far more fragile than we ever thought. However they should return to a similar equlibrium once the warming trend ends.

More worrisome is that activity in our solar system is helping the trend along and CO2 is just amplifying the problem. Unrelated to CO2 levels the earths magnetosphere has decline 15% or and it appears it could be do to level of dust particulate rising in the solar system as we spin around the edge of the galaxy. 

It's is VERY likely that some parts of the galaxy are more dangerous and thus extinctions are more prone. The falling magnetosphere could also be a polar reversal which probably isn't all that great either.

http://books.google.com/books?id=hwmCBIYB0vAC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=galactic+plane+extinction+likelyhood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=30uTuF5AQ5&amp;sig=WB3YoaRODW9aD14Ajd4qOPxue1c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-e59So6dFpWBtwf1ivjmAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false

I suspect we have entered an area of the galaxy which has increased the likely hood of extinction and, rather than meteor strike, probably altering our weather by pulling us through large radioactive dust clouds and such. The clouds can interfere with solar winds and change the size of the suns heliosphere, which is the most likely reason for magnetosphere decline, but... we'll see.

I highly suspect it's not just CO2.

I had a bad experience with an old high school crush, which involved a lot of the things you mentioned.  Unclear feelings, leading me on and not putting out, expecting me to be a boyfriend like figure, but never recognizing me as one.  Not to mention that she had a boyfriend when we told each other we had feelings for each other.  I cannot totally blame her, I agreed to a lot of those conditions, until she told me that she wanted to see several guys at once after she broke up with her boyfriend.  So I ended it then and their.  

She still persisted to come onto me, even after she picked out a new boyfriend.  So to drive the fact home that we totally done, I began dating her best friend/next door college room mate.  She wasn't a rebound, and I really did have feelings for this other girl, it only lasted the one date when she decided that I made her too ""uncomfortable.""

I wake up the next day to see that these girls have de-friended me on facebook, as well as some of their friends that I had met at their college.  I felt like crap, but in the end I realized that I had just gotten rid of this drama, and that it couldn't have ended any better way.

Since these two break ups I have come to realize a few very important things:
1.) Stay away from girls in relationships, if they are willing to be affectionate with you while they are in a relationship, then there is nothing keeping them from being unfaithful to you if you ever do get in a relationship.

2.) Stay further away from girls who are just coming out of a relationship.  You may think you are helping them by being the shoulder to cry on while they are recovering, but they will come to recognize you as only a friend figure, and won't want any more.  

3.) When you end things with a girl, all it means is that you are setting yourself up to be with a better person.  Always keep in mind that there are 6 BILLION people in the world, meaning there are 3 BILLION women, your odds are pretty good for finding someone better.  As a wise man always said ""Women are like buses, there'll be a new one every 10 minutes.""

P.S. I would not advise waiting for her, for it seems that she is just holding you in this purgatory of hers.  Don't wait for her to come back from Europe, but let it play out.  I guess what I am trying to say is that you shouldn't restrict your options when you are single.

Then you got lucky. Scotland is my favorite place outside of my old hometown (Santa Cruz, California). The people in Scotland are very seriously the nicest people I have ever met. I pulled out my map on the train and someone walked right up to me, asked where I was from and talked to me about the US before explaining the map to me and telling me all about where I was and where I should go. I stepped off the train and walked out of the station, looking again at my map to follow the mans instructions, and two more people walked up and offered help with anything. Couple streets down another person started chatting me up and asking if I need help. It was seriously crazy how friendly everyone was - which was to me a *huge* contrast from my years in San Francisco for college (where I'm pretty sure you could fall dead on the sidewalk and no one would question it for a few days). 

Everything about that place was beautiful. I absolutely loved the streets! [This was just down the steps from my hotel](http://photos.keithdreier.com/albums/europe/IMG_0861.jpg). I can't wait to go back someday, hopefully soon.",4,t1_c0bu6ix,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,rek,c0bu6ix,0

Americans pays the highest portion of GDP on healthcare, yet receive around the 37th globally ranked healthcare.  Before anyone rips into the validity of that comment,  whether it’s absolutely representative isn’t important, the point is that whether the US system is “good” or “bad”, one thing it isn’t is value for money. Essentially every other developed nation has managed to achieve similar or in most cases better results, with considerably less resources
.
In the debates I’ve seen about updating US healthcare, the current insurance based proponents often base their argument on quality of care, which they suggest would be hindered by a socialised system. But to us in the UK, that seems absurd, since any western nation should be providing top quality care. At the end of the day, the Harvard medical school doctor isn’t going to be any better than the oxford medical school doctor. The european MRI scanner isn’t going to work any better or any worse than the US MRI scanner. 9 times out of 10, they’re both manufactured by the same people anyway! Instead, it’s about resources. How many doctors do you have, how many MRI scanners etc. And the way to maximise that is “value for money”. Something which the US system entirely ignores provided the healthcare companies are contributing to the economy. If you could cut away all the call centre staff, the actuarial staff, the advertising campaigns etc. without losing the customers, the money that’s saved could be focused into useful areas like more MRI scanners, more doctors, more nurses etc.

We can’t understand why some Americans resist socialised healthcare so much, since intrinsically it saves money compared to an insurance based system. Because the US system is so insurance based, a lot of what you are paying for aren’t doctors and nurses, treatments and instruments – instead its insurance and advertising related. Why should an insurance salesmen be paid when you get ill? How are they helping you recover? Their purpose isn’t to make you better, it’s to obtain your money which is arguably the only achievement of the US system.

Hmm, this is all relative. I think the wealth in the gulf countries like Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabic helped them have a good slandered of living (schools, health care, ...).

&gt;d) Why do Muslims women put up with all the shit they are being put through? Why do they accept it? Why don't they revolt? (e.g. the burka - WTF!?)

They think this what god wants them to do. But the fact is, there is no mention to any of this in the Quran! And actually according to the Hadith women slaves are allowed to walk bare chested in public.

All of this is a way for male domination. Women has little value in Islam. They are no more than sex machines. Sure, they say there are 2-3 hadiths that say good things about women. But what about hundreds of other degrading ones. Why choose to read ones and not read others.

1) Production sound/Dialog or Dialog replacement (let's not talk about these, as from a 'sound' and not dialog POV they are not really a major part of the picture.

2) Ambience beds/room tone. Tone (the harmonic buzz unique to each room) is usually unique per location the film is shot at, but ambient beds like city noise or forest wind etc. are usually grabbed from a sound library. Why? It's easy and cost effective. Unless you need a very very specific track a library background should suffice, and there are some pretty specific ones out there already, for example, you need small european village seaside market at dusk, it's there in a library. You need 10-20 people chattering at a party in a large hall, it's there. By layering multiple ambient tracks the designer can usually come up with the perfect, unique sound for said scene.

3) Foley. This is usually recorded per film. Although each track is unique (and consists of things like cloth ruffle, footsteps, skin touch sounds, paper lift sounds etc.) they may always sound the same because there are not a lot of foley artists in the industry, it's a small field and they have similar bags of tricks.

3) FX. This would include specialty sounds like explosions, phasers, car sounds etc, things that probably weren't there in production and cannot be produced by a foley artist. The bigger/better sound designers will often do their own things, [Ben Burtt of star wars fame is a great example](http://filmsound.org/starwars/) but if you are on a tighter budget and/or don't need such a unique sound, why bother blowing a lot of money and time recording gunshots when there are thousands of pre-recorded samples at your disposal? The question is of cost, but also of whether the added cost is adding anything worthwhile to the project. So many FX sounds are so generic that re-recording them per project really adds nothing. Conversely, if you need a unique sound (for eg. the sound of transformers transforming or a time-machine spinning up), then a designer can really play with it and have a lot of fun/add cost-worthy dimensionality to the final piece.

edit: a word here and there.

I read on an analysis somewhere about these shipping stocks in regards to the BDI so hopefully I can reproduce fully based on memory here: some shipping companies sign FFA contracts that lock in the shipping rates for the year, I think DRYS is at 80+% and GNK is about 65%. 

Now, the main driver of BDI is BCI, and when BCI gains, BDI moves up. The big money is also BCI. BCI is affected by Iron Ore trades. Iron Ore biggest trade right now is still China. 

So my opinion is thus, to trade / short / long these companies, you need to see how they are affected by spot rates (GNK @ 65% average contracted rate now has a bigger exposure to downside BDI/BCI and therefore getting less $$ per spot and so BDI drops SHOULD drop GNK as well.) 

On the other hand, IF, and this is a big IF, IF China imports a lot of iron ore when the talks are finished, and the new vessels don't come onto the market before end of year, and a company gets a good chunk of that new iron ore business, and the contracts are not all locked in and the spot price for BCI is high, then that company will be making a lot of dollars.

And by the way LOTS of people who can afford it make the effort to see American-educated dentists in France. The ones who actually care about their teeth and not just a superficial visit.

My brother-in-law had a ""dead tooth"" that required lots of work to save it. He made multiple visits to a standard French dentist to receive treatments. After it was all finished, he went to visit one of the special American-educated dentists to get the work reviewed. This dentist told him that everything would need to be redone. He put together some extensive notes for my brother-in-law to give to the cheap-o dentist in order to correct it. He also pointed out a number of cavities that my bro-in-law had not even been informed of.

My brother-in-law related to me the discussion he had with the American-educated dentist about the lack of quality in French health care, which I would happy to post here if there was any open-minded interest in it. But I'm sure I would be speaking to a bunch of brick walls. Reddit has made up its mind on the issue, and once Reddit forms a bandwagon it's pretty hard to offer a different viewpoint. Yes, the American health care system is VERY flawed. But some of these other countries (such as France) are not the shangri-las they are made out to be. 

Forget the fact that I'm probably one of the few on here who has experienced firsthand both systems. So who am I to speak?

Aannnnnnd downvote for offering uncomfortable insights.

edit: Also, you want to know what happens when there is less money going into the system? Doctors and Dentists have much lower salaries, and there is hardly any competition in the schools and the curriculum becomes very lax. Also, less money means doctors and dentists are forced to squeeze in as many patients as they can per hour in order to make it worth their time, which explains the in-and-out service here.

2. Death for us all is certain. When not in work make the best of life. Do things you enjoy. Be with people you enjoy. If you don't know what makes you happy try new things. Start martial arts, join a fitness gym, start riding a bicycle, buy a motorcycle (learn to ride safely first!!!!), try hangliding, go skydiving, try scuba diving, go surfing, go camping, go hiking, go on vacation, leave the country, take your family across europe, visit China, start drawing, painting. The choices are endless.

3. Help others. Helping other people is one of the most fulfilling things. Volunteer at your local animal shelter, Goodwill, Salvation Army. Lookup some non-profits in your area and get involved (non-profit animal rescue?). Join red cross, travel to other countries and administer care. Join Habitat for Humanity (helping build a house is fun). Travel to Africa with a local church mission.

Healthcare, like any industry, is complex. Nobody is going to get everything right all the time. And that's precisely why we shouldn't let the government decide, or at least not the federal government. It's less bad if the 50 states in my country want to run healthcare, because then we've got 50 separate experiments. People can leave one state if that state's experiment doesn't work.

The taste difference between the sugar sweetened and the HFCS sweetened in soda is ridiculously minimal, at best. It is probably almost all about perceiving what you expect to perceive. Although, to be fair, when it comes to taste and smell, it is really only an individual's perception that matters even if it is erroneous.

The soda you love in Europe has 50% glucose and 50% fructose. The soda you seem to hate in America is 42% glucose and 55% fructose. HFCS and regular sugar are practically identical in terms of sweetness: HFCS is a 1.1 by weight, sucrose is a 1.0. HFCS was formulated to mimic the taste of sucrose when it was created and blind taste tests at the time confirmed their success. I can't find any modern scientific study (blogs don't count) examining the differences in taste between sucrose, not glucose, and HFCS. I know there is one that found no difference by Breslin, Beauchamp &amp; Pugh in 1996 (edit: this is actually referenced in the Slate article I mention below).

People worry about fructose because it doesn't stimulate insulin like glucose and is more likely to turn to fat. Which is true... except in cases when fructose is paired with glucose... which is always because pure fructose make us feel ill. In normal daily doses, the difference between sucrose and glucose is minimal. 

[Here is a good reference](http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/03/hfcs_the_good_the_bad_and_the.php)
 
The case for it being less satiating is not compelling either. 
 
[Reference 1](http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/139/6/1253S) - This is the best I could get that wasn't behind my Academic Search Premier account. No indication of external funding.
 
[Reference 2](http://www.ajcn.org.ezproxy2.lib.depaul.edu/cgi/content/abstract/86/5/1354) - Supported by the International Life Sciences Institute, which most trust but some don't because they do receive some funds from the food and beverage industry, though they are primarily funded through the government and their own endowment. 

Further, on the matter of health, if you look up the studies that found HFCS leads to more increased fat storage over regular sugar (sucrose) diets, you will find support. BUT they found their results with a 30% fructose diet, rather than the normal 8-9% concentration found in normal diets. There is a good review on sweeteners, containing this information as well, by GH Anderson (2006) in *The International Journal of Obesity*. I'm fairly certain this is not funded by any outside source, as it is only a review and requires no funding, but it could be hidden.

Last year there was supposedly a contest where Google was taking submissions for proposed projects to improve the world meaningfully, and funding the winning proposals to the tune of several million dollars. I thought it would have been a great idea to use the money to buy up brownfields or land in areas suffering from urban blight. Completely reconfigure the development of the land so that you are left with a central densely developed area surrounded by undeveloped parks/agricultural land. 

This pattern of development is much more similar to the model followed in much of Europe where you have many small village centers surrounded by farmland or parks, etc. You could actually develop something like a European-style village (but denser) in the middle of an American urban wasteland.

Instead languages just drift over time with no real rhyme or reason. For instance, the reason why the vowels in english are all pronounced differently than the same vowels in mainland europe is because the sounds of every vowel in english has just shifted. Originally, all european languages inherited the latin characters with the latin pronounciations, still common in every other european language: i was ""ee"", e was ""ey"", a was ""ah"", etc. This used to be the case for english, but for no real reason, they all shifted, i is ""eh"", e is ""ee"", a is ""ey"".

Right now, there's a similar vowel shift going on in the US. However, it's going one direction in the northern US, and a different direction in the south (NB: the advent of TV is actually slowing this down, and we're generally shifting more in the same direction now).

Today I finally register, and only to comment this.
The 'High speed' rail, is an ultra-expensive slow piece of shit.
I live in Madrid and none of my friends from Barcelona ever take the train because even after being paid by taxes, it still costs a liver.
Not only that, they stoped all the cheap trains! Now, there's only the expensive ones, no other option, no average and cheaper train!
The construction of the rail was a chaos, corruption and accidents everywhere, the floor gave several times, small bridges fall down and it was years after schedule, we are talking about 10 years.
This 'high speed' (sic) trains are a waster of money, a crime against humanity, a redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the highly connected construction corporations and the rich class who are the only ones to afford the 'executive-train' as we call them.
The new train joining Madrid and Valladolid was 6 years late, when it started it went half-speed for a year, if was always late, and never returned your money (they said that only if it arrived an hour later, but how the hell can a 1hour and a quarter voyage be a full hour late!).
After the politicians smiled(of course they smile, they are rich, powerfull, above the law and they don't work, never have, never will!) for the photos, they took the best parts of the train, which were leased, and in their place put slowe versions, changing the duration only after the newspaper had printed the other now impossible to reach.
Oh, I should add, that my friends, and mostly everybody instead of the train, they take private buses, like the ones from a company called ALSA, who has grow a lot after the reality of the scam surfaced.
One example, madrid-barcelona in bus, 25€ in train, 100€, the difference?

Well, if you take a look at other industrialized nations like in Europe you'd notice that the consumption of the average car is way less than one in the US. As well, cars are not a sole mode of transportation and the public transportation system is way more advanced bringing down the  per capita energy consumption.  

&gt;humankind will have to drastically change (again I've seen no evidence that this is possible)  

But many countries (including the US eventually) have taken measures to try and get the pollution down, bring about an end to over-fished seas and get people to become aware of the finite resources our planet is able to provide. Granted, there is still and overwhelming amount of people who are just thick and think material consumption will bring about happiness and they do not  see the destruction that each human being (little by little) causes by his/her consumption of finite goods.   
But we currently live in a society where growth is propagated. A company can only be successful if they can show they have grown and made more of a profit as compared to last years size and profit. The idea behind capitalism is to constantly grow and make more and more money. Organizations which are set to be this way are like cancer: steadily growing but killing everything around them no matter the cost. And especially in the US such a world view is propagated (I am not excluding Europe and the new emerging capitalism in Asia from this). So you might be right: if the world (each person) does not see that the philosophy of capitalism is at the core of the earths destruction and that only a change in minds of how we want to interact with our fellow human being in every aspect of life (financial in the case of capitalism) will save 'us' in the long run - then truly humanity and the earth along with it is doomed.",1,t1_c0buy94,False,philosophy,t5_2qh5b,Cassio,c0buy94,0

Let's assume that he *did* use a definition consistent with political science.  That point is moot because he invited us to ask our peers (who for the most part aren't political scientists) the nature of the existence of ""government"".  He than uses the ""theory of government"" in place of the word government but that isn't how *regular* people think of government.  Let's take his money analogy.  When you ask someone what money is, they don't think of the ""idea of money"" but rather concrete paper bills.  Because of the context that he has asked us to ask these questions, it's unreasonable to present an awkward definition of government to people not trained or accustomed to thinking of them as abstractions.

Ordinary people reify abstract concepts all the time, that's how people naturally think of things.
Examples:
-*Science has given us the combustion engine.*
(Obviously science can't literally give you something)
-*Fascism gripped Europe during WW2.*
(Similarly an ideology can't 'grip' something)
So it's not inappropriate at all to even call abstract concepts 'real'.

Now even though that I've showed that his definition is indeed unreasonable (because ordinary people think of abstractions as real things, further ordinary people don't theorize about government as political scientists do but interact with it in 'the real world') **I'll play your game** and show that ideas do become real after they've been implemented (which is the case of government).

First I'll come up with a reasonable definition of ""real"".  Since mere existence doesn't satisfy you I'll further add that for something to be considered ""real"" that it must have concrete consequences. That is if you were to imagine a parallel universe where the idea of something didn't exist then it would be somehow different from ours (where it does exist).  Examples of ideas that aren't real could be the idea of parallel universes that I have just illustrated.  Had no one ever thought of parrallel universes than there would be very little difference in the world.  Maybe a film or two wouldn't be made but films aren't concrete, they themselves are ideas or information on tape, so not all ideas are 'real'.

What's an example of an idea that is 'real'?  One could be ideologies such as liberalism that is an ideal that have defined most western societies.  It's hard to prove because we can never show a counter-positive but it's not a hard stretch that without the concept of liberalism we would not have freed the slaves, or granted women's suffrage.

Similarly governments are real.  An example is the American government, once an idea in the heads of your founding fathers became realized and would influence the world for the next few hundred years.  Had they not written those documents the picture of the piece of land you call America would be radically different so you can't say it didn't have any concrete consequences.

Now lets add a further restriction on the definition of 'real' to clinch this even further.  *Things are only real if and only if you can touch them.* (ie equivalence)  Well as I said earlier, abstract ideas aren't touchable by definition so 'the idea of government' isn't real making your entire position a **logical tautology** thus making the whole premise of the debate uninteresting and nothing is to be learned of this conversation.  In a formal debate this position would be inadmissable.  What's worse is that the questions that Stef presents us are supposed to provoke thought and debate but it doesn't do that at all because it's **not debatable**.

I've drifted as far as fascism (inspired by 'Starship Troopers', and completely removed from Nazism and all its negative features, mind you) to democratic-socialism (inspired by reading about some of the systems in Western Europe) before becoming a libertarian.  

I actually got my first libertarian book by accident, called ""The New Barbarian Manifesto"" by Ian Angell (by accident because he actually doesn't mention ""libertarianism"" by name until later in the book).  It's incredibly obscure and perhaps not the best written book ever, but it had me convinced that it wasn't so much a matter of whether or not libertarianism was ""desirable"" (depending), but rather, that it was ESSENTIAL.  Barring totalitarian efforts on a global scale, globalization isn't going to stop any time soon.  And assuming third world countries don't add to that by advancing, neither is the ""race to the bottom"".  Private industry IS going to get larger- and this is desirable, because again, you cut out ingenuity and incentive, you curtail the potential for overall evolution.  If they don't like the taxes or laws in one place, they'll move elsewhere, with their former hosts being all the poorer for it.  That's assuming they can't buy influence.  And how do you stop that- by giving MORE power to the people they're paying off in the first place?  But I apologize, I'm ranting.  

After following up with ""Economics in One Lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt; ""Libertarianism in One Lesson"" by David Bergland; ""The Revolution: A Manifesto"" by Ron Paul; and my personal favorite, ""Vienna and Chicago, Friends or Foes?"" by Mark Skousen (debating Austrian and Chicago schools of free market economics), I was hooked.

Beyond that, there was the question of, whom do I support more: the libertarians in the GOP, or the Libertarian Party?  Since I had already come to the conclusion, prior to becoming a libertarian, that more than two parties was needed in this country to promote greater checks and balances, keep people honest, and improve overall representation, I opted for the latter.  Seems like a long shot, but when you consider how little your vote sometimes matters otherwise (what with the Electoral College and depending where you live), you may as well stand for what you believe in, right?

&gt;This sanitizing approach to intensely religious societies is not only bizarre, but misleading: By failing to see the fundamental political and theological defects in Arab culture, it cannot chart a convincing way forward. 

As though 'Arab culture' were prima faci defective and that 'the west' (both generally meaningless catch-all terms) were inherently superior. If it is the case that a fundamental problem exists between fundamentalism and secularism (which there is, and it's a serious one) then any criticism therein applies equally to the US and 'the west' as they do to the arab world. As much as the bible belt anabaptist revivalists who held significant power under Bush, and still do in their on little fiefdoms, interpret the Bible in a literal (rather than allegorical, historical, or philosophical) way then there is a fundamental threat to secularism in American. As much as radical zionists, or their christian allies, promote the fundamental superiority of Israel as a nation apart, that is also a fundamental challenge to secular liberalism facing Europe and the US equally. And as much as political and economic elites find their interests served or conjoined with those two mentioned groups, that is a fundamental challenge to the whole world. To preach and demonize as Mr. Loconte is doing, is to be disingenuous at best, and malicious at worst.

If one really wants to examine problems, perhaps it should be noted that the two who are/were most corrupt are also those who are/were the unassailable heads of state, while their contrasts languish in Congress and the other in an Israeli jail or occupation. If we are serious about respecting democracy, we would respect it when it is practised and engage with the democratically elected Hamas government (for example), not seek to subvert, arrest, and assassinate them. The hypocrisy and failure of the intellectual peons like Mr. Loconte, understood early on by some, is now painfully eminent to all. That they deserve further platforms and audiences is vastly unwarranted.

*I am not in favour of hamas or islamic government generally, but Haniya is a reasonably rational and democratically elected figure who has proved pragmatic and willing to compromise when possible.

MILAN -- Global warming killed 150,000 people in 2000, and the death toll could double again in the next 30 years if current trends are not reversed, the World Health Organization said Thursday.

One heat wave killed 20,000 people in Europe alone this year, the WHO said, launching a book on health-weather links at a U.N. environment conference.

Climate change, linked by scientists to human emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide from cars and factories, is causing more frequent floods and droughts and melting ice caps.

""An estimated 150,000 deaths ... were caused in the year 2000 due to climate change,"" the study said. A further 5.5 million healthy years of life were lost worldwide due to debilitating diseases caused by climate change, it said.

""The 1990s were the hottest decade on record, and the upward trend in the world's temperature does not look like it is abating,"" it said. ""In Europe this past summer, for example, an estimated 20,000 people died due to extremely hot temperatures.""

""By 2100, water scarcity could impact between 1.1 and 3.2 billion people, says a leaked draft of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report due to be published in April 2007. The report focuses on the consequences of global warming and options for adapting to them. In February 2007 the panel released a report on the scientific basis of climate change.

The IPCC predicts critical water shortages in China and Australia, as well as parts of Europe and the United States. Africa and poor countries such as Bangladesh would be most affected because they were least able to cope with drought.

One way to deal with acute (drinking) water shortages, would be to ship water by tanker.

(They largely kept issues of religion and law separated.) To the ancient Hebrews this wasn't true, so the priest was ALSO the lawyer. One and the same. You say that rabbis never had power to impose punishment. That's not true. They took part in larger religious councils that arrogated to themselves the authority to execute people. The Bible is rife with commandments about stoning disobedient children, killing homosexuals, meting out death to apostates.

Honestly, this is nothing more than often repeated dogma.  If this were all true, then we would have corporations which would last virtually forever.  Yet, only around 17% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 have been around for more than 50 years.  This means that there is always a constant influx of new competitors replacing the old guard.  A corporation lasting over 100 years is an exceptional thing, rather than the rule.

If free markets lead to monopolies and oligopolies, then we would have high prices, little competition, and virtually no economic progress.  If this were true then Eastern Europe would be economic powerhouses and the U.S. would be a basket case.  In short, reality doesn't agree with Marxist theories.

It is also interesting that you choose a market (insurance) with the most government mandates and one of the most heavily regulated as the poster child for free markets.

If you have too many seniors, however, then it becomes a problem. It's actually becoming a huge problem in some European countries. Possible ways to tackle the problem: reviewing the minimum retirement age, promoting natality. 

As for disabled people, it kind of depends on whether they can still be productive or not. I doubt the percentage of disabled people large enough to unbalance the system.

But to some degree, it's because in the early and mid twentieth century, they arrested all the socialists, all the radicals in the Debs era at the start of WWI, and lots of people in the McCarthy era.   Also, there were some big points where the socialists probably could have won but racism divided working people, e.g. in strikes over the eight hour work day, black and white people were divided, on account of the white workers having gone on race riots killing black people a few months before, lots of black people worked as strikebreakers and the strikers lost, even though at one point they were fighting off the military with stolen artillery.   That tactic got used over and over again, endless labor divisions based on race, the right tries to make poverty about brown people, in the sixties  while the french radicals got the six week vacation all our energy was still getting sucked up by people defending whites only water fountains and basically getting democracy for the first time in a third of the country. That's the truth in people saying socialism succeeded in europe because they're a monoculture, yep, because they didn't have to try to solve racism to win a labor negotiation like american labor has had to.

And I write a lot because there is no need to dumb-down my posts to pander to redditors uninterested in having a conversation. This one is long too.
 
Second, please reread the post because I did provide the name of the authors that found no difference in taste as well as the year. I could find no online link for it that provided any substantive information, so I'm sorry about that, but it was later referenced in the Slate article too if you would have given that a read. I also was talking about the actual difference between the sucrose people claim to love and the HFCS that people claim to hate, and point out that the difference is actually quite small chemically. HFCS was developed to taste like sugar when mixed with food and that is why they stopped with a 55/42 blend because further than that individuals started reporting the ability to discriminate. Or so history goes, and to be fair history is written by those that want it to say something. 
 
My point is that it was developed to taste like sucrose, resembles sucrose very close, and the only actual study that I'm aware of found no difference in taste among respondents. I've got no agenda here except for people to stop making all these claims about HFCS because it is really trendy to do. Please, find me an actual study that shows a taste because that would be informative for everyone! If it is proven to taste different, then that is just peachy!
 
I discussed taste and satiating ability separately because they are both worth reading. I didn't mingle them.
 
No, I don't think taste is subjective. But I do think perceptions are. If you perceive they taste differently, even though it objectively doesn't, then drink what you perceive tastes better. 

Last word is your (and I think we both know what it will be) unless you find a study that I did not, in which case I'll congratulate your researching skills before reading and commenting again.

EDIT: Noiserr had an interesting proposition above (or below, somewhere). He suggests that maybe since Europeans have less exposure HFCS that they are sensitive to the taste differences, while Americans consume it regularly and actually experience no difference. That one study in 1996 was done on Americans to be sure, though that wouldn't explain initial development comparisons.

Margaret George writes a lot of memoir type books, the first one I read was called ""Memoirs of Cleopatra"". I believe her most recent book was ""Helen of Troy."" Linda Lay Shuler wrote the ""She Who Remembers"" trilogy which starts with a young Anasazi girl accused of witchcraft because of her blue eyes. Jean M. Auel wrote the Earthchildren Saga, which pretty much follows the life of a woman raised(and cast out) by neanderthals in Prehistoric Europe. Diana Gabaldon has a time travel series, I'm not quite sure how to explain it but it starts off with a woman going back in time and being forced to marry a scottishman younger than her. Pretty typical romance beginning with a lot of character development. Stephen King...I don't have to say anything other than he rocks my socks.

* Lots of awesome and awesomely bad stories, like one time I signed a contract for big money in China. A couple days later, on my way to the airport, I went to check my itinerary on my phone and found out the team canceled my ticket and backed out. That was depressing, but it pretty much happens to every guy at some point.
* The Czech league is pretty good (mid level Europe), but it's completely dominated by one team every year, Nymburk, unfortunately I did not play for them.  They literally lose one game a year, I've never seen anything close to that.  For me, as a center, it's tough because every team either has a good domestic center or hires an American, so there are no easy nights.  Guards can get away with playing against weaker players a lot (notice the bias).  
* I'm 28 now, so it'll be tough to get another crack at the NBA. Plus, honestly, I'm not an NBA level player, just don't tell my mom I said that.
* I got the NBA tryout by being in the right place at the right time. I live really close to an NBA city, and they were gonna work out some Greek guy, but he missed his flight. I filled in to workout against this 6'11, 290 pound monster, I was weighing in at 235 at the time. I held my own and he got hurt half way through. So they brought me in for another one, that went well.  Next thing I know, they needed a center for camp, and I kinda just stuck around.
* Being a pro athlete is fun and rewarding, and it sure beats an office job. The NBA is really glamorous, chartered flights, chartered trains, staying in Ritz hotels. It's unbelievable, I was never treated so well in my life.  Europe and the whole overseas lifestyle is much, much less glamorous, kind of similar to college, long bus rides, early flights and all that. I would definitely consider it ""work"", not complaining, I like all the experiences from it. 
* Minor leagues are interesting, if you know what to expect, they're fine.  You would be surprised by some guys who think they should be in the NBA or making 30k a month overseas, bums. Everyone in the minors is trying to improve their stock, and they do not hide it.  Guys jack shots, politic against each other, pass to their friends, etc., really not good for team chemistry, but stats are what get you paid.

I'm surrounded by people who have goals of getting a decent paying job and living comfortably. I can't do that. I have no problem living off of 10k-11k a year in Europe, if I'm working towards my dream.

Ever since I realized these ambitions, I've been manically depressed ever since. It's my driving force. Nothing else matters. It can be annoying.

Yet, sometimes it has its benefits. If my private loans fall through this fall and I have to put off University while I work at Mc. Donalds saving money, it won't matter to me since I'll be working towards a unified goal. I'd be happy doing it, too. In these situations, it's good.

I know the chance of failure is high, but it doesn't phase me. I'll be 24 when I graduate, which is still relatively young, and I'm hoping will be a benefit when I begin my ""journey"" in Europe, looking for the job.

I'm digressing though.

Communism, Socialism are to most Americans foreign (European) concepts. That alone makes them undesirable to American notions of freedom.

The fact that America uses some socialist principles to its advantage matters little to people who hate without needing to know exactly what it is, and why they should hate it.

The government bailouts and essential ownership of the auto and banking industries are two recent examples. Medicare and Medicaid are another two examples of government control of supposedly free markets...so is social security.

There is a sub-set of Americans, the ultra-rich, politicians, big business, and others who have a vested interest in keeping this idea afloat amongst the rabble so they have something to focus their collective anger on, whilst continually getting fucked over by these very same groups.

Then there's what I call the institutionalized Southern mentality...willful ignorance for ignorance's sake. The prime example being the civil war. How many Southerners actually owned slaves or profited from their ownership?

I've seen figures of between 15 and 20 percent who were direct owners or benefited in some material way from slavery. Yet the confederacy fought a long hard war basically over states rights, and the ability for one man to own another.

The descendants of these people make up the major contingent of the birthers, are still extreme racists and xenophobes...but 100 % ""real"" American to the core.

Free markets and fundamentalism go hand and hand. Faith based free market fundamentalists, like their religious analog, have the dogmatic zealotry of their religious brothers, along with no logical proof, or material evidence for their position. Yet their proselytizing never ends. Deregulate everything, privatize everything else. The only thing government should provide is prisons, police and a military...and even that is being privatized as I write this.

This is the masterstroke of the GOP, it's also what will eventually consume it. 

Get a bunch of essentially undereducated rabble to vote against their very own best economic interests again and again by transparent appeals to their worst fears and unending prejudices, keep relitigating the civil war and perceived injustice to hard working white people (the new underclass) and you've got a captive (to their collective ignorance) audience.

Edit:  Wow, seriously guys?  Did you read past the first few words in the wikipedia link you're hitting me with?

&gt; In both popular thought and academic scholarship, Nazism is generally considered a form of fascism – a term whose definition is contentious. Both fascism and Nazism reject ideologies like democracy, liberalism and Marxism,[29] but it is difficult to indentify a perfect definition of the two terms. According to most scholars of fascism, there are both left and right influences on the ideology; it has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.

&gt; Some historians, such as Zeev Sternhell, see each movement as unique, however many historians argue that there is a stronger family resemblance between the Italian and the German fascist movements than there is between democracies in Europe or the communist states of the Cold War.[32] Additionally, the crimes of the fascist movement can be compared, not only in numbers of casualties, but also in common developments, such as Benito Mussolini's March on Rome and Adolf Hitler’s attempted coup d'etat in Munich.

In other words, Nazism called itself socialist but was more fascist than anything else.",1,t1_c0bvgkj,False,politics,t5_2cneq,thereddust,c0bvgkj,0
1426013887,t3_9910o,,True,,1249905761,0,,3,False,t1_c0buxl3,0,"&gt; I'm going to college almost exclusively on [subsidized] loans, and I like it that way. I would MUCH rather have this system then have the government pay for my education. Taking out loans and paying for everything myself makes me feel independent, responsible and it makes me appreciate my education a lot more. I don't spend my days partying and getting drunk, cus I know I'm paying for this.

That's one of the saddest things I've ever heard. I finished up with undergrad last year $70,000 in debt. Let me repeat that for you: I'm 23 years old, just starting my life, and I'm *$70,000 in debt*. I'm also one of the lucky ones who got a scholarship and went to a state university: it could easily be three times that amount for private school students. Who needs that at 23?

I'm also engaged to a Russian citizen and although neither of us want to live in the U.S. for long, we've got little other choice until I'm done paying off loans, since salaries in Russia don't even come close to allowing me to pay off that amount of money before we're too old to start saving for retirement--and I know plenty of other American graduates who've made different kinds of personal sacrifices just to pay off the massive amount of debt that they incurred in the process of getting an education.

Meanwhile, *all* of my fiance's education, from kindergarten through his Ph.D., was government-funded, and the government would have stopped paying if his grades had stopped being up to government standards.

I don't know if you've actually compared the efficacy of higher education in the U.S. with that in Europe and Russia, but I studied abroad in three countries as an undergraduate and spent my first year of grad school as a Fulbright fellow in Russia, and I'll assure you, it was humbling. High school students in Hungary were the TA's for my third-year undergraduate Galois theory class; second-year undergraduate Russian students were sailing past me, a grad student, in pseudo-differential operators--and it's not because I was a lazy student back home, it's because of what education standards in the U.S. have become as a result of students paying for their education. See, European and Russian students in general take their education seriously, since the government stops paying for it if they don't, whereas U.S. students pay for their education and somehow think that entitles them to things like grade inflation and scaling to a curve, and professors know they can't get away with holding students to higher standards because they'd complain to university administrators (the ones who are paid so well thanks to their tuition dollars), and as a result they continue to assign low-level topics and assignments that keep even motivated students limited in what they've got time to pursue on their own.

It is very well impossible to exclude alternative explanations with 100% certainty, and social researchers (as all serious researchers?) are aware of this. But society seems to pick/propagate certain explanations that sit well with the current Zeitgeist (not necessarily those with the greatest support in research).

In this example, there was a fierce debate in soc. demography between the likes of Ehrlich (""population boom"", neo-malthusians, human ecologists ...) and for instance Marxist-inspired researchers. The second group critiqued the ""naturalist"" explanations of the first and pointed at the interaction between nature and the political economy: this implied that a population boom was not a necessary endpoint.

But one of the explanations received an ""official"", dominant status: that there will be a population boom. For (a part of) the explanation why, read up on people like [Hugh Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Moore), who believed basically in the following chain: Third World overpopulation &gt; poverty &gt; communism &gt; foreign threat to US &gt; Doom!. He used its Dixie Cup-fortune to fund Ehrlich, spread Population Bomb-literature to the entire Who's Who in the US and create an extensive network of pressure groups like [Population Action International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population\_Action\_International) and the [Association for Voluntary Human Sterilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EngenderHealth) to [pressure the US government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draper\_Committee) &amp; spread population control measures around the world.

And it worked. To put it crudely, in Cold War-times, the US (and other) government was more interested in explanations that pointed at ""simple"" population control measures that could be integrated in foreign policy, than models &amp; theories that pointed out that a more equitable (some: non-capitalistic) world economy would lead to greater prosperity in the Third World, and falling birth rates.

Other examples in social sciences (the last decades) I can think of are the trickle down-effect, the Eurosclerosis-thesis (European labor protection stifles economic growth), the ""death of class""-claim, the ""hard"" individualization-thesis, etc.

All these hypotheses receive(d) theoretical critique and empirical refutation _in_ the scientific literature. But _outside_ they receive a lot of attention, mainly because they fit with the intellectual climate (e.g. trickle down &amp; Eurosclerosis with neo-liberal policy; death of class &amp; individualism with the believe that our post-Berlin Wall society is fair and an individual meritocracy, ...).

The vast, vast weight of expert legal opinion says that punitive focused prisons are not effective, and there was a clear and immediate link (once again, drawn not by me but by legal experts) between Finland's prison reform and their rate of crime and rate of incarceration.

&gt;Countries across Europe have ever increasing prison musters. With one exception: Finland.  
Finland reduced its national imprisonment rate from around 180 prisoners per 100,000 of population a generation ago, to the current rate of 40 per 100,000.  
This represents a sustained and gradual reduction in imprisonment of around three to four percent a year for more than twenty years.  
It's a success story at a time in history when just about every other country in the world increased its prison populations massively.  
But what does this reduction or increase in prison musters have to do with crime? The answer is, not much. But it has a lot to do with politics.   
After a particularly horrible crime, for example, the murder of the child Jamie Bulger in England, the British public demanded longer sentences and more people in prison. They got it.  
Fear of crime affects policy.  
In Finland public opinion demanded that the shamefully high numbers of people in Finnish prisons be reduced.  
Those countries with a high rate of imprisonment like the United States don't have a lower rate of crime.  
Has crime decreased dramatically in Texas? No. In fact the Justice Policy Institute's research found that when it comes to reducing crime (and I quote) 'a state-by state comparison shows (Texas) to be lagging behind other jurisdictions which have not increased their prison 
systems so dramatically.' (end quote) 
 ""Hon Matt Robson  Re-thinking penal reform """"

It's hard to overstate just how united most people who actually study crime and recidivism are behind the idea that rehabilitation is far superior to punitive focused prisons.

Do note that there are several democratic socialist countries in Europe that are as progressive as (if not, more) the US.  These have nothing like the communist issues that you are trying to foist on socialism - unless your contention is that Americans are not mature enough to deal with democratic socialism and that any form of socialism in the US is going to lead to communism.

A lot of people in the UK say they are buying ""skunk"" when it is not necessarily of skunk genetics.  Skunk has become the slang for ""pretty decent bud"" just like ""BC Bud"" is supposed to mean pretty good Canadian pot, from British Columbia.  However, a lot of the stuff sold as ""beasters"" in the states is more likely grown in California or Oregon, perhaps Kentucky.  And it could be any number of strains.  One strain that has shown to produce well commercially is ""Big Bud""..a mainly indica strain that grows short and is supposed to produce, well, big buds.  It really isn't the best out there.
All strains will ultimately come down to indicia, sativa, or a cross.  Different growers will cross strains back and forth to see what grows best in their specific climate or indoor environment.  I have produced an F2 hybrid of Northern Lights x Hash Plant/Sativa/x Sour Diesel.  Being F2 it wasn't really a pure phenotype, but the one I took cuttings from produced some really stellar grops.
I agree with redsolitary, there can be many laws that say we can't grow cannabis, but really, come on.  They used to make sodomy illegal, and in some Texas county, you can't go to bed with your shoes on!  These, like weed, are stupid laws that can hardly be enforced.  Unfortunately with cannabis the cops get billions in taxpayer dollars to try and pitch water on the fire, but it really doesnt do much other than keeping cops' salaries high.
Other people will make up crazy names for pot, or sell some random mass produced weed as ""X"" weed. 
After a while the connoisseur will be able to tell strains apart.  Recently I have had ""blue dream (blueberry x haze)"" ""green crack (not sure)"" ""flo"" ""snowcap"" ""c99 (jack herer x shiva skunk)"" among others.  Each strain has its own unique smell and taste.  The green crack is bright green with a citrus smell, the flo is one of the most purple weeds I have smoked, also with a nice citrus aroma, but definitely a night time herb.

That's 14.5%.

Taking into consideration than net immigration figures for France are one of the lowest in Europe (1.52 migrants per 1,000 population), and the indigenous fertility rate is one of the highest in Europe, if anything, France is better placed than any other European country to hold on to it's native identity.",11,t1_c0bvmts,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,[deleted],c0bvmts,0

In fact, I call all people whose names start with the letter D or A ""D-money."" So anyways D-money, somebody posted the link to your landlord-pet-dispute on reddit, which in turn had a link to your website. The girl on the front page isn't half-bad looking by the way. I know we're only moderately good friends by now, but if you have any naked pictures of her, could you do me a solid and send them my way? And don't give me any of that ""hey, that's my girlfriend!"" malarky, because if that's the case then I KNOW you have naked pictures of her. But I digress.

I read a couple of the email chains on your site, being partial to ""Love letters from Dick"" myself, and decided I would apply your level of unexpected and gratuitous divulgence of information to one of my own currently-existing online disputes. I bought an old video game on eBay maybe a month ago, and a week or two ago I noticed that it had never arrived. I voiced my concern to the seller. Eventually I got this email back:

**Dear stratfx300,**

I am really, really sorry to tell you that I think somebody took the game from my room and never told me about it. I will give you a full refund right now. Sorry again.

**- anonymous1337**

Of course my parents have been gone all week and I've been partying like my parents have been gone all week, so I didn't even get this email until today, five days after D-money up there drafted it up and sent it out. Apparently, his perception of ""right now"" differs from most living creatures with a grasp on the present though, because I still hadn't gotten a refund from him. This is how I responded:

**Dear anonymous1337,**

So, still waiting on that refund. It's been five days since your last email. You must have had your attention immediately called away after sending your reply to me, for instance by a large bird flying through your window or a parade of rock-and-roll-playing strippers marching through the street. Who knows, it could have been something even more distracting like a house-shark erupting from the carpet to the right of your desk chair and launching a deadly assault on your workspace, or maybe just a popup with some really bangin porn. Don't worry though, my paypal account is still here and you can try sending a refund ""right now"" again, perhaps even a third time if you so desire. For the record, I do not accept payment in cheese or eastern european mail-order brides (nudge nudge, wink wink).

Interesting how we're speaking about recourse for individuals who are not represented by their government, and you attack those who seek recourse.  As if your views on the world are grounded in ""the truth"" and all others are wrong for straying from your views.  You've proven my point that when government mandates are involved that a portion of the population will always be unhappy with the results, and recourse is impossible for the individual.

I am an independent who has voted for Democrats, Republicans, independents, Libertarians, and Reform party candidates.  I have never been to a teaparty event, not that it would really matter.

&gt;Again, I'll ask (and clarify): ""Again, I don't understand how you, along with a group of other parents, haven't decided to take the issue (verbal abuse from a teacher) to court. If you complain about costs, realize you can sue for court-costs."" Telling me about cutting music class for economics is deflection. Realize that I know how to read and comprehend.

No law had been broken.  The larger issue is limited recourse in the education system.  If your comprehension skills are as great as you claim, you'd see that the individual issues are rather meaningless. 

&gt;I have appeared in court, both as a witness and a plaintiff. The cases I were involved in were real issues though, not some non-sense about Obama's birth certificate or whatever else republican/neo-con nutjobs bring to the stand.

The cases we have been involved with have been regarding voter fraud in a recent city council election and a ballot access issue at the state level where candidates who did not file by the deadline were appearing on the ballot.  But I'm glad that you're the arbiter of what cases are legitimate... it's a relief to know.

&gt;After reading this, the only point I see you make is that you ""think the system is broken, but if it weren't, it would work fine."" Such insight. You support that Government broke the system, but don't explain how or by what regulation. I don't see you blaming the health insurance execs who make million dollar yearly salaries, the lobbyists who spend millions (perhaps hundreds of millions) of dollars to buying elected officials for deregulation, or the the dozens of suspicious anti-reform groups who popped up over night who don't work for free. Do you see you're money going into their pockets, or do you just turn a blind eye towards all of that and blame the Government instead?

Lobbyists don't fight for deregulation when regulation keeps large corporations in business.  Only with government intervention is such a stranglehold on the economy possible.  The only deregulation they lobby for are mandated coverages and the ability to weasel out of contracts.

Regulation increases the cost to enter a market and decreases the potential competition.  Regulations regarding who may form risk pooling groups, if they may pool across state lines, what coverages an individual must purchase, caps on malpractice, regulations on how data must be stored and shared with the government, etc.

&gt;This doesn't address anything I wrote. What self-assembled group are you talking about? Do you have block parties in your neighborhood where everyone decides which company to go with? You also seem to think that a company cares about a single person. If there are 7 people who are happy with their service, and 3 people who aren't, what are the chances the company will change anything for these 3 people? You are naive to assume they care about a single person, much less a small group.

You have immediate recourse with every dollar that you spend.  It doens't matter who *cares* about you spending the dollar, every dollar you don't spend with X and instead spend with Y is your active choice in not supporting X.  

The self assembled groups which I speak of are groups that are by and large not permitted to be assembled today.  The larger group of risk you can pool, the lower the average risk per-person, the lower the cost.  The larger the group, the higher the purchasing power, the higher the leverage in negotiating coverages and premiums.  This is exactly what we see today with company provided healthcare.  Why should companies be allowed to form groups and get tax deductions, yet when an individual wishes to do the same, they are not legally permitted?

&gt;Are you freaking crazy or just trolling? Do you understand the role of the FDA and government regulations? Let's put it this way: the FDA makes sure the Tylenol you take for headaches is actually safe. Just like with the beef you eat and the shampoo you use. Go to a country without a governing body like the FDA and see how many locally made medicines you'd want to consume. You're far too spoiled with the benefits the FDA provides, and the worst part is you don't even know it. You tell me to give up my ""freedom"" to the state. If you value yours so much, go live in any country in Africa where there are no Government regulations. BTW, your definition of ""freedom"" is incredibly skewed.

The FDA does not make sure that Tylenol is safe, it approves Tylenol for sale as OTC.  It provides no guarantees of safety and assumes no liabilities for any mistakes.  

7,000 people die each year because the FDA has not yet approved the Ambu CardioPump, which is approved for use in Canada, UK, Germany, Sweden, Japan, and Australia.  It was blocked from approval in 1994, yet saves lives each day in other countries.

The OmniCarbon heart valve was just recently approved, after being filed in 1986, and approved for us in most of Europe, Canada, and Japan.  

Interleukin-2 was delayed in its approval, while it was approved in France, Denmark, and other countries, thousands of kidney cancer patients died.  

Around 73% of drugs which are not approved by the FDA are approved in Canada, UK, and France.  

Then we've got approvals like Vioxx and Fen-Phen which led to serious health complications and tens of thousands of deaths.  Both of which were after FDA approval.

My definition of freedom is NOT skewed.  A person should be *free* to consume any susbtance they desire.  It is not the government's role to tell me what I may or may not consume, and with whom I may or may not associate.

I am not anti-certification, I am anti-government mandates.  I feel independent labs should provide certification for drugs and treatments, and doctors should discuss the options with patients including the certification information.  It should in no way be a function of the government to limit the treatment options of patients.

&gt;Insurance companies and big pharma want you to campaign for less regulation for them. That means they can charge whatever they want for services, all to maximize profit and minimize risk. They want to be able to sell you ibuprofen that has a little more contamination, but is cheaper to make. They don't want to have new drugs go through NIH studies to show how safe they are for Human consumption (mice are good enough, right?) They want to repackage the same old aspirin and claim that it reduces Diabetes.

I want more competition, which insurance companies actively lobby to eliminate.  With government collusion they are able to strangle the marketplace... but it's not possible without government involvement.

When I purchase fire safety equipment or electrical equipment, I look for the UL logo because I value the testing they perform.  I'm willing to pay more for safe equipment which is done by an independent lab.  If I feel that I wish to purchase an extension cord which is not UL tested because it is half price, I should be *free* to do so, but should assume all risks involved.  I am not *free* if I can not make such decisions for myself.

&gt;Again, tell me if you'd rather have an AMA approved surgeon using FDA approved anesthesia to remove your appendix, or some back-country ""doctor"" who buys second-hand Mexican-made rx drugs.

So your statement is that every licensed doctor is a great doctor?  Am I really reading this?  I had a surgical procedure 2 years ago and researched my surgeon extensively.  He's consistently rated in the top 5 for his category in the metro area and has high patient satisfaction with lower than average incidence of death during procedures.  I care about that, not his AMA license.

With regards to the drugs, I prefer discussing treatment options with my doctor rather than relying upon a government agency.  If I had glaucoma and could relieve my symptoms with marijuana, and my doctor feels it is the best course of treatment, should we be limited by the FDA and DEA's restrictions in my treatment?

Second, he likes to pose in front of old monuments. Please, we Europeans are fed up with fat Americans obstructing the view on our magnificent idols of bygone power. Since he went to Europe alone, he must have pestered countless of hardworking Europeans with his requests to take a picture of him being ""awesome"". Please, stop asking us, get your girlfriend to do it... ah oh wait...

Third, he somehow managed to live in a relationship where something as fundamental as ""oh baby I'm gone for 2 weeks in Europe""  got lost in conversation. And his friends didn't tell her? Why? How the fuck is that even possible. Leave your phone on, douchebag, after all your mother could die in a car accident or you could win in a fucking unsolicited mail scheme and have only 24 hours to claim your prize! 

Fourth: Instead of calling her at least once to see how she's doing, he wants to show his love by buying her a cheap Italian necklace from YOUR-AVERAGE-SOUVENIRSHOP-WITH-TOTALLY-ORIGINAL-PRESENTS-INC. Epic tourist fail my dear friend. 

This is all. I'm unnerved.

Even if Paulson didn't conspire specifically to provide huge amounts of cash to his friends he can be seen as caring about helping them.  Not through conspiracy but just an entitlement mentality he shares with them where they should be able to do whatever they want and if things go badly governments should bail them out.  Nobility in Europe didn't have to conspire to maintain the status quo they so deeply shared a sense of entitlement that they naturally took actions that supported the shared outcome of routing the wealth of the nation to their collective pockets.  Now you can also have out and out conspiracy to bring things things about (within the current government) but my guess is the more important factor is just having a bunch of people that all see the way the world should work is to route huge amounts of cash into the pockets of a few people.

They don't have to conspire in petty schemes.  They just naturally support actions that bring about the transfer of funds to those few people.  This is actually a much more robust design to bring about the desired results than having to conspire on all sort of individual schemes.  They just see the natural role of government is to provide huge benefits to well connected friends and carry out such actions.  They think it is perfectly appropriate to use regulations to allow anti-competitive behavior.  They think it is perfectly sensible to avoid regulation that would harm their rich friends.  I think such actions are much more common than any secret plots to take what isn't theirs and give it to friends or those that bribe them...

They see providing benefits to their rich friends much like someone else might see helping those that don't have enough to eat get enough to eat.

We were the couple that could spend an evening out with our friends or laze about on the couch and either way end it all in fantastic sex and confessions of love.  I know that something has happened to change all that, but you have to admit that you still feel something for me.  To deny that is to deny your very soul. I know you'll call me tonight. We have a lot to discuss. A lot of bad nd good.  It may not change things and we may still be broken up, but you at least owe me a conversation. A chance. Em

1. Careful when you date passionate people, because passion swings both ways. Sometimes they'll love you, but other times they'll hate you.  And when they hate you...boy do they hate you.
2. When you go to Europe for 2 weeks, leave your fucking phone on.)

If you want to have boiling water to drive turbines, it's prohibitively expensive unless you're in a tectonically active area (e.g. Iceland or California) where the geothermal gradient is closer to 30 deg. C per km.  In most places, geothermal will be limited to more passive heating methods, at least until we can find an efficient method of converting heat to electricity that doesn't involve boiling water.

&gt;Finland is instructive.  Finland is the country that had a steady downward trend in its prison population during the 1990s (though there has been a rise in the last couple of years).  The downward trend started in the 1970s, since when the numbers have been halved.  It is well documented that the decisive factor was the readiness of senior officials, the judiciary and the prison authorities to use all available means to bring down the number of prisoners.³  They had noticed that their neighbours had much lower numbers in prison and this led a group of key individuals to define the size of Finland’s prison population as a problem, and to produce a number of measures, not only law reforms and alterations to sentencing practice but also low level day to day decisions, which all contributed to the desired result.

Yes and yes. Granted, I don't eat cheeseburgers everyday. I'll buy a salad and put 1/4 packet of dressing on it once or twice a week for lunch. That's what's unhealthy, the dressing!

&gt;You can't tell people what to eat or not eat, but do you think your company encourages people to buy a big mac meal more than a salad?

We spend millions of dollars to advertiseour salads and healthy options. There is an entire division devoted to targeting healthy foods for young kids in our corporate communications/marketing department. McDonald's sells more fruits and vegetables than any other single company in the world.

That said, the consumer's wallet talks. Consumers buy more cheeseburgers than salads, that's just how it is.

MCD is a real estate company masquerading as a restaurant. We own the most land in the world, second only to the Catholic church. There were zoning stipulations in some European countries where we bought land for restaurants that required us to sell beer. It will never (not in the near future, anyways) be sold in America.

The Turks allowed other religions to exist within the empire in peace provided that non-muslims did not bear arms or take roles in the administration of the Ottoman Empire; and as long as they paid taxes. 


The Nationalism/Religion motivated ill will toward the Turks is a recent phenomenon caused in part by foreign influence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. After all, it was European influence that got the various ethnic groups within the empire to revolt against their Sultan.

Secondly, yes, that's all very well and good, but you didn't justify your O'Reilly math there.  

&gt;The Health care tax in Britain is 11 percent of your paycheck every week and *they are covering a much smaller population.*

You said that they are taxed 11%, and presumably it'd be more for us because we have a larger population (this assumption drawn from the italicized portion, I took it as a Tax percent:relative size of population to america ratio).  Nevermind that because we have a larger population we may also have, you know, more people working.  

Nevermind also that Americans typically work much, much more than European countries and so those hours worked by Americans may get taxed less.

So yes, because there are ten times as many Americans, that doesn't mean that there are ten times as much debt to cover, or in O'Reilly's case, ten times as many fatalities.

1. There are fairly effective govt. run systems. Of course, it is tricky, and maybe the US political system isn't up to it.

2. He's being pedantic. Of course it isn't free, steal from the rich more, already.

3. Sweeping statement, and frankly unbacked. AFAICS the mess was caused by the free market. Maybe it could be set up to work better though, for instance limits on how the contracts are set up, rules on when to drop people. (In the Netherlands they *have* to take on people, and money comes from a state pot if they would cost the insurance company money.

4. Possibly true, but i don't think it is ethical to get the rich flexibility over the backs of those who are poor/got screwed by insurance companies. You can set it up so people with more money can get more treatment to some extent.

5. From what we see European countries, it is just not true. Furthermore it would save a lot of money in insurance companies, etcetera.

6. What is or isn't he for universal health care? And emergency care is for emergencies. You'd think those are things that just *emerge* rather then things that one can see coming for miles. Treatment that gets there earlier is almost always cheaper.

7. Same as 4.

8. Afraid so. However, i guess there are already things to keep people safer, like car safety. Also in Europe (don't know about US)bans on smoking in bars/cafes Frankly i'd rather pay a little more taxes then take away freedoms that happen to be more risky. It's not really that bad though, except on soft drugs. I live in the Netherlands, but still, they should just make production legal too.. 

9. If the jobs at insurance isn't doing anything useful anymore, they should be lost. Those jobs are on the paychecks of the people.

10. Doesn't really have to be so. Private practice could still exist.

11. Uhm, don't know, how that would work out in the US.

12. Also, see 8. It is a rather real concern. In the Netherlands for instance, there is also a high tax on smoking and alcohol. (Although the reason might be more to get tax then to stop it's use.) Imo, it is not that bad, though. Again, it is up to the political system(uhm, well, maybe it's more complicated then that) to keep the government in check. (And the US one seems a little shoddy at this point.)

13. This is pretty much happening in the Netherlands.(You can opt out though.) I really don't get why they don't just give the patients a memory stick or something.

14. and 15 *Could*, it hasn't happened in many countries. Anyway, when some treatment is scarce either waiting lists pop up, or the highest bidder, it's just that choice. And if you have a waiting list you don't need a market to increase capacity.

Corporate American, nor the private medical sector, nor those who blindly oppose any and all public options don't have time on their side. 

Either they look like leaders now or fools later and then people will say DAMN we could have saved 30 trillion dollars if we just did public care back when the Clinton pushed it or maybe 50 trillion back when Truman tried to push it. 

There is no where to run from publicly managed care, it's just too damn cheap and effective compared to the spider web of bullshit America calls health care. 

So, go ahead, fight your war but it's putting the GOP's reputation on the line when all the facts point to the reality that public care would save us trillions is just a stupid move.

They should cave and ask for non health care related favors from the Dems because at this rate they've pushed the Dems into a corner where even if a Dem senator wanted to oppose health care they are being forced to pass something, anything to prove they aren't a lame duck congress. 

The harder the GOP pushes the more pressure the Dems feel the pass the bill however since they are using slander instead of rational the GOP are effectively silencing themselves from having any lasting say in the issue. 

If they don't cut costs the program will collapse in a matter of years, so the idea that they won't cut costs is a misconception at best. Costs are whats driving people to want public care now and it's not hard to realize that if costs don't come then the issue of costs will come up again with a more aggressive approach.

The trick is just getting the public plan in place from that point it will devour the private insurance industry and in doing so it will unite people. All these people on the care will be GET YOUR GOVERNMENT HANDS OFF MY PUBLIC CARE OPTION because once they use it they'll never go back and that's Obama's plan imo. You can take whatever concessions you want but if there is a public plan option people are going to flock to it and if you mess with the public plan they are going to raise hell and that means either private companies take less profits or... private companies go out of business and new smarter ones model themselves after more cost effective care system like in Europe and Canada.

first of all, it's not true that Muslim countries are representative of Islamic values of trying to end oversexualization of women. These societies are extremely sexual and exploitative of women. 

Secondly, despite this, their rates of violence against women are much much lower than secular and western countries. I think maybe in many redditors minds they are shocked to hear this, since violence against women in the Muslim world is often very sensational and reported more often than in other places. The numbers show that violence against women is higher in almost any european country, and a shocking amount higher in Australia and America. 

Third, it's not enough for a society to say ""ok it's illegal to cause any harm and that's the law"" - all societies, especially sweden, legislate social responsibility. I think one area that's severely lacking, especially in sweden, is to legislate social responsibility between men and women. 

Fourth, sweden has a huge rape problem, one of the biggest in the world, and according to the EU-sponsored Daphne II study, it has a large connection to night-life, partying, early sexual debuts, etc. 

&gt;Researchers behind the EU study, which will be presented on Tuesday, conclude that rape appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in continental European countries. In Sweden, 46 incidents of rape are reported per 100,000 residents. 
This figure is double as many as in the UK which reports 23 cases, and four times that of the other Nordic countries, Germany and France. The figure is up to 20 times the figure for certain countries in southern and eastern Europe. The study, which is financed by the Brussels-based EU fund Daphne II, compared how the respective judicial systems managed rape cases across eleven EU countries. Sweden is shown in an unfavourable light, according to the study. 
The high figures in Sweden can not it seems be explained purely by an increased tendency to report rapes and other more minor sexual offences. Rape simply appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in the other EU countries studied, the researchers argue. **Early sexual debuts, high alcohol consumption, ""free sexuality"" and the ""right to say no"" quite simply results in more rapes, the study concludes.** The Daphne II fund ran from 2004-2008 and was set up by the European Parliament as a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk

While the rest of the developed world find the US system so tragic that the US is frequently pulled out as a horror example whenever someone argue for more private involvement in healthcare.

Nationalized healthcare has been the biggest success-story of European governments since WWII, for example. It's the one thing no European could try to mess with without the risk of a popular uprising. That's how happy we are with what we have.

&gt; It's the cheap easy way out and all it does is kill flexibility and give the government more power.

How so? I live in the UK, and nobody here is prevented from going private if they want to. Most people choose not to for anything that is covered, since the government provided option is more than good enough. Yet private healthcare flourishes to cover things that are not covered, and there are options for other operations etc. through private hospitals catering for the small minority (ca. 10%) who still opt for private insurance.


&gt; The current system hasn't hurt me at all.

That's besides the point. The point is it is easy to find people it *has* hurt. Your current system is only in the interest of people that can afford to massively overpay for expensive insurance, or risk paying millions in cash, or who happens no never, ever get an expensive health problems. I prefer not to gamble.

&gt; I'm sick of having these conversations with people who clearly don't care about the ideals of democracy or capitalism. 

Capitalism? Of course not. The notion of putting property and profits before people is barbaric. 

Democracy? Of course - we care about ensuring the safety and security of people so they can actually participate in society on an equal basis, rather than put corporations on a pedestal and allow them to buy influence at the expense of people. If anyone makes a mockery of democracy, it is the US, where real political choice is practically non-existent.

&gt; We just need more competition which is a pretty simple problem to solve. Keep the government out of it completely, deregulate, and open up a national market.

The UK had that. It's the reason the NHS was built: The open, deregulated market that preceded it was an unmitigated disaster, to he point that it didn't even take the conservatives more than an election cycle after the NHS was introduced to realize they'd never get power again if they didn't start backing the NHS.

I diagree entirely. Our position as a first world power happened simply by the existence of our huge economy. The Entente wasn't begging us to enter WWI based on our history of policing Europe, it was begging us because we were in a unique position compared to any other overseas power.

&gt; Only laws that benefit the US I note. It isn't as if the US is out defending other nations interests. In short the US does things because they are good for the US.

While true in some cases, isn't this an even better argument against the US being the world's policeman? But still, in many other cases, we do things that do not benefit us at all: Tsunami aid, peacekeeping in the Balkans, etc.

&gt; The US also loans on a fairly predatory basis, attaches conditions beneficial to itself to aid and supports dictators. It is hardly the compassionate state you suggest.

In most cases around the world, the overthrow of a dictator is a *condition* for US aid. Rare exceptions, like some occurring in Central Asia at the moment, are mandated by our ""role"" as world-police: we can't get to Afghanistan without going through somewhere. Again, in most cases, US aid comes totally free of obligation. Consider the tsunami, or the billions in food aid sent to Africa [which does more harm then good, but it is definitely sent without condition]. 

&gt; You don't suffer at all. That is why prices in the US are so low, wages are (relatively) high and living standards are amongst the best in the world, even for your poorest. It would be a fallacy to suggest that the US has suffered due to the position of it's currency (although it may now) so far it has benefited beyond measure.

This is just plainly false. Western Europe has very comparable prices and standards of living to the US, and did so even before the Euro began to provide competition for the dollar.

It is not something that the market can't provide, simply something that it isn't currently set up to provide. We can solve this problem by encouraging competition. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater simply because the French (or whatever) system seems cheaper is to lose focus of everything but the current mess we're in. Permitting the government to delegate what a life is worth for the majority of the country (who would be on the nationalized health plan) is to invite sorrow. The government has no place deciding who gets to live and die.

The Entente wasn't begging us to enter WWI based on our history of policing Europe, it was begging us because we were in a unique position compared to any other overseas power.

I disagree, the US acted in an extremely effective manner both prior to and post WWI and WWII and benefited from its positioning afterward in both cases (massively in the second instance).  Not that that is a bad thing, the US also managed to influence Europe's development and essentially allowed Europe to forge the best part of half a century of uneasy peace.

&gt;While true in some cases, isn't this an even better argument against the US being the world's policeman? But still, in many other cases, we do things that do not benefit us at all: Tsunami aid, peacekeeping in the Balkans, etc.

Tsunami aid may have been altruistic but it wasn't exactly a significant proportion on US foreign military and humanitarian aid.  Of course it is an example of the US not acting in its direct interests (although on a PR basis it obviously is...) but then its contribution was on a par with the EU, not something isolated and unique to the US.  

As to the Balkans, the US certainly had an interest in the region, although a limited one, which is reflected in the number of troops it deployed (significantly less than Germany and the UK for example).

However, it is rather clear that the US's actions in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas where conflicts have been 'less' official were not due to some international moral position, but because of US national interests or US ideology.
 
&gt;In most cases around the world, the overthrow of a dictator is a condition for US aid. 

No, usually US conditions are economic and relate to the opening of markets to competition. Rarely does the US impose directly political conditions on aid, although it is not unheard of, it will use aid as a carrot (counterbalanced by the stick of US military of UN security council action). The US is not alone in this regard, but the consequences can be rather nasty, especially in Africa.

&gt;Rare exceptions, like some occurring in Central Asia at the moment, are mandated by our ""role"" as world-police: we can't get to Afghanistan without going through somewhere. 

US alliances have often been with dictators (albeit right wind ones) where it has been necessary, as we are aware the US has on more than one occasion essentially deposed a democratic government to promote an undemocratic one more sympathetic to US aims.

&gt;Again, in most cases, US aid comes totally free of obligation. 

Most certainly does not.  That said, the most needed aid generally does, food and disaster relief is almost always free of conditions.  Even then we should look at things like tsunami relief to Burma and the issues that came up at the time (that said I think that it is obvious that it was Burma acting the fool, not the US/EU etc...).

That however does not make up even a significant portion of US aid.  (development aid and military aid eclipse it).

I will point out though that aid from the US people (a surprisingly large amount) is obviously free of any conditions.

&gt;This is just plainly false. Western Europe has very comparable prices and standards of living to the US, and did so even before the Euro began to provide competition for the dollar. 

Not quite. The cost of living in Europe is generally higher across the board.  One aspect of this is the  difference in fuel costs, which has an impact on all parts of the economy.  Take the UK for example, fuel  costs $6.25 a US gallon, something like 300% of the US cost, in Germany it is $5.60.  That drives prices up.   Now add the fact that there is better consumer and employee protection legislation (making production and so goods and services more expensive) and you should realise that your point is incorrect.  I can't find the statistics now, but I am fairly certain that when I looked last the US had the lowest cost of living of almost any industrialised western nation, including Canada and the UK etc.. except possibly Greece and Turkey.

&gt;The dollar being relied on as the world's reserve causes all sorts of problems, namely, it contributed to the current economic meltdown. See the Triffin dilemma

And it also provides massive benefits, namely that the US can simply print its way out of debt, something that no other country can do.  Moreover the US has for the last 40 years been able to essentially export inflation, any increase in the monetary base was split over multiple countries and not just its own citizens.

&gt;This is not what I am suggesting at all. However, I believe a crash is inevitable. You can't change the fundamentals by fiat, no matter how hard you try. It would have been better for us to suffer the damage in September, rather than try to gloss it over through inflation and pay for it for decades. 

It rather depends.  I would much rather slide down a 1000ft cliff than fall off the top, the former may cause me harm over a long period and cost about the same, but the latter could be fatal.

I agree that the US system is broken, I agree that it is inequitable and I would love to see the US lose its position as the most dominant power in the world (and it is happening) I would also love to see the dollar collapse (slowly) and the banks shrink.

The US has and always will look after its own interests.  Those interests however may not always be the same as all of its citizens, usually it would generally be for some majority, or some powerful minority.  Even the bail outs and current collapse have benefited some of those, as did the various wars and dead soldiers.

Eventually they run out of options. They didn't get a good education, most likely, and now they need to turn to their ghetto and their family or join society, either way, their children start behind their competitian, as yet another immigrant didn't make the cut, and is less capable of being the parent which could give them a head start.",13,t1_c0bw5r9,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,IhateRedditors,c0bw5r9,0

Where he can fall on his slender prey roaring as loud as he feels like, and guzzle her blood with open joy.  Eh?  Where he can just wallow and rut and let himself go in a softness, a receptive darkness of limbs, of hair as wooly as the hair on his own forbidden genitals.  Where the poppy, and cannabis, and coca grow full and green, and not to the colors and styles of death, as do ergot and agaric, the blight and fungus native to Europe.  Christian Europe was always death, Karl, death and repression.  Out and down in the colonies, life can be indulged, life and sensuality in all of its forms, with no harm done to the Metropolis, nothing to soil those cathedrals, white marble statutes, noble thoughts . . .

The world seems to hate the US for its policies, but at the same tiime, I see some fairly genuine surprise and outrage when it does something not consistent with being the vanguard of morality and ""allows"" or otherwise enables something bad to go on.  The US is a selfish hegemon, but in all likelyhood, other regional powers would be exerting the same influence if they could.  The only common denominator would be weakened Middle east states.  China, Russia, and previous European empires have proven that they can and will be just as heavy handed in serving their own interests if given the chance.  The fact that the US is on top right now does not necessarily mean they are any worse or any better than the others.

Also to your point about no culture is more developed than another, I disagree.  I believe culture evolves and becomes more suited to the world we live in.  It is only natural that some cultures change more rapidly or adapt in more efficient manners.  Just the womens' rights issues is a good example.  A society that does not allow women the same educational and job opportunities of men is limiting the creative and labor output of half their adult population.  It would be difficult to compete with a country that does not do this all things being equal.  Add to that the past history and damage done by colonist and US involvement and they are at a huge disadvantage.  Also a with religion playing such an overt and key role in government it stifles new ideas .

Don't get me wrong, I have no illusions that the people in western nations are any smarter or fit to run the world.  I just think that a combination of factors in the middle east has caused them to lag behind significantly.  The US and other powers have definitely contributed to this.  Unfortunately the middle eastern people have been left holding the bag.  They will be the ones who have to end the status quo.  World powers almost assuredly will not because they benefit most from the situation as is.

Second, the images look way too modern, like graffiti from roman times or even well after. I'm thinking 11th - 13th century drawings by peasants.

Fourth, the source website is ""A Biblical Examination of SCIENCE'S FIRST PRINCIPLE -- HOW THE BIBLE DEFEATS SCIENCE"" -- hardly unbiased.

Fifth yet probably foremost -- this kind of conception of a line as delineating the boundaries of a human face and facial features doesn't even arise in Europe until a couple thousand years BC, well after the time of the supposed neanderthals.

And [TWO] a sense that centre-left is quite simply out of ideas and intellectually bankrupt *especially* in these times of crisis.

Exactly. That's why it promotes investment. Park your money in equity and you'll do just fine. If the historical record is any indication, you'll easily beat inflation by doing just this.

&gt;A deflationary environment encourages savings, which is what creates wealth. 

What utter horseshit.

Deflation usually starts from a collapse in the demand for consumer products, meaning that firms have lower revenues. They'd rather fire people (and freeze hiring) than cut pay across the board, so layoffs occur, people are poorer and spend less, thus reducing demand even further.

Deflation's good for you if you manage to keep your job, because you're getting an implicit raise every year, even if your salary stays the same. The problem is that stable corporate or government jobs (which ensure pay raises in a deflationary environment) become like rent-controlled New York apartments-- so coveted that they are never willingly given up, and therefore practically unavailable to those who don't have such jobs or the social connections to get them.

&gt;Computer prices fall at a rate much greater than 3% a year (which is the gentle deflation Americans saw in the 1880s), yet people still buy or upgrade their computers every day.

That's not deflation. That's improved efficiency - improved *productivity*. If anything, the decline in computer prices demonstrates that you can have an expanding money supply AND massive productivity gains that either hold prices constant or cause them to decline in some sectors. Most of the growth that occurred in the tech sector over the last 20 years occurred in an inflationary environment. Investment and consumer spending drove R&amp;D and capital expansion and caused new labor markets to develop in Asia. It's unlikely that there would have been enough capital or enough consumer demand to fuel all that expansion without an expanding money supply. New wealth requires new money, otherwise on a macro scale the economy cannot be pareto efficient.

&gt;our country's greatest economic growth was during the late 19th century,

I lauged. What retarded youtube video are you getting this crap from? 

Read up on the long depression and tell me why almost across the board industrial economies were erecting trade barriers and trying to scrounge up consumer demand in their colonies. The faltering of industrial economies not just in the USA but also in Europe during the late 19th centuries was palpable. Almost all growth in productivity in the U.S. from the 1870s-1890s reflected growth in the post-war population. On a per capita basis there was almost no growth, and most economic sectors were stagnant or saw falling revenues. There were severe stock market crashes in 1873 and 1893 that impacted the entire industrial world and took years to recover from. There was even an American ""Greenback Party"" that emerged in the 1870s to push for fiscal expansion to counteract the contracting economy. The only people who had it good during those days were the robber barons and the railroad and telegraph monopolists. For everyone else, life sucked. The country had a huge surplus of labor (much of it consisting of freed slaves) and nothing much for them to do. The lower east side of Manhattan had a lower life expectancy than Calcutta for chrissakes.  Read the slave narratives from those times and over and over again people talk about how much better off they were under slavery.

From an economic persective, the late 19th century one was the absolute worst periods in US history. The years beween 1873 and the late 1890s were actually called the ""Great Depression"" until 1933. And just look at what a tin can navy we had in 1914. It took us three years to finally build enough ships and enough weapons to put a sizeable army on the ground in France. That's not a characteristic of a country that has just experienced ""our greatest economic growth."" America at that time was overwhelmingly populated by poors.

Now, to make my position clear:

I cannot judge who has a legitimate claim or not in this particular conflict. My judgement is based on the fact that when a small country like Georgia is desperate enough to trigger a conflict with the Russian Empire, they must feel that their existence is threatened - nothing less would cause them to take such risks. When Russian sock puppets like Ossetia and Abhkazia act up, knowing fully that mother Russia has enough troops on their territory to defeat the entire conventional armies of Europe, they are not the victims - the are the aggressors. Those actions show no more courage that a little bully hitting another little boy while the bully's big brothers are immobilizing the victim. 

Your attempt to pretend that the situations are somehow equivalent clearly marks you as a Russian apologist, and since most honest people know better than to argue your positions I am guessing that you are either being paid to provide this support or you are a Russian apparatchnik trying to make enough noise to confuse the issue - yet another clear Russian aggresion against a former Soviet republic, designed to rebuild the USSR by whatever means necessary.

For what it's worth, I am no big fan of Saakashvili , but the election have been as clean as one can expect for that region, so I'll accept that he represents the will of his country. 

Ossetia and Abhkazia's citizens now carry Russian passports - whose will are they representing? I'm sure that that Ossetia's elections (monitored by only a handful of Venezuelan and Russian observers) were completely democratic :)",1,t1_c0bwa2x,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,DaPM,c0bwa2x,0

You're now chatting with a random 

Stranger. Say hi! A word of advice: ""asl"" is boring. Please find something more interesting to talk about! 

Stranger: hey 

You: hi 

Stranger: whats up? 

You: nm home alone 

You: so now what? 

Stranger: throw the party of the year 

You: If you could live forever, or at least a long time (several hundred years or maybe thousands) would you want to? 

Stranger: that's a good question 

Stranger: i mean 

Stranger: everyone wants to live forever 

You: oh not true 

Stranger: but without the impending threat of mortality life becomes meaningless 

Stranger: which is one of those annoying aspects of it 

You: life can be meaningless with the threat of morality 

You: at least IMO 

Stranger: didnt say it wasnt 

Stranger: but what makes people productive is the short amount of time they have to spend here 

Stranger: productive in the sense that they want to live their lives 

You: that's what I'm getting at. I've sort of ""awaken"". Life, earth, the universe everything around us. Our lives......are just a fucking blip 

You: like a nano fart 

Stranger: true 

Stranger: but it's so rare 

Stranger: in the universe 

Stranger: that it has to be worth something 

You: We don't know it's rare. We've barely gotten off our own rock. 

Stranger: well 

Stranger: probablity and all that 

Stranger: intelligent life is probably rare 

You: My point is. I wish I could live thousands of years so I could see what happens and analyze trends of human history 

You: For example 

You: I'm american. SOME day our government will collapse 

Stranger: i picked up a book from the library the other day on fashion throughout the ages 

You: That's a fact 

Stranger: it's fantastic 

Stranger: you can basically watch style evolve from furs to powdered wigs to top hats and modern suits 

You: I'd like to be there when it happens 

Stranger: it'll be soon enough 

Stranger: america's not doing that well 

Stranger: but china will replace it 

You: haha I know with the way our government is running things. 

Stranger: most likely 

Stranger: and i dont know if thats preferable 

You: Yes I've accepted that. China is a HUGE economic force and will probably dominate for the next 100 years. But I won't be around to see it. I would like to 

Stranger: ugh i'd hate to see china running things 

Stranger: they're kind of evil 

Stranger: not that the us isn't 

Stranger: but human rights violations etc 

You: My step mom visits china quite often. She tells me all these stories which makes me realize. It's impossibe to label that country anything. It's 1.3 BILLION people...

You can't generalize that. Their government is corrupt and oppresive 

Stranger: thats what i was talking about 

Stranger: the government will be running things 

You: well with 1.3 billion people they don't value life they way other countries might. 

You: Well we can both speculate what it will be like. I'd like to live long enough to KNOW 

Stranger: and the government is oppressive 

Stranger: i'd rather a sensible country would rise to power 

Stranger: but there aren't many of those 

You: yea. Also consider this. Have you seen the movie Idiocracy? 

Stranger: haha yeah 

Stranger: great film 

You: Well....it's a stupid comedy but I think they hit something big 

Stranger: yeah seems like the worlds headed in that direction 

You: Statically speaking uneducated poor people have more children the educated wealthy people. 

Stranger: i just saw a show with a bunch of americans talking about how vaccines cause autism 

Stranger: autism rates have gone up 

Stranger: but the number of kids dying from polio has also decreased drastically 

Stranger: but people buy that shit 

You: Try not to judge me for the next thing I'm going to say. With the more stupid people being born it's just a matter of time until idiocy takes over 

Stranger: the solution: forced sterilization based on IQ tests and analysis 

You: Ok so how can this be countered? MASSIVE education programs. I wish in America we spent as much money on education as we do on military. EVERY child should get a first rate education. Teachers don't get paid shit so no one wants to do it. Make EVERY teenager able to access a college education 

You: no your solution sucks 

Stranger: yeah it was a joke 

Stranger: well the problem with the american education system 

You: they made a movie about that. Gattica. Pretty cool/scary flick 

Stranger: is firstly the privatization of universities 

Stranger: then the fact that american high schools are set up under the impression everyone is going to university 

Stranger: so the system stops being about education 

Stranger: just a series of hoops to jump through to get into a good college 

Stranger: if you can afford it 

You: I've learned some staggering statistics recently. My wife recently applied to and was accepted into Teach For America (google it after this chat). It basically aims to take high achieving college grads train them to be outstanding teachers and then place them in failing schools. Their mission is to bring kids that are usually 1-2 years behind up to speed with the normal wealthy peers. 

You: For low incoming families, only 50% graduate high school. And of those 50% only like 10% end up going to college 

You: *income 

You: So really our education system is FAILING low income families 

You: It's called ""The Achievement Gap"" and it's not getting smaller 

Stranger: i dont see college as being a measure of success though really 

Stranger: it's just something thats been decided everyone has to do to be successful 

Stranger: but its terribly unproductive 

Stranger: i know some one whos fantastic at programming but wont be hired because he doesnt have a degree 

Stranger: so he now has to pay for college to go through and study all the things he already knows 

Stranger: high school was a big enough waste of time for me 

Stranger: i decided not to go to university 

You: Well that's also true, but not always true. Sometimes graduating college is simply a certificate. Someone without the certificate (i.e. your friend) can be much better than a college grad but not get hired 

You: That part is unfortunate 

Stranger: it's a system that serves to fulfill itself 

You: I'm not saying that everyone should goto college but everyone should have the *opportunity* to go if they want to. 

Stranger: yeah of course 

Stranger: so socialize it 

You: Some colleges, not all. 

Stranger: like they do here in sweden 

You: They should 

Stranger: american colleges are terrible money traps 

You: but have you seen the shitstorm created when they try to reform healthcare in the US?! 

You: It's simply retarded 

You: Agreed. 

Stranger: a friend tells me the first semester theyre forced to live on campus 

You: Some colleges have that policy 

Stranger: but yeah american healthcare 

Stranger: socialized medicine = communism 

You: ugh..... 

Stranger: just like 

You: Sometimes I want to leave America 

Stranger: a socialized police force 

Stranger: fire department 

Stranger: library system 

Stranger: etc etc 

Stranger: don't come to sweden 

Stranger: socialist democracy isnt that much better 

You: yea. There is this post going around the net. 

You might have seen it. About all the services the US govt provices. USPS, DOT, etc etc and they all work great but somehow people think Government = bad 

You: It's like who the fuck do you think put those stop lights in that direct your traffic or standardized safety requirements so you don't die in a car wreck 

You: 

You are Swedish? 

Stranger: yeah 

Stranger: lived in america until recently though 

You: Wow this is great! 

You: Sweden was one of the places I was considering 

You: also the Netherlands 

Stranger: you should probably move to the netherlands 

You: I like Swedish IP laws. 

You: and the pirate party etc etc 

Stranger: that the government gets to spy on its people? 

Stranger: ISPs are now required to run suspected file sharers over to the government 

You: Do they? They do that here in America too and people tried to sue and our congress passed laws making it legal and dismissing all the lawsuits. Fucking criminals 

Stranger: yeah 

Stranger: last year a wiretapping bill went through as well 

Stranger: allowing the government to monitor all phone/email traffic that went across international borders 

Stranger: if they so feel inclined 

You: 

You can thank american media companies for that (RIAA, MPAA). If it wasn't for those two organisations there wouldn't be a global push to track down filesharers. Slowly but surely most countries are falling 

Stranger: yes 

Stranger: the RIAA says that metallica's record sales are more important than people across the world's right to be innocent until proven guilty 

You: yea.......so sad 

Stranger: so the EU has been pushing for monitoring 

Stranger: in all of its countries 

You: gross 

Stranger: yeah 

Stranger: my ISP is refusing to comply with it though which i think is admirable 

Stranger: sticking it to the man 

Stranger: haha 

You: good for them 

Stranger: the pirate party is getting a lot of support 

Stranger: because of these things 

You: Well I hope they can cause change. They face a mountain of opposition, especially if they actually start scaring media execs 

Stranger: haha yeah 

Stranger: good luck to them 

You: Well it's been very refreshing talking to you. Restored a small bit of my faith in humanity =) 

Stranger: haha likewise 

You: I'm gonna post this conversation to reddit. Is that ok with you?

Well, you're not gonna believe this... they actually have enough money to make an **effective** health care system.

...but I like fireworks

&gt;**the EU finds itself under fire as the global economic crisis confronts it with the greatest challenge it has seen since 1989**

true.

&gt;**the tough question that has to be asked is whether the crisis could lead to the unraveling of European integration.**

Easy answer though: it could unravel *EU* integration.

&gt;**There are four key issues that need to be tackled...the first issue concerns the continuation of enlargement. The EU is an indisputable success**

...only it is very much disputed.  So much so people keeping calling for a referendum so they can vote No.  Those countries who are lucky enough to get a referendum and happen to vote 'No' are told they must have an endless sea-turtle affair of referendum upon referendum until they provide a 'yes'.  The EU is a fickle friend to the endangered referendae (?) of Europe - they like them only as long as the referendum likes them back.

&gt;**But EU membership has always been about more than economic integration and trade flows.**

....apart from its humble beginning when states got on side.  When it was sold as being exclusively about economic integration and trade flows under the EEC.  Only when economic assimilation had been achieved did the EU appear - and then everyone was told it was too late.  Resistance was, we were told, futile.

&gt;**Today, membership is a more powerful incentive than ever for what the EU calls three ""candidate countries"" - Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey**

...because why go through economic turmoil carrying baggage as heavy as dead bodies when you can inherit the equivalent of the walking dead in those that don't meet current EU economic criteria *and* have a border with Iraq as part of the bargain?

&gt;**The second key issue concerns the EU's internal structure. The Lisbon Treaty offers a fundamental redesign of how the union works, but despite the pressing need to enhance EU institutions' mobility and flexibility it is still awaiting ratification. The economic crisis makes it more important than ever to introduce these reforms.**

That's the treaty that they said would be a slimmed down version so they used thinner paper, smaller margins, scaled the font size down but they put more in.  The one which is sea turtles all the way down until a referendum throws up a 'yes'.

&gt;**Third, there is the euro.**

...that's currently killing Spain.

&gt;**But the financial and economic crisis has demonstrated the benefits of euro membership. Ten years after the common currency's introduction, the 16-member euro zone has the world's second-most important currency**

...and the world's most important currency?  That'd be the Hindenburg waiting to happen: the USD.  If you're having to sell other countries to adopting the Euro to bolster the ship; then there's a problem with the ship. And rats falling on your deck from the sinking ship alongside is hardly a great metre. 

&gt;**The final issue concerns European solidarity. EU enlargement brought greater prosperity, with living standards improving throughout the union, particularly in the new member states.**

Not really.  I mean the new member states did kinda well - until they realised that their next generation had moved out.  Now you have the big boys paying the tab for the others who are looking at their newly  fractured communities.  You don't need the EU to make a trade agreement and having to go through the EU is actually starting to harm some member states.  You don't need the EU for solidarity either: between football, foreign exchange students and the internet we got that covered.  If the politicians and the travel industry want to play ball then the more the merrier.

&gt;**The EU's newcomers have adopted growth models that rely to varying degrees on foreign capital to finance domestic investment and on banking systems that are largely owned by West European banks. It is a model that has served new and old member states well.**

So the newcomers are reliant on banks that have been both bailed, and are bailing others, out.  Banks that even if they aren't hit by USD Hindenburg are going straight into a pension crisis in the next decade. It seems you have a watertight plan.  

&gt;**This process enabled West European companies and banks to expand into new markets with higher growth rates and thereby satisfying pent-up demand and tapping unrealized potential.**

Oh you're tapping unrealised potential alright.  Helping them be like you, and paying for it, so then you can say there's growth only the only way you can pay for it is by creating growth - which you're paying for.  It's a bit like a shopkeeper buying all the stock of his own shelves to impress the accountant with his turnover.  There isn't any sustainability in it.  Demand: yes.  Sustainability: no.  

It's Catch 22's Milo Minderbender selling a eggs all over again.  The more I think about it; the EU *is* M&amp;M enterprises.

&gt;**To turn our backs on these countries would have serious economic ramifications.**

Not for them, they have no growth so they're obviously bound to do well according to this logic.  Serious economic ramifications indeed for those countries footing the bill; now they won't have to and since the article is about surviving economic downturn it's a great time for those Western European banks to start investing in Western Europe.

&gt;**The EU drew the right conclusions when it stressed that national bank rescue packages must not be designed in ways that starve subsidiaries, and also by doubling - to 50 billion euros ($71.8 billion) - the crisis funds available to EU countries outside the euro zone. The EU must not stand aside when solidarity is needed.**

That must be the reason why Europe isn't celebrating.  Their banks haven't been allowed to create enough debt yet.

I always though I got lucky that I didn't catch the worry gene that was obviously very prevalent in my family.


A few days ago, I was sitting in a Broadway show, one that I've already seen once before, and my heart started thumping. I got really nauseous and anxious all of a sudden, and had to like consciously take slow, deep breaths to calm myself down. My mom decided to talk to me about anxiety medication on the train ride home, and that freaked me out even more.


My sister takes Xanax I think? And she was given the smallest dose, which after a year or so stopped working. So the solution was simple, she was just given a higher dose. And she's fine now.


For a lot of my teenage life I thought I had bad anxiety. I worried like crazy and I overanalyzed situations, but it mostly happened in really social settings and it was never too much of a problem. I think I liked to turn it into more of a problem than it was. Then, just a few days ago, I felt what anxiety was really like. My best way to describe it was puberty times a million. I described it to my friend: ""I feel nauseous, and never hungry, and always worried, and I constantly have a headache, and I'm paranoid..."" and he joked around saying I could be pregnant. And then just spiraled out of control itself, and made me panic even more.


And just like you, I'm suddenly realizing that those basic things I used to take for granted now freak me out. I was in a car the other day in the heat and got dizzy, and then I started worrying about it, which made me dizzier, which made me worry more... etc.

""Soul Makossa was [a big] hit, in Africa, in Europe, and in America, where it came to be seen as one of the first disco records,"" says Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker magazine. Sanneh adds that, ""[Dibango] named his song after the makossa, a Cameroonian dance, but he stretched the word out, [and] played with it [so that it sounded like]: 'Ma-mako, ma-ma-ssa, mako-makossa'.""[1] Although Jackson's chant imitates Dibango's chant, Jackson's version is essentially a mispronunciation of the word Dibango is chanting.

Jackson's version of the Dibango chant has since been sampled and incorporated into other songs, including an interpretation by Rihanna on her 2007 single, ""Don't Stop the Music"", and the hook was also been sampled in D12 and Obie Trice's song ""Doe Rae Me"".

I have never found that being intolerant of a political ideology is wrong as long as you have considered the facts and are open to being convinced otherwise.  I am tired of people with power telling me how wrong it is to provide health care to the poor, I am tired of people with power putting the ten commandments everywhere, and I am tired of supply side economics being treated as a viable political theory.  I see no reason why I should tolerate these things.

&gt;Because like it or not, the south is governed by the same constitution as you are in the north, and last time I check that grants the right to disagree and elect people to office that represent their constituents.

I never argued with that.

&gt;I can't emphasize enough that I don't agree with the overriding political philosophy of the south, but that doesn't mean I think that the south should secede.

Look at this from my perspective.  I see southerners electing some of the most vile and hateful people to office while the people I interface with every day would never do such a thing, yet these people elected by southerners hold the same power the rational people that I elect hold.

You're right. Jews aren't entitled to any more than anybody else, nor were they ever - but also no less. Palestinians have a right for a normal peaceful state, and so do the Jews.

Time for some facts (i hope you don't mind):

1. Do you have complains about the fire department? Or a little more relevant: medicare? Seem to work just fine.
2. Ofcourse it isn't free, that's why you'll have to pay for it. In my country the taxes are higher because of this, oh no!  My taxes might be $400 higher (just a guess), but i don't have to pay $600 (a guess again) for my insurance. 
Or in case of the public option: You just pay a (cheaper) bill to a government agency in stead of your insurance company.
3. Not always. Only the US has these incentives and yet you have to most expensive system in the world. Most(/all?) european countries have cheaper healthcare, even through we actually treat ANYONE.
The real result of private healthinsurance: gigantic profits for the insurance companies. And they're doing that by raising insurance costs and denying treatment whenever they can.
4. Bullshit. I can go to the docter/hospital/ER whenever i feel like it. I'll ALWAYS get treated.
5. Wrong. Preventing is cheaper than fixing. Or in healthcare therms: Getting a check-up really doesn't cost much. Diagnosing a disease early on can actually save a lot of costs.
6. And still there are an incredible amount of people who die due to a lack of insurance... And the uninsured getting treated at ERs, you're paying for them too.
7. Bullshit, same as nr4
8. That's why some countries actually do charge (a little!) extra to smokers. Which is done by taxing smoking.
9. And the government can hire those people (although only a part considering the government option will be more efficient).
Universal healthcare is easier for 'records' ofcourse, but even in the public option it's not that much work ...
10. Bullshit again. The government doesn't tell doctors what to do or how much they can earn. They simply pay the bill. In case you don't believe me: there are plenty of doctors over here.
11. That problem (retarded as it is) has nothing to do with government-run healthcare. 
12. Already countering yourself are you? See nr8. My government does tax smoking, which is a nice way of making them pay for their increased health problems. And 'loss of freedoms'? Please, they can still smoke if they want.
13. Bullshit. Again: doctors take care of confidentiality. The government pays the bill.
14. Bullshit. FFS, there is no rationing! That's just fearmmongering.
15. Not true at all over here. More fearmongering.
16. Yes, if universal healthcare gets passed, you'll never get rid of it. And that's a good thing.
Face it: The US is the richest country in the world and yet all the other industrialised countries have a cheaper system even though it includes everyone. And it's just a good (or maybe even better) in quality of healthcare.",1,t1_c0bwmiw,False,politics,t5_2cneq,Sentinell,c0bwmiw,0

I completely understand that sentiment.  I don't understand why we continue to fight out of misunderstanding and misplaced hatred, why we allow corporations and individuals who only care about profit to guide our foreign policy, be it military, intervention, or just relations.  I don't understand how violence can be seen as an acceptable answer.  I don't see how people can turn a blind eye to rape, slavery, child soldiers, child labour, and a struggle to find the basic necessities for survival.  It sickens me to see the world throughout wrought with problems, knowing that I can't fix all of them and might not even be able to fix one or might not even see them fixed in my lifetime.  There is hope in knowing that there are people who do things, that there are small actions we can take to try to make things better and right.  When you look at it in terms of individual lives that you can affect, it becomes a little easier.  You can be a positive force in a handful of lives and sometimes that one life you invest in can make a dynamic change, not just in itself, but for those around.  By no means do I mean that we should ignore the larger issues, because we shouldn't and should continue to try to solve them, but sometimes working on and fixing the small things can work wonders.

&gt;  Clearly, I don't have an answer to this problem; I wish someone did.....

Don't we all.  Many of the problems in Africa were underlying problems that were waiting to erupt and the Europeans merely gave the grounds for their eruption during their colonial rule.  After they left, they exploded.  There is no easy solution when people have been taught hate or when they are merely seeking an excuse to hate.  Some find their excuse in religion, some in racism, and others in greed.  Even groups with artificial differences, like the Hutus and Tutsis, have reinforced their differences to draw out a conflict.  In Africa it all comes down to power.  The thing is, as much as we want to step in and stop the violence, doing so will only keep the hatred from exploding, it does nothing to fix the problem.  I hate to say it, but some of the nations need to be left alone to work out their power struggles or else there will never be peace present.  One of the main things the AU is trying to do is let Africa sort out its problems and, in all honesty, letting Africa sort out it's problems is probably one of the only ways it will become stable.",2,t1_c0bwnjm,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,nubbinator,c0bwnjm,0

Last I checked Bush and Obama, along with their respective parties, are pro-FISA, they're pro-CIA, they're pro-DOHS, they're pro-Federal Reserve, they're pro-NAFTA, they're pro-WTO. They both don't believe a shred of copyright or patent reform is wholly necessary in anyway that might benefit the individual or the populace as a whole, only reform that benefits corporations. Both parties do absolutely nothing to combat corruption within the EPA or the FDA.

How about education?  One side (R) push ridiculous policy like No Child Left Behind.  Has that been undone by our Democrat congress or President? Nope.   In fact, there was a voucher system in Washington DC, that allowed parents to have the tax money for their child be attached to the child, rather than the school.. allowing the kids to use tax dollars to go to private schools if they wished thereby makign the public and the private school compete for the students, since the money was attached.. else; fear the poor public school closiing down.  Guess what? Grades, graduation rates all in increased, disciplinary action decreased. But b/c this was a threat to the teacher's unions, and because Democrats hate any solution that doesn't encourage government reliance, they're out to kill the program now that Obama is in office.  Both sides put ideologies before education, they put their lobby groups (like unions) before education.

Both Bush and Obama have had staged and stacked ""Town Hall"" meetings full of planted friends in the crowd waiting with canned questions to give the illusion that they're speaking to us and listening to our concerns.    Both administrations are pushing for a National ID card of one form or another.  Both believe wholly in warrantless wiretaps.  AT&amp;T's illegal spying has not stopped under Obama and does not look like it will.  It was Clinton who gave us DMCA, it was Clinton how gave us the marriage act identifying marriage between a man and a woman at a national level.  It was Clinton who deregulated the media.  

Look at the history of war in the last 20 years: Reagan ramped up nuclear armament and started countless skirmishes over the cold war, Reagan's actions in Nicaragua and Chilie are chilling, his actions of People's Park is appalling, he was also responsible for empowering the Taliban, Bush Sr empowered Norega and started a bullshit war over fabricated crap with Iraq, Clinton continued to bomb iraq and fucked up Somalia, only to have Jr come in and start Iraq up again, and for Obama to continue this madness.

&gt; I have never found that being intolerant of a political ideology is wrong as long as you have considered the facts and are open to being convinced otherwise.

I think that intolerance and willingness to be open and consider the facts are mutually exclusive. I approach political ideology the same way I approach religion and philosophy--I feel strongly about all of them, but I could be wrong. I'll never know if I don't look at all sides openly and accept that I could be wrong.

Me too. But I will also admit that the south has taken a long time to start making progress, although it is now. I'm not sure that the pace of change will maintain without opposing opinions from other parts of the country. I think that the south being a separate country would slow the pace of change and hurt the south.

&gt; Look at this from my perspective. I see southerners electing some of the most vile and hateful people to office while the people I interface with every day would never do such a thing, yet these people elected by southerners hold the same power the rational people that I elect hold. They start wars that put blood on my hands, they take money from the poor and give to the rich, and they do it all under the flag of a god that I don't believe in. Now you tell me why I should be glad that they are under my flag.

I see your perspective, and I agree that the south has been largely responsible for a lot of terrible things that I disagree with, to my very core. I don't expect you to be glad that the south is under the same flag as you, but I do ask that you accept that they are and accept that.

While I don't think it's untrue I do believe there is a good reason for it.  Many places that give you vacation time (if any) only give you about 10 days of vacation.  In that two week time period Americans if they want to travel outside of america will have to spend up to 2 days going to and coming back from.  So in a 14 day vacation period about 2-4 days are already gone due to travel.  Then wherever we ended up going may not be as exciting or have as much stuff as America.  I know this may seem very ignorant and/or judgmental but if america does one thing right (it'd be blowing something up but if it's TWO things) it'd would be to make something entertaining.

So there aren't that many places that are very reasonable to go for vacationing for americans.

A popular sports magazine ran an ongoing story about Sakakibara's ties to the yakuza which led to PRIDE being kicked off the major network Fuji TV and back on to PPV, thereby losing a lucrative TV deal.

DSE sold PRIDE to ZUFFA (owners of UFC) and Dana White promised to continue the Japanese franchise rather than folding it into the UFC.
From Dana's accounts most of the former PRIDE management team stayed and kept their offices where they were supposed to continue PRIDE but instead they worked on a pro-wrestling org called HUSTLE (owned by DSE).

Dana claims they tried working with their own management team but were met with cold responses by the Japanese networks and eventually gave up and essentially folded PRIDE into UFC by unifying the titles (with the exception of Fedor and Gomi).  Both Japanese and western PRIDE fans were extremely disappointed by this and many believe folding PRIDE was always Dana's intention.

Since the death of PRIDE, MMA is no longer ""mainstream"" to the extent it was back in 2005, even K1 is experiencing a drop in audience figures. Getting the audience back requires a new, fresh crop of Japanese superstars - who are sparse and the UFC doesn't really have any in their roster.

It would be an uphill struggle to run UFC in Japan in an ever decreasing market.

Further, is it not possible that even if our health care is more expensive due to necessities of advertising that it is still more beneficial than a socialistic system because it permits people to choose between multiple providers?

&gt;So chances are, once you're in a public system like that, you won't EVER need to pay an extra cent for any of the medical attention you might require.

I think you've missed the point. It isn't whether people will generally be covered or not (that is evident), but rather what happens to the people at the margins when the government will not cover them. The UK has a 5 million dollar limit for adding one additional year of life to a person's life. If your treatment will cost 5.001 million dollars to give you that additional year, you are screwed. Being that most people barely have enough money to afford one health insurance policy, most people won't be able to afford a private supplemental to the public insurance, thereby subjecting them to death if the bureaucrats in Washington decree that only X dollars may be spent to save a life, but a given person's health care will cost X+1 dollars.

&gt;TIP: Travel someday. Go to any European country (except the UK). Check how a regular public hospital works, and get informed about it. Then sit down and wonder why have all your previous governments been denying that to you all for your whole history. Then think about how ironic it is, that when you finally get a president that wants to help you and make things right for once, you actually reject him. I guess you have what you deserve... or they've really brainwashed you.

I've traveled England and Italy, but I appreciate your patriarchal, sarcastic tone.

1426014621,t3_999kk,,True,,1250002245,0,,1,True,t1_c0bwbw5,0,"&gt;You obviously don't understand that public (government-run) health care is compatible with private health care.

This is getting tiring. 

Let me do some basic math for you. 

The average (AVERAGE, mind you) American has 5000 to spend on health care per year. Health care currently costs 5000 dollars per year. That means a lot of people get coverage, but people on the lower end are left out (hence the current problem). However, while most people are covered, they can afford no more coverage than what they currently have. 

If we went to a nationalized system, prices would probably not drop significantly because the way we DELIVER health care would not change. At best, lets guess that health care will drop to an average cost of $4000 per year. This will cover more people, but only at the cost of more taxes. However, for the sake of argument lets say that the average person still has $5000 to spend on health care per year. This means that the average person has $1000 spare dollars per year (provided they set aside the same $5000 they did before, and provided they were not taxed more heavily to cover the people on the lower end of the scale who cannot afford health care). This $1000 per year would have to be enough to cover a private supplemental in full, which it well may not be. If it is not, the average people will not be capable of paying for a supplemental, and will thereby be relegated to government insurance only. Any treatment that the government refuses to pay for, or any money that the government insurance plan refuses to pay will result in the death of unhealthy Americans, and they will have no alternative place to turn. 

&gt;Then, if you happen to need those few things that aren't covered, they'll still be much cheaper that they are for you right now, because private health care systems in countries which have a solid and working public plan have to be competitive in order to win customers. Otherwise, they'd be out of business, as everyone would go for the public option. This means that they spend very little on anything which hasn't got to do with medical facilities, equipment or staff.

This logic should apply to the current situation in the United States, yet it does not. If competition is fully capable of providing cheap, effective health care, why shouldn't we just try to introduce and foment competition rather than radically overhauling the entire system and nationalizing health insurance?

I was boots on ground in Kuwait on Thanksgiving in 2002 - before the war was a war.  Back then I never thought my country would through action or ignorance propel us into war.  Looking back it's pretty hazy and the evidence looks thin.

&gt;&gt;How can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster? This must be the product of a great conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man. A conspiracy of infamy so black that, which it is finally exposed, its principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men.…What can be made of this unbroken series of decisions and acts contributing to the strategy of defeat? They cannot be attributed to incompetence.…The laws of probability would dictate that part of…[the] decisions would serve the country’s interest.

&gt;Now turn back fifty years to a manifesto signed in 1895 by a number of leaders of the Populist party:

&gt;&gt;As early as 1865-66 a conspiracy was entered into between the gold gamblers of Europe and America.…For nearly thirty years these conspirators have kept the people quarreling over less important matters while they have pursued with unrelenting zeal their one central purpose.…Every device of treachery, every resource of statecraft, and every artifice known to the secret cabals of the international gold ring are being used to deal a blow to the prosperity of the people and the financial and commercial independence of the country.

&gt;Next, a Texas newspaper article of 1855:

&gt;&gt;…It is a notorious fact that the Monarchs of Europe and the Pope of Rome are at this very moment plotting our destruction and threatening the extinction of our political, civil, and religious institutions. We have the best reasons for believing that corruption has found its way into our Executive Chamber, and that our Executive head is tainted with the infectious venom of Catholicism.…The Pope has recently sent his ambassador of state to this country on a secret commission, the effect of which is an extraordinary boldness of the Catholic church throughout the United States.…These minions of the Pope are boldly insulting our Senators; reprimanding our Statesmen; propagating the adulterous union of Church and State; abusing with foul calumny all governments but Catholic, and spewing out the bitterest execrations on all Protestantism. The Catholics in the United States receive from abroad more than $200,000 annually for the propagation of their creed. Add to this the vast revenues collected here.…

Given only 200 years to work with, then, the fact that almost a fifth of the S&amp;P have been around for a quarter of that time and a few have been around for half is remarkable longevity.  Some of them manufacture products which are obsolete in a matter of months; they've survived literally hundreds of product cycles.

&gt; If free markets lead to monopolies and oligopolies, then we would have high prices, little competition, and virtually no economic progress. If this were true then Eastern Europe would be economic powerhouses and the U.S. would be a basket case. In short, reality doesn't agree with Marxist theories.

I never said I was a Marxist, though I find your implication that the US has a model economy pretty rich.  And blaming Eastern Europe's economic woes (if, indeed, that's not an overgeneralization) on the Soviet Union's communism is trite and misleading.  There's a lot more going on there than the application of any one economic philosophy.

You make a superficially fair point about my choice of industries, but upon inspection I don't think it works.  First of all, I didn't bring up health care; I was responding to nixonrichard, who identified it (probably not totally incorrectly) as the source of reddit's beef with the free market.  Second of all, I never said the insurance industry was a poster child for the free market.  I said it was a poster child for business; its business model illustrates exactly what is wrong with the idea that businesses will work for us if simply left alone.  Aside from government regulation, the insurance industry's business model provides them no quality incentives whatsoever.

I agree there's plenty of government intervention.  I don't think all of it is very effective, but we would be much worse off without it.

And I must confess, I can't stand the pretense that we should be ""objectively"" discussing economics instead of politicizing it.  Even if I had been free to choose my example, I would very likely have chosen health care **because** of how political an example it is - it is a case of market principles and economic decisions bearing on our lives in a clear and integral way, and I won't pretend that's irrelevant.

I've been to a few different European countries myself, and you're right- Americans are generally more open and ready to talk to you (this is not to say that all Europeans are unwelcoming; far from it, it just takes a little extra time for them to get to know you).  I think this might be due to our sheer size, in terms of both geography and population; if it exists somewhere else in the world, it probably exists in America as well, so we're not afraid of encountering radical opinions or ideas (unless you live in the deep South or Fundie Territory, anyway).

""On the basis of the metrical and morphological data outlined above, we may dismiss the theory that the Anatolian Turks are in any sense mongoloid.""

And [this study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117873906/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0) says that only 13% of Turkish genes were contributed from Central Asia. I'll also add that even Central Asians aren't fully Mongoloids as the East Asians, since they're closer to Europe.

Not to mention that Turkish haplogroups show a total of 10.2% Asiatic genes while the rest of the genes are of Caucasoid mixture including genes from the Europe, the Caucasus, and the Near East.

Different studies of course show different things, but I think haplogroups are the most reliable thing to consider. And I think it's pretty obvious just by looking at Turks that they really aren't Mongoloids. I'll post more pics:
