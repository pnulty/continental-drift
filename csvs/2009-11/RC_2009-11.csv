c0f6pxh,politics,,True,22,"Ask him what Israelite tribe he descends from. He probably has no idea, and probably can't trace his family heritage back more than 3 generations.

""Jew"" technically means a member of the tribe of Judah. Israel was made up of 13 other tribes. You also had the nations of Asher, Benjamin, Dan, Gad, Issachar, Levi, Naphtali, Reuben, Simeon, Zebulun, and the two half tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.

These other tribes were broken up and largely deported from Palestine and carried off as slaves or driven into exile at other times throughout history. They are the ""Lost Tribes."" The remains of Judah was demolished when the Romans obliterated Jerusalem in 70C.E. Many of the Jewish inhabitants in Judea who stayed around are the ancestors of the many of the modern day Palestinians.

Most of the northern tribes of Israel were driven northward and westward and probably slowly migrated their way across Europe and into what is modern day Iran and Afghanistan almost a thousand years before the final fall of Jerusalem. That was about 3K years ago, which means their ethnic identity is surely dispersed and diluted by now. They've simply melted away into the surrounding peoples. Their dispersal probably means that all Europeans probably have a little piece of ""Israelite"" in them somewhere. There are even black African tribes which claim to have descended from ancient Israelites, and independent DNA tests have concluded that they are genetically different from surrounding people groups.

Look at the way Muslims are treated in Europe, where there are many extremists advocating extreme things in the streets. That has prompted certain reactions against them.

Now look at the US. There few, if any, extremists, and certainly no one advocating extremist things in the streets. The only thing that happens is a few terrorist attack from some random non-citizens. While there are certainly bigots in the US, there is rarely abuse against someone simply for being a muslim. 

&gt;awfully convenient to tell the victims of intolerance that they brought it on themselves

They are fully capable of controlling what they say and the way the act. That is why they are being targeted by the kinds of people that don't tolerate such things. Suppose a flamboyantly gay man goes to a redneck bar in the countryside and starts flirting with the redneck patrons. The kick his ass because they're intolerant bigots. Would you say he brought it on himself? I sure would. Now suppose that I, a suburban white kid, go to an inner city black club. Suppose I start yelling that my people will dominate them. I get my ass kicked. Who's at fault? Me, or the black people? And are the black people *bigots* for beating me up? After all, if I was black they probably wouldn't have cared too much, and all I was doing was talking. Of course, regardless of how you answer those questions, I brought it all on myself.

Sure we can.  What you meant to say is you don't want to draw such parallels.  Here let me show you how parallels can be drawn.

Estimates for Romani deaths in the Nazi Holocaust vary.  In November 2001 a report issued by the International Organization for Migration (the IOM), a body designated to locate and compensate surviving Romani Holocaust victims, stated that “recent research indicates that up to 1.5 million Roma perished during the Nazi era.”  Other reports show that after the war approximately only 500,000 Romani people remained in Europe.  [Dr Sybil Milton, former senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Research Institute in Washington put the number of Romani lives lost by 1945 at “between a half and one and a half million”.](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005219)

Part of the problem in identifying exact figures lies in that even prior to 1942 the Nazis often had a shoot on site policy when it came to the Romani people.  

You could always argue that the good Gypsy people should be provided with a Helmsdeep, their own country with recognised borders to roam, somewhere to return to.  They have an ancestral claim to India, parts of Pakistan and the disputed territory of Kashmir! 

You could go on and do the same for all other groups, showing how they've been persecuted and using that suffering as a justification for setting up Gaytopia, Marxville, Libertatia, etc. etc.

The Jewish people had a story about how a long, long time ago they originated from a wandering migrant originally from Ur called Abraham.  Abraham's descendants did a lot of traveling (like gypsies), some slavery (like gypsies), before ultimately migrating outwards (like gypsies) and ultimately fighting for their own tract of land (gypsies were forced settlement).  The people who had been living there,  the Amalekites and the Caananites, to give two examples, were put under all manner of [horrible things](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0520.htm#17), genocide included, at the hands of these wandering *homeless migrant, Abraham's,  descendants.*

It's a real shame it has come to this...

They targeted a lot of specific people.  The International Organization for Migration (the IOM), a body designated to locate and compensate surviving Romani Holocaust victims, stated that “recent research indicates that up to 1.5 million Roma perished during the Nazi era.” Other reports show that after the war approximately only 500,000 Romani people remained in Europe. [Dr Sybil Milton, former senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Research Institute in Washington put the number of Romani lives lost by 1945 at “between a half and one and a half million”.](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005219)  That's a figure representing a possible 75% of the Romani population in Europe.

&gt;**This doesn't mean that other minority groups were butchered in the holocaust, but they weren't the main target.**

It is a real shame when talking about genocide you want to get into a who has the biggest willy competition.  It's not about groups.  People lost their own lives; 1 for 1, 1 person, 1 life.  Until there was 11 million of them lost in total.  Don't try to make it any less terrible than that to garner some political leverage - *which is exactly what you're doing*.

&gt;**If you look at history - Jews were chased, attacked and fought against for centuries, and the climax was the [&lt;Nazi Genocide&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust).**

If you look at history - Gypsies were chased, attacked and fought against for centuries,[ even enslaved right up until the 19th century,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Persecutions)  and the climax was the [&lt;Nazi Genocide&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos).

&gt;**The UN declared Israel as a country to be a safe-house for Jews from all around the world, denouncing the declaration of Israel, is the same as denouncing the declaration of any other country.**

See, I've not disregarded the declaration of Israel.  Israel declared its independence from an independent Palestine as recognised by the League of Nations covenant.  I don't think it was fair how it was done but it is very much legal just as any other secession.  The UN did not form Israel however, you need a SECURITY COUNCIL resolution for that.  Israel never got one.  There was only a non-binding General Assembly resolution on partition.  However the League of Nations DID establish a country as a safe house for Jewish people on the condition that the people already living there accepted a mandate and that all measures were taken to ensure the consideration the people who were already living there were accommodated.  They didn't call it Israel though.  They called it Palestine.  It was in this context that massive European migration began.  It was this immigrant population that allowed a declaration of independence for a 20th century Israeli state.

&gt;**The 6 Million Jews that were killed were killed out of being Jews, not out of being activists, academics or homosexuals.**

5 million were killed for being activists, gypsies, academics, political prisoners, homosexuals, artists and disabled.  Some of the 6 million others were also migrants, academics, political prisoners, homosexuals, artists and disabled.

&gt;**Please read a bit on the holocaust, Hitler killed a lot of people, but no ethnic group was such of a target like the Jews.**

You back to crying the biggest victim.  There doesn't need to be a biggest victim, or a smallest.  75% compared to 70% , 6 million Jews compared to 1.5 million Gypsies compared to 5 million non Jews compared to *24 million* Russians.  Look at Poland, we talk about Jews being targeted but if you were Polish they didn't even have to bother with going through the rigmarole of taking them to one side before killing them.  The same with the Romani gypsies - SS groups often had shoot on site policy for them.  240,000 Polish soldiers/combatants were amongst the 6 million Poles killed.  Think about that.  They just didn't bother using gas chambers on the Polish.  They probably felt why bother when you have artillery, a village, a need for target practice and there's nobody who can say anything to stop it.  I'm sorry but what happened to the Jewish people was terrible but don't think you can justify singling them out.  You can't.     

PLEASE READ a lot more on other aspects of other things because you seem obsessed with justifying a persecution complex and not just a tad egocentric neither.  What you're empowering is people profiteering on suffering. Guilt manipulation by orchestrating biggest victim status whilst detracting from the price others had to pay.

You don't need to break it down, martyring yourself in a who's the biggest victim competition.  Genocide.  11 million.  Very bad.  Shouldn't happen again.  Certainly shouldn't allow ourselves in being guilt tripped into looking the other way when illegal land seizures and ethnic cleansing is being carried out.

I agree with you that absolute radical ideas have no practical use and of course I agree with your thoughts on the military aspect of the government spending.

Regarding absolute freedom and the point that taxation is needed to pay for things society needs, I would argue that, although this is a common ""accepted"" way of looking at society in the modern day and age, having forced taxation might actually be where the line between freedom and oppression lies. 

I just minced the words modern day and age, but if you look back you can see that taxation has always been the means by which people have been oppressed in many parts of the world. The ideals behind the foundation of the US were exactly freedom from old-world oppressions, among which I would argue that forced taxation is one of them.

On one end of the scale we have the idea of paying small amounts of taxes for regular operation of a minimal government and absolute necessary services, which should not be forced, and on the other side of the scale we have the idea of taxation for practically everything. Honestly, the discussion is, where should the line be drawn. When is enough taxation and government control of society enough? Some of us believe people can setup institutions and charities to carry out these efforts. If people don't want to do this, the idea of forcing them to do it through the use of government force goes against the very ideals of freedom.

Imagine if we also add the idea that government should also handle contracts between workers and companies, so workers do not get abused by companies. Let's also throw in government handling and choosing which career and university you should take because we also socialize higher education. Let's take one small step further and socialize big profit making companies, because after all those rich companies earned their money from the general public! ... do you see what we have now? a complete communist state.

I am not using the word ""communist"" loosely here. I understand that there might be people who actually believe in it or in a socialist system. However having known about communist countries and even socialist european countries at least from my point of view, at the end of the day, these socialistic systems hinder progress and prosperity (even though they like to paint themselves as progressives). You just have to look at the mindset of a typical American and a typical European to see who is the one who actually wants to progress, become successful and who is the one who just wants to lay back and do as little as possible in life.

Israel came about by a Jewish population declaring independence themselves on the day the British Mandate was to expire.  Nothing was given to them.  Palestinians accepted a British mandate in return for recognition as an independent state, development aid post Ottoman Empire-WW1 and established borders which were officially ratified in 1923.  The British mandate afforded Jewish protection in Palestine in accordance with what they had set out in the Balfour declaration for *Palestine*.  There was a large Jewish migration.  This European Jewish population allowed for secession with a declaration of independence in May 1948.  Unethical but quite legal: that's how it happened.  

&gt;**But it would would be just as wrong to try to fix the problem now by seizing that land back from the Jews and giving it over to the Arabs.**

Finally something I can get behind.  What you could quite easily do is turn round to all those settlements and settlers and say ""1967 borders!"" in accordance to what Israeli post-Zionists, the 22 state Arab peace initiative and what both major democratically elected Palestinian parties all propose.  The Jewish settlers would be free to stay where they are in the homes they've built.  Of course they'd now be living in Palestine, paying Palestinian taxes and having to abide to Palestinian laws lest they be pulled in front of the Palestinian judiciary.  The Israel occupation as identified by the Geneva Convention and the UN Security Council would cease.

The founding fathers created this form of govt because they wanted LESS democracy.

Some paraphrases from founding fathers:
James Madison (aka Father of The Constitution): 
1) Democracy is not right for america.
2) The way to rule the USA is to protect the rich from the masses, and we can do that by making voting districts larger and more diverse, and therefore having more factions. More factions mean that the masses cannot unite and discover their common interests and therefore cannot use the govt  to hurt the rich.

Elbridge Gerry: The problem with the USA under the Articles of Confederation is that we have ""an excess of democracy"".



If you want to live in a nation like western european nations, then try to make america look like a western european nation: we must be a smaller nation, with more white people percentage wise, and we must have a parliamentarian system where the power of the govt rests in the hands of politicians elected from small, non-diverse districts.

Gypsies have been persecuted just as much, they have a traceable geographical link.  But they're not a nation apparently.  Israel is a nation today, Jews living in Palestine had a legal right to break away (not a very moral one though). But Israel not only  IS a nation, it WAS before Israel declared independence. But gypsies 'no' - apparently.

Surely that's the circular logic here.  

As for the British blocking them, the British were in charge of a League of Nations mandate and were trying to implement a Balfour Declaration which specifically called for Jewish protection in a *Palestinian* state.  

&gt;**During the Mandate, the Yishuv or Jewish community in Palestine, grew from one-sixth to almost one-third of the population. According to official records, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally between 1920 and 1945.[57] It was estimated that another 50–60,000 Jews and a small number of non-Jews immigrated illegally during this period.[58] Immigration accounts for most of the increase of Jewish population, while the non-Jewish population increase was largely natural.[59]**

&gt;**Initially, Jewish immigration to Palestine met little opposition from the Palestinian Arabs. However, as anti-Semitism grew in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigration (mostly from Europe) to Palestine began to increase markedly, creating much Arab resentment.** 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine#The_Jewish_Yishuv

They specifically allowed a 10:1 migration ratio whilst still being committed under the League of Nations to not malign the present population and to take into account their country.  But don't go attacking the British!  They're the guys that arranged the [Kindertransport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindertransport) before outbreak of war without putting any cap on it, they're also the one allied country that fought from start to finish and whilst Russians gave blood and the American brought muscle in 1942 nothing would have worked if the British hadn't bought time.  The very word Auschwitz and its connotations would never have been known to the world, and a very different world it would have been too.  Not only that but whilst they were doing all this they were actively being attacked by Zionist militants.


&gt;**Don't speak of history without knowledge.**

I think you'll find if you read the previous comments the only problem *you'll* have with my history is that it's not revisionism. 

&gt;**You reason that Jews have no right to a country, a national home, because we are not a nation.**

Actually, if you'd read the previous comments I've just said,

                   &gt;&gt;&gt;Israel came about when Jewish people
                        living in the ""independent"" Palestine declared
                        independence themselves after the Second
                        World War.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Now where did I say they didn't have a right to declare independence?  They were legally in Palestine (well the vast majority of them were), they declared independence - an act of secession.  Where have I said that was illegal?  What I have argued is that the idea that they had a prior moral claim on Palestinian land is dubious in the extreme, that the Nazi Genocide which included 6 million Jews is no justification for extending illegal settlements today and if we were to follow the same logic as what neo-zionism follows then today the US would be supporting Romani gypsies seizing lands from Pakistan, India and Kashmir as justified.  But once they were in Israel they had every right to break away.  

*Only since then there was a settlement in 1967 and if you watch the video the transferring of a civilian population into occupied land is against both the Geneva Convention and contrary to several United Nations Security Council resolutions.*

&gt;**You reason that Jews have no right to a country, a national home, because we are not a nation.W  hy are we not a nation to you? Because we have no national home.**

See you're talking about rights now.  It was the other user that said that Gypsies didn't deserve a country because they weren't a nation, despite all their suffering, where as Jews did.   

Well the declaration of Israeli independence was in 1948.  Prior to this Israel wasn't a nation.  I'm sure you're not going to disagree with that, are you?  Where was the nation of Israel in 1942 when Eichmann and Groß were looking at Madagascar?

Israel is a nation today.  I can show it to you on the map.  Before 14 May 1948 (or 5ylar 5708 if you prefer) and [Yom Ha'atzmaut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Ha%27atzma%27ut) it wasn't.

You imply that since modern Americans live on the land, they deserve it.  Because they paid someone for it who stole it from the people who lived there before.  You either need to decided that land conquered belongs to those who conquered or those who lived there before.  In both cases Israelis have a right to at least coexist with Palestinians in Israel.

You're like the person who walked out of the theater while watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" right when the monoliths were discovered, and you've been justifying your fail decision by hating on monoliths ever since.

I saw the BeBox/BeOS demo at Macworld around that time, too, and yeah it was awesome. I also have a soft spot for [Jean-Louis Gassée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gassée). Have you seen [Haiku](http://www.haiku-os.org/)?

Apple almost had BeOS to itself, but Gassée pushed too hard: ""In 1996, Apple Computer decided to abandon Copland, the project to rewrite and modernize the Macintosh operating system. BeOS had many of the features Apple sought, and around Christmas time they offered to buy Be for $120 million, later raising their bid to $200 million. However, despite estimates of Be's total worth at approximately $80 million,[citation needed] Gassée held out for $400 million, and Apple balked. In a surprise move, Apple went on to purchase NeXT, the company their former CEO Steve Jobs had earlier left Apple to found, for $400 million. NeXTSTEP was used as the basis for their new operating system, Mac OS X.""

I'm assuming here you use Windows unabashedly. You may not be aware of this then: ""However, partially due to behind-the-scenes pressure from Microsoft, Be was not successful in getting top-tier OEMs to bundle BeOS with their hardware - only Hitachi and AST (who were major in Europe at the time) did so - which Gassée saw as fundamental to their success."" If you loved Be, you really should not like Microsoft at all.

&gt; I would actually prefer to use Windows ME.

c0f7chf,politics,,True,18,"I agree with you in principle but I really want to point out that nobody gave any land away.  The UN passed a General Assembly resolution which was non-binding that called for partition.  For it to have been binding the UN Security Council had to act on it passing a resolution to support it.  When it went to the Security Council they needed 7 votes for it to pass.  They only got 5.  It came back unsigned.  On the day the British mandate expired Zionist Palestinian residents (I know the 'Zionist' term is packed with emotive resonance but in this case that's the right term) declared their independence establishing what was effectively a true* civil war.

Personally I believe it would have been wiser if the British mandate were extended and if German Jews had been taken to Dresden and told they'd be safe.  Any non-Jewish German who had a problem should have been given a free tour of the cold Auschwitz camp and given the wake up trip of their lives.  Allied troops were still present for quite some time - order would have been maintained.  They could have gotten busy rebuilding what the RAF flattened whilst the German people also got busy rebuilding some other bridges.  Of course in the wake of so many of our own young soldiers the immigration channels in the West should have been swung open too.  Up until the outbreak of war Jewish immigration to Palestine had been 10:1 compared to non-Jewish immigrants - to some extent that too could have been re initiated. Britain had to open up to mass immigration anyway by the 1950s to help rebuild.  With all the rebuilding to be done in the wake of death across Europe there was plenty of room for the homeless masses to start again.

Israel:

- Had expatriates of many successful intelligence operations of Old Europe at exactly the time the United States was discovering that our skills at HUMINT were atrocious.  In other words, much of the American worldview of the Near- and Middle East was shaped by Israelis, invariably to the benefits of the Israelis.

- Did not choose a policy of nonalignment, as Egypt and Saudi Arabia did, or a policy of aligning with the Warsaw Pact, as Syria did.  They aligned explicitly with the United States, providing us with our only ally in the Middle East that wasn't a proxy through the United Kingdom (like Iran was).

- Provides the lion's share of SIGINT espionage tools and methodologies used by the FBI, CIA and NSA.  The revolving door between [Unit 8200](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200) and electronics manufacturing in Israel is even more prominent than the revolving door between the NSA and telecommunications in the United States.  More importantly, because Israeli surveillance technologies can be manufactured and developed extranationally to US treaty or law, capabilities that the US is prohibited from developing (but not deploying) can be manufactured by Israel and used by the United States.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but compared to every mature nation in the world, the United States entered the world theater a blind and blundering drunkard, incapable of listening or learning anything about our enemies or allies without relying on the British or the Israelis.  The cornerstone of US Foreign Policy, the [Kennan Long Telegram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan#The_.22long_telegram.22), basically says ""If we ignore them, they'll die off"" - a capitulation of intelligence and international understanding if ever there was one.  And unfortunately, since foreign policy in the United States is dictated by elected officials of limited term *but carried out by appointed officials of unlimited term,* those in control of the secrets tend to get what they want; what they want is what the Israelis sell us.

c0f7grm,politics,,True,19,"###A Brief History of Israel

There are a lot of misconceptions about Israel, where it is from, what it wants as a nation, and what its intentions are in this thread.  Much of this is due to the fact that Americans study almost no contemporary European History and essentially zero Middle Eastern History.  A few cogent points that the majority of Reddit may not be aware of:

1) The Birth of Israel can be traced directly to [The Dreyfus Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_Affair), in which anti-Semitism in Europe was seen as a driving and unavoidable fact of life for Jews.  Coinciding as it did with the drive towards nationalism, Jews ended up occupying a polar position to the drives of most politicians and nationalist groups, representing as they did an identity wholly divorced from national borders.  The treatment of Dryfus caused [Theodor Herzl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl), an agonistic Polish Jew, to hypothesize that the Jewish people would never be free or safe until they had their *own* homeland.  Thus was [Zionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) born.

Zionism, it is important to note, is wholly and completely separate from Judaism.  The Jews had been without a ""homeland"" since the [Diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora) 2,700 years ago.  At the time, Palestine was viewed as an ideal homeland for the Jews because a) historically, it covered areas the Israelites had occupied and b) with the decline and fall of the [Ottoman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire ""AKA The Sick Old Man of Europe""), there would be little opposition to the establishment of a nationalist state (there's that ""nationalism vs. tribalism"" thing again).

So the Zionists decided on Palestine more because it was weak than anything else; that, and they felt they had a historical claim to it.  They did *not* figure the Arabs would go quietly (""Why should the Arabs make peace? If I was an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country ... There has been anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that? They may perhaps forget in one or two generations' time, but for the moment there is no chance. So it is simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army"") but knew they had to go ([""We must expel Arabs and take their places""](http://www.monabaker.com/quotes.htm).  One of the basic arguments used was that since the Jews were united and the Arabs were not, the Arabs had no basic claim to the territory ([""There is no such thing as a Palestinian people... It is not as if we came and threw them out and took their country. They didn't exist.""](http://www.monabaker.com/quotes.htm).

It was actually in the midst of guerrilla warfare between the united Jews and the un-united Arabs that the United Nations stepped in: [Resolution 181](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) essentially gave all arable land and all developed communities to ""Israel"" and all the cliffs and deserts to ""Palestine.""  Arabs worldwide let out a cry and [war was on.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#First_phase:_14_May_1948_.E2.80.93_11_June_1948)

However, since the Israelis were united and fighting for their home (while the Arabs were a loose conglomeration and were fighting for their principles), Israel won handily.  

It's important to note, however, that no Western power backed either side.  

Israel solves a number of problems for other nations.  It gives Arab states someone to hate on even more than the British, the Russians, or the Americans (no small feat, considering the history of the Middle East).  It gives the West a promontory to peer into a difficult, intractable region from.  And, as I mentioned below, there are tertiary benefits of intelligence for the United States.

But Israel exists for Israel's sake.  It was created out of fear of Europe, with the recognized necessity of driving Arabs off their ancestral homeland.  It is a big, ugly, heinous mess, the repercussions of which we will be feeling for a thousand years or more.

But it is only an American problem because the Israelis have made it so.",t3_9zvsv,t3_9zvsv,False,1257103339,t5_2cneq,t1_c0f7grm,False,19,0,kleinbl00,0,0,,,1426086673

c0f7h1k,politics,,True,1,"What half of Europe does is to combine the purely-individual American/British/French election system with an individuals + party lists system.

Suppose you have 200 places. 

100 places you elect as usual normal - people vote, on a territorial basis, on people to represent their state, county, city, district or whatever is the territory. This tends to be two-party based, third parties rarely have much chance here, just like the current system in American, Britain or France. Nothing new here, this is your usual system.

100 other places you elect not by voting on a person, not by choosing Ms. Smith or Mr. Tailor, but choosing a party. Dems, Reps, Greens, Libertarians, you name it. Each party has an ordered list of candidates, Ms. Smith No. 1, Mr. Black No. 2 and so on. If a party gets say 6% of the votes the first 6 people on the list got a place. The advantage of it is that small parties have a chance. The disadvantage is that these people do not have loyalty to voters, only to their parties, because they have been elected indirectly, and brownnosing the bosses of their party in order to be higher on the list helps them more than caring about the voters. I mean in such a system if you have 6th place on a Dem or Rep list you are guaranteed to get in because their popularity cannot really go below 6%. It means such a person doesn't have to give a flying fuck about the voters, all he needs is to have the favour of the party bosses to put him on the 6th place on the list. This is of course bad - this is why it has to be combined with the first system, the American/British/French-style individual-votes system in order to balance it out.",t3_9zu9j,t3_9zu9j,False,1257103804,t5_2cneq,t1_c0f7h1k,True,1,0,[deleted],0,0,,,1426086675

This is my anonymous account I've used in the context on Reddit only. I've been in power exchange for half of my life. I'm gentle and polite in daily life and successful in my business life. The professional side and respect of my peers makes BDSM a private issue for me, as most of them would never properly understand it. I'm very ambitious and wouldn't sacrifice my professional goals for BDSM, although I try to fit them in where I can.

I've been involved with a number of submissives over the years both locally and over distance as I had the luxury to travel, ranging from unexpected encounters to long term master/slave arrangements.

The Church tried to stem this violence with the Peace and Truce of God movements, which was somewhat successful, but trained warriors always sought an outlet for their skills, and opportunities for territorial expansion were becoming less attractive for large segments of the nobility.

When most Tibetans live outside the Tibet autonomous region with millions of Chinese then I have a problem with one sided arguments advocating they get the whole of the land.  Inner Mongolia is mostly Chinese, but you wouldn't advocate it becoming a sovereign Mongolian state would you?

The system in Tibet before the PRC took over was literally feudalism and with the same level of development as middle ages European feudalism.  Before the Palestinians were colonized they were part of the Ottoman Empire and at worst would have become something similar to Syria which is so much better than pre PRC Tibet.

Tibetan autonomy would be great as would autonomy for other ethnic minorities in China, but unless you have real tangible ways of doing it without separatism why would you expect China to comply?

Prior to firing, each piece is dipped with a watery slip then most of the interiors are glazed by dipping with a variety of individually made glazes (usually a Shino glaze). Some pieces have the watery slip or glaze sprayed on the inside and/or outer surfaces. The exterior surfaces have a variety of metal oxides and terra sigillatas (no glazes) that produces a colour range in the hues of nature. The crispness in colours and varying surface textures are produced by the salt-firing. 

Late in the gas firing, I roll up ""burritoes"" made of salt and baking soda and wood shavings and put them in to the kiln by dropping them in to the kiln on a piece of angle iron. Once in the kiln, they volitize sending salt vapour moving with the gas flame among the pieces of pottery. The resulting outside surfaces vary from side to side due to the direction of the flame with the salt vapour interacting with the pieces as the flame weaves through the kiln.

Yes, I agree, that's why it's a little disingenuous to say ""the Chinese look down on the Hakka."" That would be like saying ""Europeans look down on the Germans.""

The fact is the the Hakka **are** Chinese just like the Germans are European. Now perhaps there are certain Chinese subgroups that have stereotypes about them but there has always been stereotypes among the various Han Chinese groups, e.g. the Shanghainese are good in business but greedy.

So to say that it parallels how black people are discriminated against is unfair and frankly makes light of the racism black people have faced.

&gt; Lee Tung Hui is indeed Hakka but that was AFTER the Democratiziation of Taiwan. Prior he and many others felt the discrimination, and frankly still do...

Prior to the democratization of Taiwan, there was a general discrimination between the wei sen ren (mainland China born) vs native Taiwanese born. And the native Taiwanese group composed of both Hakka and Hokien.

Also your Ma Ying Jeou link says ""Ma was born in the then-British Crown Colony of Kowloon, Hong Kong on July 13, 1950...He is of Hakka ancestry, originating from Hunan Province.""

And after doing some more research, it does seem like Sun Yat Sen is [Cantonese, not Hakka](http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/index.php?/topic/15792-was-sun-yat-sen-cantonese-or-hakka/).

Most take it before their college years, but some after.

Mine was spent riding trains in Europe (I am from US), drinking in bars, sleeping with women from around the world and spending a ton of time in Holland. 

You learn a lot by doing this. You can do 48 months of college standing on your head in the corner while jerking off. Let me tell you one thing - college is, should be, and will always be remembered as one of the best times of your life so get up off reddit and go enjoy it. 

I just got back from Hawaii - been there twice. Company paid me to go there with my family for two weeks as part of my package (I am in sales). Now that is really fun - and free. 

Why don't you finish what you started and then go to Hawaii for 2-20 years? Really enjoy yourself. If you finish college you can live in Hawaii making 150-250K a year at some cush job. If you just walk away you will be the guy/gal at the car rental desk. Don't get me wrong - nothing wrong with that. Money won't make you happy let me tell you. It does however make things a hell of a lot easier and there is one thing you are going to need in Hawaii - MONEY and a ton of it. It is 4-10 times more expensive than the midwest by far. 

The sad thing is that right now you say all of the things that a college education will give you you don't care about (money, job, etc.). 

Whatever happened to going to college to get an education? To be educated and be able to carry on a conversation or appreciate art and literature? To experience new things? To broaden the mind? 

That is what you should be thinking about when at college - the money comes with passion - not a piece of paper. All the best - but I know you and your kind and if you leave now you will be back to finish and it will be a huge pain in the ass to finish later.

[The EU] The latter being quite different than the former due to the EU requiring member states to actively give up sovereignity (somewhat similar to WTO)

Since the UK is part of the EU, most of the attention has been on European law, but the fact that the UK is part of the EU doesn't have direct bearing on a lot of these laws. The European Convention on Human Rights is actually not an EU law, for instance. Most of the case law dealing with the ECHR and related conventions is focused on treaty obligations. [Googling turned up this interesting book](http://books.google.com/books?id=l6Gxhu926UEC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=human+rights+treaty+obligations+%22house+of+lords%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_hIlAqirDJ&amp;sig=8RPHotVSYxW7xOyG_3gMxvxgA_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tUzuStfaAcXajQfIvJSaDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20rights%20treaty%20obligations%20%22house%20of%20lords%22&amp;f=false) detailing different judges' opinions on how to read the UK's treaty obligations in line with its laws.

&gt;My overall point is that for most international agreements there exist little to no enfocement mechanisms. (look at Kyoto Protocol for example...) The UNCRC is similar, sure it may make some states change laws, but for the most part signatory states are free to ignore it (Iran for example routinely knocks off children)

I agree completely, I was originally just nitpicking about the sovereignty point. :p My point right now is that whether the law in question is an international or domestic one doesn't really matter in cases like Iran -- the government will disregard the law if it wants to disregard it, whether it is domestic or international.",t3_9zy5p,t1_c0f7z3c,False,1257131586,t5_2qh3b,t1_c0f7zxk,False,2,0,johnleemk,0,0,,,1426086939

&gt; The Palestine Liberation Organization has enjoyed status as a non-member observer at the United Nations since 1974, and continues to represent ""Palestine"" there.[169] After the 1988 declaration of state, the State of Palestine was formally recognized by 117 United Nations member states.[170] Many countries, including the EU and the United States, have diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority, and have recognized the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza as a ""Country"" for legal, economic, and political purposes.[171][172] Dozens of other States have gone one step further and legally recognized that same national entity as the ""State of Palestine"".[172][173] There have also been published reports of Israelis who have accepted Palestinian citizenship and passports.[174] Palestine is also represented at international sporting events, like the Olympics and Paralympics and films from Palestine have won awards at international cinema events, like the Oscars. (See also Cinema of Palestine).[175][176]

c0f8659,politics,,True,1,"You simply have a more complex set of stereotypes than I can comprehend or care about.

The fact of the matter is that we have two parties that paint themselves as left and right, which only makes sense within the U.S.  From a European perspective, we have a party leaning to the right (the Democrats) and a party a bit further to the right (the Republicans) which are made up of a host of groups that are more scattered across the Left/Right spectrum, plus whatever vector one might consider for Ron Paul (which arguably isn't left or right).

In my view, the more critical issues we need to address in this country have to do with 

1) a reduction in what we spend on defense.  We currently are following the Soviets, and are on a path to bankrupting ourselves.  Tied to that is 

2) a need to unleash real competition through Intellectual Property reform and Trust Busting.  If we continue to allow the established companies to make the rules (I put a stand against Net Neutrality in this camp), we are in trouble.

In contrast, laws governing drugs, abortion, prayer in school, evolution vs Intelligent design, homosexual marriage, and the host of other ""social conservatism"" issues don't make much difference.  Don't get me wrong, they may absolutely make a huge difference to various individuals, and yeah they impact our budgets, but they are not going to destroy this country.  Not like spending ourselves broke on Defense we don't need, or protecting established businesses and outdated business models that are unproductive.

Besides, as I said before, the class of problems in the first category do not have a significant overlap with the class of problems in the second category.  No preacher is out there preaching that God will judge us if we don't put more money into defense, or protect Disney's copyrights, or Texas Instrument's patent portfolio. 

Seriously, CEOs for the most part are not putting money into the Republican Party to fight a woman's right to choose, regardless of the advertising to the dirty masses of the Republican Party.  Nope, the CEO's are voting for more money, more control, more contracts, more pork, less competition.

Just to be really clear, If you got your way totally on every social conservatism issue (non-defense related) ever promoted by some Social Conservative by giving Big Defense and Big Business everything they want, everyone would be happy.  You would be happy cause you got your way on every Social issue (drugs, abortion, gay rights, whatever it is you care about), Big Defense and Big Business would be happy (cause they'd continue to rake it in), and the Social Conservatives would be happy (they could stand up in their churches and happily claim God destroyed this country).

Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.


 

The charges specifically allege that the group have

 

- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


 

The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.


 

The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO.

What is it about ""god"" that you feel you need, anyway?

The whole ""nobody understands me and nobody could possibly understand me"" attitude is pure mind-poison. It isolates you and causes you to trivialise both your interaction with other people and the people themselves. Some interactions *are* trivial, I'll grant you, but not all of them, probably not even most of them.

The whole ""whirlwind"" thing is generally a kind of manufactured refusal to deal with things. In today's middle-class college environments, there's generally so little real stress that peoples' minds concoct this kind of invented adversity to be overcome, but cannot then deal with looking at it too closely because it *is* invented.

It's all very well me saying these things to you, but my simply saying it doesn't actually help you. Most of what you'll get at a counselling session is simply the means to come to these realisations on your own; it's actually not an awful lot of help to simply tell people what's actually bothering them; if they knew enough to appreciate the nuances of what's bothering them, it wouldn't be bothering them in the first place.

So, yeah, go talk to the trained professionals and try to sort yourself out with some answers.

After a couple of sessions, go pick yourself up a copy of David D. Burns' ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"". Please don't take this recommendation as a plug for the book; I've had the book independently recommended to me by a doctor and two counsellors, and each of them had copies of the book in their offices, and the counsellors each worked in a way very similar to that described in the book.

However:

* Don't take my word for it, ask whoever you're seeing whether they'd recommend it. If not, ignore me; If they're not working from those methods, all you'd be doing by reading the book would be muddying the waters.
* Don't just assume that reading a book is going to help, either. Talking stuff out in sessions is one of the best ways of coming to terms with whatever it is that you're needing to come to terms with.

Lastly: Dude, school *is* trivially easy. An awful lot of stuff is; even complex stuff. Apart from a select few professions which require complexity, speed and attention to detail (so, surgery, for example), there's really not an awful lot in the world that will challenge *anyone* with a half-decent brain. In American universities particularly, where they take four years to teach what European universities teach in three, the boredom must be nearly unbearable.

You save seriously. 20% of your income, chuck into your travel fund, money that you cannot ever touch until you leave the country.

Second, you pick somewhere to travel. Flights to Asia are expensive, but for you being based in the states, Latin and South America are close and should be cheap. I'm not sure on restrictions on US citizens regarding Cuba, but if possible, there's another place that should be amazing.

So you've booked your flight, in SE. Asia, hostels/guesthouses are cheap, think $2-5 per night. In Europe, it's expensive, which is why a lot of people either go with a tent, or [couchsurf](http://couchsurfing.org). It's not weird, it's an amazing way to make new friends in different countries and I HIGHLY recommend you try it. In fact, you can join the group for your state/city and go to some of the meetups to see just how cool it is.

I don't rent cars, I stay in cheap hostels or guesthouses, I hitchhike and take shared transport. I picked countries that are cheap to travel in. I even picked a place for cheap airfare. I was going to go to South America, but a flight to Vietnam was $200 one way so I went there instead.

12k USD over one year is $30 per day, I challenge you to go to Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, China) and see how you can easily live on $10-20 and have money left over. If the average salary in those countries is close to $30 per month, it means it must be possible to live there for that amount.

In history the strongest, most vicious psychopaths become the police, maintaining ""law and order."" ""Be reasonable. Do it my way.""

Where do you think the European aristocracy comes from?

That is why we have a Second Amendment. Security in a self-reliant America is a ""do it yourself"" affair.

What I see is the potential for individual police, military, National Guard, and mercenary units (such as Blackwater and its alumni) turning rogue. The incentives are there. Budgets first become constrained, then cut, then, as in Detroit, essentially non-existent. The courts too are under financial constraint. The ability is there. Washington, in its ineptitude, has militarized local police.

I do not see Washington being able to maintain control. The line of command will snap, and local units will be left to forage, rape and pillage for themselves in a 21st Century return to the Dark Ages in the first several hundred years after the fall of Rome. You will not know who calls the shots, and probably the local rogue won't know either.

Charlemagne (742-814) was simply the strongest rogue of his day.

THIS SCENARIO NEED NOT PLAY OUT.

First, stay out of the way.

Second, remember the Second Amendment and history. We are many. They are few.

Third, remember that non-violence, and relating on a human level with others is more powerful than any weapons, though doing so is something all of us need to learn. Those with weapons live in fear. Have no fear.

c0f8leh,AskReddit,,True,5,"Caesar was actually the name of his family within his tribe, Julius being the genitive of his tribe (it seems likely that individuals maintaining the tribal name was an Etruscan tradition).

Since only a very limited set of first names were used by the Romans, and the tribes grew very large, an additional nickname began to be used to distinguish individuals and this eventually became the name of the family.

Caesar became a title only later honoring his achievements. Incidentally, the third (family) name was adopted by the plebeians much later than the nobility which might suggest its importance in inheritance.

My guess would be that the latter use of family names in feudal Europe was taken from Roman tradition for practical reasons (so again we see it in the nobility first). The new nations settling the area as Rome declined no doubt had proud traditions of their own and it took time for these to be supplanted.

Sort of a has-been rock-star status where the oligarchs weren't so blatantly corrupt. For example, unemployment hovered around 2% during the Soviet Union; now its between 30 and 40%.

c0f8rb2,worldnews,,True,9,"Originally the term ""Holocaust"" included other races and people murdered en masse by the Nazis.
Somehow it has been co-opted by the Jews to ONLY include them.
That is both sad and sickening.
It is also interesting that those who question the official figures are lumped in with the deniers.
Would 3 million Jews dead be less valid?
But if put in context 3 million dead Jews will not equal the 7 million + dead from the Ukrainian Holocaust. Or the estimated 10 million killed during WW2.

Ukraine's Population Losses in World War II: 7.5 million or 13,614,000?

Ukraine lost more people in World War II than any other European country. At the beginning of the war Ukraine's population was 41.9 million. Let us review some of the estimates of losses from largest to smallest. According to A Short History of Ukraine published by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev in 1986, as a result of the Second World War: ""The population [of Ukraine] contracted by 13,614,000."" (p. 239). This statistic is not explained.

In 1977 Stephan G. Prociuk estimated in a detailed analysis that Ukraine's World War II loss of population was 11 million. (Annals of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences in the U.S., New York 1977, vol. 13 no. 35-36, p. 23-50.

The American journalist Edgar Snow, who visited Ukraine in 1943 during the war and at the end of the war in 1945, reported in his book The Pattern of Soviet Power (New York 1945) that according to a high Ukrainian official ""No fewer than 10,000,000 people had been lost to ... Ukraine since 1941."" This statistic excluded ""men and women mobilized in the armed forces."" (p. 73).

    Ukraine Lost 10,000,000 People

    ""Yet it was not till I went on a sobering journey into this twilight of war that I fully realized the price which 40,000,000 Ukrainians paid for Soviet--and Allied--victory. The whole titanic struggle, which some are apt to dismiss as ""the Russian glory,"" was first of all a Ukrainian war. No fewer than 10,000,000 people had been 'lost' to... Ukraine since 1941, I was told by a high Ukrainian official. That excluded men and women mobilized for the armed forces.

    A relatively small part of the Russian Soviet Republic itself was actually invaded, but the whole Ukraine, whose people were economically the most advanced and numerically the second largest in the Soviet Union, was devastated from the Carpathian frontier to the Donets and Don rivers, where Russia proper begins. No single European country suffered deeper wounds to its cities, its industry, its farmland and its humanity.""

    Edgar Snow
    The Pattern of Soviet Power
    New York: Random House, 1945. p. 73. 

""At the end of the war, Ukraine lay in ruins: the population had declined by 25 per cent -- that is by approximately 10.5 million people; 6.8 million had been killed or died of hunger or disease, and the remainder had been evacuated or deported to Soviet Asia as political prisoners or had ended up as slave laborers or emigres in Hitler's Germany..."" states Ann Lencyk Pawliczko in Ukraine and Ukrainians Throughout the World (University of Toronto Press, 1994, p. 62). Prof. Kubijovych, a geographer, says ""the population of the Reichskommisariat Ukraine fell from 24,100,000 in 1939 to 16,900,000 -- a drop of 30 percent. The population of the larger cities dropped by 53 percent. ... We may assume that in 1943 the population of the Ukrainian SSR in the current boundaries was about 30 million, ythat is, 10.5 million less than in 1939."" (Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia, University of Toronto Press, 1963, vol. 1, p. 204.) V. Trembitsky gives a total of war losses to Ukraine in 1941-45 of 8,545,000. (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 24 serpnia, 1994 p. 3). Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Shcherbitsky in 1974 gave a statistic of 6,750,000 as Ukraine's World War II losses. (Radyanska Ukraina, 18 October, 1974). 

Now someone tell me where the fuck are all the Ukrainian Holocaust movies?

I think the thing with bubbles being defined the way they are is that by default they are to be viewed as a deviation from the norm, that the absence of bubbles is to be considered a normative period, not the times before or after one.

I am of the mind that, at least amongst Americans, that consumer based credit culture isn't inherently good or bad, but neutral since is has as much ability to swing towards positive gains as much as it is able to swing to negative drawbacks and pains.

Agreed. That's part of the risk, and it still seems the will in America is that the net positives still outweigh the net negatives. I deem a national movement to destroy personal credit cards would be a clear and easy signal that the view has changed though.

* I often slept in fields near the small towns along the highway. Sometimes by a church, sometimes near or in the gardens of the locals. Probably should figure out where best to sleep to avoid nasty critters, or nasty people, but common sense goes a long way. 
* Get a green sleeping back. That way you won't be up all night afraid that the drunk people that apparently make heavy use of the 'hidden dirt road' will see your pink sleeping bag...
* Other times we slept near the side of dirt roads that led away from bigger roads. Not very comfortable, especially if, like me, you forget any kind of mat, but less bugs. Be careful though; we were once almost run over by a car because in the dark we thought we were in a field *next* to a dirt road, but we were actually sleeping on a sort of parking area.
* Look for empty buildings in small towns. There's usually at least one construction site where you can go inside (doors open, or climbing) without being noticed. It's warmer, safer, but usually dusty as hell. Also be aware that construction workers might show up early, although they probably won't care and might even help you.
* Locals will often tell how dangerous the area is (at least, that was my experience in the Balkan region). Locals usually think the area is more dangerous than it really is, especially in rural areas. Take their more general, vague advice with a grain of salt, or ask for more specific information. They might know about particular roads that are dangerous, or particular towns, but their 'general' advice is usually wrong (again, just my experience).
* Just *ask* people if they know a place where you could stay. We spent three awesome days with some students in Montenegro. We met them at the train station while they were working, and because their parents were away we could stay with them!
* Always be on the lookout during the day for spots to sleep. You can return at night. You can practice yourself to see the places where nobody will find you.
* I've found that even if you stay on someone's private property, they will usually be very nice if you don't appear hostile, or make sure that they won't find you by stumbling over you. You might be better off on private property than on public property, where the police might get you, or mean people.
* In many places you can get leftover food from markets at the end of the day. In Eastern Europe you can buy food in shops for very little. Ask around for cheap places, or markets.
* If it's night: just go to a bar and ask if anyone knows a place to stay. It's astonishing how often you get lucky and some drunk person offers to host you (not recommended for women or those who are uncomfortable with weird people).",t3_9zx4c,t1_c0f7mhl,False,1257186845,t5_2qzb6,t1_c0f8ubn,False,2,0,mercerist,0,0,,,1426087334

""Be sensible""

""do some research of your own and refute what I have said.""

Ok,

""Hilberg's estimate of 5.1 million, in the third edition of The Destruction of the European Jews, includes over 800,000 who died from ""ghettoization and general privation""; 1,400,000 killed in open-air shootings; and up to 2,900,000 who perished in camps. Hilberg estimates the death toll of Jews in Poland as up to 3,000,000.[188] Hilberg's numbers are generally considered to be a conservative estimate, as they typically include only those deaths for which records are available, avoiding statistical adjustment.[189]""

The number of people killed at the major extermination camps is estimated as: Auschwitz-Birkenau: 1.4 million;[106] Treblinka: 870,000;[121] Belzec: 600,000;[109] Majdanek: 360,000;[115] Chelmno: 320,000;[111] Sobibór: 250,000.[119] This gives a total of over 3.8 million; of these, 80–90% were estimated to be Jews. These seven camps thus accounted for half the total number of Jews killed in the entire Nazi Holocaust. Virtually the entire Jewish population of Poland died in these camps.[174]""

Israel has nuclear power, a powerful army, support of U.S. and European countries, while Palestinians don’t have any leverage on Israel. Those suicide bombing have been well contained and are ineffective. The rocket attacks damages Palestinians more than it harms Israel, because Israel uses that as an excuse to do whatever it wants to Palestinians under the name of “self defense”. What I am saying is that even though the fair thing would be for Israel to withdraw to the 1967 border, the reality is, that is never going to happen because nobody is going to force Israel to do so. Palestinians need to get to the negotiating table fast and without any preconditions (e.g. a freeze to all settlements). Fatah keeps saying that we won’t negotiate until you freeze all the settlements.  Israel: “You won’t negotiate if we don’t freeze our settlements? That’s fine with us. We will take more of “our”  land in the meantime.” 
Palestinians need to swallow their pride,  and take the best deal they can get today. They need to realize that even getting a final border that include 75%-50% 1967 Palestine as a victory considering how powerful Israel is. The more time they waste by “resisting”, the worse that “best deal” becomes.

Mad bomber honored
By Michael J. Smith on Sunday November 1 02:45 PM
The triumphant secessionists of Kosovo have rewarded, pro virili, their imperial patron by erecting a remarkably ugly eleven-foot statue of Bill Clinton, spray-painted gold. The cheesy spray paint is nice and appropriate, I think -- just the thing for Bill Clinton.

The effigy follows the normal eastern European iconographical convention -- ""Great Leader Hails Taxicab. Hail Great Leader!"" One somewhat original touch is that Great Leader's non-hailing hand is holding a binder or folder or something inscribed with the date that he started the bombs falling. The Albanian chauvinists of Kosovo have little talent for hypocrisy, it seems. Another people might have chosen not to emphasize the fact that they were celebrating a campaign of slaughter.

Ole Bill is very popular there, along with Tony Blair and Madeleine ""We'll kill any number of children and enjoy it"" Albright. People in Kosovo apparently name their kids after this trio of bloodthirsty fiends. 
By chance I recently passed by the Jefferson Davis monument in New Orleans, commemorating another Southern friend to imperially-sponsored secessionism and pride of race.

It's a more accomplished piece of work than Clinton's clunky memorial. Ole Jeff has a lifted arm too but his gesture is graceful and oddly airy. His expression is solemn and elevated, very much in the usual pompous style of American civic art, but at least he doesn't have that look of slitty-eyed low cunning and false bonhomie that Clinton's does.

That look, on spray-paint Clinton's face, is another touch, probably unintended, of veracity. The earnest but unskilled -- and, I fear, untalented -- Kosovar sculptor didn't quite know how to read an Arkansas con artist's facial expression, so he just... rendered it.

Camp Bondsteel

The United States agreed to provide a force of approximately 7,000 US personnel as part of the NATO KFOR to help maintain a capable military force in Kosovo and to ensure the safe return of Kosovar refugees. The US supports KFOR by providing the headquarters and troops for one of the four NATO sectors. The US also provides personnel, units and equipment to other components of the KFOR organization.

Camp Bondsteel [CBS] is quite large: 955 acres or 360,000 square meters. If you were to run the outer perimeter, it is about 7 miles. Bondsteel is located on rolling hills and farmland near the city of Ferizaj/Urosevac. There are two dining facilities at Camp Bondsteel: one in North town and one in South town. The food is very well prepared and there are always a variety of main and side dishes to choose from. There are also salad bars, potato bars and multiple dessert offerings. Due to General Order #1, only alcohol-free beer is served, but it is better than nothing! There are set hours for meals, but each dining facility also has a 24-hour section for sandwiches, coffee, fruit, and continental breakfast items.

Soldiers live in SEA (Southeast Asia) Huts. There are about 250 SEA Huts for living quarters and offices. The buildings have five living areas that house up to six soldiers each. Each building has one large bathroom with multiple shower and bathroom stalls. A few buildings have smaller bathroom facilities as well. Female and male sea huts are separate. The beds are comfortable and each room has its own heating/air conditioning unit. Soldiers get their own wall-locker for personal storage, and most opt to purchase a small set of plastic bins for additional storage. You can buy almost anything from the PX to make your living space more comfortable, such as TVs, DVD players, coffee makers and sound systems. Rooms are routinely inspected to make sure they adhere to fire and safety codes. The best way to improve the safety of your room is to purchase an approved surge protector for European voltage, and plug all of your lights and equipment into that. Adaptors are also available so you can plug your 220-compatible devices, like laptops, into the European outlets.

The Bondsteel PX offers soldiers the latest CDs, DVDs, electronics, souvenirs, clothing, uniforms and everything to make your stay in Kosovo comfortable. With two stories of merchandise, the PX draws lots of multinational soldiers from throughout Kosovo. Also located at CBS are Burger King, Anthony’s Pizza and a Cappuccino bar.

There are Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) buildings in North town and South town. The facilities offer billiards, ping-pong, video games, interenet access and a video teleconference room. They also offer movies to check out and watch on several TVs in the MWR facilities. There are a total of three gyms at CBS. Two gyms (north and south) have basketball/volleyball courts, exercise equipment, weight machines and free weights. The third gym is strictly a weight room.

There are two chapels on Bondsteel, North and South, and one on Camp Monteith. All Chapels offer services in several denominations. The Laura Bush education center offers a variety of college courses to suit your needs. Want to learn Albanian, Serbian, or German? Improve your computer skills? The variety of college credit and certificate courses is staggering. There are two colleges represented at US base camps: the University of Maryland and Chicago University.

The US sector is in southeast Kosovo. Headquarters for US forces is located at Camp Bondsteel, built on 750 acres of former farmland near Urosevic. Bondsteel has about a 6-mile perimeter. The 1,000-acre camp was built from the ground up on a former field. Basecamps Bondsteel and Monteith were established in June 1999 in Kosovo to be used as staging points for the bulk of US forces stationed in the Multi National Brigade-East. About 4,000 US service members were stationed at Camp Bondsteel in the farm fields near Urosevac, and another 2,000 were at Camp Montieth, near Gnjilane. Both camps are named after medal of honor recipients, Army Staff Sgt. James L. Bondsteel, honored for heroism in Vietnam, and Army 1st Lt. Jimmie W. Montieth Jr, honored for heroism in France during World War II. Camp Able Sentry, located near the Skopje Airport, Macedonia, serves as a point of entry for supplies and personnel into Kosovo. Another 500 Americans support the operation from Camp Able Sentry in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The US contingent is known as Task Force Falcon. There are a number of locations within Kosovo, other than the base camps, at which US soldiers maintain a presence.

US forces entered Kosovo in June 1999 following NATO Operation Allied Force. Since then, military officials worked to rapidly improve service members' quality of life. At the outset, planners wanted to use the lessons learned in Bosnia and convinced decision makers to reach base-camp “end state” as quickly as possible. Because of uncertainty about the Bosnian mission’s duration, when the Army moved across the Sava River into Bosnia in 1995, soldiers were housed first in tents – in the winter! Only years later were they moved to semipermanent Southeast Asia (SEA) huts (a theater-of-operations design that first made its debut in Vietnam) on base camps. Engineer planners knew it was much more cost effective to forego this gradual approach in Kosovo in favor of building end-state SEA huts right away, and operational commanders agreed with this approach.

In contrast to the Bosnia peacekeeping mission where troops lived in tents for many months before moving into hardened structures, DoD decided to erect the SEAhuts from the start. The single-story SEAhut wooden structures were first used in Southeast Asia and then in Bosnia. The military redesigned the SEAhuts specifically for Kosovo. Each wooden structure has a male and a female latrine and six rooms housing six service members each. The huts have heat, hot water, air conditioning, plumbing, electricity and telephones.

With rising number of transaction also increasing number of frauds.  
Frauders has various methods how to cheat and sometimes they are so perfect that you are not able to recognize when you are becoming a victim of scam.

The first and most important rule is - Never pay for goods at advance via payment methods where you don’t know real name and details of seller. That is especially Western Union, Money Gram and similar services. 
Every week I can hear about cases when the buyer has never seen the goods for the money he payed. There is not only problem with sellers from Asian or developing countries. Many cases of fraud also coming from EU and U.S.

B2B marketplaces are a great places to trade however the lack of security of transaction is needed.  
DoTradeEasy.com B2B and B2C marketplace offers a secure payment system for worldwide buyers and sellers. They send your money to the seller only when the delivered goods are satisfactory. This the great system for smaller orders.

For larger transaction is the best to use letter of credit and FOB. For larger orders you mostly deal with Limited Companies so check their details and feedback before send the money. 

DoTradeEasy.com serves wholesalers, suppliers and manufacturers from any country. Even if you are end user, retailer or sole traded you can use this marketplace to sell or buy products online securely. This is also business directory of worldwide suppliers.

I was doing the usual rounds of the stadium as part of my job, when I saw a really nice looking family, mom/dad/2 girls, walking outside the gates. It was pretty obvious that they couldn't afford to come in (tickets were like 40 Euros at best), and had made the trek to the venue just to hear what they could from the outside. They stopped for a minute. The look on the older daughter's face was so sweet and sad. It said everything about how badly she wanted to be inside. I know that expression because I'd worn it so many times in the same situation when I was around 9 years old. 

I tried to talk to the dad to give him some passes for the family but he wouldn't speak with me... probably thought I was selling something. I had to keep moving, so I handed them to the mom and explained where they'd go to get in. Checked in with the security guards at the entrance gates and crossed my fingers that they would remember this family. I saw them go in from a distance, and I hope they had a good time.

&gt;Everyone thinks this is the Irish Feis Samhain, which began at sunset on 31 Oct and that the Church co-opted the date.  However, Pope Gregory III (d. 741) moved the  feast ""in honor of all the saints in heaven"" from 13 May to 1 Nov to correspond to the dedication day of All Saints Chapel in St. Peter’s at Rome.  There was no connection.  Later, in the 840s, Pope Gregory IV declared All Saints to be a universal feast, that is, not restricted to St. Peter's.  The holy day spread to Ireland. The day a feast is the ""vigil mass"" and so after sunset on 31 Oct became ""All Hallows Even"" or ""Hallowe’en.""  It had no more significance than the ""Vigil of St. Lawrence"" or the ""Vigil of John the Baptist"" or any of the other vigils on the calendar. 

&gt;In 998, St. Odilo, the abbot of the powerful monastery of Cluny in Southern France, added a celebration on Nov. 2. This was a day of prayer for ""the souls of all the faithful departed."" This feast, called All Souls Day, spread from France to the rest of Europe. 

&gt;That took care of Heaven and Purgatory.  The Irish, being the Irish, thought it unfair to leave the souls in Hell out.  So on Hallowe'en they would bang pots and pans to let the souls in Hell know they were not forgotten.  However, the Feast of All Damned never caught on, for fairly obvious theological reasons.  The Irish, however, had another day for partying.

&gt;After the Black Death, All Souls Day became more important, and a popular motif was the Danse Macabre (Dance of Death).   It usually showed the devil ""leading a daisy chain of people — popes, kings, ladies, knights, monks, peasants, lepers, etc. — into the tomb.""  Sometimes the dance was presented on All Souls’ Day itself as a living tableau with people dressed up in the garb of various walks of life.

&gt;""But the French dressed up on All Souls, not Hallowe'en; and the Irish, who had Hallowe'en, did not dress up.""  During the 1700s the Irish and French Catholics began to bump into one another in British North America and the two traditions mingled.  ""The Irish focus on hell gave the French masquerades and even more macabre twist.""

There are a lot of logical leaps of faith in this article. I think one at least should mention that Norwegians have 25 days of statutory minimum employment leave and the very basic fact that it's crazy to compare private consumption between countries without adjusting for what is paid for by some through taxes (e.g. health care).

I would also like to add that the whole aspect of distribution of wealth is absent from the article. In my opinion GDP is not a good measure of how rich the average citizen is, let alone the poorest in society. The Gini factor tells something about the disparity between the poor and the rich - here Denmark is number one, Sweden number three and Norway number five. The US has a higher Gini-coefficient than any European country. Now, consider GDP per capita adjusted for puchasing power parity where Norway is number three, the US number six and Sweden and Denmark are 15 and 16. Put these two metrics together and I think we have an idea of which country has the richest average citizens.

Barbary corsairs

The Barbary Corsairs, sometimes called Ottoman Corsairs or Barbary Pirates, were Muslim pirates and privateers who operated from North Africa from the time of the Crusades (11th century) until the early 19th century. Based in North African ports such as Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers, Salé, and other ports in Morocco, they sailed mainly along the stretch of northern Africa known as the Barbary Coast.[1] Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa's Atlantic seaboard, and into the North Atlantic as far north as Iceland, and they primarily commandeered western European ships in the western Mediterranean Sea. In addition, they engaged in Razzias, raids on European coastal towns, to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in places such as Algeria and Morocco.[2][3]

Pirates destroyed thousands of French, Spanish, and English ships, and long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants, discouraging settlement until the 19th century. From the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured an estimated 800,000 to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves,[2] mainly from seaside villages in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, but also from France, England, the Netherlands, Ireland and as far away as Iceland and North America. The most famous corsairs were the brothers Hayreddin Barbarossa (""Redbeard"") and Oruç Reis, who took control of Algiers in the early 16th century, beginning four hundred years of Ottoman Empire presence in North Africa and establishing a centre of Mediterranean piracy.",t3_a01wy,t1_c0f91r2,False,1257199943,t5_2qh13,t1_c0f974z,False,3,0,DrDm,0,0,,,1426087500

I would never claim that being a landlord ought to be illegal, because really there's no viable alternative short of some thoroughly unlikely and completely unworkable Marxist nonsense.... but still I will maintain that becoming a landlord turns you into an asshole. It's generally a dirty, dishonorable living. My grandmother told me once that in the town she lived in in Austria, there was plenty of rental property, but it was all owned by wealthy semi-nobility. These upper crust folks charged for rent only what it cost to operate and maintain the properties, considering it crass to actually *profit* from it.

Hell, it's probably unheard of in Europe too, nowadays, being as it would only really come from people who had owned the properties outright for quite a while.

GPS manufacturers used to charge around $100 per year to get updated maps and POIs.  Now Garmin charges about $70 for one offs or $120 for unlimited quarterly updates for the lifetime of the device.

Traffic information has to get into the device somehow and is usually done over FM radio (radio stations broadcast it as data).  The MSN data radio service also included flight status, gas prices, stocks, cinema etc.  Data used to cost $60 per year but is now $60 for device lifetime. (MSN cost more but the service is being closed 1 Jan 2012).  Garmin now has the traffic data for ""free"" which is done by showing you ads.  The new [Garmin 1690](http://www.gpsmagazine.com/2009/10/garmin_nuvi_1690_review.php) downloads over the AT&amp;T cellular network and costs $5 per month for that.  In all cases the device would come with some amount of up-front service included in the sale price.  Typically this was 3 months for FM radio, 12 months for MSN and is 24 months for the 1690.  TomTom used to do data via BlueTooth connection on your phone and I believe still do so in Europe.  They then charge ~$10 per month for the data.

The GPS devices work well as a scrolling map, but get expensive if you want to keep the map and points of interest up to date.  It costs yet more to get traffic information which isn't even that good.  For example they typically cover major highways but not major side roads so you still don't know if departing the highway and taking side roads will work.

Garmin especially has also been very guilty of removing functionality from devices and then only having it again on more expensive new devices.  They have yet to introduce detours where you can set the length of detour - without it they just take you off the next ramp and back on again as soon as possible which is pointless.  Look at the various Garmin reviews and there will always be user comments to this effect.

Ultimately the GPS and map companies did this to themselves.  They had a nice high margin business and did their level best to keep it that way.  They did slowly make things cheaper but at nowhere near the normal rate for consumer electronics.  Garmin does have the [Nuviphone](http://www8.garmin.com/nuvifone/) but it is too little too late and took a really long time from announcement to being available for purchase.

RE: FIGHTING:  and why did the Arabs start fighting?  Because they were thrown off their land that's why.

 RE: Ownership: Turkey ceded Palestine to the British.  

The Balfour Declaration’s commitment to a Jewish national home in the British mandate of Palestine soon came back to haunt Britain and the Arabs. Arabs were outraged by the implication that they were the intruders in Palestine, when in fact at the end of World War II they accounted for about 90% of the population.

While Jewish immigration to Palestine in the 1920’s caused little alarm, the situation escalated markedly with the rise of Nazi persecution in Europe. Large numbers of European Jews flocked to Palestine, inflaming nationalist passions among all Arabs, who feared the creation of a Jewish state in which they would be the losers. Palestinian resistance erupted into a full-scale revolt which lasted from 1936-39. This revolt, which in some respects resembled the intifada of the late 1980s, was the first major outbreak of Palestinian-Zionist hostilities.

Although the strict terms imposed on Transjordan since 1921 prevented Emir Abdullah from establishing official contacts with Palestinian Arabs under the British mandate, he nonetheless gave refuge to Palestinian leaders and political activists. He constantly warned the British against earmarking Arab lands for a Jewish national home and allowing increased Jewish immigration to Palestine. He also intervened at various levels on behalf of the Palestinians, while warning of impending disaster should a diplomatic solution to the problem not be found. His predictions fell on deaf ears, but came true nonetheless.

As the Jewish population in Palestine increased sharply during the 1930s, fighting between Jews and Arabs increased also. Both sides blamed the British, who failed miserably in their attempts to reach a settlement acceptable to all. The conflict was muted by the onset of World War II, during which both sides cooperated with the British. Transjordan’s Arab Legion also joined the side of the Allies, helping the British and the Free French drive the Vichy forces from Syria.

The crisis of Palestine reached a boiling point in the years immediately after the war. With international sympathy firmly behind the Jews in the wake of the Holocaust, Zionist leaders pressured the British to admit thousands of displaced Jews. At the same time, underground Jewish groups such as the Irgun and the renegade Stern Gang initiated a campaign of terrorism against the British. Washing its hands of the whole imbroglio, Britain declared in February 1947 that its mandate over Palestine would end on May 14, 1948. The matter was then addressed by the United Nations, which, after rejecting various plans, voted for the partition of Palestine in November 1947. The plan called for the partition of Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state, with al-Quds (Jerusalem) to be placed under UN trusteeship. More than half the territory, including the valuable coastal strip, had been allotted to the Jews, who only owned about 6% of the land. The Arabs were shocked, and conflict was inevitable.

On May 14, 1948, the British terminated their mandate over Palestine, and the Jews immediately proclaimed the independence of the state of Israel. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize Israel, followed promptly by the United States. The tragedy of Palestine was born.

Much of the valuable purchased by Jews from Arabs?  When...unbiased source please.

c0f9iq3,AskReddit,,True,2,"Why Americans don't eat horse meat: Americans don't consider horses ""food"" just like dogs and cats. In other countries they do eat horses; some countries also eat dogs and cats. 

More importantly, the slaughter process using the captive bolt - which was designed for the much more docile cattle - is extremely cruel when used on horses. Unlike cattle horses throw their heads in the air when a perceived threat approaches from the front. This makes it almost impossible for the operator to get a clean shot - so many times the horses is shot with the bolt over and over again, causing great pain and terror. Another reason many horses are not properly stunned is that their brain is not in the same position relative to the face as is a cow's. So, many horses regain consciousness while strung up on the meat hook, prior to being bled out. Are you sick yet?

If you're not sick yet, you will be if you eat horse meat. American horses are not raised to be food animals, so they are routinely medicated, sprayed and daubed with substances that are banned for use on food animals. They state plainly on the labels: Not for use on horses intended for human consumption. These are VERY common products used on virtually EVERY horse at one time or another.

Since horses are not classified as food animals in the US, there is NO FDA oversight, NO inspections, NO nothing.

The European Union has recently set extremely strict new rules for horses imported from the US. These rules will permanently exclude most American horses from export to the EU.

In fact by your analogy Palestinians have the right to take any land not individually settled in Israel and make a country, but that will never happen because you and everyone else who believes this bullshit are giant hypocrites and liars.  

The Palestinians were colonized by the Ottomans and were promised independence by the British if they fought the Ottomans and then promptly imperialized by the British.  They never gave permission to European Jews to settle their land just like Algerians never gave permission to Europeans to settle their land and no one questions whether that was wrong because Algeria didn't have a seat at the League of Nations at the time or the UN later.  There wasn't even an official definition of genocide until the Holocaust, but that doesn't mean the Armenian genocide was not a genocide.  Oh oops that's what Israel actually claims.

The British conquered land from another imperialist power in war and decided to impose on that population the settlement of people that Europeans were too racist to accept in their own lands at the time.  


European Jews for all the horrible persecution they suffered at the hands of European Christians still felt free to see Palestinians, or Arabs, or whatever you want to believe them to be as inferior.  In fact European Jews even saw Middle Eastern Jews as inferior and still do in Israel to an extent.

The fact that you consider Palestine as simply ""Arab"" so you could then pretend that it was spoils of war between two countries fighting each other shows that you just believe what you want to believe.  ""Israeli"" identity hasn't even existed for a century and yet people don't pretend it's not real.

Nowadays, certain religious people have unfortunately become anti-science and anti-knowledge but this has not always been the case. There were long periods of history, such as in the European dark ages, where Christian monks were the guardians of knowledge.

&gt;&gt;Are you just making this stuff up or what?

&gt; Nope.

OK. So where is the doctrine that an Emperor must call an ecumenical council? Simply posing an 'if before then after' and citing personal correspondence is not enough.

&gt;So, Africans and Asians and North Americans and South Americans and Europeans are all ethnically the same Church? Huh? What about those Churches (Byzantine) that are Catholic but not Roman?

You come off in hysterics once in awhile. There are a number of churches in Africa even if ignoring the missionizing protestant groups. The Ethiopian Orthodox, the Copts, Marionites, Greeks and so on. I don't ebelieve any of these churches are in communion with one another either. Would you call them all ethnic churches? Isn't it more accurate to say the Russian Orthodox Church is named such because it is based in Russia? The Greek because it is based in Greece (actually the Ecumenical Patriarch heads the Greek Church). It seems you ae trying to argue here without making a point.

&gt;That is actually how it is done today- the Pope counts himself as first among equals- among all bishops.

Except he practices it as though he has the most authority. His vote is equal to the vote of another bishop and papal infallibility is also contrary to first among equals.

&gt;Yup, that's why I gave that example.

So you are attempting to highlight similarities. I am highlighting irreconcilable differences.

&gt;You may need to be more specific. Are you speaking of a particular basilica? Office? 'The Vatican' is not very specific, especially seeing at St. John Lateran is the official seat, but St. Peter's is the most popular.

Fine, fair enough, and on closer perusal, most of those images do seem to be Persian (or Central Asian, and thus I would assume shi'ite.)  Nonetheless, there do exist Sunni depictions (the coins he mentions, and a number of Ottoman copies, for example) of Mohammed/Muhammad/Bob/whatever-you-want-to-call-him; at least in the translation of the Koran I read, the whole proscription on pics seemed somewhat ambivalent (i.e. mainly about worshiping images rather than making them), and it's my impression that the real fatwas prohibiting it stem from Egypt in the early 20th century.

And I reiterate my point that, no matter where it comes from, it's irrelevant in a modern, free society that guarantees freedom of religion.  I will freely agree that it's a pretty douchebaggy thing to do to intentionally go try and piss people off because of their religious beliefs (unless these are explicitly harmful to others or to society), but freedom of expression, unless it directly threatens the livelihood, bodily integrity, or possessions of other individuals, trumps all.

Kilimanjaro not a victim of climate change, UW scientist says

Scientist Philip Mote says researchers may consider his finding an inconvenient truth: The mountain is losing its snowcap, but not because of global warming.

A similar photo taken in 2006 illustrates the cap's decline.



The shrinking snowcap atop Mount Kilimanjaro has become an icon of global warming.

Pictures of the African peak, which has lost 90 percent of its ice cover, were featured in Al Gore's documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Greenpeace activists once held a satellite news conference on the summit to sway participants in an international climate conference.

But most scientists who study Kilimanjaro's glaciers have long been uneasy with the volcano's poster-child status.

Yes, ice cover has shrunk by 90 percent, they say.

But no, the buildup of greenhouse gases from cars, power plants and factories is not to blame.

""Kilimanjaro is a grossly overused mis-example of the effects of climate change,"" said University of Washington climate scientist Philip Mote, co-author of an article in the July/August issue of American Scientist magazine.

Mote is concerned that critics will try to use the article to debunk broader climate-change trends.

He hastens to add that global warming is, indeed, responsible for the fact that nearly every other glacier around the globe is melting away. Kilimanjaro just happens to be the worst possible case study.

Rising nearly four miles from the plains of eastern Tanzania, Kilimanjaro has seen its glaciers decline steadily for well over a century — since long before humans began pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, Mote points out.

Most of the world's glaciers didn't begin their precipitous declines until the 1970s, when measurable global warming first appeared.

Also, recent data from Kilimanjaro show temperatures on the 19,340-foot volcano never rise above freezing. So melting triggered by a warmer atmosphere can't be the reason the small summit ice sheet is retreating about 3 feet a year, said Georg Kaser, co-author of the new article and a glaciologist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.

Most glaciers in temperate zones, like those on Mount Rainier, extend to lower elevations where their terminus is warmed to the melting point in summer.

On Kilimanjaro, ice loss seems to be driven by two factors: a lack of snowfall and sublimation, the same process that causes freezer burn by sucking moisture out of leftovers.

Researchers believe Kilimanjaro's glaciers formed about 11,000 years ago, when the region was undergoing a period of wet weather that allowed snow to accumulate. But even before the first Europeans reached the summit in 1889, the weather has been dry in Eastern Africa. There simply hasn't been enough snowfall to keep up with the loss of ice due to sublimation, Kaser explained.

Sublimation, caused by exposure to sunlight and dry air, occurs when ice essentially skips the melting step and evaporates.

Kaser, who climbs Kilimanjaro twice a year to gather data, says the ice topography shows little evidence that melting is anything but a minor force. Jagged spires and cliffs made of ice up to 120 feet tall are not softened around the edges.

Other researchers say melting may become more important if global temperatures continue to climb. Some have reported water gushing from boreholes and glacier margins. It's also possible climate change may play a role in droughts that have starved Kilimanjaro of snow, though that pattern was established before the planet began to warm significantly, Kaser said.

He was the first to point out the disconnect between global-warming rhetoric and scientific data from Kilimanjaro. His 2004 findings became fodder for conservative Web sites and global-warming skeptics — many funded by the oil and coal industries — who argued that all reports about melting glaciers are suspect.

The debate was so rancorous that a co-author of the 2004 study decided not to lend his name to the American Scientist article, which summarizes what researchers have learned about Kilimanjaro's complex ice dynamics.

Even though the mountain presents an interesting scientific puzzle, it's an anomaly compared to what's happening with other glaciers, said Douglas Hardy, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Massachusetts. The new article will be seized on by ""global warming naysayers"" and could give people the mistaken impression that it calls global warming into question, Hardy predicted.

""What value to society does that serve?"" he asked.

Mote, who as Washington's state climatologist travels the Northwest to warn of global warming's regional impacts, said he worried about the article being misused but decided to go ahead.

""Science is a process of getting to the truth,"" he said.

Even when the truth has unexpected twists like this: Models predict global warming will increase rainfall in Eastern Africa, which could actually be the thing that saves the ""shining mountain's"" snowy crown.

Information in this article, originally published June 12, was corrected June 12. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that temperatures on the summit of Mount Kilimnajaro never dip below freezing. Actually, temperatures never rise above freezing, which is why scientists believe melting caused by global warming is not responsible for shrinkage of glaciers on the African peak.

c0fa985,Economics,,True,1,"&gt; I think the fact that the U.S. economy has grown by 100% over the past 25 years while the EU economy has grown by only 50% is a much bigger factor than Americans' happy willingness to be spending today and paying next month and the month after and the month after for things they want.

Yes, however the financial crisis might reset that a bit, given the weight (and subsequent fall) of Wall street (the article is 4 years old). Also GDP growth through asset growth does not directly reflect the spending power of individual citizens. Also, you need to look at the other part of the division too : population growth in America as outstripped population growth in Europe in every single year. While this does not account for the full difference, it shrinks the growth gap considerable. Lastly, part of American GDP growth is achieved by breaking the glass, modern style : locking up 2 million people creates a huge industry that add a nice chunk of GDP but doesn't really contribute to individual well-being.

But, all that said, even when taking all that into account, Americans still have more spending power than Europeans. The reason is quite simple :

The most important factor in spending ability for the average American versus average European is the higher number of hours worked : Americans work longer days, have less vacation, enter the workforce earlier and retire later. All that adds up to a higher productivity per capita for the average American vs the average European.",t3_a07ay,t1_c0fa4kh,False,1257266450,t5_2qh1s,t1_c0fa985,False,1,0,bbibber,0,0,,,1426088132

I'm not happy.

The Lisbon Treaty can be seen as if in the US power was transfered from the states to the federal gov, which is a bad thing in itself, except that here 1) the EU isn't even a country, we don't even speak one language, the countries have less to do with each other culturally as the US has with Australia 2) it's not quite a transparent, democratically elected elite that calls the shots in Brussels.

I just can't see how it could be a good idea. I think the most of the core ideas of the centralization of power in the EU are a kinda imitation of the US, except that the EU isn't a country, isn't a nation. The cultural homogenity that's required for nation-building is missing here. And what is a power structure without a nation and a national homogenity? An empire? The EU isn't even an empire, empires of the past tended to have at least one official language (usually Latin). WTF is it really? 

There are parts of the EU thing I like, such as the free movement of people, goods and capital. I'm grateful that I as a Hungarian was allowed to live and work in the UK and now in Austria, and there wasn't such a thing before the EU. But the EU in the sense of a centralized power elite was unnecessary for it, we could have achieved that just with some international treaties.

I think at the end of the day the EU in it's post-Lisbon form is basically a Utopian project, one of nation-building or empire-building, but without the cultural homogenity of nations and the cultural supremacy of one culture (like Romans or Brits or Russians in past empires) of empires.

Mr. Lévi-Strauss also made sharp distinctions between the primitive and the modern, focusing on the development of writing and historical awareness. It was an awareness of history, in his view, that allowed the development of science and the evolution and expansion of the West. But he worried about the fate of the West. It was, he wrote in The New York Review of Books, “allowing itself to forget or destroy its own heritage.”

Attack on Poland is an attack on NATO

&gt; The Parties of NATO agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.

It is the front line against Russia and an act of war against Poland means that shit has hit the fan. Why would they let them in if they wouldn't do it? Let's widen the theory, would NATO respond if Turkey is attacked? Germany? UK? Where would it end?

Russia knows this, and that's why they won't touch Poland, or any other NATO country. There are no precedents of NATO leaving their members to bleed out, so why would that happen now? NATO is a powerful force, not to fuck around with, so why the hell would Russia risk this?

c0fak2k,worldnews,,True,4,"Traditionally, yes, but the contemporary situation only echoes that.  Prior to the European domination of the region, the Tutsi were herders and the Hutu were farmers -- a cultural division that tended to favor the Tutsi economically, and thus in terms of social position.  The Belgians further stratified them by instituting the identity card system (without which, intermarriage would tend to blur the boundaries between the two classes) and favoring the more ""Hamitic"" Tutsi with civil jobs.  After the withdrawal of Belgian rule, those institutions continued to stratify Rwandan society, culminating in the violence of the late 1950s and early 1960s, creating a Rwandan diaspora in its neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire (now the DRC).  Between the 60s and the 90s, Hutu made huge inroads into government, particularly after the assumption of power by President Habyarimana.  Habyarimana led something of a coalition government for a while, but his wife was a member of a powerful clan from northeast Rwanda who began to exercise power through the government and manipulation of the media -- think modern day Lady Macbeth and you'll get the general picture.  They essentially created the Hutu Power party and began the training of the *interahamwe*, semi-official vigilante groups who began training for the massacres long before the outbreak of the genocides.  In April of 1994, Habyarimana's airplane was shot down en route to Kigali, opening a brief vacuum of power.  Hutu Power, who likely orchestrated the assassination, quickly seized power, killing prominent Tutsi in the government, and the next 100 days say the death of around 800,000 people -- a tenth of the population of the country.

So, yeah, it's a little more complicated than a bourgeois uprising, if that's what you're getting at.  The Tutsi already no longer held immediate control of Rwanda, and a high degree of intermarriage within the population meant that a lot of the *genocidaires* were turning against their own in-laws.  Rather, the genocides look to be the result of a concerted campaign of stirring up hatreds in order to serve Hutu Power's political ambitions.

Better to have kept quiet at this point and presumed an imbecile than continue to speak and prove it beyond doubt. But I have to commend you for your ability to induce real disgust. There is so much hostility towards Christianity that people (a term used loosely here) like you direct it towards completely innocent, constantly victimized groups that have done absolutely nothing but to exist.

The ban on Nazism in Germany has some rational basis (though I do not agree with such thought or expression-based legislation). Nazism was a blight on Germany, Europe, and the planet, and as the cradle of a political movement that killed many millions, Germany has reason to be sensitive. Although I have major problems with banning political or religious expression, I have less a problem, say, proscribing anarchism from the public forum than I do Santerians. 

Banning Christianity and ALL forms of expressions of Christianity (even completely innocuous ones like names and tattoos) is, of course, has NO RATIONAL BASIS and is the first step in banning it entirely. Christians in Egypt have been peaceful for many centuries. Many died for their faith, many die for their faith. You obviously fail to grasp how important that faith is for believers. 

That said, you're obviously not American, and you have a diminished sense of the importance of unfettered, free expression. The Supreme Court has done an excellent job balancing the importance of freedom of expression with compelling public interests (safety, etc.). I am perhaps overly idealistic in thinking that should be the *status quo* everywhere, but to think that in a country like Egypt, in 2009, Christians cannot simply exist without fearing for their lives? Absurd beyond belief.

Everything coming out of your mouth is so ridiculous on so many - philosophical, political, social, ONTOLOGICAL - levels, I am again at a loss.

Way back in the day traveling was a great way to get killed or taken into slavery, and people very rarely traveled without some kind of financial backer. If you had money and letters of protection, you could theoretically travel freely, otherwise you were SOL. Not to mention disease being a huge problem - read Plagues and Peoples, it's a great book that speaks to how deadly travel was before antibiotics and vaccines.

Later, as nations developed, you needed visas and documents to travel, You needed an identity papers. It's was just like it was now, except that you would often need them to travel within single nations. 

Cost was also a huge factor in limiting travel back in those days. You couldn't jump on a plane that cost 80 hours of minimum wage work and fly across the atlantic. Families pooled their life savings to send someone from Italy to the United States, in the hope that they'd be able to support them in the future.

It's enough to look at my parent's generation (my dad turned 60 this year): by the time he was my age, my dad had traveled to 4 countries in the region. That's it. I've been to 12 european countries, all over the united states and in canada.

* Get on a plane and fly to any country in the EU with no more than an ID card.

* Drive to a non-EU state, this will require me to dust off my passport.

The Life Support Unit provides cabin pressurization and warm air. I believe that we should design the capsule to “default cold” so that we only have to worry about warming it. We could achieve this by making the outside highly reflective (mylar film?, multiple layers (space blankets) to achieve insulation). We would then use the hypergolic fuel (for the DS motor) in small quantities to heat the air. Instead of depressurizing the CM by venting the contents prior to the extravehicular activities we would pump the contents so that we could store it and then release it once the EVA is complete. 

The Electronics Unit (EU) contains mostly batteries, but also required computer equipment. I see no reason that the computing requirements need to exceed the capabilities of a standard laptop computer (netbook even). Cabin lighting will be high efficiency LEDs.

""Dear students in Germany,

in Austria the universities are squatted. We see the need to personally inform you about what is happening at the moment, as it was not conveyed in the media that this protests are something new that has never existed before.

This protest was rooted in a totally spontaneous demonstration of solidarity, no Student representative or party organized this, purely from the awareness of the Education issue it has arisen and developed. This pure core, this motor we are feeling behind everything that happens here. Students of all disciplines have spontaneously - without any parent organization - come together to protest the studing conditions.

The extent of this action is proof that this is a central concern all European students are personally related to. We protest, not as the media presents it, but just also against the decisions of the Austrian Government, but primarily we do not agree, on a basic level, with Europe-wide trends such as the commodification of education and the loss of democracy in education institutions. These are transnational problems, which we, as students, will only be involved in if there are protests all over Europe.

Wanting self-determination of students and teachers is a key element of this movement in Austria. Therefore auditorium halls were occupied, which are now alive and hold constructive discussions, in which all students can participate at any time. It is important that there is not only protest, but that discussion spaces beyond public Institutions and established platforms are created. In Austria, across regions this has already happened. The debates and protests will continue here and students in Austria are waiting for their German fellow students to disclose common problems.

November 5th is an international day of protest as a warm-up for a week of protest under the motto ""Education is not for sale"". The students and pupils in Austria will support this day with a big demonstration.

We encourage every single student in Germany, in Europe and beyond
dissatisfied with her/his educational system.

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign (fleshandstone.net)
Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO. www.theflucase.com


Infringements
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2. Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.",t3_a0ogu,t3_a0ogu,False,1257296141,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fb25l,False,-1,0,necromanser,0,0,,,1426088579

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign 

Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

**Infringements**
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2. Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.

The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO. www.theflucase.com

c0fb77v,atheism,,True,1,"&gt; Yup, and I think France is wrong. More to the point, I think its a really blatant and disgusting anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, law and violates the principals of freedom of religion.

This is ridiculous. We have more muslims than any other European country and make it easy for them to come here. Saying that France is anti-immigrant is really funny coming from an American (I suppose) since getting a green card is the hardest process ever. The UK keeps sending illegal immigrants back to their country by plane whereas the few times when it happened the media kept talking about it. You probably believed the whole ""France is at civil war"" bullshit about the riots which were portrayed like that by the American media after we didn't want to go to Iraq - when really, [it wasn't the point of the riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_France#Integration_issues) (which were greatly exagerrated) at all.

Muslim != Hijab. Most muslims here are from North Africa and they're far from being extremists. And since they're 5-10% of the population they're everywhere, everyone knows some and they're usually fairly well integrated. Lots of my teachers/fellow students are Algerians/Tunisians/Morrocans and trust me, they don't give a shit about the Hijab.

Laïcité (secularity) is one of the pillars of the French republic. To us, ""laïcité"" is as important as your ""freedom"". You'd never see a crucifix in public schools here. Or ""in god we trust"" on our money. Or politicians swearing on the Bible or crap like that. That would be utterly shocking. The one time the president said something about religion (something along the lines of ""teachers can't teach everything, priests can teach important things too"") he's been overwhelmingly criticized and portrayed as a dangerous whacko.

If you believe France is pro-Catholicism and anti Islam, you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. The French are mostly non-religious. Political leaders almost never talk about the subject. And nobody wants extremist religious people to throw religion into our face. If you decide to believe in some crazy fairy tale, at least be respectful and keep it to yourself.

France has always fought to prevent religion from getting too intrusive. Laïcity in school has been enforced since 1880, Jules Ferry declaring that school should be ""Laïque, gratuite et obligatoire"" was a very important part of our history. Books were changed so that no reference to god would appear in them. Even images in textbooks were modified so that no crucifix/reference to christianity would be visible. What was it then, a racist move too?

You guys think you need the right to bear arms because you had to fight the British during your revolution? Well our revolution was in great part against the clergy which had gotten too powerful. Religions can be dangerous if you don't limit them. I mean, just look at what creationists are trying to do in the US...

So yes, the idea is that headscarves or crucifixes should be kept out of public schools. And it's a good thing. Children shouldn't be indoctrinated.",t3_a0hyn,t1_c0fa86a,False,1257302403,t5_2qh2p,t1_c0fb77v,True,1,0,loulan,0,0,,,1426088643

(My own observation was that none of those intersection studies would be directly relevant to 4-way crossings, the most common north american intersection.

The bonus is the fun you have with fellow fans and the economic bonus that is gained from it. It isn't pointless if people are getting something from it. just because you don't.

Again the point you seemed to have missed, is that its too much. I'm even being taxed against my will to wastefully spend it on fancy stadiums. Why don't you sports lovers pay tax money for **my** hobbies?

&gt; i don't know much about other sports, but most NHL players have full College level educations and a lot have degrees from everything from business to art.

Oh you mean all those flunkies who get full ride scholarships on colleges that spend millions on sports and let them fail all their classes without kicking them out? They sure are the epitome of academics.

&gt; Again, your opinion of dubious value. People gain a lot from sport. I for one used to play basketball constantly.

Ok, so it helped you. The point is that overall, it is not helping the US. People in the US are still fatter and dumber than many of other first world countries.

&gt; They do get paid, they're called Sprinters. It's a feat of the human ability. some people can appreciate that.

Sprinters don't get paid nearly as much as basketball or football players. And it doesn't really change my point. How about replacing that with ""slapping someone as hard as you can""? Do you get my point now?

&gt; Sure they get paid lots. but how much do you think they should be paid then? how much does one deserve for being the best at something? for dedicating themselves to something? it's how the world works.

Again, its all about what they are doing is helping the nation. If I am the best in the world in slapping people, according to you, I should be paid billions of dollars because I am good at that.


&gt; Think of all the things that would be gone if sports were gone. Kids would be not active at all. all the millions of jobs created from sports and gain bonuses from sports would be gone. From the hotdog vendor that gets a bonus from a busy night after the game, to the people that manufacture the equipment, to the people who transport them, to the TV crews, and the infinite other things i could name if i cared more.

Oh you mean like China which is kicking American ass in the economy right now without being morbidly obese? Or even Europe being less focused than Americans on sports?

I could think of a million different things that those people could be doing that would be more useful. 

How about money for cures for cancer, or alternative energy so we don't keep spending trillions of dollars to appease terrorists in the middle east because we need more oil? PhD students get something like $20,000 a year doing research. There's something wrong with that.

How about better funding for schools, and impoverished neighborhoods? How about improving roads and highways that have gone neglected so much that people are spending 3-5 hours on a commute? How about better rehabilitation and crime prevention so we don't spend billions on prison fees? 

How about actually giving money to people getting their MDs instead of student loan corporations who get to make a killing off these loans and then we wonder why doctors are so expensive in the US?

The fact that you can defend a 12 person per year limit for a [minor surgery](http://www.medtronic.eu/your-health/urinary-retention/getting-a-device/surgery/index.htm) means you are trying to be overtly dishonest in your defense of this. And that you could then say that someone dying on a waiting list for a minor surgery ""wasn't denied"" care is just over the top.

&gt;For all you know, that SRS surgeon was just hitting on his arse twiddling his thumbs until that 'bureaucrat' approved the woman's surgery.

If there's a centrally-managed care system where there are gender reassignment surgeons sitting idle while people are dying from physical ailments, would that be a misallocation of resources on the part of the Canadian government?

&gt;Thirdly, the headline suggests that re-assignment surgery is somehow silly or trivial. It certainly can be elective in many cases, but in many other cases it is a very grave matter, and transgender people who do not have access to surgery often develop severe depression and self-mutilate or even kill themselves.

Thanks, strawman. Get out of here with your trivializing bullshit language. One woman was dying from an actual physical ailment and one guy just felt he should be a woman. You tell me how you would allocate resources in that event.

c0fba1a,programming,,True,1,"&gt;Whether kernel modules are GPLed or not it doesn't really have to do anything with US and EU courts nor patents.

Under current patents, I can't see Sun allowing it to be rewritten for Linux - major lawsuits would start.  Why would they allow a major feature of their product be copied by a direct competitor (which Linux is).  Unless the courts somehow gave it a stamp of approval, any mature ZFS project would be buried faster than a dead skunk.  The open source community wouldn't be able to band together enough to fight Sun off - Sun's fighting for its bread and butter on this one.  Granted, this is all personal speculation, though.  I could be completely wrong.  Feel free to disagree.

&gt;Making code GPL licensed doesn't protect you from patent claims.

Exactly.  I foresee patent lawsuits as more of the GPL'd port projects reach maturity.

&gt;Also the limitation whether kernel can use GPLed code or not is really up to Linus

Probably not... for the same reason that the Linux license can't really be changed anymore.  Absolute control isn't in one person's (or even a small group's) hands.

In addition to sending more troops, the surge was a change in strategy that involved an attempt to coopt the insurgents. Remember that some of the first things that happened after Baghdad fell were the looting of office equipment and the museums. Clearly, there was a criminal element that was making a ton of money. Saddam had emptied many of the prisons in effort to cause mayhem which didn't help either.

While, undoubtedly, many of the insurgents were motivated by sincere anger over lost loved ones and the indignity of occupation, many wanted to extend the chaos and the opportunity it gave criminals.

Anyway, the inspiration for joining the Awakening for many was cash. We have essentially bought their allegiance. I think there are 600,000 people now on the payroll and many may have dubious qualifications or allegiance.

It sounds like a hopelessly unsustainable situation, but it may not be. It could give the necessary peace to build schools and repair infrastructure, and hopefully repair the civil institutions that can counter the authority that gangs claim for themselves. In a way it is a reversal of the de-Baathification policy that is now condemned. (I'm in the minority of thinking it wasn't a completely stupid policy. During the Allied advance through Europe, the Nazi bureaucrats were often temporarily restored to power in liberated towns as a way to administer law and order, and with hindsight that is considered a mistake, too.)

Anyway, *nothing* happening for an extended period is likely to create a new reality in itself. What happens to the boy in Afghanistan who from age 13 to age 22 has lived in a country where he has been at the mercy of warlords and has no idea if an education opens up possibilities or if it is a waste of time that could be better spent forging a useful reputation as vicious or maybe pious?

If a person from a certain company acts dishonorably, the *whole company* is disgraced. And so on.

It is changing, but traditional Japan was very hard on individualists. And from this I believe it is very easy for an average Japanese to generalise.

It is also helped by certain cultural differences which just mean different things in Japan. For instance, average American personal distance is much closer than average European, which is still a bit too close for Japan. When someone approaches that close, it is intimidating and threatening for the Japanese, even if the American is doing his best to be friendly (in the way of his culture). The Japanese misunderstand, and suddenly Americans are scary - and by extension, all whites, probably simply because of the number of Americans in Japan, and especially because of the soldiers.

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign
Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.

The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.


**Infringements**
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2. Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.


The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO.

c0fbkz0,SuicideWatch,,True,1,"Your unstable brain is being flooded with chemicals.  I don't say that because I'm against anti-depressant medications at all.  But when you are taking those and illicit drugs it's amazing what you can do to your brain.  For example, I was on 20 mg of celexa day.  A fairly low dosage.  My girlfriend and I (19+20y/o) backpacked around Europe this summer!  On the plane ride over I took some melatonin to sleep.  When I was in Paris for about three days I spiraled into deep uncontrollable depression.  I should have been so happy but I couldn't stop crying.  Eventually my dad (doc) told me that he thinks it's the melatonin mixing with the celexa.  I looked it up online and there was some research indicating a connection, but not much.  As soon as I stopped though I became normal again.  My point here is if I, a very happy person (at the time) was able to spiral into deep inconsolable depression by fucking up the chemicals in my brain.  Just imagine what would happen to someone already down in the pits?  I just kept telling myself ""It's not your fault, the chemicals in your brain are fucked.""  I realize that it may not be greatest consolation when you are in the depths of depression.  But you are twisting your brain up something awful with all these illicit drugs.  And trust me, I have done opiates and the whole 9 yards and I know alll about it, I'm not just regurgitating anti-drug shit.  

The best thing to do is to **force** yourself to do things that *should* make you happy.  Make yourself go on a run, force yourself to hang out with your friends, grit your teeth and have dinner with your family and make conversation.  This is not a quick fix, there are no quick fixes.  But remember you can control your own life.  We are all ultimately responsible for our own happiness, this is something I have learned.  But first and foremost if you are twisting your brain up you can't even begin the hike up.  Quick all illicits and take the anti-depressants you are prescribed the way you should.  Anti-depressants do not work like opiates, oh trust me I KNOW.  But quick fixes are never true happiness.

c0fbla2,WTF,,True,8,"No, you usually don't need to know their language. Some of it depends on age, for young kids who are still learning their native language, teaching them another language isn't so bad. For older kids who know their native language well, usually an English teacher is paired up with a local teacher who speaks English. The local teacher can go over a lesson in their native language and teach them the terms in English. Then the foreign English teacher teachers the lesson, in their own way, and reinforces the concepts and they get to hear how everything should be pronounced correctly.

There's a lot of different ways to do it, but that one is pretty common. No country in Asia is going to expect a European or American to speak their language, although if they stay long enough they will probably learn and it will make their classroom time easier. But many schools also don't want you to speak to students in their native language since your job is to speak English and the fact you speak it without a foreign accent is the whole reason you're there.

I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.""

..........................................

First world nations keep electing Rothschild agents using a two party ""Punch and Judy"" puppet show political system they designed and called democracy, without anybody understanding what's going on behind the back curtain. People elect representatives who have a greater alliance to a party than to the people who elected them while the top party politicians loyalty is to the Rothschild agenda.

You don't choose your presidents or prime ministers, two people are selected behind closed doors and then you choose between these 2 people not even chosen by you who are portrayed as being different when the same agenda continues no matter who you vote for, Their loyalty is to the agenda, this is what gives them a seat in the election process, anyone else who stands will be taken out by the media which they brought in 1915.

The current system is a puppet show to distract us, wasting our time fighting over things of little importance that without the puppet show can be solved easily, they designed the system this way to have you think you have a say, while behind the curtain they continue on with their agenda. They are creating their new world order out of the chaos while we are distracted fighting over nothing.


The current political system in America is designed to allow the continuation of America as the Foreign Military Corporation for the House of Rothschild while the CIA stands for Corporate Interests Abroad with all terrorists groups allowed to function only as tools and assets of the CIA. While they claim to protect you and to keep you safe from ""Them"", the ""Them's"" are always connected with the CIA and it appears the CIA is really there only to keep them safe from ""you"". The CIA does all the dirty work and the main stream media bundles it up nicely and sells it to the people based on what ever paddock they want you in to achieve what ever results they want

They create money out of thin air, and it is backed by nothing. They let you print it and you pay them interest for the right. These International bankers own the Central Banks in every nation in the world, except the so-called seven rogue nations. The U.S. State Department. defines ""rogue nations"" as any nation that harbors or supports terrorists. The present nations that meet this definition are/were: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. There is no evidence that Cuba or North Korea harbour or support terrorist, the only common thread between these countries is that none of them allow the International bankers to control their central banks.

The current system is a fools democracy, People need to start voting independents only if they want to claim back the government.

Knowledge is power, the American peoples lack of knowledge is their power.

So you admit that if Israel stopped fighting it would stop existing.  Nice to see a ray of truth poking through the clouds of hateful delusion.

If you really want to know why the Israeli economy has so many high-tech companies, it's because sabras are highly-educated, the Russian olim came with tons of Soviet-issued science and technology degrees, and the shekel is weak enough compared to the dollar and euro that paying an American-grade or European-grade salary to a high-tech worker in Israel buys you top-grade talent who will work quite enthusiastically because you've made him a very comfortable man.

Third, income tax in Israel is significantly more than in the United States and with benefits included, the average cost of a high-tech worker to an employer in Israel is on par the USA, centeris paribus.  Finally, Intel's fab in Israel is located in the south, where land is inexpensive and wages are lower.  Intel also has thousands of employees in Israel even not counting the fab, so having a fabrication site in the same country that develops the chips makes management sense.

of military expenditure.

Without increased cooperation we will have a very hard future, this is especially true for the UK as we have lost a huge amount of power over the last century, and we are simply not in a position to remain globally relevant without the EU. By creating a European defence force we can combine our resources and field a far more effective defence force than nations can individually, simple things like unified logistics would be a massive help now. We cannot rely on the Americans to look after us forever, and with the increasing signs that Washington doesn't see Europe in the same light as it did during the cold war, we need to think about this sooner rather than later.

As for the European police idea, again this is something we will be forced to introduce simply due to the fact that crime does not respect borders, especially when you effectively have no borders. Unless we work more closely in creating a unified approach to serious crime, we stand to lose out. The mixture of laws, culture and legal systems is an issue, but not an insurmountable one.

For example someone on a WVP cannot change his non-immigratant status while visiting, nor do you have the right to administrative or judicial review when you are turned down at the bordergate. Both of those things would be different if you had an automatic visa issued.

c0fbpxp,reddit.com,,True,4,"Honestly, this isn't down to Islam, it comes from ideological influences introduced into the Middle East from Europe in the 20th century: fascism and Stalinist Marxism.

After World War I the Turkish Empire had collapsed and the Arab world was looking to win independence.  These early Nasserites sided with the Axis and the Germans during World War II because that side opposed England, France, and the Jews (all of whom the pan-Arabists hated).  They imported fascist ideology from the Axis.  Most Middle-Eastern fascism at this point was pan-Arabist rather than Islamic religious, but since Arabs have always felt that Islam is their ethnic religion little pockets of Islamism sprung up.

Then after the war they *again* sided against the British, French, and Jews by aligning themselves with the Soviet Union.  From here they imported a Marxist and secular tinge to their ideologies: the West+Jews were no longer conceived as racially inferior or as religious infidels, but as imperialists keeping the Arabs down.  This compounded the basic problems in the thought, as adding a grain of truth (Western imperialism) made the virulent lies (OMFG EVERYONE'S OUT TO GET US ARABS AND WE DESERVE TO OWN THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AS A PROSPEROUS SINGLE UNITED NATION WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANY INCONVENIENT NATION-BUILDING OR INDUSTRIALIZING) seem more believable.

Then the '70s killed Nasserism, and the virus mutated into a religious form.  Thus was born modern Islamism, which puts an Islamic skin onto an older Arabian fascism.  Political Islamism feeds off Islamic fundamentalism and identity politics, so its proponents make their very best efforts to both keep Muslims from integrating into Western nations and to encourage fundamentalist practices among Muslims that will make integration or the achievement of a Muslim Enlightenment more difficult.

EDIT: Note this!  The core conflict is not between the West and Islam or even between the Jews and Islam.  The core conflict is between Enlightenment thought and Romantic-fascist thought.  Muslim countries that have embraced Enlightenment, labor, and development really did quite reasonably for themselves until troubled by imperialists and MidEastern fascists (ex: Iran, parts of India, Turkey).",t3_a0m29,t1_c0fbbo1,False,1257337394,t5_6,t1_c0fbpxp,True,4,0,eaturbrainz,0,0,,,1426088885

c0fbt38,relationship_advice,,True,2,"&gt;I think you're really striving to understand your authentic feelings.

Thanks, I appreciate hearing that. I know some of my friends say it sounds really unromantic to think like this, but from talking to people that have been divorced, they seem to wish that they were more honest to themselves about their relationship before they decided to get married. Likewise, some people that have been together 20-30 years...well, some people just fall in love and stay that way, and while I think we're in love, you can't predict the future and I want there to be a very strong foundation for our relationship. If there are rough patches, having a strong foundation, I hope, would see us through. My goal is to marry someone that I could never see myself splitting up from, not just in a romantic/attraction sort of way, but also on a personal level. 

&gt;I have to wonder about some of the misgivings you seem to express. To my mind, there are certain levels that you need to relate to your partner on. If you can't relate on all of these levels, it may not work out: mental, emotional, demeanor (for lack of a better word), and sexual.

So, I don't think we relate to each other perfectly on everything. part of me likes that, as it challenges me to see things differently. Also, while it may be comforting to be with someone that thinks the same exact way as you, I see enough merits for being with someone that thinks a little differently than you do. As long as you acknowledge and respect the other person's differences, you should be fine. And, I think we do that. She comes from a different social circle/culture than I do -- she was really popular in high school, etc etc, and well, I was kind of an introverted nerd. My family is from Poland, so there is somewhat of a cultural/values barrier for me with people I meet, her included. That being said, all I think it does is enrich our lives that much more. We can expose each other to more things and... it almost feels like synergy, if that makes sense. For example, I've been fortunate enough to have traveled all over the world when I was younger, and she hasn't traveled as much, so we talk about that it would be fun for me to take her backpacking around Europe when we get the chance. While we don't relate to each other perfectly (which is somewhat of a misgiving, don't get me wrong here.. it's something I think we've always been aware of) all it has done so far is enhanced our relationship. I do feel, on a fundamental level in terms of core values (family, money, religion, etc) we relate to each other very well. It's the everyday piddling things that we don't necessarily relate to each other perfectly on. 

&gt;is the sex good? No, I don't mean to fixate on that one aspect, but I think it is really important.

You're not the first person to bring this up -- my mom's boyfriend, who's a *really* great guy, asked me this when I told him I started thinking about getting engaged. Our sex is good, great even. It was definitely slow at first getting used to each other, I think, but we've reached a stage that it's really open, spontaneous, and fun.

c0fbt3e,worldnews,,True,-1,"The lisbon treaty in reality will eventually destroy national sovereignty.  They will deny that though.  But that's what the EU is all about. Think I'm crazy?  Take a look at the following incident that took place; finnish woman moves to italy so many years ago.  She gets offended by the crucifix in the school her child attends.  She sues demanding that all crucifixes be removed from public places.  Italian court rules that she can go to hell, and it goes to the european court.  European court says, screw you italian court, all crucifixes must be removed...sounds all reasonable, correct? but here is the real kicker:

&gt;hanging the crucifix in Italian classrooms is the result of a legal and political agreement between the state and the Catholic church.


&gt;In article 7, the Italian constitution reads: ""The state and the church are, each one in its own domain, independent and sovereign. Their relationships are regulated by the Patti Lateranensi"". That's the Lateran treaty, the agreement reached in 1929 between Mussolini and the Cardinal Pietro Gasparri which established a framework for mutual recognition and cohabitation of the secular and the religious domains within the Italian state. The agreement, among other things, states that crucifixes must hang in every classroom and tribunal in the country.


&gt;**The ECHR's ruling says exactly the opposite. But because of the superiority of the European Union over the nation state, it has the power to supercede national regulation.**

And that my friend, is what the lisbon treaty is all about. It is the last nail in the coffin for the destruction of national sovereignty.

c0fbt7g,reddit.com,,True,5,"&gt; Did you read my post? Carefully?

Yes. I saw the same lazy arguments about violence in the Islamic world as I hear from my fundamentalist Hindu friends and Fox News.

&gt; All I am saying is that poverty, lack of opportunities, education etc. 
&gt; cannot by itself be the cause of religious extremism.

That is true. But Islam is not the reason. It is a scapegoat and excuse for lazy thinking. The Middle East is largely tribal societies. India is not the same way at all (though strains persist in identification by different ethic groups), but still has not fared as well as China and the West. The book [Gun, Germs, Steel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel) goes into far more detail as to why the divide between civilized societies and tribal societies still exists today.

&gt; Caste based violence does occur in India. But are you seriously 
&gt; suggesting that this is on the same scale as that which is happening 
&gt; in the middle east? I would beg to disagree.

Hindu extremism is mostly contained within India. Islamic extremism is far more spread out, both in the Middle East and reaching out to Europe and the US.  What is happening in the Middle East has a lot more to do with history (Crusades, Ottoman/European conflicts), and in how the Middle East was colonized (India/Pakistan conflict x 1000), and in conflicts between Arabian tribal groups and others spanning millenia. The Middle East and the West have been interacting in history for a very long time, and much of what is happening today is echos of past conflicts. The Islamic world is living in a past glory and sore over past defeats, and this is the source of populist anger against the West. India has largely been a curiosity in that history, and the conflict between Britain and India was of a colonial nature only, the cause of which ended in 1947.",t3_a0m29,t1_c0fbrh0,False,1257343911,t5_6,t1_c0fbt7g,False,5,0,banfu,0,0,,,1426088928

As an American who has spent extensive time in France, I've certainly noticed a few differences.

Most european countries are parliamentarian democracies were the PM is indirectly elected and the cabinet is merely nominated or endorsed. Besides, there is still many constitutional monarchies in Europe so the head of state is not even elected.

The President of the Council is not really a new position. The high representative is a fusion between the present high representative position and an existing commission position. None were elected. Common Foreign and Security Policy do not forbid independant diplomacy and did not prevent the deep rift between member states during the Iraq War.

Besides, the Common Foreign and Security Policy is probably the only chance to develop a strong european policy independent from the NATO and US ones.

c0fbvt0,AskReddit,,True,2,"   1. 32. Male. Florida. Hetero
   2. I'm on my second marriage. From what I can see, with two children, one from each wife, pregnancy is evil.  My first wife was always violent, but it got worse when she was pregnant, and the relationship definitely deteriorated. She ran off with the neighbor of one of her friends when the baby was about 8 months old, leaving the state a few months later. I have custody.  The second wife (married 2006) got pregnant RIGHT AWAY, and our daughter was born 12/2006.  She started fucking her boss a few months later.  I almost left her, but I didn't want to be 30 and twice divorced, so we reconciled.  Being married, for me, has sucked so far. I recognize I'm the common thread in these two relationships, but having had an actual relationship with these women for years with them happy and faithful only for them to take up with another man after the pregnancy -- well, I assume it had to do with self esteem, etc.
   3. Kinda answered in the above question, but I have two awesome daughters, one from each relationship
   4. Absolutely.  At least once a week, sometimes 3 times a week. Not usually more.  My wife is pretty fun in the sack, even though a lot of what we do is routine anymore.  We spice it up pretty good.  It helps to find somebody sexually compatible.
   5. We have fewer boundaries and can fantasize together. It's about intimacy and fun TOGETHER, not about the rut.
   6. Definitely not.  I travel the world, drive fast...but I have less time and resources to do these things, and that's ok.  The change that comes upon a man when he becomes a dad means that I'd rather see $1000 go towards my kids than towards a plane ticket to Europe. I'd feel guilty if I did that. But that doesn't mean I don't have a ""me"" budget. Everybody should have a ""me"" budget.
   7. A little. I don't fear death, and I still don't. I do get a bit nervous now while living, though, knowing that so many idiots are out there on the roads.  I contemplate missing my kids' weddings, graduations, children...that gets me a little nervous, though I know that if I died I'd no longer give a shit.
   8. Children are important for the future of the species, obviously. When I was younger I wanted to have a large family, but it's too hard to provide for a large family anymore without a reality show. I wanted to be a breeder for as long as I can remember.  It's like Harvey Danger said, ""I've been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding"" and I need to counteract that.
   9. A lot of things were out of control when I was younger. My parents filed bankruptcy a year before I went off to college, so I couldn't afford to go to a good school.  I went to an expensive, good school the first year to see if I couldn't figure out a way to keep going to it, but I didn't pull it off.  I ended up graduating from a school that would have given me a full ride, but it was a fallback school. If I knew I would have graduated from it in the first place, I would have just gone from the get-go.  Also, I probably would have stayed in the military, come to think of it. I got my commission, but in the wrong branch, unfortunately, and I was miserable.  So that's two things.
  10. I'm happy all the time, man.  I have lots of work to keep me busy and accomplishing things, and my work has started to win some insider industry awards.

Any deal would necessarily include the High Representative too. You must also take into account the european political equilibrium. Most of Europe is governed by right-wing parties.

c0fbwhc,AskReddit,,True,1,"A ""date"" is literally an appointment to get together and jointly engage in an activity at an appointed hour. ""Dating"" is merely the name for going on ""dates"" on a regular basis. The ""dating scene"" refers simultaneously to a pool of people that are ""dating"" people, and the environment in which they do it (e.g., where you go on your ""date""). That's the denotative definition.

Connotatively, it's a little different in that Americans have a tendency to consciously divide platonic friendships from courtships. Obviously, how stark that divide is varies from person to person and region to region. However, ""dating"" is more of a concept in courtship and it conveys a certain formality and openness of the intent -- it also often carries with it a certain expectation of exclusivity. Some Americans will refer to this as ""being in a relationship,"" which is kind of silly since the phrase could obviously be justly applied to any form of relationship, even and adversarial one, but if an American uses that phrase they likely mean it in the context of a courtship or marriage.

It probably is a residue of the values and traditions of the early european settlers of the US.

The semantic division between ""dating"" and having more platonic friendships is a popular subject for what we Americans call ""romantic comedy"". It's explicitly a subject of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and is topical in a good number of Seinfeld episodes as well as lots of TV programs aimed at youth (vis the Nick and Disney mid-afternoon line-ups).",t3_a0uz3,t3_a0uz3,False,1257348085,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fbwhc,False,1,0,FellowConspirator,0,0,,,1426088971

c0fbx75,reddit.com,,True,1,"Let me be frank:  It takes a few generations for virtually all immigrant groups to assimilate.  Somehow the idea of a ""cultural melting pot"" has become ""they will adopt our culture the moment they step onto our shores"", which is not the way it's ever worked.  It explicitly discards the notion that we just may acquire some of their culture in return, or that they may maintain distinct groups after time (see: Chinese, Somali, Hmong, Jews, persistence of the Indian caste system)

When the Irish, Poles (any major Catholic group, really), Chinese, Eastern Europeans, and other major influxes of population came to the US, the same xenophobic bullshit was thrown at them.  Has it occurred to you that they came to the UK/US in hopes of providing a better life for their family, but that generations of cultural bias are not so easily dropped?

Moreover, the idea that honor killings are somehow endemic to Islam is galling.  The same shit happens in India and China (to name two), just under different names.  We're fond of condemning actions which don't fit our cultural mores (arranged marriage, continuing to speak their native tongue, et al) and telling the foreigners to ""go back from whence you came"" is a de-facto denial of the virtues (equality, acceptance, opportunity) which you ostensibly stand for.  It's not going to stop the spread of Islam either.  Nor is Islam responsible for this man's actions (see: Philippines, Lebanon, much of Africa, and other areas where Islam is prevalent but there is no history of honor killings).

Restricting your condemnation to ""Muslims who live in the West and dislike it..."" is a false dichotomy.  They did not come here to adopt your values.  They came for the opportunities.  Their children *will* adopt your values after a couple of generations.   The history of up/down votes in this thread and baseless trashing of Islam leads me to believe that I'll be downvoted, and that's fine.

That also goes for the backwards people adamantly opposed to gay marriage, the people in that picture.  In 20 years, when you look back at the political issues of 2009, are you going to think about gay marriage or the issues I have listed below.  (By the way, I'm not a Christian conservative. I expect these baseless attacks anyway.)

I'm more concerned with bankers looting our treasury and giving trillions of dollars to off shore banks in Europe.  I'm more concerned with U.S. citizens being captured in rendition programs, being put in jail for years without having a trial and without their family knowing where they are.  I'm more concerned with the U.S. invading Iraq under complete lies. I'm more concerned with Obama doing nothing about Iraq. I'm more concerned about Health Care and 47,000 people dying every year because they don't have health care insurance.  I'm concerned about the U.S. government actively legalizing torture.  I'm concerned with Western Governments committing false-flag terrorism.

These issues make the hysteria about whether gay people can have that official title of ""marriage"" seem rather minor.  Gay people can legally have the rights of other married couples, at least in my state.  The hysteria is over the title alone.  (I guess I'm a little biased here. As a young man, the idea of getting married could not be more repulsive to me, even with my girlfriend, who I love.  Marriage is scary to me. Maybe it's because my parents got divorced).

I'm sorry, but the gay marriage movement is not on the same level as the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. Straight up.

c0fbyec,AskReddit,,True,157,"Your post brings up a great point. Namely, in the US, there's a kind of 'crowding' effect from dating, that is from declaring your interest point-blank (which is essentially what asking for a date does), that disadvantages people who try to make friendships first and THEN date. For men, not asking for a date explicitly makes you a wuss without confidence, in the eyes of women. If you try to become friends and transition into dating, you're penalized for it. Of course the latter makes a lot more sense - why skid into a relationship at full speed, have sex, then try to make up your mind about a person while simultaneously having a physical relationship with them that exceeds the actual intimacy you really share? It also leads to this scornful attitude about male-female friendship, seen in the poster above; friendship (which, because of the crowding effect from dating, is put in a totally, almost bizarrely, different class) is frequently seen as the 'consolation prize' for not scoring a relationship. And so male-female friendships suffer, since they are seen as vaguely emasculating, for men; all relationships are sorted into 'sexual' and 'nonsexual' practically from the first day, so if you don't rush into it and declare your interest as sexual right off the bat, you forfeit the right to consider it as a sexual relationship later. So naturally people *have* to rush into relationships, because otherwise the option is withdrawn from consideration. 

The European approach would be better, but as with so many things in the US, it seems we just can't have it here, because the American approach, at least superficially, makes you sound more proud ('I don't have to waste time talking to women, I sleep with them immediately,' etc.)",t3_a0uz3,t1_c0fbx7y,False,1257350222,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fbyec,True,157,0,moscowramada,0,0,,,1426088998

c0fc02r,AskReddit,,True,5,"&gt; What's the difference between dating someone and being in a relationship with them?

This depends on the person. Seriousness of a relationship is a continuum between ""I just met you"" and ""We're married."" ""Dating"" usually refers to the region on that continuum between ""casual acquaintance"" and ""in a committed relationship"". Saying you're dating someone means you've indicated your desire to pursue a relationship, but (generally) that's it's still in its relatively early stages.

There's a subtle change, though. In the *past tense*, ""dated"" can be used to describe a relationship of almost any level of seriousness. While you're in a committed relationship with someone, most people *would* not say ""I'm dating X"" because it sounds like you're minimizing it.

After the relationship has ended, though, it's common to say, ""I dated X for two years"", I think just because that's easier than saying ""I was in a relationship with X for two years.""

&gt; How common is this thing?

All relationships travel through the continuum of seriousness, so in that sense it's common. If you're asking how common the *term* is, it's fading. ""Dating"" used to be a pretty formal part of the American courtship process. There was an entire etiquette around it, similar to Victorian morality.

After the sexual revolution, that entered a steep decline. The courtship process in America now is very informal, and probably doesn't look much different from any European country.

We just have a couple of leftover words from that earlier time that we've reappropriated. Their meaning is changed, and in many cases the use is still declining. (When I was a kid, we still talked about ""going steady"", but I think that term is pretty much dead now.)

&gt; Is it like there's a ""dating scene"" with some people playing the game and others not?

Yes. Singles bars and nightclubs have a large presence of single people who go there to meet other single people. I think most people would prefer to form relationships with people they already casually know, but your circle of friends may effectively limit that. The singles scene gives you a place to expand your pool of potential partners.

That certainly doesn't mean you can't make non-romantic friends there. Bars vary in where their scene is on the ""meat market for people to get laid"" -&gt; ""friendly open atmosphere where people just want a good time"" spectrum. People have different preferences for where they want to be on that line.

&gt; At what point can you finally stop putting up a show?

Who said anything about putting on a ""show""? I think trying to look your best with a new person is a pretty universal human trait, but most people seem to think being yourself (but the best version of yourself) is the winning strategy.",t3_a0uz3,t3_a0uz3,False,1257351998,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fc02r,False,5,0,munificent,0,0,,,1426089016

Grew up in a military family, raised pretty Christian-Conservative, Grandfather was a Baptist preacher in Georgia. Moved to Belgium at 6 years old, lived in Europe until age 11. Was there when the Berlin wall came down, and have a big piece of it we knocked off with a sledgehammer. Moved to Alabama, then Colorado where I finished high School. I joined the Marines. Did all the basic bootcamp/SOI/MOS into Security forces. I was supposed to guard subs in Georgia, but fortunately got denied and stationed in Spain. Got to spend two years in Spain where I went on several NATO training ops, living in downtown London for two months, Guarded ships in the Med and Trained military forces in Africa. Moved to Hawaii, then deployed to Iraq. Got back, got selected for an officer program and now I'm going to college, making over $50K a year, am 26 and loving life.

Look at any recent protest. Or worse, look at the Italian G8 arrests. I bet you don't even know what I'm talking about. Put it this way...what happened in Iran was nothing on this. In Iran the police tackled violent protesters in the street, as happens in the west in similar situations. In Italy they stormed their homes and beat the crap out of every single person. 

&gt; tortue rape 

Abu Graib? Rape was a **formal** torture technique. The released photos were actually the least shocking images. Forced ""circle jerks"" was one technique, as was raping the young children of those being interviewed (in front of them of course). There is video tape of this by the way.

And US prison rape is a ongoing concern. Rape is common place in your prisons. In Iran it was a **single** case, and the perpetrators were fired &amp; criminally charged. In the US they would get paid leave, or promoted.

&gt; and execution of student demonstrators 

No students were executed.

Your own perception of what's going on has been deliberately cultivated by this propaganda.

c0fc466,AskReddit,,True,39,"You have this former European redditor's voice in agreement!

I was just as puzzled as OP is when I first arrived in the US. Having had many a date now and gone from dating to getting married I still have questions. Here is what I learned though: a date is either a person or an occasion where you do something fun in a couple-sort-of-way. When you ask a person out as your date, it can be for an organized social event like a prom (that's another good [AskAmericanReddit](http://reddit.com/r/AskAmericanReddit) subject!) or party, or it can be just for the two of you to see whether you like each other. Some folks (mostly guys) will indeed have a sexual affair in mind when asking someone out and it is generally understood that there is a tad more than an interest in friendship, at least with the second form of ""date"".

""Dating"" someone specific is used interchangeably with ""going steady"" or being girlfriend/boyfriend. The level of commitment to the relationship may vary though. Once you start talking about a real committed relationship, the terms ""partner"" or even ""fiance(e)"" are used, the latter even without a proper engagement having taken place. On the other hand, ""dating"" in a more general way would refer to going on dates, possibly with many different people each time.

The modern era of internet dating sites has made the ""blind date"" a much more common thing where either or both parties really don't know a lot about each other. This used to previously be in the exclusive domain of professional or amateur match makers. Other extreme forms of dating include ""speed dating"" where you go to an organized event and pair up with potential future dates for a few minutes at a time to decide whether you will want to see them again.

There is a certain formalism to ""dating"" as the guy usually has to ask the girl out ""for a date"" and he would usually also pay any expenses. Depending on your age and tastes, a date can be anything from going to the movies to birdwatching in a park. A ""first date"" is often glamorized if the relationship actually happens, so there is a bit of pressure, unless you are a ""serial dater"" and don't care about a long term relationship. However, the ""dating scene"" usually involves crowds of single people visiting bars to hook up with someone. Again, it is often the guys who ""hit on"" the girls. Both terms have negative connotations.

All the confusing terms and customs aside, I found it much easier to meet women in the US than I did in Europe. And yes, sex just after a few dates, maybe even already after the first date does happen a lot. All US American prudery aside, promiscuous sex is very common here and for many (men and women alike) not completely associated with knowing one another very well first.

P.S. I'm not white. I'm a massive melting pot of European and Asian ancestry. On the surface I'm half white, half Filipino. If you look, just as far back as my grandparents (and I can trace part of my lineage to 1500s Germany) I'm Irish, English, German, Spanish, Malaysian, Chinese. The Philippines are like the mexico of asia. Spaniard colonists conquered and interbred with island natives, who immigrated from the Malaysian peninsula and the Chinese mainland.

I'm really not sure how that works but it's happened more than once. *shrug* Also amusing: I was born and raised in the south, culturally white.

Oh, you're referring to that new bubble that's about to burst in one or two years.  And the dollar is being tossed by China, Japan, and Europe.  Look at real economic figures, like real unemployment, not the rigged economy that will burst again.  

http://www.economywatch.com/economy-business-and-finance-news/real-us-unemployment-is-already-more-than-20-per-cent-27-10.html

One in 5 people are unemployed. The stock market is 'turning around,' but the real economy is not. And it can't because this country is in dept up to its ass.

Turn off the CNBC, the network that did not predict the crash last September/October, and come back to reality.  Job growth is still terrible.  The people becoming wealthier now are people that are already wealthy.  The top 1% has more economic wealth than the bottom 95%.  People that have money are making some off of companies that are coming back from almost zero dollars per share. The top banks are just building another bubble that will burst again.  Tons of banks are still failing.

Usually, during a major recession or depression, you will get deflation, as the prices of goods and services will drop with the ailing economy, naturally.  But we are seeing inflation, as the the dollar is becoming weaker while our economy is not recovering.  The word stagflation will be brought into the vernacular again like it was in the 70's under Carter.

To be fair, the jewish state probably should not have been created in the middle east. newfoundland was a viable option i would have supported. But were quite a few jews in 'israel', plus it was a 'sorry' for the holocaust. i really think that because of the creation of israel, islam in the middle east became much more radical. But imperialism is, or rather was a reality. The powerful exploit the weaker. It's a very small state and they *should* have stopped crying about it. I suspect that they wanted that land over newfoundland was because it was their 'homeland', and if any other location even in the 'west' had been their homeland, such as newfoundland, i'm sure we would have gladly handed it over to them. But it wasn't. They want 'israel' more. And the muslims cried about it. It's not like the jews turned the land into a backwards society though. As we all know, the quality of life is much much higher there.

Why not let Britain have a sharia state? Well it's a backwards ideology (yes, ideology, and way of life). If i lived in a backwards society where my basic needs could not be met, i would surely move -- if that was impossible, i think invaders would be great.

So i would support an islamic state next to britain (even without a holocaust/a 'land claim' in britain) given the following 4 conditions.

1. That they aren't anti-west.
2. They don't support child marriages, genital mutilation etc...
3. Britain is a backwards society where the state cannot ensure a decent quality of life.
4. The islamic state could ensure a significantly good quality of life, similar to that of western europe, canada, and the u.s today.

You either ask a new aquanitance girl for her number and a date, or you approach a female friend with a long-winded explaination that you have romantic feelings for her, and propose a ""date"".  You go out for an evening or two in which you enjoy eachother's company, and romantic things may happen (cuddling, kissing, sex). At first, it is usually assumed either party is free to accept offers for dates from other interested parties. At this stage yo are ""Non- Exclusively Dating"", ""Casually Seeing eachother"", or ""exploring a relationship"" After a few of these events (the length of time varies according to the personalities involved), there is a ""discussion"" of ""where this thing is headed"" - this usually sets the understanding that it is or isn't okay to continue to accept offers from other interested parties. At this point, you can safely say you are ""eclusively dating"", ""in a relationship"", or ""boyfriend/girlfriend"". 

My experiences in Europe suggest that people tend to ""hook up"" much sooner - they may meet on a night out and end up snogging or such affectionate behaviour. If this happens often enough with the same person, you somehow become a couple and are dating / together.

No. We do not deny it, we dispute that the majority of those killed were Hamas terrorists.

This is because they already did the same after the fake Jenin massacre, complete with international fact finding and imaginary mass graves.

&gt; RE: FIGHTING: and why did the Arabs start fighting? Because they were thrown off their land that's why.

They were not thrown off their land before they started fighting, except when the land was bought by the jews for ten times the price after which the arab tenants refused to vacate the property which they were previously renting from the landlors (it is no coincidence that one of these landlords was palestinian micro-Hitler Muhammad Amin al-Husseini).

Situation Update No. 23
On 04.11.2009 at 17:48 GMT+2

Eighty-six people have died in Ukraine from flu and respiratory infections, the health ministry said Wednesday, in an epidemic the World Health Organisation said could be largely due to the A(H1N1) virus. The ministry said that almost half a million cases of flu and acute respiratory infections had been recorded since mid-October in the country of 46 million, while 24,000 people have been hospitalised. Some 148,000 cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, it added. The epidemic is concentrated in the west of the country which has borders with four European Union states but a growing number of cases are being reported in the capital Kiev. ""As the pandemic virus has rapidly become the dominant influenza strain worldwide, it can be assumed that most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the H1N1 virus,"" the WHO said on Tuesday. Lyudmila Mukharska, Ukraine's deputy chief health officer, said the authorities had confirmed that five of the dead had died of the H1N1 virus. She vehemently denied rumours that the west of the country was suffering from an outbreak of plague, saying that it was ""H1N1 that is circulating in Ukraine"". The WHO has sent a team of nine experts to Ukraine to help the authorities with the situation. While the country is suffering from an above-average infection rate, many independent observers have accused Ukraine's squabbling politicians of seeking to profit from the situation ahead of January 17 presidential elections. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has personally overseen a delivery of anti-flu medicines in the middle of the night while pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko even called on NATO for help. ""Many questions remain to be answered,"" said the WHO. ""The outbreak in Ukraine may be indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in Eastern Europe.""",t3_a0pzi,t3_a0pzi,False,1257360892,t5_2qh4r,t1_c0fc937,False,3,0,Scutterbotch,0,0,,,1426089151

I am always interested in my own kind of visceral reaction.  I try to remain neutral until I get all the facts, but in any dispute, nonetheless, the guy who says, ""God wills it"" loses with me.

As an American, I support stopping all arms sales and foreign aid to Israel.  I support complete withdrawal from the region.  Israel doesn't deserve the special relationship it was with America...er, the American *TAXPAYER*.

I don't know that I'm anti-Israel but they can fuck off and fund their little authoritarian apartheid regime on their own.

It'd be interesting to see how Israel would fare without arms and money from other countries flowing in.

Their little lines and barricades don't interest me at all.  No matter where you live in the world, you have a right not to be kicked out of your own home, you have a right to freedom of speech, and movement, and all of those things.

I have had it with Americans putting up with explanations for the widespread disregard of the rights of Palestinians for reasons they would never accept in their own country.

As for the whiney bitch and moaning about a ""double standard"" those who support Israel claim we hold their government to, you're damn right: the only reason you're worth aiding is because you're a western style democracy, and you can damn well bet we hold, and ought to hold, those kinds of governments to a higher standard.

This is an enormous amount of comparative data, and it takes a few minutes to dig through it. But, it quickly becomes apparent that the US healthcare system, as compared with other OECD nations, is both more expensive (% of GDP spent on healthcare) and less effective (life expectancy, infant mortality). Also, fears of ""rationed"" medicine that one might expect from the ""socialized medicine"" that's practiced in the other 29 OECD countries don't appear, at least as measured by metrics such as doctors per capita or hospital beds per capita.  

The Wall Street Journal recently (past month?) ran a very concise article that boiled down the OECD data, and placed the US measures in the context of its peers. It clearly points out that the US healthcare system is far and away the most expensive (as in double the average) of the OECD countries, and yet is is below average in most measures of positive healthcare outcome.

On the link that you send me it says:


&gt;The Court of Justice is separate from the European Court of Human Rights.

&gt;All EU members are members of the Council of Europe and have signed the Convention on Human Rights. There are concerns about consistency in case law between the two courts. Hence the Court of Justice refers to the case-law of the Court of Human Rights and treats the Convention on Human Rights as though it was part of the EU's legal system. Even though its members have joined, the EU as a whole has not, as it does not have competence to do so under current treaties. However, EU institutions are bound under article 6 of the EU treaty to respect human rights under the Convention. **Furthermore, if the Treaty of Lisbon becomes ratified, the EU is expected to sign the Convention. This would make the Court of Justice bound by the judicial precedents of the Court of Human Rights and thus be subject to its human rights law; this would resolve the issue of conflicting case law.**

Maybe you didn't quite understand that, but let me explain it to you...it means the following:

Now, that the treaty of Lisbon is ratified, and the it will come into force on December 1st, then EU as a whole will have to sign the Convention as it will be annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon (which basically means it is part of the treaty), and thus human rights things will be treated under EU law, which indeed supersedes national law.

As for your other question, well, I am partial to Eindhoven. It may not be the prettiest school (quite a few buildings are rather outdated) or even the prettiest city (though there is so much construction going on and they're building a lot of cool things), but I do think it has the best atmosphere. I think the TU/e and Eindhoven are no-nonsense, fun places to be. I think Delft tends to be a little more ""stuck-up"" and look down upon us, since they're older and bigger than us. I think it's a different atmosphere in that part of the country, too. Kind of a big city vs. somewhat more rural area, though Eindhoven isn't a small city. It's hard to explain, I guess.

I chose Eindhoven, because the architecture department is (supposed to be) better. I don't know if this is true for engineering. All I know about engineering is that you really really really shouldn't go for the women, though that's true in any engineering school.

&gt;Adolf Eichmann was, of course, in no way a banal bureaucrat: He just portrayed himself as one while on trial for his life. Eichmann was a vicious and loathsome Jew-hater and -hunter who, among other things, personally intervened after the war was effectively lost, to insist on and ensure the mass murder of the last intact Jewish group in Europe, those of Hungary. So the phrase was wrong in its origin, as applied to Eichmann...

What? How does that conclusion follow from those premises? ""Eichmann was a vicious Jew-hater; therefore, he couldn't be evil in a banal way.""  It's precisely the fact that his vicious hatred of Jews manifested itself in carefully crafted memos that makes it ""banal.""

And then there is the absurd claim that one can't rely on Nazi-historians for anything of value. As if music composed by Wagner must be awful because of his past.  But, we are told, Arendt ""internalized"" these Nazi sources and made them her own; while it's fun to speculate about what people did and did not internalize, this sort of psychoanalysis as fact is horseshit.

And then of course there is the usual bitching about Heidegger. Much of these criticisms are addressed by the man himself in his interview with [Der Spiegel](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~other1/Heidegger%20Der%20Spiegel.pdf).

You're wrong. Jews lived UNDERNEATH Muslims as *dhimmis* for centuries, as second class citizens who were subjugated, extorted with taxes for being non-believers, forbidden to ride horses, etc. . Jews have lived as second class citizens - everywhere - for almost 2000 year with disastrous consequences.

Now we have a thriving, world-class state of our own in our native land - and the means to defend ourselves -  and that angers Muslims who are still stuck in the 7th century and have a primitive culture of honor-shame that is focused on revenge. 

Israel will be harassed by Islamists no matter what its size, no matter how many territorial or political concessions it makes. The Islamist Jihad (a.k.a. Palestinian) movement is implacable.  If Israel agreed to take up a space 1/10th of the tiny scrap it has today, Muslims would *still* howl and complain and launch rockets.  The existence of a technologically / socially advanced state will always shame and anger Muslim Arabs - and arouse hostile envy. 

You can quote some contradictory Islamic  text all you want to - but it still doesn't change the facts about the Religion of Violence and its aims. You don't understand much about the Jews and why Zionism exist and why they are in Israel today (a clue: most of them aren't there by choice... and were driven from their homes in the Middle East and Europe by unspeakable antisemitism, genocide or ethnic cleansing)  - nor about the Muslims and Islam - who have no collective aspirations or uniting cause other than to destroy the Jews.

c0fcm6r,AskReddit,,True,2,"&gt; seeing someone on the bus for 3*15 minutes can also work.

Silly Europeans and your public transportation.  Don't you know we Americans drive everywhere?  That must be why dating is so popular here.  ;)

But seriously, I wonder if cars are part of the difference.  Getting around everywhere by car is the American Way, but it also makes you more isolated in a lot of ways not just because you don't sit next to someone on the bus, but also because you tend to live farther away from everything, and not have neighborhood friends, etc.  In the end this doesn't necessarily make your social network smaller, but it makes it a lot more spread out.

Also, personally, I don't know of associations or activity-based clubs where people stay for most of their lives.  Can you give some examples of that sort of thing?  Maybe it's a European thing, or maybe it's just me.

All I know is that Americans/Canadians have most of these same things -- moving to the city, congregating in bars and clubs, friends from various activities, etc.  Many people do make friends through those activities, or through friends of friends, but for many people it isn't a big enough network so they resort to going outside the circle of friends and friends of friends and looking for people for the specific purpose of dating.

I wonder if this is because:

1. European social networks are bigger (unlikely, I think)
2. Europeans don't have a fall-back plan, so they ""work"" their networks harder (possible)
3. Europeans don't have a fall-back plan so they are less choosy (possible)
4. Europeans don't have a fall-back plan, but are less concerned if things don't work out in the end (possible)

c0fcmio,AskAmericanReddit,,True,2,"I think there's a pretty wide range of how Americans feel about America, honestly.  I'd like to say the younger generations see our place in the world a bit more clearly, but the ""America is the only nation that matters"" type of attitude is passed on in much the same way that religion is passed on I guess.  You've got the fierce conservatives on one end, and the extreme liberals on the other (short of the anti-America Americans who join terrorist and extremist groups, but there are only a handful of them), so I don't think you can really break it down to ""Americans think that..."".  

Personally, I do feel like America has contributed a lot on all fronts (especially in terms computer technology), and we should as such a large and populous nation. 
I feel that we have a long way to go in terms of living more in tune with our environment, but we are miles ahead of some other parts of the world.
I also feel that being aware of our power, as a nation and as a global force, that stepping in to help sort out conflict in other parts of the globe are warranted.  But I also feel that it's been taken too far, and in some cases the motives are more self serving than the public is lead to believe.  

As far as Obama goes, I said this from the day he got elected: I do not envy that man the position he's in.   He took over the nation at one of the roughest times to do so, and to try to turn it around on all fronts is a staggering thought.  Iraq, Afghanistan, the economy, health-care, equal rights, and all the other issues, not to mention trying to improve America's fit with the rest of the world.  People are as quick to judge as they are to hope; patience is not easy.  He may be the president, but he's not the whole government, and bodies that large take time to work and change no matter who is at the helm. 

There's also the fact that, for better or for worse, America is separated from most other nations, physically, and it's pretty big.  As an American, you're simply unlikely to meet many foreigners outside of tourist spots.  Seeing someone speaking French or German is quite the novelty.  I'd expect that with the much smaller countries in Europe, and the ease of travel between them, people tend to see themselves more as members of a broader community.  As I understand it, patriotism in Europe went through the same transition as communication and transportation became more viable.  In early America, most of the devout patriots were loyal to their state before their country.  As America became more connected, it became more cohesive as well.

I'm not sure if this really addresses your questions though.  Probably not, heh.  I'd need a lot of effective polling data to give you to give you a fair and adequate answer.  And as some have said, the overall opinion you get on reddit may be skewed from the American median.  I can comfortably say American patriotism is a little too blind here, but in all honesty I would be very careful who I said that to in person.* I'm glad to be an American, but I'd probably I'd be just as happy as a Canadian.  Australians pay too much for video games though.

c0fcn4t,AskAmericanReddit,,True,2,"&gt; Do you think it is reasonable to suggest that the Americans see the US as either exceptional in its contributions to the world or that its contributions are generally more advanced?

I would suppose like any country, there is always an interest in highlighting areas where the US excels. There is the theory of [American Exceptionalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism), which is more specific than taking pride in American achievements, but it is very much associated with the right side of the US political spectrum.

&gt; Also do Americans generally see the pushing of US national interests (like pushing for privatization globally, democracy in certain regions and things like intellectual property laws) as an altruistic act intended to benefit both the US and the recipient?

It is very hard to talk about what Americans ""generally"" think on any issue. There are 300 million of us after all. What's more, the issues that you identify as our ""national interests"" are not really in the forefront for most Americans. Many people won't have an opinion on them at all. Our national debate is much more focused on domestic issues. To the extent that people discuss foreign policy, it's usually about the wars and terrorism.

I think most people recognize and believe that democracy is a good thing, but pushing for it like Bush did has been thoroughly discredited. International intellectual property laws get *no* airtime whatsoever.

&gt; I note that here in the UK there are already rather a lot of people looking at the Obama administration and wondering whether many of the changes we expected will actually arrive and feel somewhat let down by a lack of sweeping action on Obamas part...

That opinion is shared by many on the political left here as well. Personally, I think he's not going as far as some would like, but he's leagues better than Bush and better than McCain would have been. The right-wing already hates him for what little he's trying to do. Adopting a sort of European position on many issues is politically infeasible for now. Hopefully, the country will gradually move to where it needs to be.",t3_a1015,t1_c0fcktq,False,1257375904,t5_2rbq0,t1_c0fcn4t,True,2,0,sn0re,0,0,,,1426089351
c0fcn6b,AskAmericanReddit,,True,2,"No problem, and thanks for asking.

I would say most reasonable Americans believe her contributions are exceptional in their number and frequency.  We have such a big population, many who get university education, and so much damn wealth.  This alone allows us to contribute greatly.  But as far as the more advanced part goes... I think we are watching other nations fly by.  Reasonable Americans are often asking themselves what are we the best at?  We do everything, but what are we better than everyone at?  (Personally I think we have the best research universities and the best constitution.)  

I think nobody here in the U.S. fully believes U.S. national interests are altruistic.  As a nation we know we have power, and we want to keep it.  Usually this conversation leads to the debate about globalism.  People defending U.S. national interests will say that every country does it and point to the so called benefits it brings to developing countries.  Many are against it.  But no one reasonable believes it is just for the good of both parties.

Note:  The above two paragraphs must be read with the knowledge that many people here aren't ""reasonable"" in my view.  That is, they are blinded by patriotism and cling to traditions long past and refute any sentiment other than ""America is the best!"".  These are the people who stood by Bush, listen to Hannity, and support Palin. It is unclear how many of these people are here, but they are here, and they are loud. 

I'm very optimistic about what Obama will do.  But this optimism comes with the knowledge that our political system (separation of powers) is designed to make political change difficult and slow.  We are generally not susceptible to quick and drastic change (wars excluded).  This also means we drag our feet to achieve needed things (civil rights).  Obama wants to do many things but he has to play within our system, work with congress and popularity, and be very smooth if he wants to get re-elected.  Obama must make our country do a 180 in many respects.  Europeans, and anyone else paying attention, should know that Obama won't push a ton of new policy through, but he can lead us in a better direction.  The more telling person will be whoever comes after Obama.  That person will have a much better opportunity to implement actual political change, not just ideology.

c0fcnn0,worldnews,,True,1,"&gt; By that definition I and a group of people have every right to go into the Rocky Mountains and establish a country on any land that isn't settled.

That would be true if there was no sovereign nation or private persons that claimed it as its own sovereign soil or property, for the simple reason that no one would be there to stop you.

&gt; In fact by your analogy Palestinians have the right to take any land not individually settled in Israel and make a country, but that will never happen because you and everyone else who believes this bullshit are giant hypocrites and liars.

No, not *in* Israel. Within West Bank and Gaza, on the territories nominally thought to comprise the would be palestinian state, they certainly may - and most certainly do.

&gt; The Palestinians were colonized by the Ottomans and were promised independence by the British if they fought the Ottomans and then promptly imperialized by the British.

That's [simply not true](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths2/Israelsroots.html#a12). And [it wasn't the independent palestinian nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt) they were trying to create.

&gt; They never gave permission to European Jews to settle their land just like Algerians never gave permission to Europeans to settle their land and no one questions whether that was wrong because Algeria didn't have a seat at the League of Nations at the time or the UN later.

Zionists did not intend to harm the arab population and certainly did not see any wrong in returning to the ancestral lands at times of the worst destruction of jewish people. 

&gt; There wasn't even an official definition of genocide until the Holocaust, but that doesn't mean the Armenian genocide was not a genocide. Oh oops that's what Israel actually claims.

We're simply whoring for political relations with Turkey, because we *really* want to be friends with muslims. Turkey is going towards diplomatic relations with the armenians, and when it does so then Israel's stance will be [adjusted accordingly](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/968844.html). Dirty politics.

&gt; The British conquered land from another imperialist power in war and decided to impose on that population the settlement of people that Europeans were too racist to accept in their own lands at the time.

Congratulations, you get a cookie to figure out who was a shitty manager and a loaded imperialist.

&gt; European Jews for all the horrible persecution they suffered at the hands of European Christians still felt free to see Palestinians, or Arabs, or whatever you want to believe them to be as inferior.

They did? Cause in actual recorded history it seems that this wasn't the case. Jewish presence even made arabs glad, because jews brought with themselves money, agriculture and other nice things.

&gt; The fact that you consider Palestine as simply ""Arab"" 

And what is it, not ""Arab""? 

&gt; ""Israeli"" identity hasn't even existed for a century and yet people don't pretend it's not real.

Israeli identity is a fact. Palestinian identity, today, is also a fact, although it emerged recently and hardly based on ancient past, which is why I support two state solution.

&gt; While what the particular Jews who settled in Palestine did to the Palestinians was wrong

I want to know what is it exactly that they did to them that was so wrong. I am talking about the period before the arab attacks on jews (think 1910). 

&gt; However, Israelis aren't excused to whitewash history and deny reality because then they'll just continue persecuting the Palestinians and prove themselves to be the biggest hypocrites in history.

Here's your problem: you don't read books.

It's a tough neighborhood where violence is customary, communication is brutal and black-and-white, and only the strong survive.  

I can say, that Israel treats its sworn enemies more fairly than any other regime in the region. It is a moral and rational culture that values human life and telling the truth, and it is sincerely more interested in survival and improving the quality of its own future than in getting revenge or attacking the neighboring tribe .

Critics and antisemites like to apply a Westernized ""Swiss country club"" double standard of conduct to Israel in a brutal, extreme backwater Islamist region where rationality, co-existence, discussion, and ""live and let live"" are alien concepts that do not apply... and Israels enemies don't even pretend to adhere to. 

Israel has zero interested in destroying Islam. Islam is obsessed with destroying Israel. It's the sole uniting cause, the only thing the warring tribes and dictators have in common is Israel - the perfect scapegoat to take the attention on the real source of discontent.

A whole life is exaggerated, but decades is not unusual. Around here, there are concert band groups, all kinds of sports clubs (occasionally someone stays too long and gets a heart attack, so that one really spent his life there), general activity groups (originally catholic), artistic courses, carnival groups, local history groups, ecological groups, local political parties, social work volunteers... Extended family gatherings used to happen typically for weddings, communions at 6 &amp; 12, burials etc. but that's declining. All in all, 190 semi-public groups for a group of villages totaling 15000 people.

Taking myself as example, I've been in a youth movement since I was ten. I'm 28 now, and still maintaining a bit of activity. A guy I know from there I went on holiday with. I also see him when I take my drawing course in the nearby town (10 km). That town happens to be the place where the local youth bars are, and when I go there I see several other people from the same youth movement, among which a guy who studied the same as me at university (different city than me though), who knows a girl I met on the internet, who knows a girl I met at the teacher's course last year. She happens to know another girl because their friends are romantically involved, and that girl (whose dad was a teacher at my school) lives in the same village two streets away.

It would have been much harder to get acquainted to these people if they didn't knew each other, and I get news about them from various sources, so it's easier to keep up. The networks also include people I otherwise wouldn't bother to keep contact with just for their personality: that's good to broaden my horizon.

One of the reasons that people are less likely to seek partners further away is that one of both has to leave their local network then.

So I would conclude with a combination of 1 &amp; 2 and the spatial organization from a pre-car era: all these networks overlap, making them less costly to maintain, allowing more and deeper relations for the same effort.

c0fcr9r,philosophy,,True,6,"&gt; The crusades can't be blamed on religion, since the roman church is just a pawn

There were many causes of the crusades. Recent stability in Europe leaving a surplus of armed people with no wars to fight, sitting around picking fights with themselves and causing problems. The same leaving a surplus of nobles with no land, who believed there was land for them to take in the east. The decline of Byzantium and the pressure they put on the west to help them. The need to halt Muslim expansion. Empowered mercantile classes applying pressure to open eastern trade routes.. etc. I've always assumed it to be obvious that wars aren't caused by the one event or cause that people usually believe they are caused by. They're usually the culmination of decades of combinatorial and incremental pressures. They're like a pressure valves for evolving power struggles and expansion.

c0fcv2u,AskReddit,,True,13,"My mother is actually getting her Ph.D. on Dating (she's an Italian immigrant). She has done a exhaustive amount of research from interviewing Latinos, Europeans, Blacks, Whiteys, to reading ""Dating for Dummies,"" and even going on dating websites (e.g. eHarmony etcetera). Without going into too much detail (she has a book she's coming out with and I don't want her to kill me) it boils down to this.

Euros, you know how the culture of the U.S. is the almighty dollar and business right? Well let's move from there. Business is the culture, it seeps in all facets of American life including, you guessed it, romance. 

*As I go into detail describing the process, odds are if you are American you will be thinking ""well, duh,"" and if you are anything but American you will be saying ""WTF???""*

So, what is dating? Dating is an American phenomenon in the realm of romance. In other words, business-romance.

Dating is a cultural tool structuring the process of romance from first meeting them to sleeping with them. A consenting newly-met pair of people (who may or may not have previously known each other) agree to meet at a place and time with an activity. 

Generally it goes something like this: 
Two people meet. Either through a friend, maybe bump into each other, whatever. One asks,
""Hey, wanna go catch a movie some time?"" To which the other may respond,
""Sure! When do you want to go?""
""How about I pick you up at 8 on Tuesday?""

The date will serve, in rough terms, as an appointment for a mutual analysis. While in conversation, both parties present themselves in the best light, showing off humor, previous achievements, goals, and status. If there is a meal or movie involved, the man will pay. The reason the man pays is because although not guaranteed, he is trying to present himself in best light to get laid at the end of the night.
Supposing all goes well (no major pitfalls in conversation, mutual content feeling) at the end of the night one person will drop the other off at which there is incredible tension for the man to ""make a move."" The tension arises for two reasons 1) It is somewhat expected that either you will have a kiss or stay the night and 2) There is the chance that one party is interested, and the other is not, so there are feelings of risk and rejection in both parties' minds. 

This whole exchange is also wrought with ""rules"" (not written in stone, but culturally agreed upon) of things you should and should not do. Generally it is frowned upon for women to kiss or sleep with a person on a first date. However, this may be okay on the 3rd or 4th. In other words, while the consenting party of two is in the process of ""dating,"" they will go on dates, generally once a week, until either they become boyfriend/girlfriend (exclusive), they decide they want nothing to do with each other (stop dating), or they become casually sexual (keep dating, may or may not be exclusive). 

I would like to add that this is a generalized view of dating, and that contemporary dating has some different rules. However, it remains dominantly popular as THE way to bridge the gap between meeting someone and establish a relationship with/obtaining sex from them. These are the ultimate goals and there is a lot more which I could not go over as it is deeply rooted in the culture, and thus, has many layers. Almost all romantic relationships begin this way in the States.

**TL;DR; Guy meets girl, asks her to go out to dinner. Guy brags about his beamer and his job, makes her laugh. Guy pays for dinner. Guy drops her off and either gets nothing, gets a second date, gets a kiss, or gets laid.

* That's a date = We have agreed to meet up for an event or a meeting.
* We have gone on some dates = We are just getting to know each other.

* We go on dates = We go out on occasion and it might be or might not be a sexual relationship.
* Would you like to go out on a date? = Are you interested in meeting me in a public place so we can talk and get to know each other? 

You rarely will you say ""let's go on a date?"" but instead you’ll say ""would you like to go to the movies/bar/concert/what ever tonight?""


This is where question like “how long have you been dating”, “is it a serious relationship”, and “have you sealed the deal” (have you had sex with her/him yet) come in so you can understand what the person means by what they are saying. You often need to ask ""are you two boyfriend/girlfriend"" or just friends?

c0fd1k8,AskReddit,,True,1,"I started drinking when I was 14, and a few years later I still enjoy it. I was surprised to find that drinking is vastly different in Europe than it is in the US. Back home there is alot less stigma about drinking, and I wouldn't really hear comments about people not drinking. Everyone does it and its easy to drink if you're underage. This is not meant as justification, only as background. I try to analyze critically my actions, and when it comes to drinking I oftenm found it hard to understand why I did it, but I have come down to realize I enjoy being drunk. Its definetly not a state I would like to live in constantly, but I do enjoy being completely and utter wasted from time to time. 
I find I learn quite a bit from myself from being ""mentaly imparied"" for a while, which is the same reason I try other drugs when I can and when I feel its safe (like pot from Holland or from friends I trust). I actually feel trying drugs grants me experiences I both enjoy and learn from.

About the social lubricant, I don't really drink to approach girls, I actually rather go out with my friends when I go drinking, mostly because I know I'm going to suck at picking up girls when I'm drinking. Also, I have never felt loss of control due to alcohol. I honestly think my judgement on relevant issues is the same, even if I am obviously way over the top and going to puke shortly.

c0fd2s0,Economics,,True,2,"&gt; I mean that these programs, both in practice and in principle, are bringing us closer to the ""abyss"". I explained why each program is doing so.

Many things have both negative and positive effects. Obviously, the fact that these programs somewhat temper large differences in spending disparity help prevent the economy from falling apart.

Would you disagree with this statement apparently from [Citigroup](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=389&amp;topic_id=6694962&amp;mesg_id=6694962)? ""Spending by the uber-rich overwhelms that of the average consumer... The United States is one of the plutonomy countries countries whose economies are powered by a relatively small number of rich people... In plutonomies the rich absorb a disproportionate chunk of the economy and have a massive impact on reported aggregate numbers like savings rates, current account deficits, consumption levels, etc.""

Or how about this from the [WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2007/01/08/plutonomics/)? *The best way for companies and businesspeople to survive in Plutonomies, Kapur implies, is to disregard the “mass” consumer and focus on the increasingly rich market of the rich. A tough message — but one worth considering.*

&gt; Now, I can tell you right now that the productivity of Ford would plummet down to nothing, maybe one car a year at most.

Obviously since you like to surround yourself with pro-capitalist propanda, you would never hear about things that refute your illusions. Watch this documentary: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-take/

When the employees took over Zanón, they lowered prices to 60% of pre-democratic levels, maintained the same pay, and hired more people.

&gt; Your society will create more poor people because your society would be less productive.

Empty claim. What is your reasoning for believing this?

&gt; The consumer decides.

Dude, reread the question: ""who would judge who within a company deserves how much wealth"" - consumers only decide which company get their business, not whether the CEO gets more money or the janitors get more money.

&gt; The only rightful owners of the products a company produces are the company owners

They only have this ""right"" if others voluntarily agree with their claim to ""their property"".  If others do not agree, then their property claim is not based on consent.

&gt; I am not doubting that government and business can benefit each other via bribes, anti-competitive regulations, corruption, subsidies, privileges, and everything else that is endemic to the real world US economy and other economies like in Asia and in Europe.

So would you oppose control of the mass media by the wealthy? Would you oppose campaign contributions? Lobbyists? Think tanks?  Like those other examples, ownership of the media itself isn't anything scary by itself, but when all those are combined with a society in which some people have much more economic power than others, then there is no way your ""anarcho""-capitalist society can prevent oppression.

&gt; Where they would have to enforce the new employee's claims over the means of production.

They don't. The employees are just controlling themselves. They are not controlling others.

&gt; What if these new employee owners decide to hire wage laborers, and these wage laborers want to take over the old employee owners?

Well, if you imagine the society as being composed almost entirely of anarcho-syndicalists, then you might consider everyone to be the government. What they would to is protect the right of people to control what they are using to produce things.  Thus there isn't even a concept of ""hiring wage laborers"" - new employees just show up and start using things.

Remember, this is also a post-capitalist society where people don't even need to work to survive. If these new employees are showing up to produce things, it is because they are volunteering, not because they are forced by the threat of starvation / death to work.  Why would they volunteer to work if they could just get things for free?  Again, I refer you back to the redesign of the incentive and advertising system - in which the work itself is advertised as the reward - in other words, these activities are advertised as play instead of work.

&gt; the employees would be initiating physical force against the owners, and would hence be violating the owner's property rights.

Yes, I know capitalist ""libertarians"" confuse their bodies with inanimate objects. If somone attacks your body, then I agree you are justified in defending yourself. If someone is using a thing that is not a part of your body, then you are not defending yourself when you attack them - in fact, it is you who is initiating physical force.

The difference between right-wing ""anarchists"" and leftists can be easily summed up by what Henry Edward Manning wrote: ""Necessity had no law, and a starving man had a natural right to his neighbour's bread. Before the natural right to live, all human laws must give way.""

If we had been fighting, then we would deserve more credit than Russia, but we weren't.  Our economic aid alone was not as much of a contribution as Russia's body count.  Counter factual speculation about ""what if"" we had been invaded has nothing to do with what happened.

Second part, actually we went through Africa first, which is nowhere near Germany or France actually.  Then we went to Italy, then Germany.  Russia held of Germany by itself during this period.

Finally, I was not being sour about the US joining late.  It was probably very wise to avoid bearing the brunt of the fighting.  By avoiding all those casualties we didn't prevent them, we just shifted them to Russia, who bore the brunt of the war and fought off the majority of German offensive, meaning they deserve a large share of credit for winning the war.

That doesn't mean I hate the US or Britain, but give credit where credit is due, without Stalin's crazy dictatorial communist ass we wouldn't have a Europe to go on vacation to.

c0fd6rb,technology,,True,1,"&gt;It is true that you can sweep the mouse to the corner, but why the lower right corner?

It is easy to move the cursor to a corner.  The start menu is in the bottom left hand corner.  If a window is maximized the close button is in the top right hand corner and the system menu is in the top left hand corner.    That left the bottom right as the only unused corner.  Short of changing the UI it seemed rational to me.

&gt;UI designers and ergonomics studies generally agree that it is easier to move the mouse up (forward).

Call me ignorant, but I've never heard that it was easier to move up.  Unless the cable snags on something my intuition would tell me the opposite (ie. it is easier to bring something towards you than away from you.)  I would be interested in reading said studies.

&gt;This is why Apple originally put their toolbar commands at the top of the screen.

Going with a universal toolbar as opposed to an application specific dictates that the toolbar ought to be on the edge of the screen so as that one can't overshoot the menubar.  Which edge one goes with is rather arbitrary, but the top makes would tend to be closer to what one would be working on in a text documents because in most European languages one writes left to right, top to bottom.  Hence, Fitt's law would dictate that the top would make the most sense for your commonly used menu.  If we wrote from bottom to top, Fitt's law would dictate that the bottom on the screen would make more sense since it would be closer to where you are working most of the time.

Regardless of whether there is any substance to the easier to move up claim, there is a logical reason for the menubar to be at the top that has nothing to do with your proposed reason.",t3_a13kx,t1_c0fd4ri,False,1257399947,t5_2qh16,t1_c0fd6rb,False,1,0,SAugsburger,0,0,,,1426089696

c0fd8px,worldnews,,True,1,"Dude. Look, man, we Jews understand it's not all black and white. That we're not all perfect and that the Arabs aren't  all wrong and they have some valid points and claims. We understand that this situation is messed up, we have compassion that many Arabs lost their homes and were treated like garbage by the other states who started the war, but  many millions more of us lost our homes, mothers, fathers and kids in a lot more countries... and we're trying trying to survive in a very messed up situation. We got genocided out of our European and Middle Eastern ""settlements"" so we returned home to the only place we could get into. The UN, US and UK strongly encouraged us to go to Israel rather than have masses of Jewish survivors coming to their countries. We were thinking that we could some be generous and fair and democratic enough and equally co-exist with the Arabs who were a majority, but not the owners, governors or sole ethnic group in the Holy Land.  We thought we could return to our home after thousands of years of exile, and help improve it and enrich it and share it - and somehow be accepted. But we were wrong, the Arabs would rather die than share with Jews - who are culturally very different and no so compatible with Islamic values.

Palestinain Arabs are human, not cockroaches,  but they have been mercilessly exploited by other Arabs for political purposes, and they've been indoctrinated with intense hatred from birth,  and they are rather poor at nation building / planning. They have never had a state before, and have no frame of reference for a democracy or consensus. It's not their fault, but they are conditioned to accept the legitimacy of thugs like Arafat or  Hamas siezing power and deciding all the issues of life and death. Arabs believe it is ALWAYS honorable to fight no matter how self-defeating and fruitless ,and ALWAYS shameful to negotiate or compromise with an enemy no matter how pragmatic and beneficial it could be. They are proud warriors and conquerors and that is a core point of their culture. 

They have been offered land to build a state on from DAY one, and the offer has been extended to them many times since then with the utmost sincerity... but they have refused it every time...  predictably. 

 They can have a state if they aren't going to use it as an Iranian arms depot and launching pad for terrorist attacks on Israel, like they did in Gaza. If they are serious about peace, Israel is reasonable and willing to compromise &amp; share. It's not black or white for us - we are not trying to destroy Islam, kill the Palestinian Arabs, or claiming that we're the ONLY people who have the right to live in the area.

 If the Pals are going to turn it into a full-fledged terrorist state... with no economy or national ambition other than to start a more intense war with ISrael.. then it would be suicide (for both parties)  to give them control of the land so it can be used to create more fruitless and depressing war.

Er, no.  You didn't.  The remainder of your previous post reads:
""The only reason it is not much more so already is because every time is was tried, most member states refused to replace or duplicate NATO.""

This isn't the point I was making.  Under Lisbon, the EU can make its own common foreign and defence policy, provided that it doesn't conflict with any NATO commitments, which will have primacy.  So, by definition, by the wording of the constitution, the EU simply cannot have a ""strong military policy free from NATO"".

This is not to say that the EU has to seek approval for NATO for actions in Georgia or the Congo.  If NATO hasn't already secured commitments from its members in relation to any situation, then the EU is free to do what it likes - although the realpolitik will still mean that some of the most influential countries in the EU will still not agree to any policy which will embarrass or antagonise the US.

Where NATO already has a policy, then the EU's hands are tied.  We simply cannot adopt a policy or initiate an action which conflicts with NATO's.

It is simply wrong to pretend that Lisbon allows us an independent foreign and defence policy.  It specifically prevents it - giving NATO a few namechecks in the treaties just to be absolutely certain that there is no wiggle room on this.

""Don't be so literal with a Constitution, actual policies will always prevail""
Excuse me?  A constitution sets out the framework within which policies may be drafted and accepted.  That is what it does. If a policy conflicts with the constitution, then the policy cannot stand.

""And your own interpretation so far has been mostly wrong by being so disconnected from reality and history.""
You haven't shown anything of the sort.  I haven't presented any analyss of history - there isn't any history of the post-Lisbon EU yet.  My analysis is, however, firmly based in reality.

All timed to take place during the holiday season while the public is distracted.

Stubblebine III](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/THE_FOUNDATION/Events/codex-moderngeneral.html) (also check out [his Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Stubblebine)) who was the commanding general of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984. 

This guy is also pushing the NWO's New Age religion cult.

He says he ""passionately believes the First Earth Battalion doctrine that **every human being alive was capable of performing supernatural miracles**...""

""Since ""Earthkind"" has grown from pack to village, to tribe, to territory, and then to nation, LtCol Channon **envisions going from nation to planet next, and thereby declares the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance to the planet**. Making the planet whole requires the ethical use of force based on the collective conscience. Therefore Channon believes the Army can be the principal moral ethical basis on which things politics can **harmonize in the name of the Earth.**""

""[The First Earth Battalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Earth_Battalion) was the name proposed by Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Jim Channon, an American soldier who had seen service in Vietnam, for his **idea of a new U.S. military to be organized along New Age lines.**""

""Service members of the First Earth Battalion would practice meditation, use yogic cat stretches and primal screams to attain battle-readiness, and use tui na or shiatsu as battlefield first aid. First Earth Battalion trainees would learn to fast for a week drinking only juice and then eat only nuts and grains for a month. They would be able to: fall in love with everyone, **realize the different paths of spirit, perceive the auras of living organisms**, organize a tree plant with kids, **attain the power to pass through objects such as walls (teleportation), bend metal by using the power of the mind (psychokinesis), walk on fire, operate based on spirit communications (mediumship)**, become a peacemaker, **actually change a violent pattern in the world (Maharishi Effect), calculate faster than a computer, control their heart rate—including making it stop—with no ill effects, intuit information from the past (retrocognition) or future (precognition)**, have out-of-body experiences, live off nature for twenty days, be 90%+ a vegetarian, have the ability to massage and cleanse the colon, stop using mindless cliches, stay out alone at night, and be able to intuit other people's thoughts and feelings (telepathy). LtCol Channon coined the term ""warrior monk"" for these new service members of the First Earth Battalion, which is anyone who has the presence, service and dedication of a monk and the absolute skill and precision of a warrior. The warrior monk will learn different self-defense systems of martial arts (such as taiji, aikido, etc.) based on using the force of their attackers against themselves. To alleviate negative stressors and promote healing in self and others, the warrior monk will employ a number of techniques like relaxation, visualization, qigong and reiki to help strengthen and improve the mind/body connection with spirit.""

We had social security numbers, bank account numbers, banking verbal passwords, affairs in the act, inter-office sex talk, spouses calling in getting really dirty for a quick lunch meet up, scheduling a doctor's appointment for ""that rash I got in Cancun"" was a classic one because of the description given in such detail to the doctor's secretary. We even called the feds on a guy trying to contract a hit on his wife. You name it, we probably heard it with the hundreds of employees continuously talking. The IT guys usually cherry-picked the good conversations for me to listen to. Conversations were randomly selected, and once something juicy was found, they'd keep listening to that person's calls for more stuff.

On top of that, as a programmer for the site, I had direct access to literally hundreds of thousands of credit cards in the database. A feature I was tasked to deliver when I first got there was reverse connecting credit card purchases to travel in a nice, clean read-out for the execs. That way they can plug in some information and pull up all the travel details for that customer. I found one of the execs regularly going to Thailand when he'd say he's going to Europe with his wife; no guesses needed to know what he was doing.

c0fdcj0,AskReddit,,True,2,"Age is not an issue. I started med school at 30, after an unrelated graduate degree (Physics) and several years of work. A friend's dad started at 50.

That being said, being admitted can be difficult. There is a high demand and a limited number of spaces. In North America, only students with strong grades and a good MCAT score are accepted, but they almost all graduate. In Europe, many more are accepted, but most fail out. Other countries have different accept/pass ratios.

If you're European, you'll need to spend EVERY-WAKING-MOMENT studying once accepted. Med school is not hard, but the sheer volume of information you must learn is staggering. And it's graded on a curve. So if you don't put in the hours, someone else will and you won't make it to 2nd year. It's that simple. 

If you're North American, you'll need to spend months (if not years) reviewing biology, organic chemistry, etc... and preparing for the MCATs. With mediocre grades, your MCAT score will need to be excellent. If you can do this, then you'll also have learned the study skills necessary to succeed in med school. But getting a good MCAT score is challenging.

So, regardless of where you are, the biggest issue is one of how much time you can put in. If you're willing to do the work - and it isn't hard - you can be a doctor.

tldr; Not too late, requires high time investment.

**EDIT**: The biggest problem for you will probably be a change in learning style. Physics, philosophy, psychology, etc... require understanding concepts and being able to create generalizations which you can use to solve new problems.

Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced, swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

**Infringements**

1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.
These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2 Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.



The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter &amp; WHO for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material,supplied by WHO, with the live bird flu virus and distributing it to 18 countries.

c0fdh5u,gaming,,True,6,"Let's take a favorite example of mine -- the digital camera.

_Edit:_ **tl;dr**:  Lots of numbers and boring economic crap.  Fancy toys cost more in Western Europe.

Out here (Amsterdam) Calumet is in a run-down industrial park.  In San Francisco, it's in a crappy, underdeveloped out-of-the-way part of town.  SF is not known for low rents anywhere.  It certainly won't be higher than in this crappy corner of A'dam.  B&amp;H in NYC?  I'm sure they get some cool tax breaks or somesuch, but their rents are not really going to be all that cheap.

Salaries:  SF has a minimum ""living wage"".  USD $15/hour.  Dutch minimum wage is 1301 euros/month.  Work that out per 160 hours worked/month and you get a lower rate.  

Sea transport from Asia is going to cost roughly the same per unit -- the longer distance will not add more than a tiny incremental cost per unit.

Europe has more efficient, denser distribution networks; furthermore, teamsters and longshoremen in the U.S. are heavily unionized.  So there goes the ""higher costs of distribution"" argument.  Granted, fuel costs in Europe are higher, but as with sea transport, you're moving this crap around in big trucks / train cars, so even if there were a difference, incremental cost per unit would be minimal.

The regulatory and accounting cost argument also doesn't hold much water.  Regulatory expenses for business in Europe _are_ higher, but again, we're talking about CA and NY here.  That's comparing red apples to green apples -- whereas if you'd said ""Arkansas"", it'd be perfectly valid.  Again, minimal incremental costs if any difference at all.

That leaves [import duties](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds/cgi-bin/tarlist?Lang=EN&amp;DesLang=EN&amp;SimDate=20091105&amp;Offset=1&amp;Goods=camera&amp;Day=05&amp;Month=11&amp;Year=2009) -- the same across the EU.  Using the TARIC code for 

&gt; Transmission apparatus for radio-broadcasting or television, whether or not incorporating reception apparatus or sound recording or reproducing apparatus; television cameras, digital cameras and video camera recorders

originating in Japan, we get, what do you know, no import duty information.  That doesn't sound right, so let's search for ""European Union import duties on cameras"" and we find [this](http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/eu_import_duty_to_hit_future_digital_cameras_news_130299.html) which mentions a 4.9% import duty, on top of the VAT of 19% (specific to countries, this is the case with the Netherlands).  

Let's look up the US [harmonized tariffs](http://www.usitc.gov/publications/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/0911c85.pdf) (PDF) -- in this case, for section 8525.80.40 (digital still cameras) -- I come up with a maximum tariff rate of 2.1%.  Nominally, as I ordered the camera to California, it should have been charged at the CA sales tax rate of 8.25%, but bless them, Adorama didn't. 

I could run you through similar examples with France (which has a very very slightly higher minimum wage and the same import duties), Germany (no statutory minimum wage) and the UK (I don't know enough about the import tariff situation there, but I believe it falls under EU regulations, plus a £5.80 minimum wage -- so even allowing for a pre-crisis high pound, that doesn't explain the disparity.)

Since we're talking about prices outside of sales tax / VAT (as I mentioned -- the NL pre-tax price was higher than the US gross price), that leaves licensing fees, as you say.  This is called ""price discrimination"" (not a judgmental term, that is the name for charging more in country X than in country Y for the same product.)  

According to [this site](http://www.justlanded.com/english/Netherlands/Netherlands-Guide/Jobs/Working-the-Netherlands), the average salary in the Netherlands is 25k-30k euros/year.  My boss is a middle manager in a large bank with ~20 years of experience and a university education, and he pulls about 65k euros a year, which seems average for his level.  I was offered a job as national head of strategy for a big international company in Paris last year, and while their salary was a bit on the low side, the offer including bonus would have been around 84k euros p.a. -- my girlfriend's employees make significantly less than that, and 25k-30k for an engineer freshly out of university is not unheard of.  This also meshes with the experience that MBA buddies of mine have in France and elsewhere in W. Europe (and if you make the ""how can you tell if someone has an MBA"" joke one more time, I'm cramming a spreadsheet up your ass.)

So we're not talking about people working at McDonalds for $5/hour in Bakersfield, but reasonably urban areas with higher wages for comparison.  Looks fairly similar.  Also, remember that for the salary ranges we're talking about who'd normally have disposable income to buy this kind of stuff, income tax in FR/NL tends to be _way_ higher than in the US.  And if you want a more generic approach, look at purchasing power parity for most of W. Europe compared to the US -- it's pretty much the same overall.

Back to Calumet / Adorama / B&amp;H, their employees are hardly unskilled labor, but trained professionals with a fair amount of experience.  Plus, the salaries at the actual retailers aren't going to make much difference -- as evinced by the very small price differences between pure ""put-shit-in-a-box-send-it-off"" e-tailers and specialist stores with an ecommerce page.  

I don't recall Calumet's exact price for the 5D Mark II body, but it was around 2k euros pre-tax.  B&amp;H-- USD $2400 (via Google products).  Amazon.co.uk -- 1808 pounds (on ""sale"") from ~3k, but let's assume that's nonsense.  Dutch prices -- from ~2k to ~2.7k euros.  Similar in France.   So okay, granted, in this particular example, not quite the same in euros pre-tax as in the US, but pretty damn close, given exchange rate of ~1.5 euro to the dollar.  And what do you know?  Same exact thing goes for my Manfrotto DX190 tripod.  AND THAT'S AN ITALIAN COMPANY.

Or, the Seagate Momentus 500GB G-Force hard drive I bought last weekend in one of my ""cheap"" neighborhood electronics districts in Paris:  103 euros, no frills, so about 84 pre-tax, vs. ~100 pre-tax on amazon.fr.  US prices seem to be around USD $109 - $125.

I know these are all anecdotal examples, but I travel a shit-ton, and I run into this _all the goddamn time_.   Even while living in Chile and Singapore, countries with decidedly lower wages than the US, this was the case for electronics (although in those cases I'd very easily chalk a substantial portion of the price up to import tariffs.)

And that brings us back to ""companies charge much more for this stuff in Europe than they do in the US"".  

P.s.:  Lest I give the wrong impression, I am _not_ saying ""Europe is more expensive than the U.S."" -- you can't generalize.  Outside of big cities, rents can be very cheap.  Daily cost of living here (again, A'dam) is lower than it would be in San Francisco; Paris is higher (well, it's Paris).  Zurich was about the same.  ""Fancy"" food in the U.S., such as good cheese and bread, can easily break the bank.

That is the difference between ""positive freedoms"" and ""negative freedoms"" and it is a huge difference between Europe and the US that I never hear much about.

Edit

Consider

&gt; Another scene of destruction in the coastal enclave is that of the local universities. Israeli shelling targeted the Islamic University and al-Aqsa University's agricultural school. 
&gt;
&gt; ""We in the Islamic University of Gaza have lost a significant scientific laboratory building because of the bombing by Israeli warplanes. This laboratory used to serve not only the university's tests, but also those of other sectors of the Gaza community such as the agricultural or water sectors. We used to perform needed tests for poisonous substances, checks that cannot be done, except in the university's laboratory,"" Dr. Kamalin Shaath, president of the Islamic University of Gaza, explained. 

Now bombing universities sounds like Tienanmen Square. Mind you, this is no ordinary university

http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=40480

&gt; Officials from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party last month claimed they captured seven Iranian military trainers – including a general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards – inside Gaza City's Islamic University, which they said was being utilized as a Hamas military training ground. 
&gt;
&gt; The Fatah officials said they also found some 1,000 Qassam rockets and equipment to manufacture the rockets inside the university. They previously suspected kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was being held for a time on the university grounds. 

Now people will complain about World Net Daily, but consider the source - they are quoting Fatah officials. The New York Times also quoted Fatah saying the same thing. In fact Fatah considered the University a legitimate target

http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=1026&amp;pageid=&amp;pagename=

&gt; A New York Times report on internecine Palestinian clashes at Islamic University stated, ""Fatah said its men had raided the university because Hamas militants had been firing mortars from the grounds. There was shooting from the university, and it is a place for weapons storage,"" said Maher Mikdad, a Fatah spokesman. In another interview with the Times, a Fatah spokesman stated, ""The Islamic University was used as a base for Hamas gunmen."" Earlier, Fatah-affiliated security officers captured an Iranian general at the school. They claimed he was ""supervising manufacturing weapons and explosives for Hamas,"" according to Yediot Ahranot. ""The source told Ynet that the expert was in charge of several labs in the university, mainly chemistry labs, in which he trained Hamas activists, most of them women, [to] manufacture the explosives. At least five Iranian citizens were arrested during a raid at the Islamic University, a Hamas stronghold in Gaza City. Hundreds of weapons and a lathe for the production of Qassam rockets were seized in the raid. The Palestinian source added that at least 20 women, some of them students, were arrested in the labs supervised by the Iranian expert, who was mainly involved in developing shells and rockets, but also explosives.""

Back to the article

&gt; In recent weeks, the Hamas government undertook a widespread campaign to remove the rubble of destroyed buildings. Also, local engineers, based on the idea that need is the mother of invention, have begun using available materials like mud to rebuild some facilities.

This makes it sound like Hamas is doing its best to fix things but are hampered by a lack of access to material. Look further down though -

&gt; Al-Mansi added that his ministry is willing to cooperate with any international body for the sake of reconstructing the war-torn Gaza Strip, but without preconditions designed to undermine Hamas' governance.

I.e. it sounds like outsiders have offered to help, but they won't funnel aid through Hamas. Hence the mud construction. Actually at one point the US funded the Islamic University Of Gaza, despite Israeli objections. The US also funds the Palestinian Authority, it was only after Hamas's coup against Fatah that aid was cut off, and only to Hamas. Thanks to Hamas, the Gaza Strip has no real economy and now refuses aid even from the Europeans. It was also Hamas that fired rockets at Israel and provoked the current war.

c0fdlnp,AskReddit,,True,16,"&gt;Is there anyone on this website that doesn't that wouldn't mind coming out and saying so/or explaining why they feel that way?

I have said several times that I oppose gay marriage. Not strictly because of religious reasons (e.g. I do not approve of any laws that govern the sexual intimacy of grownups, so I would be against sodomy laws, etc.)

To **me** the very expression ""marriage"" means a specific (but variable in scope) arrangement between a man and a woman. Just as a tenis match of ""mixed doubles"" means that each team has a man and a woman, and I would find it ridiculous for two men or two women to shout ""discrimination!"" if not allowed to play as a team.

By the way, I don't agree that marriage is a religious thing. Marriage is a cultural thing, the product of specific civilisation, that also aquires religious overtones because of the constant feedback between religion and the overall cultural framework that exists. In a way religion is yet another cultural component. In any event throughout European history marriage has always been perceived as the union of a man and a woman to constitute a new family (and yes, there were exceptions sometimes, but insignificant in terms of describing the common practice).

As such I oppose the changing of this definition because it goes against the very meaning of it. Which is why the objection about ""blacks couldn't marry whites years ago"" doesn't work for me, since it was an extra condition imposed on top of something which didn't contain that prohibition in its very meaning. 

I am not opposed, however, to civil unions that guarantee the same rights (in terms of inheritance, taxes, hospital visits, etc.)

One of the problems here is that, from reading some comments, it being legal is only part of the problem: it seams that I should be *forced* to think that it is the same, even on a *personal* level, since failure to do so is some sort of a hate crime.

What? Are you even aware of how much the US spends on its military compared to other countries? Again, the US spends about as much on the Pentagon as THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED (and that's not including the off-budget wars).

Russia's not trying to catch up, they simply can't.

&gt; Not for lack of effort, ex Soviet states aren't to keen on Russian influence.

Actually, some ex-Soviet states (e.g. Belarus) want to rejoin Russia. Others have significant Russian minorities that want to do so.

But you ignored the point about the US breaking its pledge not to expand NATO eastward.

Again, it's the US that is the aggressor here. The US invaded Russia in 1917, stayed years past the end of WWI trying to overthrow the Bolshevik gov't, and has never stopped trying to destabilize and break up Russia.

&gt; Which would those be?

It is widely reported that the US was involved in supporting Chechnyans in their bid to gain independence. The US has talked about breaking Russia up in a Balkanization strategy since at least the 1950s.

&gt; No, no one did.

You know not of what you speak. The Pentagon has put out white papers on strategy where it openly says it seeks world military ""domination"" and will seek to not only contest rivals, but to prevent any potential rival from rising to a point of challenging Pax Americana.

&gt; Yes, quite a bit along with a list of war crimes that would make GWB blush.

The only military action Russia has taken outside of its borders was to respond to an attack on int'l peacekeepers in Georgia. Georgia broke a US and European-backed (at least publicly backed) agreement, shot Russian peacekeepers in Georgia, and launched an attack breaking the ceasefire. Russia counter-attacked.

&gt; Yes

What I was citing was the ""Bush Doctrine"", an immoral policy that is in violation of the UN Charter and which breaks int'l law dating back to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia.

c0fds4u,atheism,,True,1,"&gt;It's worth pointing out that most Enlightenment quotations involving the word ""priest"" are as likely to be anti-clerical as they are to be anti-religious. In other words, they represent a reaction to the position of the Catholic Church in European history, not to religion in general.

considering that most of them seem to have embraced deism, you're probably correct.  however, i would note that a general, non-specific belief in a deity is far different than following an organized religion.  the sentiment (as i see it) is that these people running organized religion (i.e. the ""priests"") are con artists, duping the masses to serve themselves and their political partners.

&gt;I wonder how many historical examples Jefferson could present of priest-free peoples maintaining a free civil government

i think jefferson was arguing in favor of the grand american experiment.  the separation of church and state was intended to curtail the power of the priesthood, so that the individual could practice (or not), according their own conscience.  i.e.:  priest + power of government = tyranny.  see, e.g.:

&gt;""The clergy, by getting themselves established by law and ingrafted into the machine of government, have been a very formidable engine against the civil and religious rights of man."" --Thomas Jefferson to Jeremiah Moor, 1800. 

&gt;""[If] the nature of... government [were] a subordination of the civil to the ecclesiastical power, I [would] consider it as desperate for long years to come. Their steady habits [will] exclude the advances of information, and they [will] seem exactly where they [have always been]. And there [the] clergy will always keep them if they can. [They] will follow the bark of liberty only by the help of a tow-rope."" --Thomas Jefferson to Pierrepont Edwards, July 1801. (*) 

&gt;""This doctrine ['that the condition of man cannot be ameliorated, that what has been must ever be, and that to secure ourselves where we are we must tread with awful reverence in the footsteps of our fathers'] is the genuine fruit of the alliance between Church and State, the tenants of which finding themselves but too well in their present condition, oppose all advances which might unmask their usurpations and monopolies of honors, wealth and power, and fear every change as endangering the comforts they now hold."" --Thomas Jefferson: Report for University of Virginia, 1818.

**European Union Report:** The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: ""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"". The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that “in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”

**USAid Report:** The report, by the US Agency for International Development, showed more than one-fifth of young Palestinian children are malnourished. This is more than a threefold increase since the last study two years ago. The plight of children under 5 years of age was particularly alarming. Twenty-two percent of Palestinian children under age 5 were malnourished, up from seven percent in an agency survey two years ago. Of that number, nine percent suffered from acute malnutrition—resulting from poor nutrition over the short term—and 13 percent suffered from chronic malnutrition—longer-term deficiencies that can result in stunted growth. About 20 percent of children under 5 had some form of anaemia.

It chronicles the ""devastating"" effect of the siege that Israel imposed after Hamas seized control in June 2007 and notes that the dramatic fall in living standards has triggered a shift in diet that will damage the long-term health of those living in Gaza and has led to alarming deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and vitamin D.

&gt; I think this is a case where the market should self-correct without the need for outside intervention

At no point did I ever argue for intervention, but as a consumer, it sucks and I will refuse to pay the European price whenever I get the chance, in the hope that this will hurt margins here and drive prices down.  In the case of network-delivered products, that's unfortunately not an option, so I can choose to either pay up or be locked out and go read a book, or pirate when that's an option.

sperm quality and testicular cancer.

born after the 1930s-1940s have lower testosterone levels than their
fathers and grandfathers had at the same age. A 30-40 year-old man
today has the same level as a 70 year-old did at that time.

Why do they ""rightfully"" hate Chavez? Because he has **democratically** implemented socialist political policies designed to reduce the power of the Venezuelan oligarchy and to create a more egalitarian society?

Of course rich people will flee when their taxes are raised and their lop-sided economic and political power is reduced.

Look at the 1960s when the Beatles fled Britain to the ""tax haven"" of the US. Or look at today when members of Irish-bragging U2 officially live in the Netherlands because of lower taxes.

But Americans look at this with biased eyes. The fleeing of rich Europeans to other rich countries is different than rich Cubans fleeing Cuba after Castro took over, or rich Venezuelans fleeing after Chavez was elected. We sympathize with the rich because we are rich and fail to note the disparity between rich and poor in Latin America is much, much worse. After all, we in the US helped create and sustain those Latin American oligarchies by overthrowing many democratic/populist governments. But the principle stands: the rich will flee and are highly organized to maintain their disproportionate political power.

&gt; Venezuela sponsoring terrorism? Gimme a fucking break!

Quite true. But this is a standard US imperial tactic. We're in the first phases now. The US is arming Columbia, installing military bases near Venezuela and starting (so the Venezuelans claim) destabilization efforts.

The Venezuelans will then respond with a military buildup because of the threat, feel forced to crack down because of the destabilization, and then the US will scream ""See, they're militaristic tyrants opposed to freedom!""

Given that the European Parliament has concluded as fact that the US conducted outright terrorist actions (everything from bombing civilians to shooting school kids with shotguns) in western Europe in the 1980s on our ""closest"" allies -- all to push their politics to the right -- the hands of the US gov't are so bloody and dirty that we should rightfully have little credibility.

c0fe4p7,worldnews,,True,-1,"1. Starting multiple wars against a legitimate, U.N. sanctioned state and losing land in the process is not ethnic cleansing. It's a consequence of desiring war more than peaceful compromise of a dififcult situation.

2. Israel is the ancestral homeland the the Jewish people. It is not a colony or ""beach condo"". Ancient Jewish communities were indigenous in the middle East - before they were forced out of their homes and into Israel by the Arabs. Approximately 40% of Israeli Jews are Mizhrazi Jews from Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Yemen, Iraq and Iran... these people and their ancestors 100% native to the Middle East - without a single European or non-Middle Eastern ancestor. They became refugees in the Arab-Israli Wars... and  Israel is now their home.  20% of Israelis official citizens are local Arabs, 40% are Jews who are unquestionably indigenous the Middle East since the beginning of time,  and 35% are Ashkenazi Jews  who were refugees of antisemitism and genocide in Europe and Russia. A small minority are indigenous minority ethnic groups an imigrants from North and South America .

3. Israelis understand that Palestinian Aras have lived there for a very long time too, and also have claims to the region. We don't deny this, not do we deny anyone basic human rights or freedom of religion. We are eager to COMPROMISE and work out a peaceful solution - meaning we will bend on some things even though we can't be forced to. We understand that we're in this together, and we need to live side -by-side in peace and security. 

4. Defending against terrorism and violence instigated and continued by a party who refuses to compromise - or bend an inch in their demands - is a BASIC HUMAN RIGHT we will not forfeit. 

5. Palestinians are a rebel group who want to destroy Israel and cleanse the Jews out. It is explicitly outlined in their constitution and charater of the regimes that control them. 

There is nothing legitimate or honorable about using terrorism to try and make one party cave into 100% of your demands (which designed to weaken and eventually destroy them). 

The legitimate and honorable thing would be to be brave and tell the truth. Palestinians leaders lie, because lies are the weapon of the weak. They lie that Jews have no history in Israel, that Israel does not exist, and that Jihad is the only possible solution - when there are dozens of far more prosperous and possible ones.

We are not trying to destroy Palestinians by offering to give up land we control for them to have a PEACEFUL , self-governing, non-fascist-non-Iranian-arms-laden.. non-terrorist state. But we will not give into their demands and let them create an Iranian-sponmsored terrorist regime, like they did Gaza, as a base to attack and incite genocide against us, again. Ever.

What? Here is the direct definition for a ""recreational drug"" •""a narcotic drug that is used only occasionally and is claimed to be nonaddictive 
wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn"". That is a pretty big distinction from let say the medical use for a drug. 

Here's another definition much more closer to home, 
""•Recreational drug use is the use of psychoactive drugs for recreational purposes rather than for work, approved medical or spiritual purposes, although the distinction is not always clear (often spiritual use is considered recreational)."" Given that it is from wikipedia.... but ill give the benefit of the doubt. But most of the time recreational use of a drug has a clear distiniction from the medical use of the drug.

There is a very clear distiniction of what is a Recreational drug and what is drugs used for specific medical purposes.

&gt; My assertion is there is no basis for the illegality of certain substances and not others as it has no foundation in logic or rationale. 

Yes, yes there are. FAA: A legal drug is one that has ""...have medicinal value, have been tested for safety and efficacy, have been manufactured under sterile, controlled conditions, and are administered in controlled doseages. Sometimes the testing proves to have been faulty or inadequate, but at least an attempt to make them safe has been made."" 

&gt; would otherwise bring nothing negative to the world is absurd, futile, and destructive to society and the human spirit. 

Where's your proof that it has nothing negative to bring? The moral arguement here is pointless because there isnt any sense in promoting something negative any how, unless you take the utilitarianist approach. The logical and rational arguement is being mixed with opnions not facts, i.e. ""i think government shouldnt be involved because *insert reason here*"". Every citizen and person in this country is binded by a social contract, you are to follow that social contract or face the consequences, if the contract says drugs are illegal than, they're illegal and it is your responsibility to follow what that contract says. It's as simple as that. But I dont understand why any drug (non medical or proven harmful) would be promoted in the first place in morale or even in any logical society for that fact!

The real problem behind this whole entire debate is that within the American Culture, there exist no real moral calculus, just the side that wants to smoke pot and not get in trouble and side that wants to profit. There are plenty of logical arguements that can go both ways.

You can notice in Europe that people from former-Commie countries - which correlates with being raised as atheist - tend to worry more and be more pessimistic. No I don't say atheists tend to be more pessimistic, I say being _raised_ as one might.

c0feb6a,atheism,,True,0,"&gt;Romans and Greeks had no problem with man on man sex, and this is who he is writing to, not some Jewish Christian convert.

No, Paul was writing to the Christians in Rome, not just Romans in general.  Some of those Christians were Jews, and others were Gentiles.

&gt;No Christian in their right mind at the time of Christ would have even considered homosexuality as anything but the most abominable of sins.

If you can't support that from a broader reading of the Bible (particularly the New Testament), then on what do you rely?

&gt;Jesus Christ did not bring a SINGLE new idea to the table

Not necessarily, but He pulled a lot of old ideas together in a new way -- at least, new for His Jewish audience.  Indeed, He chastized the Pharisees for slavishly following narrow little rules precisely because they took those rules out of context to the point that they lost sight of the big picture.

Because I agree the Bible should not be read literally, I also agree that it should not be treated as the well-spring for morality.  Romans Ch. 14 tells us that we must take personal responsibility for our relationships with God and with others, and choose which rules we follow based on that principle.

&gt;The only thing Christianity has accomplished is the slowing down of human progress THAT'S IT, they have done NOTHING and I mean NOTHING that has contributed the bettering of humanity.

That's not true, historically or otherwise.  Christianity was the primary force for the preservation and spread of literacy in Western Europe between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance.  Christianity has also been associated with a number of charitable works over the centuries.  Many of those efforts were misguided, but at least give them credit for trying.

&gt;In fact on many instances Christianity has been the root cause of retrogression, Main would be a good example of this.

I disagree.  Christianity only gets the blame because fearful, ignorant bigots can cite passages out of context to justify the hatred they would experience anyway.  The voters in Maine were guided by fear and ignorance; the Christian trappings were mere window-dressing.

There's an important distinction between causation and correlation, and neither term accurately applies to an *ex post facto* rationalization of bigotry.  It is easy to blame Christianity, but you have to believe the bigots in order to do so.

c0fec3l,reddit.com,,True,1,"""AN official Taliban publication warns Australia that it will have to assimilate into a dominant Asia or face the prospect of being overpowered and forced to take population overspill from Asia.

The choice is spelled out in the latest issue of the online Taliban monthly magazine, Al Sumud (Steadfastness), whose lead article offers a sweeping view of a post-war order in which a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan becomes a moral pivot for a pan-Asian renaissance that will coincide with the decline of Western power.

""The end of European leadership in the world will place the white settler diaspora in Australia before two choices,"" writes the author, Mustafa Hamid, a former senior al-Qa'ida member who in 2001 married Australian Rabiah Hutchinson, a Sydney mother with links to Islamic extremists.

""It can either return to its motherland in Europe or reconcile with its Asian surroundings and assimilate into it as a wealthy and active member.""

Otherwise, he warns, a lengthy conflict will ensue in which Australia will be overpowered ""by Asian waves that are better armed and more numerous"".

""There is no doubt that the huge growth in the population of Asia, together with its economic and military development, will make Australia into lebensraum -- to use the European term,"" writes Mr Hamid. Lebensraum, meaning living space, was a term used by Nazi Germany as a motivation for territorial conquest.

Asia, Mr Hamid writes, is facing a population explosion ""while Australia is nearly empty of people, apart from scattered groups of white residents"".

Residents of ""the Israeli outpost"" at the other end of Asia are likewise warned to return to their countries of origin or face an ""unequal conflict"".

These warnings, however, are marginal to the central vision offered in the article -- the emergence of a vibrant pan-Asian identity in which Islam, and the Taliban in particular, constitutes a powerful moral and cultural force but not an exclusive one. Its emphasis on pan-Asian political identity rather than pan-Islamic sets it apart from al-Qa'ida ideology. The Taliban article does not call for jihad, although it hints at the possibility of ""peaceful Islamic expansion"" and the linchpin role in the ""Asian Age"", as the author terms it, is ceded to non-Islamic China.

Western power is fading fast, he writes, ""to the benefit of Asian giants, and first and foremost among them the colossal economic and human power of China"".

Even Russia, whose invasion of Afghanistan 30 years ago would prove a milestone in the emergence of militant Islam, is depicted as an ally arraigned with Asia against the ""arrogance"" of the West.

""Today, Russia is taking a defensive position against the Western advance which aims to break (Russia) up into statelets and to cross it on the way to China to break it up as well. Russia desires a coalition with China, with India, with Iran if possible, and even more so with Afghanistan, and even more so with the Taliban movement (which) is a serious, realistic and victorious leadership in that vital country (Afghanistan).""

In the article, ""The Return of the Islamic Emirate: A vision of Afghanistan's role in the coming international order"", Mr Hamid depicts a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan having a fundamental leadership role in the new Asian order -- ""not in the field of finance, industry and interest-bearing banks"" but as a moral force.

""This was demonstrated by the ability of Islam to inspire a small, poor people to resist and defeat five military campaigns of the largest armies on earth.""""",t3_a1dxs,t3_a1dxs,False,1257457939,t5_6,t1_c0fec3l,False,1,0,[deleted],0,0,,,1426090272

No, it's not. Here's the flaw in their thinking... If I survey the American (or British or any other homogeneous population) and determine that men have 7 partners but women only 4 the logical assumption is that each gender is having sex with people in the same region.

But you simply cannot make that assumption. Let's say I backpack through Europe and bang 3 chicks while I'm there. That adds to my total but does nothing for the total of American women.

Of course, you could argue ""what about the pretty co-ed banging the pool boy in Cancun over Spring break."" Which is true. That would increase the female numbers and do nothing for the mens numbers... if women reported it.

Why is it you can recognize the injustice when it happened to those people but not see the *exact same thing* happening to another group of people as an injustice?  Plain old bias perhaps?

Isn't Israel's position that it would control Palestine's airspace and borders?  Wouldn't the honest statement be ""we need to surround them to guarantee our security?""  

&gt;Defending against terrorism and violence instigated and continued by a party who refuses to compromise - or bend an inch in their demands - is a BASIC HUMAN RIGHT we will not forfeit.

Israel has a right to violently defend its territory from foreign aggression.  Palestine had no right to defend its territory from Zionist aggression, and when it finally put up a major fight, it was actually the aggressor.  I really think you're just biased.  

&gt;Palestinians are a rebel group who want to destroy Israel and cleanse the Jews out. It is explicitly outlined in their constitution and charater of the regimes that control them.

Zionists were a rebel group who wanted to destroy Palestine and clense the Arabs out.  It was explicitly outlined in their publications.  You do see the problem here, right?  The Palestinians are trying to get back at you for *what you did to them*.  Israel is not a victim of anything but immoral tactics.  

&gt;But we will not give into their demands and let them create an Iranian-sponmsored terrorist regime, like they did Gaza

Complaining about the consequences of stupidly hanging onto land taken in war will not make them go away.  Dismantle settlements, bring Palestinian kids into your schools and Palestinian families into your communities, get people jobs and help them start businesses, really treat them like part of 'us' and not 'them,' and you will obtain the peace and security you desire.

You are projecting American - European democratic thinking and values in a STARKLY situation and culture where they cannot possibly apply. You assume that Palestinians would respond positively to gestures of removing settlements and offering them aid. We bravely tried your suggestion in 2005 - had the IDF rip Jewish families out of Gaza - and left them with $14 millions of dollars worth of farming and greenshouse equiptment that were paid for by American Jewish donors so that the local Palestinians farmers would not lose their jobs. 

Palestinians senselessly destroyed the humanitarian gifts:

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9331863/

and they promptly elected an Iran-backed jihad regime (Hamas)  that increased terrorist attacks on Israel 100 fold.


Here's what I think you fail to understand: ** NOTHING in the Middle East is even remotely ""fair."" ** Fairness and equality are concepts that do not even exist there, so it's not ""Fair"" to impose them on Israel when its enemies lie and fight dirty... and treat the Palestinians worse than Israel does. 

The Arab world has no institutions evolved by common consent for common purposes, under guarantee of law, and consequently there is nothing that can be agreed upon as the general good. Vital issues of life and death, peace and war are at the sole disposition or whoever seizes power.

A handful of absolute despots oppress and attack, with every available strategy, all those within reach. The rich and the strong mercilessly bully and exploit their inferiors. Father subjugate their wives and children. From the proudest power holder down the the humblest family, all are engaged in pillaging whatever they can for themselves, or at best for their tribe and religion, rather considering the common interest and constructing the commonwealth.

Politics, in practice, is reduced to the black arts of applied force.. and in any emergency, terror. In all relationships, domestic or private or public, internal or external, violence is not only customary but also systematic and impervious to piecemeal reform.

Choice, invention, equality and wealth creation are benefits of living under institutions in which citizens participate of their own free will. Mutual agreement by contract, as well as compromise and civility, result of their own accord.

c0fem2x,AskReddit,,True,3,"Interesting. To be perfectly honest, I'm sort of shocked by your questions. 

I'm in a pretty good position to attempt to answer your questions. I'm Swedish and in medical school well on my way to become a doctor. As such, I am from time to time an employee of the swedish medical system. I also lived in the US for two years back when I was fifteen, in state of NY to be more precise, and during that time had some experience with your system. As for Sweden, we here have fully socialized medicine. OK, here goes (one o'clock in the morning here, sorry for fuzzy answer).

1) The european countries with socialized healthcare have for many many years topped the charts in comparisons in quality between nations. Examples(/rant): Sweden has the 2nd lowest infant mortality rate in the world. We top statistics on early breast cancer detection and succuesfull treatment in the world. We have, alongside norway and france, the longest maternity leaves and parent support programs on the globe. The nordic countries have recently pionereed a program to ultra sound-test the vascular system of every single kid that participates in any athletic activity to prevent deaths related to congenital vasclular abnormaties. How could these results be reached if not by treating the whole poulation and not just the ones who can afford it? (Can't find the studies I'm looking for to back up my claims right now, but is anyone is interested, i could probably find them in the morning).

As for the ""number of toopastes"" in our hospitales, I have little to compare to. I just know that the surgery departments in the hospital where i study just bought the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System to maintain their lead as a world class facility. When the licensed doctors i work with prescribe pharmaceuticals, its ALWAYS done on a basis of whats effective and what has the best proven clinical effect, cost NEVER enters into the equation. The hospital administrators may think differently, that I don't know.

2) Whatever you are beeing treated for, be it heart transplanation, diabetes, cancer or the common cold, you never have to pay more than around 50 USD. Anyone, anywhere, have at any time the right to be treated with the full capacity of our health care machinery. For free. (Yes, I know, we do have slightly higher taxes).

As for waiting times, we do have of that. I think you are, however, guaranteed to receive treatment within 3 months of your first contact with health services (not sure here though).

3) Don't know what doctors make in the US. When we first graduate from med school (not beeing specialists yet) we have a monthly salary of about 3,500 - 4000 USD. This does grow pretty rapidly though, and Norway has, for example, higher starting salaries. Fu%&amp;ers. A middle aged white male working in cardiology probably makes around 5,000 - 9,000 USD a month. How does this compare to the US?

In conclusion: it is a well known fact that europe has some of the best health care in the world. It is also a well known fact that most europeans think the american system is a joke. More similair to an african nation ravaged by civil war and a wealthy opressive elite than a modern developmental nation. How can a country function without something that even resembles a modern and democratic healthcare system? How can a modern democracy let private companies make as much money as they do, when availability is so low?

I would be interested to know if our view of the american system are as warped as your views of our. You think we have underpaid personel and low quality equipment, when we in fact have expetionally high standards. Our view: even the smallest treatments will set you back a month's paycheck.

The Rafah crossing point is the only non-Israeli army-controlled access point
for Palestinians to leave Gaza. When Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip
in 2005, Secretary of State Rice helped broker an agreement (“The Agreement on
Movement and Access”) between Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to
provide Gazans access through the Rafah terminal. Israel agreed to allow the
European Union to maintain a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to monitor the
Rafah crossing. Without a physical presence on the border, Israel monitored the
checkpoint using closed-circuit cameras. **Most importantly, Israel retained the power
to open and close the crossing based on its assessment of the security situation.**
After Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel
to close the Rafah crossing. According to the last EUBAM factsheet, “Since Corporal
Gilad Shalit was captured [by Hamas] on 25 June 2006, the Rafah Crossing Point
(RCP) has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only.

c0fepqh,haskell,,True,10,"There's a video on the site, but there's also a (pretty poorly transcribed, unfortunately) transcript.  I'd generally rather read the transcript than watch the video, but the site is *terribly* designed.

To that end, here's the transcript in two parts:

*I'm Sadek Drobi, I'm here with John Hughes, at Erlang Factory. John, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you've been busy with?*

I'm at heart an academic, I've been a professor for many years and I got interested in functional programming way back in the mid '70s. I've been working with it throughout my career, both with the design of Haskell and more recently, when the functional programming has become to make a move into industry, then I've been working with Erlang. So, I'm very much a fanatic of technology - I love it and very much enjoying seeing that it's finally bearing fruits. In industry, what I've been doing most recently is working with my testing tool, QuickCheck and spending a lot of time with my company that is marketing that.

*From Haskell to Erlang, what made the move?*

We had a customer! Some of the Erlang users at Ericsson, especially ... were interested in using a version of QuickCheck, so I made a version in Erlang. At that time, certainly there weren't very many or perhaps hardly any Haskell users in the commercial world. So, if we wanted customers, then Erlang was a much better choice.

*Do you miss laziness from Haskell?*

Yes, absolutely. I have Macros in Erlang that simulate it and I use them all the time.

*And types?*

Yes, of course. What I miss, when I think of type error, is not immediately discovered and that's very useful, no doubt about that and I do spend some time looking for errors that the Haskell type checker would tell me about immediately. But what that means, is that I have to find my type errors by thorough testing. Oh, wait a minute, I'm working with a testing tool! I actually find that the type errors are found very quickly by QuickCheck tests, so I need to write QuickCheck properties for testing, anyway, so that it's not as big a problem as I might have expected not to have the type checker.

*What attracts you most in Erlang in contrast to Haskell?*

There are advantages than not having type checker, namely generic programming. If you do generic programming in Haskell, you can write a paper about it. If you do generic programming in Erlang, it's 4 lines - one for lists, one for tuples, one for basic values. Maybe they are only 3 lines! But it's very easy to do generic programming and I do that a lot in the Erlang version of QuickCheck. I've been able to make what the user has to write, to write QuickCheck specifications simpler and more elegant, thanks to the lack of a type system in Erlang. Erlang is very good for meta programming. It's not something that is a lot harder to do in Haskell.

*QuickCheck you designed in the beginning in Haskell, right? And then you did a version for Erlang and now you are using it to test race conditions. Can you tell us more about this?*

This is some recent work we've been doing as part of the Protest project, which is a project that the EU Framework Program is financing and what we are doing is running current Erlang programs under control of our own scheduler. We define a scheduler as an Erlang process and we instrument the code under test, so that all of the other processes talk to our scheduler and they say ""Isn’t it my turn yet?"" Then, the scheduler says ""Now it's your turn"".

That lets us randomize the execution and makes it much more likely that we'll provoke race conditions. That's a fairly standard approach, actually. What is more novel about what we are doing is that we are generating the parallel test cases using QuickCheck. We found that we are able to shrink parallel test cases and produce the same kind of minimal examples that make sequential bugs easy to find. We can produce some of those that provoke race conditions. That's very interesting!

*Higher order programming with Haskell is easy because of types. Don't you think that types are enablers for higher order programming?*

Yes. When you do higher order programming, you have to know what the types of your functions are. I do higher order programming all the time in Erlang and I know what the types of my functions are. They are a very valuable intellectual tool for understanding the complexity of higher order programs, whether or not you have a type checker that checks them. In Erlang I don't have a type checker that checks them, but that doesn't bother me so much.

*Both Haskell and Erlang inspire the industry or mainstream in some way or another. Can you tell a bit about what are your favorite features from both languages that are getting mainstream in some way?*

In Erlang's case it must be the concurrency and the very nice error handling and features for fault tolerance. In the case of Haskell, I guess it is perhaps Haskell’s ability to capture domain specific languages very elegantly, this having a lot of impact. There are several features in the language that make Haskell so good for that. One is the type system which is very flexible, another is support for higher order programming, which is really essential for defining many domain specific languages, but also lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is quite critical for defining the interface of a domain specific language.

In Erlang I have to use macros to get the same effect, because you want to be able to define constructions like conditionals that don't evaluate over their branches and lazy evaluation makes that easy to do. Some of my favorite Haskell applications are things like the financial combinators that Lennart Augustsson is working with, where you write Haskell code or what looks like a domain specific language, but is actually Haskell code that then generates Excel interfaces to the computing engines that perform these heavy financial computations - I think that kind of thing is really cool.

*With Haskell you've been always thinking it's side effect free, right? Writing a function is side effect free. In Erlang just the fact of passing a message is a side effect. Don't you find it a bit of a problem or a difficulty when programming with Erlang?*

Most of my Erlang programming is side effect free. I think I probably write very unusual Erlang programs that look a lot like Haskell ones. Now and then, I do write side effecting code. For example, when I use the random number generation libraries that comes with Erlang, it has a side effecting interface. It's very tempting when you are building something on top of the library with a stateful interface to build code on top of that that also has a stateful interface.

That's what I did the first time I tried to use it. That has caused me so much trouble. I think every single bug that I spent hours trying to track down has been caused by a side effect. In a way, I've been programming Haskell for so many years, that I'd forgotten just how devastating side effects are and just how difficult they make debugging. I've learnt that lesson again and nowadays, if I want to use a stateful library, I usually build a side effect free interface on top of it, so that I can then use it safely in the rest of my code.

c0fepqr,haskell,,True,6,"Continued ...

*Scala is a programming language that got inspired from different other programming languages including Haskell and Erlang, because it has actor model as a library and it has a pretty powerful type system. What do you think of this mixing of features? The same thing with F# which is trying to mix several paradigms, several things like dynamic and static typing in the same language for example. What do you think of this mixing?*

I think it's great. My view of functional programming is always been that it gives us new useful tools. That's what I care about, rather than that it stops us doing bad things. You can always choose not to do bad things. I think, if integrating good ideas from several different languages makes an appealing combination, that's all to the good. I'm not a very purist about forbidding side effects absolutely, I simply choose not to use them.

*Convention over obligation, right?*

Yes, I guess so.

*The QuickCheck framework got implemented in several languages. Are you aware of all the implementations?*

There have been many clones, more or less complete. It's a nice idea.

*For people that don't know about it, can you introduce it a bit to contrast it to unit testing?*

When you write QuickCheck tests, what you write is a property and the properties of the form for all test cases in some set, some general property should be true. The difference from unit testing is that you specify a property of a whole set of test cases and then, when QuickCheck runs a test, what it does is it generates an element of that set. Your test cases are generated rather than being prescribed by the programmer. The property then has to determine whether an arbitrary test in this set has passed or not and that forces you to think more generally about the behavior or your code.

It's not enough to think ""If I put in an A, I should get out a B"". You have to think of a general property that will always be true. What you are writing is essentially a part of the form specification that can be more or less complete and the tool then generates as many tests as you like and checks the property of all of those cases. When a test fails, then the generated test case is often not very easy to understand. The reason for that is that we are using random generation. Random generation of anything produces a lot of noise. Somewhere in that test case, which can often be very large, there is some feature that causes the test to fail and we think of that as the signal.

The other thing that QuickCheck does is once we find a failing test that we know contains some feature that provokes a bug, we start systematically simplifying it and usually that works very well and we boil the test case down until we get a minimal example normally that provokes a failure. That automates a very familiar part of debugging where you start off with some complex case that has failed and often you would manually start trying to remove parts of it and simplify it and boil it down to a simple case that you can then understand and diagnose. We automate that process and I think that's what people like most about the tool.

*For some time, Java was the language of the mainstream. Now we are hearing about lot of other languages, like Erlang, Haskell, F#. Do you think that there will be a next big language or we will be using a lot of languages for doing what we want to do?*

Do you mean if there is going to be a winner? I suppose there will be maybe a small number of winners. If you look at Haskell, for example, there are certain kinds of programming that Haskell is truly excellent for and other kinds of programming, where it's entirely unsuitable. I don't think that Haskell will entirely replace C, for example. But, I suppose, in the long term, it's likely that perhaps one language of each kind will attract adherence, end up with better libraries, and in the end become the natural language of choice if you want to do that kind of programming. I don't know which languages that will be. Erlang seems to be doing very well at the moment for its particular niche.

*Are you still involved in the Haskell community?*

Yes, but I'm pretty focused at the moment, I'm only part time at the university, part time at the company and we have this EU research project that is closely related to the Erlang work I'm doing at the company, so for natural reasons, just at the moment, that's where virtually all my time is being spent.

*More than side effect free, are there other concepts from functional programming that you are applying in Erlang, like maybe monads or other abstractions that we see a lot in Haskell and other functional programming languages?*

What I'm doing in Erlang is providing a domain specific language for testing and just like the domain specific languages that are provided in Haskell, higher order programming is a very important part of that, lazy evaluation is an important part because we are searching a space for minimal test cases and search processes are very nicely expressed in lazy evaluation and actually using a monad as well. I'm probably one of the few Erlang programmers who is using a monad. I think that many people, when they think about monads, they think that they are a way of doing IO without losing referential transparency.

Then, it's natural to think ""Well, you can already do IO in Erlang, and without any need for monads, so why use one?"" In fact, monads are useful both for capturing IO and as a program structuring concept. That I think is perhaps the more important use of monads and that's what I'm doing inside the Erlang code I'm writing. QuickCheck is based on a monad and it's not the same kind of monad that you do IO with. If you were, I wouldn't need it, but it enables me to structure the code of QuickCheck very nicely.

*One thing we use often in Haskell for modeling is type classes. What about Erlang?*

There is nothing corresponding to type classes.

*Do you miss them?*

I'm looking at a specific kind of application and in that application, then I don't think the lack of type class is really a big deal. One of the nice things about the Haskell version of QuickCheck is that we use type classes in order to generate test data of the right type and the programmer doesn't have to say anything, whereas, in the Erlang version, then you have to say ""Generate me an integer"" or ""Generate me a list of integers"" or ""Generate me a protocol message"" or whatever. You have to specify the generators, instead of getting them ""for free"".

At first sight, that looks like a disadvantage, but in reality, when you move beyond very simple properties, then you almost always need to specify generators. Generation is more complex than just saying ""Give me an int"". Maybe you want to generate a list and then generate one of the elements from the list for example, so you have dependencies between the things that you are generating. As soon as you move beyond very simple properties, you have to write the generators in Haskell also. Then, the fact that you have to write them in the Erlang version it's not really a disadvantage. You have to do the same thing basically.

*What do you see as a concept or a technology that will be very interesting for the future?*

I think functional programming is a very interesting concept for the future and for the present indeed. One of the things I do wonder about though, is when I got interested in the field, the mainstream was probably Fortran and COBOL and even C was fairly new at that time. The functional programming pioneers spoke of an order of magnitude improvement in productivity and I think functional programming has delivered that.

If you compare Haskell programs to C code or even C++ often, they are about an order of magnitude smaller and simpler. The same is for Erlang, those results are being validated in the industry. Where is the next order of magnitude coming from? I wish I had an answer to that question because it's hard to see almost. When you look at a beautiful Haskell program, how could this be 10 times shorter? But I think we need to be asking ourselves that kind of question. If I had a good idea there, I would spend the rest of my career working on it.",t3_a1fjo,t1_c0fepqh,False,1257473475,t5_2qh36,t1_c0fepqr,False,6,0,808140,0,0,,,1426090448

I won't ask you when your last black Queen, Prime Minister, equivalent of Sec State was, or why your soccer crowds chant racial slurs, something which would never happen here, as I'm sure you know.  Americans are just too, well tolerant and fair minded for that.

I also don't understand how you so contemptuously condemn the majority of Americans (that would be in the hundreds of millions) who don't support homosexual marriage as, haters and extremists?

Furthermore, with all due respect, to claim that you and the ""...millions that think like you..."" are speaking about ""...what is true and what is false.""  What is your evidence sir, that this campaign is driven by hatred?  What is the evidence, for that matter, you speak ""truth""?  A little bold that, eh?

Do you really believe 60% of the American people hate homosexuals?  We hate homosexuals, yet love black people enough to elect one President?  Sorry pal, it doesn't compute.  Haters and bigots love to hate black people most, right?

I regret if my responses gave you the opinion you're my inferior.  I certainly don't feel that way at all.  However, when my country is characterized and demonized as intolerant, because we don't accept the concept of marriage to be broadened to include same sex unions, when thoughtful, fair-minded, honest people beg to differ with you on what the word ""marriage"" means to them, and they're called haters and buffoons, you're going to have a problem with me, and with a lot of Americans I know...

I won't go into the oddity of this condemnation coming from a guy from a country where there are no same-sex marriages, but who is quite content to fulminate on the alleged intolerance and ""hate"" in this country!  How did that happen for you?

We didn't have to.  We have an ocean between us and them.  This is a self sufficient country.  Ordinary Americans cared that Europe was being overwhelmed.  

And I kind of resent a descendant of that overwhelmed nation/continent telling me that, really, we're just a country of mostly haters and bigots now, because gay ""marriage"" doesn't fit OUR definition of marriage, and you know the truth about us, and the way the world should be.

This is a strongly religious nation and the word ""marriage"" was adopted by the state to mean the union of man and woman.  Now that homosexuals have decided they need to be recognized legally is no reason to change the definition of what marriage has always been for and in the minds of most Americans.  Deal with that my friend before you hurl the charge of hatred and bigotry at a fair minded people, thus demonstrating the very intolerance yourself, that you falsely accuse us of.

And know that I, and most Americans wish homosexuals well in their lives, their love, their unions.  They should have all legal rights and privileges other than, elbowing their way into a ceremony descended from church rites, a union that has always been in every civilization between man and woman.  That they want to be married, that they think they should be married, isn't enough to change what marriage is and has always been, one man, one woman.

I'm sure you can appreciate the fine difference here.

Edit: also, btw, Israel indeed notified the European observers in June 2006 that the crossing is closed for security reasons (whatever they may be) after the kidnapping of Shalit; since then the crossing was only partly open. In June 2007 after the new government of the Hamas took its place, Hamas dismissed the European and the PA inspectors from the crossing. As a result, the agreement was broken and the crossing was closed essentially permanently since then. So in that sense, I guess one could say that ""in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel to close the Rafah crossing."" In any case, the above agreement does not restrict Egypt or Israel to do anything in case it is broken. In particular, Egypt can sign a new agreement with the Hamas if it so desires.

Cute start. Also, it's Ps**eu**do.

&gt; How on Earth do we even hold the 'big bang theory' as a real physics theory?

Evidence.

&gt; How does nothing just sit there forever and then just spontaneously explode?

If it was 'nothing' it would, exploding is a misnomer and we don't know much more beyond that. No matter how hard we try, there's probably no way we'll be able to look before Planck time (think of it as a refresh rate) after the start of the universe. Also, since it wasn't the universe before that, it's not really a reachable part of our universe by definition, making determining its nature somewhat difficult. We do know there was a big bang.

&gt; And then what? I'm some evolved ape?

It's slightly more complicated than that. But in a nutshell, look at a chimpanzee, bonobo or gorilla that's lost its hair and you'll see that there is hardly a difference.

&gt; Newton's second law contradicts our very existence (how does nothing sit there, and then after a period of time decide to explode)

First of all, physical laws, especially classical Newtonian physics don't make much sense at the very very start. Also, after that it was not nothing, this is Hydrogen and Helium we're talking about. When gravity, a real force in our universe, forced them together, nuclear fusion and thus heavier elements were inevitable.

c0ff4ge,reddit.com,,True,1,"From Rock Rap Confidential http://www.rockrap.com/

BIG SCAR ON THE HORIZON…Dave Marsh writes: As RRC disclosed in September, last May U2’s Bono confronted Irish journalist Gavin Martin and myself in the lobby of Dublin’s Merion Hotel. He asked what I’d been working on. I said “the premise that celebrity politics has been a pretty much complete failure.” Bono replied that he wanted to debate the topic in public. He reiterated the challenge the next evening. The witnesses included U2’s manager Paul McGuinness and my wife, Barbara Carr, among others. 
     
     I made sure that Sirius Satellite Radio, which was to broadcast the debate, knew about Bono’s invitation. By mid-June, U2’s New York office confirmed the plan, asking only that it be delayed until U2 finished recording its next album. I kept it public via RRC and my Sirius show, Kick Out the Jams. 
 
     In November, U2 manager Paul McGuinness rang me. After some brief personal palaver—I like Paul even though I know he’s alluded to me as a “Trotskyist” behind my back—McGuinness sheepishly said “Bono has asked me to ask you if he can withdraw” from the debate. 
 
     I said “Sure.” McGuinness expressed gratitude that I was taking it so well. 
     
     “Of course,” I added, “this was a public challenge. Backing out’s not gonna be private.” I did not ask why Bono ducked the debate. Maybe he’d come to his senses, as his apologetics for world capitalism disintegrated with the stock, housing and employment markets. Maybe he was too busy preparing the banalities he’d blare on the new album. 
 
     In the wake of the New Depression generated by Bono’s tutors in world finance, it’s hardly necessary to issue a point by point refutation of his statements about how the world works,. Based on Bono’s response to criticism of U2’s tax avoidance, he plans to carry to the grave the ardently stupid globalization orthodoxy of Forbes, the Wall Street cheerleading rag he co-owns. Can there be anyone else who’s ventured a deep thought in the last several months who still believes that the only path to change involves bending the knee to the powerful? 
 
     As for the lyrics, don’t jump to the wrong conclusion. It can’t be denied that Larry Mullen, Adam Clayton and the Edge can still make fascinating music. Bono’s yelped vocals are another matter, his hollow lyrics--where every platitude yields to an obscurantist pretension and back again--yet another. Unfortunately, even if he’d come up with a lyric as great as “One,” Bono also carries into each project his off-stage political pronouncements, and his fawning affiliations with war criminals such as Tony Blair and George W. Bush. 
 
     I don’t know why Bono spit the bit on debating these issues in a public forum with a well-informed antagonist. Maybe he decided that he’d fucked up and was about to lower himself by going head to head with a journalist. Maybe he doesn’t want to deal on the spot with descriptions of his repeated appearances at the conferences of the leading capitalist nations where he’s yet to ask his first hard question about anything but Africa; about his settling for promises from world leaders that patently weren’t going to be kept, and never doing more than mewing when they weren’t; about why it is that Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, by no means an anti-capitalist, observes that she met him “at a party to raise money for Africans, and there were no Africans in the room, except for me,” or why so many other Africans have complained that he claims to speak for them but has never so much as asked their permission. In regard to the last, I did receive more courtesy than Andrew Mwenda, the Ugandan journalist Bono cursed for raising such questions at an economics conference. (But then, I’m white and Celtic-American.) 
 
     It certainly isn’t my fault that I have to say “maybe” about all of this. Bono never got back to me, or had any of his handlers get back to me, about the ground rules for our projected “debate”--his term, not mine. I’d have settled for an honest interview although “debate” would have been more fun, even though the result was inevitable. No matter how many people sided with my being able to see through the kind of thing William Burroughs once poetically dubbed “a thin tissue of horseshit” it wouldn’t be enough to outweigh Big Time Pop Star status. 
 
     I don’t know. More to the point, you can’t know either. 
 
     U2 could be in a fair amount of trouble. The band is old by rock standards, and on the cover of Rolling Stone Bono looked much older than the rest  because of a physical makeover that tries to deny it. No Line’s first single flopped on the radio. The band’s decision to have its song publishing company flee Ireland for a tax haven in the Netherlands has been subject to protests in the streets of Dublin and has no obvious justification, despite Bono’s fatuous counterclaim that it is his critics who are the hypocrites because free-market values were what created the “Celtic Tiger” of Dublin’s capitalist boom economy. The Tiger’s death throes look to be particularly messy, in part because of capital flight of just U2’s kind. The band’s attempt to alter the Dublin skyline with its Clarence Hotel expansion is another example of its ruinous distance from everyday Irish reality. 
 
     Bono’s self-promotion fares much better on this side of the Atlantic than at home. For instance, he got away scot-free in the American press after declaring during the Inauguration Concert, “What a thrill for four Irish boys from the north side of Dublin to honor you sir, Barack Obama, to be the next president of the United States.” But Shane Hegarty wrote in The Irish Times that only one of the band now lives on Dublin’s working class north side while Bono has lived more of his life on the south side.
 
     “During the band's performance of ‘In The Name of Love,’” wrote Hegarty, “he described Martin Luther King's dream as ‘Not just an American dream--also an Irish dream, a European dream, an African dream, an Israeli dream . . .’ And then, following a long pause reminiscent of a man who'd just realized he'd left the gas on, he added, ‘. . . and also a Palestinian dream.’ This was his big shout out to the Palestinians… You can't help but marvel at this latest expression of Bono's Sesame Street view of the world. Hey Middle East, we just have to have a dream to get along.
 
     “Just ignore the sound of those loud explosions and concentrate on Bono's voice.”
 
     So listen, Bono, if you decide to suck it up and face me, I’m still available. I can’t win a debate, we both know that, and why you’d want to continue to look feeble and cowardly when you have virtually nothing to lose… well, that’s another question I suppose you’ll never be asked. 
 
     It doesn’t mean that those questions are going to go away. Maybe for the tamed tigers of the American pop press, but not for me, or for those people in the streets of Dublin calling you a tax cheat, or for the Africans who feel insulted by your ignorance of their lives, or for that matter, the fans who wonder why you insist on siding continually, if slyly, with the powerful against the powerless.

'Hot dead birds' protocol comes to earth

By Cade Metz in San Francisco • Get more from this author

Free whitepaper – Standardization and Modularity in Network-Critical Physical Infrastructure

OpenMobileSummit 
(edit:
http://www.openmobilesummit.com/agenda.aspx
)
Internet founding father cum Google evangelist Vint Cerf is working to bring his interplanetary interwebs protocol to mobile networks here on earth.

In 1998, working in tandem with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the (co-)father of the seminal TCP protocol launched an effort to create an ""interplanetary extension to the internet."" Initially, the team tried to make this work with the good ol' TCP/IP protocol, but Cerf and crew soon realized that this was a non-starter.

""There was a little problem called the speed of light,"" Cerf told a room full of wireless-obsessives this morning at the OpenMobileSummit in San Francisco. ""When Earth and Mars are closest, we're 35 million miles apart, and it's a three and a half minute trip one way, seven minutes for a round trip. Then when we're farthest apart, we're 235 million miles - 20 minutes one way, 40 minutes round trip.""

""Just try using TCP/IP for a 40 minute round trip.""

Then there's the problem of celestial motion. ""The planets rotate, and we haven't figured out how to stop that,"" Cerf said.

""It's a very disruptive system, and it's potentially a variably delayed system, because these planets are moving further apart based on our orbits.""

So, Cerf and team booted TCP/IP from the heavens and build an interplanetary replacement they called the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol. 
(edit:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/07/dtn_node/
)

Cerf admits this isn't the most attractive moniker.

""Engineers are really good at labeling and branding things,"" said his sarcasm. ""If we had named Kentucky Fried Chicken, it would have been Hot Dead Birds.""

Unlike TCP/IP, DTN does not assume a continuous connection. When there are delays in interplanetary transmission, the new protocol forces each node to hang onto its packets until they can be safely transmitted. It's now under test with platforms speeding away from earth towards objeccts 80 or 90 light-seconds away.

NASA first announced its successful tests last fall. And now, Cerf says, the team is looking to bring DTN to earth. ""We discovered there were terrestrial applications of this very resilient delay tolerant protocol,"" he said. The team first tested DTN on the ground in northern Sweden, using it to send data to and from laptops speeding away in all terrain vehicles, and other on-the-ground tests are underway elsewhere in Europe.

The ultimate goal - at least for Cerf - is to bring the protocol to our earth's everyday wireless networks. The protocol, he says, has already been added to Google's Android open source mobile stack as an application platform - ie it sits on top of the OS.

Cerf and crew are also working to test the protocol with Cisco router–equipped satellites. ""We're eventually going to get to the point where we can try out some of these ideas in the mobile department,"" Cerf said. ""There's relevance in the interplanetary stuff to terrestrial applications.""

What applications, you ask? Well, almost anything. ""Mobile operations are highly stressed,"" Cerf said. ""Mobiles are used where people congregate... in a sense, mobile is already a dense and hostile environment. We all know that when you drive around, coverage isn't very good...

""It's so hostile, it's clear that mobile could take advantage of these more-resilient protocols. TCP/IP is very brittle. When you lose connectivity, you lose connectivity, and most applications don't work anymore."" ®

Let's say you have a redneck. They win the lottery. They are rich, but they sure as hell aren't going to be 'posh' or 'upper class' overnight because of it. They can buy a fancy car and a big house but they are still a redneck because of their upbringing. Being posh is essentially a set of behaviours and mannerisms that are associated with an 'elite' class of some sort. Although associated with wealth and education, it's not the same thing. It's more of a social elite.

Historically, there was a large divide between the 'working class' and the other, richer, classes in England. It wasn't just a divide in wealth but also in mentality. If you worked your way to wealth rather than inheriting it you still would not be 'upper class' - you wouldn't be one of the social elite. That would take generations to change.

c0ff6nz,Christianity,,True,1,"This is an incredibly culturally myopic opinion.

Number one, it's not the 20th century anymore. The genocides and threats of nuclear war were bad, and the threats that persist are bad, but we haven't wiped ourselves out. Entire peoples have been extirpated in the past, though the numbers were smaller because the population was smaller. If you want to ask yourself about morals, you cannot simply do some morbid arithmetic and call it a day, you must look at what was done. If a group of people were killed down to the last child, is it reasonable to assume whoever did it would have stopped at the smaller figure if there were more people? Ask yourself that.

Second of all, the same conditions of 14th century Europe exist in much of the world today. You enjoy the freedom to go experience the life of a peasant farmer right now. If you have a passport, you could likely be doing it within a week.

You're a Christian, so you should know this, but you don't have the right to judge others. Your own society abounds with people who work harder than any medieval serf. Everyone sits on their butts? Why not go and share this good news with an ER doctor sitting in their butt? Perhaps some one working with the poor who's sitting on their butt? Go and talk to a Marine who's sitting on their butt, maybe? 

If you think that people today are somehow essentially different than they were in the past, you are not only mistaken but you are missing a broad section of thought that comes from your own religious tradition. If you are really serious about your statement, then there is no significant impediment to you living out your life in similar conditions if you think they are superior. It sounds to me, though, that you are projecting. It sounds like you perceive problems within yourself, but rather than deal with them, would prefer to blame society.

c0ff75u,worldnews,,True,1,"&gt; Yes, but the feature creep of government depts / politician's position / job duties will eventually mean POTEU will be an executive position.

Why? Most Westminster model republics have non-executive presidents, and somehow they have never turned into executives (which would be blatantly unconstitutional, of course). In fact, executive presidents are rather rare in the developed world; the US has one, and France and Russia both sort of have one, but I can't think of anywhere else.

&gt; Remember, this office is created to 'streamline' decision making of the EU, which during its creation, they said every country having a veto vote is fine and everyone is on equal weight and things will not get bogged down because it is the European way to politics.

No, the Lisbon Treaty was to streamline decision making in the EU. This 'president of Europe' postion is slightly nebulous. At present there are two types of president, the president of the Commission and the president of the European Council. Generally, when people talk about the president of Europe they mean the Council. This is a ceremonial position which chairs meetings. The Lisbon Treaty makes three major changes to the position; it is appointed instead of on rotation, it is a two and a half year term instead of a six month term, and the person appointed may not hold national office.

The president of the Commission already exists; the change is that it will now be appointed by the European Council rather than the Council of the European Union. It's a pseudo-executive position, sharing executive with the Commission, rather like a prime minister. Theoretically, one person could hold both roles.

Somehow, neither of these say 'terrifying totalitarian leader' to me. It is simply inconceivable that either role could take on even the powers of the President of the United States.",t3_a13ms,t1_c0ff0ij,False,1257508078,t5_2qh13,t1_c0ff75u,False,1,0,rsynnott,0,0,,,1426090674

c0ff7j0,politics,,True,1,"&gt;I also don't understand, for one, how you dare criticize America for not allowing homosexual marriage when your own country doesn't permit it? I've asked you this at least 3 times, but never mind...

And I've answered you three times that we do in fact allow gay marriage in this country but you just aren't listening.

&gt;However, when my country is characterized and demonized as intolerant, because we don't accept the concept of marriage to be broadened to include same sex unions, when thoughtful, fair-minded, honest people beg to differ with you on what the word ""marriage"" means to them, and they're called haters and buffoons, you're going to have a problem with me, and with a lot of Americans I know…

So you know what it feels like to be branded something you insist you are not, despite compelling evidence to suggest otherwise, but you aren't above throwing exactly the same insult back at someone else?  What was it I was supposed to go and do with ""Prince Charles"" again?  Shove him somewhere the sun don't shine, was it?  Did the nasty man on the internets hit a sore nerve when he pointed out the weakness of your argument?  Never mind, little man you've been very brave.  Mummy kiss it better.

Direct answer to a direct question please.  Do homosexuals line up around the block to have wedding ceremonies on your front lawn, yes or no?

&gt;..there was a sacrifice made 66 years ago which is the reason, God forbid, Europe isn't Russian or German today. I believe we went over there because it was just the right thing to do. We didn't have to. We have an ocean between us and them. This is a self sufficient country. Ordinary Americans cared that Europe was being overwhelmed.

How long do you think we're supposed to bend over and take it from America just because you live under the delusion you single handedly saved us from a war we'd already won by the time you showed up?  America is number 1, you insist.  Well, number one at what, exactly?  Most amount of wealth going to the least number of people?  Highest teenage pregnancy rates in the industrialised world?  Greatest number of people who can't afford to get a cold?  Lowest literacy and numeracy rates among school-leavers?  Most corrupt private corporations maybe?  Well at least our boys didn't die for no reason, eh?

What exactly is it you are so proud of in a nation that tolerates (your juncture not mine) a black president but considers legislating for equal human rights for homosexuals a bridge too far?  News flash.  Equality doesn't come in a jar  if you spread it too thin runs out.  It's self propagating.  It fosters understanding and diversity.  It doesn't ""erode moral values"" or lead to a lifestyle of sin and perversion.  These are the words of the religious right, designed to manipulate you into fearing something that doesn't exist.

The word 'marriage' was brought into the debate by those who are against same sex partnerships because they know they can drop it into the conversation and provoke an immediate reaction among people like you.  When you attack an institution entered into on an emotional level you provoke exactly the reaction you are demonstrating here with your received opinions, both on me and my country, my motivation and my right to an opinion shared by the vast majority of my countrymen and yours based upon evidence, as opposed to an emotional overreaction.  The coordinated campaign against same sex unions, mobilised by a tiny minority of corporate religionists, was designed to do exactly what it has done; to mould people like you into the position you think you hold for good reasons, when you can't name any of them.

If you think that is too strong, switch the word 'gay' and 'homosexual' in your above reply for the words 'black' and 'female'.  I would hope you'd see exactly what I am talking about immediately and just as quickly consider changing your bought and paid for mind, on something you self evidently haven't actually thought about for yourself.",t3_a0ty0,t1_c0fev8y,False,1257509418,t5_2cneq,t1_c0ff7j0,True,1,0,TonyBLiar,0,0,,,1426090679
c0ff7jk,AskReddit,,True,1,"What about cults though?  I think Scientology is a great example of this.  A number of European states have taken it upon themselves to ban scientology.  Why?  Because it's a dangerous organizations that tricks people into believing strange, untrue things and tries to get every dollar out of them possible.  It ruins lives and spreads lies.  

I think it is important to point out that Scientology also has its operational base in the United States, and some pretty fucked up shit happens.  In Clearwater, Florida, they more or less payroll the police and own huge sections of city blocks.  

So, because American's aren't willing to shut down cults, many, many people are going to have their lives ruined.  Is never shutting down those kids of organizations, on principle, really more important than preventing these bandits of reasons from stealing away with the freewill and wealth of many thousands of people?  I think not.  

Also, I feel somewhat dubious about this idea of Churches being ""private"" organizations.  I understand they are privately owned and opperated, but they are VERY public groups.  Not only do parish halls often function as a town hall, but then you get super extreme examples of like, the Mormon Church owning Main Street and punishing a gay couple for making a small PDA there.

c0ff7tm,BDSMcommunity,,True,5,"I'll try, although I think I did allude to it in my original post so really, I'll just elaborate on that...

When you think of what is actually happening in porn it's kinda simple: the veil of sophistication and normalcy is drawn back and you are given access to see things that you really ""shouldn't"" or at least wouldn't in any other 'normal' situation.

Therein lies the thrill. 

This holds true for everything from soft core glamour type porn right through to extreme BDSM type porn.

However: on some level everyone is aware that no matter how animalistic and raw it may appear on screen *it is still an act.* So whatever veils of sophistication and normalcy you are escaping from in the 'real world' by immersing yourself (however briefly) in this fantasy world there are similar veils within the fantasy that I suppose I (and at least the ten people who upvoted this submission) perceive.
 
When an actress is no longer able to maintain the facade and freaks out or starts crying or asks for the scene to be stopped or simply registers some form of shyness; revulsion or anger it represents the peeling back of those further veils; a deeper penetration beyond merely the physical act.

This is what I allude to when I say: ""breaking the *fifth* wall.

Actresses in porn often look directly at the camera, or you can hear the director issuing instructions, this is referred to in theatre as breaking the *fourth* wall whre often a stage set would consist of three walls with the audience forming the fourth.

The reason that porn actresses break the fourth wall is that it removes a certain level of disconnectedness. Yes, she is still acting and yes, we are aware of that but when she is robbed of the privacy of that fourth wall she seems more exposed, more vulnerable and it places you more squarely within what is happening as opposed to being isolated from it by a storyline and costumes etc... take that concept a step further and you have an idea of what I happen to find very exciting.

I thank you for not being judgmental but frankly: on some level I am repulsed by the fact that I am titillated by this particular thing. 

I have one clip where this European girl totally freaks out because the guy is gagging her with his dick, she slaps him and starts crying and shouting, her English is very bad but you can make out that this was not something she agreed to... the scene continues and eventually (whilst taking it up the ass) she breaks down again and refuses to carry on. The director gets pissed tells her to stop crying otherwise they'll have to do makeup again and that she should just sit there at the ready while another woman sucks the dude off so that they can get a pop shot onto her, she essentially shut down at this stage. 

Now when I first saw it I didn't really know what I was feeling, at first I was turned on because I enjoy rough sex, almost immediately after that I was repulsed because at the stage where she refused to carry on, certainly everything after that was rape?

Like I said: it's not something I'm especially proud of but you are who you are, the better you know that person the healthier you are likely to be... no matter how sick that is or is not.

c0ffdy3,pics,,True,1,"That is where our main disagreement comes from. You think that it is not easier to live in another country and that we can match their standard of living. You must not have been overseas yet. Even though we are currently working on our roads, transportation and service delivery, here are the facts as to how it currently is and how it has been for the past 10 years compared to other countries:

Telecommunications: The highest level of internet supplied in ZA makes use of an ancient technology that has been outdated everywhere else for almost 10 years. Even with the current developments, it is probably going to take another 5 years before we are going to even begin to get on par with the rest of the world and then hopefully we won't be paying 20x more than overseas anymore.

Public transportation: The taxi industry has been holding the country's plans for development at ransom. Only now that we are pressured to provide with the world cup looming is our leaders growing enough balls to stand up to the impending taxi strikes and violence. Do you think we're going to have less congestion on our highways when the upgrades are finished? Think again. We don't have a metro system and our inter-city train system is a joke compared to the first world. 

Crime prevention: In the area I used to live when I was younger and the area I live in now, the number of criminal incidents have risen sharply over the last 5 years. My family in Pretoria tells horror stories of how they don't even walk in the street in their once safe neighborhood. There is a much higher level of corruption within the police force itself now than there has ever been.

Electricity: Well, our current situation speaks for itself. 3x tariff increase over the next three years because we didn't plan ahead.

Water delivery: There are now talks of heavily increasing our water tariffs too because we have (surprise!) failed to maintain and expand our water works as well. In the north of the country there are communities that have begun doing their own service delivery (water/sanitation) services because municipalities just gave up. There are massive levels of unhappiness regarding service delivery up North, haven't you seen the protests on the news?

These are things the people who went overseas and made it do not have to deal with. The problems you mention pale in comparison. I can probably go on and on. I'm sorry your friends didn't make it overseas, but if you can land a good job in Europe, I can absolutely assure you without any doubt that you will have a higher standard of living even if you have a lower income than in ZA. It seems to me that you only choose to see what you want and look no further than the media. Cape town is a bubble. Please visit Pretoria/Johannesburg. Then visit Europe. Then we can speak again.

c0ffg6g,IAmA,,True,1,"In this, at least, dippyT is correct. If you want to rework the question, the original bolding is terse, but lacks another critical aspect, which is ""the point remains the same: games bring the player into the story."" That is, key to the medium of games is the requirement of interaction. Without having played the game, the audience can't say they've experienced the game. Without having experienced what you're reviewing or dismissing, you can come off as ill-informed. But that's based on the assumption that Mr. Ebert hasn't actually played many games, which may very well be false (although I've read otherwise). I'm not asking for an about face, I'm asking for a withdrawal of opinion pending further deliberation, this being based on the bolded question which emphasizes knowledge and experience as the basis for judgment, within the context of description of gaming.

What Mr. Ebert rates any given movie (or game) is rather beside the point for me. I might give more notice to highly or lowly rated movies, but what I really get from his reviews are his specific points about the movie, having actually watched the movie. For instance, he could very well have simply dismissed Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, but reading his review, he seems to have actually watched it before rendering judgment. And, of course, this is against the backdrop of all the other movies he has watched over the years. He could have simply and exclusively relied on his tremendous knowledge of the medium to immediately give it 0 stars, but instead, he treated that movie as an individual movie, watched it, and subsequently decided its critical worth. 

As I said previously, I'm not an avid gamer. Lately, I've been playing about an hour a week, if that. **The point, for me, isn't really about games, so much as what I see as a flaw/inconsistency in his reasoning and deliberative process.** Take from this what you will; it just seems like things needed expanding.

The hardest problems you have on the written test are little pictures of intersections with other cars in various positions, and you have to say which car has the right of way. The trickiest part is making sure you see all the signs and whatnot.  The actual practical test is harder because the examiners are complete fucktards (several of them don't even own a car), and they can pretty much fail you because they feel like it.

When I got my american license I started did everything from the beginning (so I wouldn't have to turn in my european license), and it was so easy I had trouble holding in my laughter. The theory test was a joke and on the practical test I barely got out of the DMV parking lot when the examiner says ""you passed"".

If over half of men believe that the world is dominated by women, that particular statistic seems to indicate widespread misogyny and delusions of persecution more than anything else; if we're talking about the entire world, that includes areas where women still can't go outside without a male escort. There have been inroads to equality in the United States and Western Europe, but elsewhere in the world women are still second-class citizens. Furthermore, as Qeraeth said in another subreddit recently, women and particularly women of color have a vastly different historical narrative. You can't wave a magic wand and say ""everything's equal now"" with only a few decades of even striving for equality, compared to hundreds or thousands of years of drastic inequality.

As to media portrayals, I think on any channel other than Lifetime you'd find a similar negativity ratio regarding *all* people, not just men. If you include portrayals of a woman as valuable only because of her appearance and/or sexuality, and portrayals of a woman as valuable only because she's a victim allowing a story to progress, I'm sure 70% is a reasonable figure. But that figure doesn't include televised sporting events, which show athletic men in heroic roles, or newscasts where most decision makers and people in power who are shown are men.

No its actually quite scientific. That is to say, it is more nutritious and lacking toxins such as arsenic.

Yet that is so often the case. People bandwagon against BIG *insert industry* and conveniently neglect the facts. Yes Monsanto as some really shitty tactics, but that is hardly an indictment GM crops or industrial farming.

c0ffosc,reddit.com,,True,1,"&gt; Political speech, libeal laws, hate speech. The holocaust was a lie...no police beating down my door.

No western European nation I know of has restrictions on political speech, with the exception of Nazi-ism or holocaust denial in a couple of countries. The UK and Ireland do have libel laws which are arguably biased against the defendant; the European Court of Justice has found that the UK's libel laws have wronged people in the past. There is talk of reform. Some countries do have incitement to hatred laws which are stricter than those of the United States (where it is extremely difficult to convict somebody of incitement to violence, though certainly theoretically possible).

&gt; You should really stop gettign all your information from reddit. Everwhere int eh world has old old laws that are never followed, pull your head out of your ass.

Homosexuality was legalised nationwide in the United States in 2003, due to Lawrence vs Texas, a Supreme Court case in which a man was arrested for having sex with a man after police entered his unlocked apartment. I'm not sure how this is getting information from reddit; it is fact. Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986 found that there was no right to privacy in the case of consensual sexual conduct; this was overruled by Lawrence vs Texas.

&gt; You were able to think of that and keep a straight face, really? You're very naive and quite ignorant, but most in Europe are a good mix of both.

Most European countries do not allow wiretapping of citizens under most circumstances; for the US situation see this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act and also this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON

c0ffotq,Christianity,Humanist,True,1,"&gt;Division, destruction, and separation are codified into Islam. Women are expressly treated differently; violence is actively condoned; the notion of salvation through a final, righteous act encourages suicide attacks.

All of which is codified in the bible as well as you well know.

&gt;And, lest you forget, it was Christians who were behind the abolitionist movement, movements for equal/voting rights, religious freedom, etc. These movements occurred hundreds of years ago and were championed by Christians.

All of whom had to step outside of the actual religion in order to bring these things about with other Christians condemning them for their actions.  Again this is not intrinsic to the religion.  And there are many Christians that would like to see these accomplishments undone.  There is little in scripture to grant equal rights to women.  

Paul said ""Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all."" Which is quite progressive, but other writings of Paul or attributed to Paul pretty much undoes this fine sentiment as you well know.

What ever the progressives among Christians might say about the equality of women the preponderance of the sacred literature is against that equality.  The actual liberation of women and others to the extent that it has come about in Christian society has its actualization in secular law.  The secular law was necessary to overcome the religious law.

There are Muslims that use the Koran to find a better place for women in the same manner, however fate has it that the fundamentalists who understand and support the core values have the power.  The fundamentalists who understand and support the core values of Christianity, have lost the power at least for the moment. 

&gt;To compare Christianity or any peaceable religion (of which you apparently think there are none) to Islam shows me that you, as a student of religion, need to hit the books a bit harder.

Here we go again.  I express the same sentiment to you in reverse.  If you think that any religion is peaceful at its core you need to hit the books a bit harder.  You might start with the Revelation of John. 

The core of any religion is intolerance, i.e. these people are in, these people are not.  Your continued condemnation of Islam is a case in point.  Other than political development there is no difference between Christianity and Islam.  That is when the Christian religious authorities were in charge, life was equally brutal as it is among Muslims.  When the religion regains authority as happened for a time in eastern Europe, the brutality returns.   Religion requires secular law to keep it in check. 

At the moment Christianity is being held in check, as Islam is not.  This may not always be the case.  All you need do is to read your bible, to see that the evil is still there lurking, waiting for its chance to be let out, waiting for its Imams like James Dobson to get their place in the sun. 

If you want me to believe that Christianity is different, then throw away that bloody book and write a different scripture.  Of course you can't do that because you are people of that bloody book and you can't pretend that it is not there.

The USA should understand it also as the Jewish migrant population is a big part of the culture there.

c0fg1nr,news,,True,-1,"**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign

Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.

The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.


Infringements
1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2 Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.


The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO.

Yes, that's what I just said.

&gt;It's not my problem their staff gets minimum wage, why should I care? We don't tip at McDonalds or Starbucks, why should we tip at Red Robin's?

Because Red Robin's staff gets $1.5 an hour. That $1.5 an hour is to pay taxes and taxes alone. Their bimonthly check is usually a couple dollars after taxes are deducted. Essentially, they get 100% of their income from tipping. The system works. It encourages waiters to actively try and give you good service because their income is on the line. Look at europe for example. Everyone gets shitty service except american tourists, because those are the ones that tip.

Now, lets look at the system you're proposing: No tips. That means restaurants would have to pay their staff 20% more. That means restaurants would have to raise the price of food by 20%. That means you're still paying the same, but with crappier service because the waiter gets paid the same whether he smokes a joint in the back room (but not enough to get fired) or actually does his job.

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign (fleshandstone.net)
Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

Infringements
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2 Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.
The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO.

It is not a discount as you get it for signing a contract that guarantees them profit. You can buy the phone and not have to have a contract and deal with inordinate disconnection charges but if you want a plan they'll make you sign a contract anyway and just not subsidize your phone. A discount is when there are no strings attached a contract is a string. 

Just because lying is common doesn't make it right. Lying to a longtime customer and using the fact that they are a long term customer in the lie is worse.

I totally understand your point about the sparseness of our population. I was not misunderstanding it I was claiming it was false. As I said if the population is so sparse why are providers claiming bandwidth is scarce? Why can't we pay more but also get more? As well our infrastructure does not reach all of Canada and even in populated areas the coverage is sketchy you're assuming they have deployed roughly the same per capita infrastructure as the states has which is a faulty assumption. I think you are also overestimating how much those nodes cost and how much of cell phone prices are pure profit. Remember the claims that text messages were bringing Telus and Bell to their knees? How do you think Bell pays out all those dividends?

He was told he got a $300 discount for being a loyal customer they should have just said they were offering a $300 discount. I they implied by stating that he got it for being a loyal customer that regular customers were not eligible. He wanted the discount on top of that offered to new customers because that was the way he understood the offer as was presented to him. He became pissed off when he figured out they were trying to trick him.

The farmer in Saskatchewan gets shitty service just like in many medium sized cities in Ontario and other provinces (I've moved a lot and found a lot of shitty areas.) My Bell phone didn't even function correctly in my last condo as I was on the ground floor (Rogers and Telus worked fine despite the concrete.) Our telecoms also have a reputation for never upgrading nodes (remember the whole traffic congestion that ""required"" bell to throttle wholesale internet traffic?) that congestion is because they are using 10 year old DSL infrastructure. They cut costs everywhere and pay out huge dividends to their stock holders while charging more than most modern nations. There are countries in Europe with population densities more similar to ours and they are not paying as much.  I happen to be a Communications Engineer who understands that infrastructure costs money and knows people who have dealt with Bell in various ways (also Telus) trust me while we do have a more sparse population than the US it does not account for the price gouging and poor service we receive.

Edit: I should also mention that most of Canada is not covered by Cell service. Take a look at Verizon's coverage of the US and Bell's coverage of Canada then realize that Verizon actually has several competitors. Verizon has 1.3 million subscribers http://askville.amazon.com/mobile-phone-subscribers-verizon/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=19463756 Bell actually has significantly more at 5,884,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Mobility without even reaching across the entire country. Now look at Bell coverage http://www.bell.ca/support/PrsCSrvWls_Cvg_Travel.page and verizon coverage http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/CoverageLocatorController

c0fg305,atheism,,True,1,"&gt;They don't assimilate because they're biologically different. Before you give me the ""no such thing as race garbage"" know that human races differ more in their genes than different breeds of dogs.

The American Anthropological Association is of the opinion that there's [really no such thing as ""race""](http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm):

&gt;With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies *within* so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic ""racial"" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes.

-

&gt;What besides biological differences can explain the fact that blacks are the most criminal everywhere they're found?

Off the top of my head?  The statistics quoted were not ""who **commits** the most crime.""  They were ""who is **arrested** most frequently.""  If arrest rates are skewed, [which indeed they consistently are](http://www.racialprofilinganalysis.neu.edu/), you can draw no conclusion from these statistics.

There are plenty of other reasons I could get into that relate to socioeconomic (rather than genetic) reasons, but I'm not going to bother because that would grant more legitimacy to your source than it's due.

&gt;Second of all, those who study the science of human biodiversity generally concede that Asians and Jew have higher IQs than whites.

That's because there is no such thing as the ""science of human biodiversity""--the discipline is called anthropology, and anthropologists are nearly uniform in rejecting even the concept of race.  The people who study the ""science of human biodiversity"" are white supremacists seeking some scientific way to whitewash (pun intended) their racism.

You'll note that the ""HBD"" crowd will admit, ""oh sure, Asians and Jews have higher IQs than whites,"" but only because they can then point out all the supposed flaws in Asians and Jews that still make white people superior.

And hey, I guess I'll deal with it...

&gt;What they ask for is that whites to be entitled to preserve their genes and culture.

There's no such thing as white culture, or even white genes.  ""White"" is a blanket term for cultures stretching from Western Europe to Scandinavia to Greece to Russia and all points in between.  There is no unified ""white"" culture.

In places like the United States, there *is* a unified **black** culture, as defined by their shared experience as people of African descent living in the US.  But even in the US, there is no unified white culture, because there is no experience that we as whites share that other groups do not.

If you want to be proud of your *German* heritage, or your *Irish* heritage, or whatever--go ahead!  That's cool!  But to be proud of your ""white"" heritage is silly.  There's no way to define ""white heritage"" except in negative contrast to black, Asian, Hispanic, Muslim, etc. culture.",t3_a1dv8,t1_c0ffwxe,False,1257549501,t5_2qh2p,t1_c0fg305,True,1,0,rooktakesqueen,0,0,,,1426091161

Uhh, sure it is.  I get a discount from a variety of places in exchange for things, wther they be the ability to hoard my information, or whether it's to agree to buy X amount of said product in a year.

&gt;A discount is when there are no strings attached a contract is a string.

This doesn't sound like any definition of discount I've ever heard.  What dictionary are you going by?

&gt;Just because lying is common doesn't make it right. Lying to a longtime customer and using the fact that they are a long term customer in the lie is worse.

For one, someone locked into a contract for 3 years is not a long-time customer.  A customer who comes to you for the last 15 years despite not having any legal obligation to do so, would be a longtime customer.

Second of all, he asked about changing his plan and they offered him a $300 dollar credit towards a new phone.  When exactly did they mislead him about being a longtime customer and due to his loyalty they were giving him an EXCLUSIVE deal?

&gt;I totally understand your point about the sparseness of our population. I was not misunderstanding it I was claiming it was false. As I said if the population is so sparse why are providers claiming bandwidth is scarce? Why can't we pay more but also get more?

If they roll out more bandwidth, they'd have to do it fairly evenly across Canada.  To do this may require upgrades which will add further expense, which will drive already high prices higher.  Percentage wise I also doubt that the majority of the users really want/need more bandwidth, unlike people in the tech industry and things who generally want to tether their phone to their laptops and download like they do at home, a regular user might just use it for email or simple web browsing.  The company shouldn't be blamed for not increasing costs everywhere to help a select few users who want additional bandwidth.  But this is getting off-topic.  If you're willing to pay more to get more, I'm sure you can pay more money to get a higher data plan, or pay the overages.  You can't expect more bandwidth and for it to be cheap, not when we're spread thin already.

&gt;As well our infrastructure does not reach all of Canada and even in populated areas the coverage is sketchy you're assuming they have deployed roughly the same per capita infrastructure as the states has which is a faulty assumption.

I used to work for two of the cellphone companies in Canada and three in the USA.  Towers generally have a 7-10 mile range, and need to overlap quite a bit with each-other to ensure handshaking and high call volumes in a particular area don't affect service.  Take a small section of one of the more barren provinces such as Ontario or Saskatchewan, and calculate how many towers you'd need to provide service to just 100 square miles of land.  Luckily we don't usually make squares unless it's to cover cities, but then we have a LOT of overlap to prevent fast-busy signals.

Do we have exactly the same infrastructure as the USA, certainly not as most of our northern half are simply not worth servicing, but when you think of how small the population is, and how many people actually have a phone, then divided by say 3 for each carrier, and it certainly makes the cost of the network quite large, and a lot per person.

I think you think it's all just some big conspiracy when it really isn't.  It takes a lot of money to cover even a small area, this is why the cost of entry into the wireless phone industry is so high.  Do we have competition problems? Surely.  But even if you try to crunch some numbers on the massive cost of this network and how many users are with each company, you'll see quickly why everything is so expensive.

&gt;The farmer in Saskatchewan gets shitty service just like in many medium sized cities in Ontario and other provinces (I've moved a lot and found a lot of shitty areas.)

No they don't, they get actually pretty good service.  I can drag my phone to any of my friends farms including some acreages pretty far up north and get a signal providing you stick to main highways or even small towns.

&gt;My Bell phone didn't even function correctly in my last condo as I was on the ground floor (Rogers and Telus worked fine despite the concrete.)

I don't know much about bell, but I'd guess they are GSM?  CDMA signals always worked better indoors but with poorer voice quality.  However if you've ever read your terms of service for any Canadian or American phone company you'll notice that they do NOT guarantee that your phone will work indoors or inside vehicles.

&gt;Our telecoms also have a reputation for never upgrading nodes (remember the whole traffic congestion that ""required"" bell to throttle wholesale internet traffic?) that congestion is because they are using 10 year old DSL infrastructure.

You're drifting into Internet usage which I honestly don't know enough to argue about, nor do I deal with Bell, except for Southern Bell in the USA (not the same company).

&gt;There are countries in Europe with population densities more similar to ours and they are not paying as much.

Which country would be even close to our landmass and population density?  Russia would be a good start.  And do you take into account the differences in wages?  I can get a cellphone in China and service for pennies.  Doesn't mean they're getting it cheaper.

&gt;I happen to be a Communications Engineer who understands that infrastructure costs money and knows people who have dealt with Bell in various ways (also Telus) trust me while we do have a more sparse population than the US it does not account for the price gouging and poor service we receive.

So your supposing it's all a big conspiracy and EVERYONE including the federal government is in on it?  I realize it's a reddit group-think idea that the CRTC doesn't stop all this competition business but that's because it's not up to the CRTC, the [Competition Bureau](http://www.cb-bc.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/home) would be the one to harass.

That's a nice straw man they burn.  By using their logic, there is no such thing as language.  There's no clear line between Italian and French, one blends into the other as you go from France to Italy.  But it makes perfect sense to speak of distinct languages.

I've tried to engage academics on race and Christians and Muslims on God, and I've found the religious believers much more able and tolerant of divergent viewpoints. In the hard sciences appeals to authorities work, but not in the social sciences, which are heavily influenced by politics.  

Amount of gene differentiation isn't important.  It's what genes.  The difference between males and females is one chromosome, but there are different physical and behavioral differences.  Once again, dog breeds differ less genetically than human races.  Geneticists can't tell a dog apart from a wolf.  But since there are universal physical and behavior differences between the species we accept them as different.  A geneticist can tell the major human races apart by looking at the DNA.  Now whether those differences have real world implications in things like intelligent and propensity to commit crime is an empirical question.

&gt;Off the top of my head? The statistics quoted were not ""who commits the most crime."" They were ""who is arrested most frequently."" If arrest rates are skewed, which indeed they consistently are, you can draw no conclusion from these statistics.

Why is it always blacks everywhere?  Maybe you'd want to argue that minorities are oppressed by majorities, by why do blacks as minorities always get arrested but not Asians or whites?  

Ever heard of Occam's Razor?  The most simple explanation is probably the correct one.

After all is humans making the vaccines and they fuck up here and there.   Just recently in Europe Baxter screwed up a batch of vaccines.  Check it out:

Baxter International Inc. in Austria unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in three neighboring countries, raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease. 

The contamination was discovered when ferrets at a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples early this month. The material came from Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter, which reported the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health, Sigrid Rosenberger, a ministry spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview. 

The virus material was supposed to contain a seasonal flu virus and was contaminated after “human error,” said Christopher Bona, a spokesman for Baxter, in a telephone interview.

That would be the same as trying to genetically prove that white people in America are different from white people in northern and western Europe. Genetically they are not. There may be differences physically, due to different climate and food sources, but genetically they are the same. 

As I mentioned, institutional racism is alive and thriving in Japan, as is evidenced not only by the treatment of people of Korean descent who have for generations been born in Japan, needing to carry a gaijin card, but also in the fact that they can't even vote. And don't get me started on the skewed and misread crime stats used to perpetuate the fear and hatred of gaijin. Because as everyone knows gaijin commit all the crimes in Japan. And it is also used to institue discriminatory policies here such as the finger printing of foriegners at the airport. Oh they say it's for terrorism, but in fact they are used to track visa over stayers (which by the way is the crime foreigners commit most here) and, unlike the US where TSA collected biometric and finger print data is not allowed to leave their care, in Japan they will use those finger prints to compare against any that are found at crime scenes, and pity the poor foreigner who may have been near the crime scene at any time.

If the government treats foreigners like this, is it any wonder there are people like this in Japan?

As for the hating of the Brazilian Japanese, well, they are race traitors aren't they. They left the holy moterland to go and live among the sub humans. It's no different than skinheads killing whites who marry blacks.

Simply false. The poor in poor countries are those most affected today by poisons, toxins, and chemicals and as a result have some of the highest sickness and ill health rates on the planet. The reason is because the poorest of the poor now live in toxic soup garbage dumps and often the only employment that they can find is by handling and processing dangerous toxic items, like smashing batteries for metals.

Being poor didn't used living in a toxic garbage dump until you died of cancer, it used to just mean that you didn't have money and had to work hard just to eat, but the work itself was healthy, and the food itself was unpolluted.

For one thing, the Japanese use a system called JAN, the Japanese Article Numbering code.  It's functionally identical to the European EAN, and was based on the UPC-A standard.  All these standards have two things in common - you don't understand them, and they strictly define spacing and guard-bars, which indicate to the scanner the start and end of a code, thus preventing confusion with background imagery and artwork such as in the submission link.  

As long as the designer follows some simple guidelines in order to not violate the standard, any artwork can accompany the barcode, including vertical lines etc.  The scanner being American vs Japanese is irrelevant - standards are standards, and assuming the standard is adhered to any compliant scanner will read them and pass the code back to the register as expected.

Regarding your multiple comments regarding lining codes up perpendicularly to the scanner - you're off there too.  Most scanners accommodate up to about 60 degrees of misalignment.

Regarding your comment that the 'supermarket style' multi-laser (really just one...) scanners can't read Japanese codes - you're wrong again.

c0fgb1g,AskReddit,,True,46,"I've been with 20+ prostitutes.  I'm a decent looking guy with no problem meeting girls and keeping girlfriends but I'll say that there is something quite fun/unpredictable about hookers/escorts that can be very enjoyable.  Said another way, I have never sat at home here in NY and dialed up and paid for a chick just to get a quick fuck.  That for me would be boring.  Most of the situations I've been in with have actually been pretty memorable.  I'll elaborate.

My first experience with an escort/hooker was in London.  I was sent there on business for a week when I was about 23 or so.  I asked a cabbie at about 2am to take me to a strip club.  He instead takes me to what is referred to as a ""hostess club"".  Hostess clubs are generally for old, stuffy men who just want to sit and eat/drink with girls who don't take their clothes off but talk and laugh and generally keep them company.  There is something somewhat depressing about them.  Now, some or most of the time, the guy works something out with the girl and afterwards something will go down outside of the club.  It's London so it's a bit conservative looking on the surface but deep down, shit goes down.  Anywho, so here I am, the youngest guy at this place and somewhat more stylishly dressed than the rest of the over 40 guys.  It was already late so I kind of gave into the experience.  There, I was immediately approached by a not so good-looking woman who started yapping away.  You need to buy drinks to stick around so I bought the cheapest bottle I could since I'm not a big drinker.  Shortly after, this chick tells this other girl (petite, brunette, Eastern European knock-out who looked like a more sulty Jennifer Love Hewitt) to sit down.  My attention starts moving towards her especially since she was so quiet and timid but seemed to be a smartass at the same time.  After a bit, the first chick saw I was more interested in this other one.  So we were left with one another, and not knowing the process, after talking for what was an hour or so, I asked her if she wants to hang out afterwards.  She says yes but says I'd need to ""take care of her"" and that I should wait out front.  So I step out and there is a Mercedes waiting for me and the guy who was previously the doorman to the club is now the driver.  He tells me to get in and since this was in an ritzy neighborhood (Mayfair for those of you who know London) and there would be little reason for anything bad to go down, I got in and waited.  She runs out all dressed down and gets in.  And this is when the night got very interesting.  She asks me if we want to go back to the hotel yet and I say I'm hungry.  She is too so she takes me to what was one of the coolest and best chinese restaurants in the city.  Place had a line at the door but we slipped in.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, I was a bit naive at the time but since immediate SEX wasn't necessarily my top priority, the whole night became much more interesting than if I would have just dragged her to bed and fucked and came.  So here was this beautiful chick who only an hour ago was dressed up now dressed down and comfortable eating Chinese food with me at 4am.  We start joking with each other, very witty back and forth, etc.  Disarmed her a bit.  Eventually we're back in a cab since the Benz had already left and she's asking me what I want to do next.  It bugged her that I was not acting super horny and aggressively since I guess that's what she was used to.  We get back to my hotel and she starts up the tub.  I start relaxing more and more and so does she.  It was pretty interesting because you could tell she wanted to fuck (and not because she wanted to get out of there necessarily but because that's probably what she was used to doing/seeing and I was breaking the pattern).  We keep talking about random stuff and then at around 6am with the sun coming up, we just start going at it.  It was probably some of the roughest, rip your clothes off, nail-digging sex I've ever had and it lasted until 8am or so.  I'm sure everyone here knows what it's like to have that late night/early morning sex that has basically been built up for hours and hours.  You're somewhat in a tired stupor to the point of it being dreamlike, semi-conscious almost.  Anywho, after we rested for a short time, she, in a similar stupor, starts to walk out and even forgets to ask me for money.  Since it wasn't some ridiculous amount of money ($200ish), I didn't feel right dicking her around so I end up giving it to her and she then asks for me to walk her down.  Since work was paying for what was a relatively fancy hotel, you have this young 23 yr old with a white t-shirt and jeans standing in the middle of a stuffy, packed lobby saying goodbye to a 30-yr old escort (dressed down though).  She clutched me and gave me what to this day (and i've had many girlfriends and other experiences) is one of deepest kisses I've ever had.  What makes this story/woman even more memorable for me was that this woman remained in my life for the next 5 years as one of my best friends and lovers (with no money involved at all) as I continued to return to London maybe once or twice a year.  I even met her in Prague for a few days and she even came to NY to visit.  

So where does the 20+ number come from? I dated an escort in NY for a few months but besides that, most of my experiences have come from being in places like Germany, Switzerland, Argentina and Brazil.  Now, compared to the girl in London and the one in NY, all these other experiences were generally just phenomenal sexual experiences.  The one in NY was another example of an escort realizing that I was a chill, good-looking guy that was fun to be around and better off as a friend/lover.  In all of the other countries, I managed to find places where you could basically choose amongst some of the hottest women on the planet and have your way.  Now, I'm not a casanova but I am generally an out-and-about guy with a decent social life and I live in NY so get to see my fair share of high quality chicks so I can say I'm not easily impressed.  In Berlin, where this is legal, there is a brothel called Artemis.  You basically pay 70 euros and get a locker and a robe and get to walk around 3 floors of what is surprisingly a pretty comfortable men's playground.  The girls are mainly eastern european and all 7-10s.  You choose as many as you want and for 60 euros per half hour, you get to take them up to the rooms upstairs and do what you want.  You can keep going with who you grabbed or go down and do it all over again.  The pleasant part is that they are all registered sex workers and you are required to take showers everytime you finish up and the rooms are constantly cleaned and are fairly relaxing.  In Brazil, a placed called Bomboa is very similar.  Again, very well-organized and clean and not dreadfully expensive.  In Argentina, there was a place called Black that also had ridiculously top-notch girls, more expensive than the average brothel in Buenos Aires but worth it, especially since it was in the ritzier area of BA (Recoleta for those of you who know the area).  

Long story short, when you're in these countries and you have some money in your pocket, there are a handful of places that are very clean and quite comfortable that you would be a fool not to visit.  I've returned to each of those countries and places quite often for a variety of reasons, the sex being one of them.  I would say that some of the best sex I've ever had, long/passionate/kinky/fun, has been overseas.  It's quite unfortunate that it's illegal in the US.  The Europeans and South Americans seem to get the joke.",t3_a1r02,t3_a1r02,False,1257561069,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fgb1g,False,46,0,NYFreeFlyer,0,0,,,1426091290

When I went through Europe, the rates at the hostels were anywhere from 8 to 16 dollars per night. But the times have changed. When I went through Europe, it was 1985, but let me tell you brother, the streets don't change. Only the names. I have no idea about the licenses. When I was there, I don't know if I required one then, but I was never approached by the authorities. Once again, the places you choose to play, use the store owners in and around you for information pertaining to stuff like that. You'll find they'll be most helpful. 

Remember, don't believe half of what you see and none of what you hear. If somebody says ""Trust me"", replace it with ""Fuck you"". You can never be too careful. Good luck!""",t3_a1q2y,t1_c0fgabu,False,1257561423,t5_2qzb6,t1_c0fgba3,False,3,0,c0ldfusi0n,0,0,,,1426091294

A lot of sex slaves in the US have many opportunities to run but they are terrified that their family will be hurt.

Then there is also the very reasonable fear that the justice system will not protect them.  I've seen interviews with sex slaves, in the US but originally from Eastern Europe, that finally couldn't take it any more and finally went to the cops.  Now they pretty much live in terror of the person they helped get arrested, or one of their associates coming after them to make them an example.

c0fgbud,movies,,True,22,"Jetset Marxist co-opts Western art styles to spread polemic and slanted notions about a struggle she barely took part in. 

She comes from a wealthy and politically connected family and when the going gets tough her parents fly her out to exotic European locales. Then she has the balls years later to write a graphic novel (with clear line styles influenced by seminal Belgian [not French, goddam you] works) equating her ""embattled"" youth with the struggles of an oppressed Iranian populace. When she gets in trouble, she just gets her parents to throw money at the problem. 

Even her last name, Satrapi, means something along the lines of ""conquerer"". 

She ostensibly reneges on the notion that she is the Last Prophet, then fills her introduction to The Complete Persepolis to the hilt with propaganda about the Iranian nation being conquered forever and ever by a cavalcade of external oppressors, then has the gumption to say what she writes is ""the truth"". Reneged indeed. In the same way, 95% of everything bad that happens to her is the fault of everyone else. She takes no responsibility for anything. External oppressors are at fault for everything.

AND, in a book utterly obsessed with regional politics, how many times does she reference Israel?

Once. One time, and it was cut from the film. Know what happens? Her dad says the political establishment before the revolution betrayed the people by signing a pact with the Jews. Her language is specific. It's disingenuous at best. Think the book would have sold, the movie would have been made if she made her book an actual barometer for anti-Jewish sentiment in the country of the time? One CNN story about an anti-Semitic comic book and she would have been finished. Savvy girl.

AND THEN, she has the balls to write this tidy bildungsroman, full of snooty Western morality, looking her nose down at the stuffy, religious peer group she is sorta a part of, and completely tears them to shreds for their repressed sexuality. Then, she almost completely ignores any notion of sexuality in her book. Twilight deals with it almost as effectively. It's important, and to slide it in under the radar to the point where you can miss it is counterproductive to a coming-of-age story. It's important, and she knows it, and she wussed out.

That all said, I liked it. It's entertaining and fairly well made, but incredibly problematic. It is incendiary polemic with no room for fault. She is the light of the truth, according to her. The balls. 

The film, however, is very nice. I have never watched it with the dubbing, but the animation is great, and the influence of French and German cinema was deliciously hilarious.

c0fgdad,Fitness,,True,1,"Care to provide some research to back up that statement?  To be honest, barefoot runners have nothing to prove.  Evolution adapted us to run barefoot - furthermore there is some research to show less stress on joints.  If anyone has anything to prove about health it's shoe manufacturers.  I run with shoes too, but I think you're being a bit quick to judge the debate when research is only just starting.  Your feet did not evolve to wear shoes.  Shoes were designed to keep our feet warm as we moved out the climates we evolved to live in.  Before the Europeans arrived, nobody in Southern Africa wore shoes.

In conclusion, this statement:

&gt; barefoot running isn't in any way ""healthy"" as some bro-scientists might suggest.
