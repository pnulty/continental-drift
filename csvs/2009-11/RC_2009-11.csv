It's a real shame it has come to this...

They targeted a lot of specific people.  The International Organization for Migration (the IOM), a body designated to locate and compensate surviving Romani Holocaust victims, stated that “recent research indicates that up to 1.5 million Roma perished during the Nazi era.” Other reports show that after the war approximately only 500,000 Romani people remained in Europe. [Dr Sybil Milton, former senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Research Institute in Washington put the number of Romani lives lost by 1945 at “between a half and one and a half million”.](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005219)  That's a figure representing a possible 75% of the Romani population in Europe.

&gt;**This doesn't mean that other minority groups were butchered in the holocaust, but they weren't the main target.**

It is a real shame when talking about genocide you want to get into a who has the biggest willy competition.  It's not about groups.  People lost their own lives; 1 for 1, 1 person, 1 life.  Until there was 11 million of them lost in total.  Don't try to make it any less terrible than that to garner some political leverage - *which is exactly what you're doing*.

&gt;**If you look at history - Jews were chased, attacked and fought against for centuries, and the climax was the [&lt;Nazi Genocide&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust).**

If you look at history - Gypsies were chased, attacked and fought against for centuries,[ even enslaved right up until the 19th century,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Persecutions)  and the climax was the [&lt;Nazi Genocide&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos).

&gt;**The UN declared Israel as a country to be a safe-house for Jews from all around the world, denouncing the declaration of Israel, is the same as denouncing the declaration of any other country.**

See, I've not disregarded the declaration of Israel.  Israel declared its independence from an independent Palestine as recognised by the League of Nations covenant.  I don't think it was fair how it was done but it is very much legal just as any other secession.  The UN did not form Israel however, you need a SECURITY COUNCIL resolution for that.  Israel never got one.  There was only a non-binding General Assembly resolution on partition.  However the League of Nations DID establish a country as a safe house for Jewish people on the condition that the people already living there accepted a mandate and that all measures were taken to ensure the consideration the people who were already living there were accommodated.  They didn't call it Israel though.  They called it Palestine.  It was in this context that massive European migration began.  It was this immigrant population that allowed a declaration of independence for a 20th century Israeli state.

&gt;**The 6 Million Jews that were killed were killed out of being Jews, not out of being activists, academics or homosexuals.**

5 million were killed for being activists, gypsies, academics, political prisoners, homosexuals, artists and disabled.  Some of the 6 million others were also migrants, academics, political prisoners, homosexuals, artists and disabled.

&gt;**Please read a bit on the holocaust, Hitler killed a lot of people, but no ethnic group was such of a target like the Jews.**

You back to crying the biggest victim.  There doesn't need to be a biggest victim, or a smallest.  75% compared to 70% , 6 million Jews compared to 1.5 million Gypsies compared to 5 million non Jews compared to *24 million* Russians.  Look at Poland, we talk about Jews being targeted but if you were Polish they didn't even have to bother with going through the rigmarole of taking them to one side before killing them.  The same with the Romani gypsies - SS groups often had shoot on site policy for them.  240,000 Polish soldiers/combatants were amongst the 6 million Poles killed.  Think about that.  They just didn't bother using gas chambers on the Polish.  They probably felt why bother when you have artillery, a village, a need for target practice and there's nobody who can say anything to stop it.  I'm sorry but what happened to the Jewish people was terrible but don't think you can justify singling them out.  You can't.     

PLEASE READ a lot more on other aspects of other things because you seem obsessed with justifying a persecution complex and not just a tad egocentric neither.  What you're empowering is people profiteering on suffering. Guilt manipulation by orchestrating biggest victim status whilst detracting from the price others had to pay.

You don't need to break it down, martyring yourself in a who's the biggest victim competition.  Genocide.  11 million.  Very bad.  Shouldn't happen again.  Certainly shouldn't allow ourselves in being guilt tripped into looking the other way when illegal land seizures and ethnic cleansing is being carried out.

I saw the BeBox/BeOS demo at Macworld around that time, too, and yeah it was awesome. I also have a soft spot for [Jean-Louis Gassée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gassée). Have you seen [Haiku](http://www.haiku-os.org/)?

Apple almost had BeOS to itself, but Gassée pushed too hard: ""In 1996, Apple Computer decided to abandon Copland, the project to rewrite and modernize the Macintosh operating system. BeOS had many of the features Apple sought, and around Christmas time they offered to buy Be for $120 million, later raising their bid to $200 million. However, despite estimates of Be's total worth at approximately $80 million,[citation needed] Gassée held out for $400 million, and Apple balked. In a surprise move, Apple went on to purchase NeXT, the company their former CEO Steve Jobs had earlier left Apple to found, for $400 million. NeXTSTEP was used as the basis for their new operating system, Mac OS X.""

I'm assuming here you use Windows unabashedly. You may not be aware of this then: ""However, partially due to behind-the-scenes pressure from Microsoft, Be was not successful in getting top-tier OEMs to bundle BeOS with their hardware - only Hitachi and AST (who were major in Europe at the time) did so - which Gassée saw as fundamental to their success.""

c0f7chf,politics,,18,True,"I agree with you in principle but I really want to point out that nobody gave any land away.  The UN passed a General Assembly resolution which was non-binding that called for partition.  For it to have been binding the UN Security Council had to act on it passing a resolution to support it.  When it went to the Security Council they needed 7 votes for it to pass.  They only got 5.  It came back unsigned.  On the day the British mandate expired Zionist Palestinian residents (I know the 'Zionist' term is packed with emotive resonance but in this case that's the right term) declared their independence establishing what was effectively a true* civil war.

Personally I believe it would have been wiser if the British mandate were extended and if German Jews had been taken to Dresden and told they'd be safe.  Any non-Jewish German who had a problem should have been given a free tour of the cold Auschwitz camp and given the wake up trip of their lives.  Allied troops were still present for quite some time - order would have been maintained.  They could have gotten busy rebuilding what the RAF flattened whilst the German people also got busy rebuilding some other bridges.  Of course in the wake of so many of our own young soldiers the immigration channels in the West should have been swung open too.  Up until the outbreak of war Jewish immigration to Palestine had been 10:1 compared to non-Jewish immigrants - to some extent that too could have been re initiated. Britain had to open up to mass immigration anyway by the 1950s to help rebuild.  With all the rebuilding to be done in the wake of death across Europe there was plenty of room for the homeless masses to start again.

Suppose you have 200 places. 

100 places you elect as usual normal - people vote, on a territorial basis, on people to represent their state, county, city, district or whatever is the territory. This tends to be two-party based, third parties rarely have much chance here, just like the current system in American, Britain or France. Nothing new here, this is your usual system.

100 other places you elect not by voting on a person, not by choosing Ms. Smith or Mr. Tailor, but choosing a party. Dems, Reps, Greens, Libertarians, you name it. Each party has an ordered list of candidates, Ms. Smith No. 1, Mr. Black No. 2 and so on. If a party gets say 6% of the votes the first 6 people on the list got a place. The advantage of it is that small parties have a chance. The disadvantage is that these people do not have loyalty to voters, only to their parties, because they have been elected indirectly, and brownnosing the bosses of their party in order to be higher on the list helps them more than caring about the voters. I mean in such a system if you have 6th place on a Dem or Rep list you are guaranteed to get in because their popularity cannot really go below 6%. It means such a person doesn't have to give a flying fuck about the voters, all he needs is to have the favour of the party bosses to put him on the 6th place on the list.

Some pieces have the watery slip or glaze sprayed on the inside and/or outer surfaces. The exterior surfaces have a variety of metal oxides and terra sigillatas (no glazes) that produces a colour range in the hues of nature. The crispness in colours and varying surface textures are produced by the salt-firing. 

Late in the gas firing, I roll up ""burritoes"" made of salt and baking soda and wood shavings and put them in to the kiln by dropping them in to the kiln on a piece of angle iron. Once in the kiln, they volitize sending salt vapour moving with the gas flame among the pieces of pottery. The resulting outside surfaces vary from side to side due to the direction of the flame with the salt vapour interacting with the pieces as the flame weaves through the kiln.

I think if you allowed free movement to work, visit, or do anything you want between all the rich countries, we'd all be better off. I mean, if you opened up the borders between Australia and the US, it's not like you're going to get a massive flood of people suddenly up and moving. I think it would be the same with Western Europe and Japan as well.

Obviously we need some immigration restrictions in place. In Australia, we have Indonesia directly above us, for example, and the US borders Mexico. While I have nothing against people from those countries, I think opening up those borders would lead to excess movements of people which would cause problems. I guess it seems unfair to allow the rich to move and not the poor, but it seems like political correctness gone mad just to inconvenience people on principle.

What do others think? Should the rich countries open up their borders to one another?",t3_a00lu,t3_a00lu,False,1257132342,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0f80gh,False,1,watchman,0,0,0,,,1426086945

c0f852k,politics,,-1,True,"Sure, the creation of Israel was a final slap in the face to a world utterly traumatized by the European/American expansion in the colonial era, a world that supported Germany and Japan because someone, however awful, had to stand up to the British and Americans, but there's another point that is often forgotten as well:  the Jews came to Germany to escape Poland and Russia. Germany seemed like a safe relatively liberal haven after centuries of pogroms and oppression.  Jews have always been deeply grateful for the protection they found in the US, and have responded by making enormous contributions to society, but after the experience in Germany protection would never be enough again.  As the Indonesians do with the Chinese business class in their country, and as has happened so often everywhere, goverments in trouble seek convenient scapegoats, and the Jews have been the designated scapegoats for thousands of years.  Kept in narrowly defined professions that allow them to prosper (and who can blame them for saving money in case they have to get out of a country fast) but such that they can be handed all the blame when the wingnuts need a victim.  When Fox goes after liberals, every Jew in America knows the code.  I hate neo-cons but I have to respect how they manipulated the right wing into staunchly supporting Israel.

c0f8659,politics,,1,True,"You simply have a more complex set of stereotypes than I can comprehend or care about.

The fact of the matter is that we have two parties that paint themselves as left and right, which only makes sense within the U.S.  From a European perspective, we have a party leaning to the right (the Democrats) and a party a bit further to the right (the Republicans) which are made up of a host of groups that are more scattered across the Left/Right spectrum, plus whatever vector one might consider for Ron Paul (which arguably isn't left or right).

In my view, the more critical issues we need to address in this country have to do with 

1) a reduction in what we spend on defense.  We currently are following the Soviets, and are on a path to bankrupting ourselves.  Tied to that is 

2) a need to unleash real competition through Intellectual Property reform and Trust Busting.  If we continue to allow the established companies to make the rules (I put a stand against Net Neutrality in this camp), we are in trouble.

In contrast, laws governing drugs, abortion, prayer in school, evolution vs Intelligent design, homosexual marriage, and the host of other ""social conservatism"" issues don't make much difference.  Don't get me wrong, they may absolutely make a huge difference to various individuals, and yeah they impact our budgets, but they are not going to destroy this country.  Not like spending ourselves broke on Defense we don't need, or protecting established businesses and outdated business models that are unproductive.

Besides, as I said before, the class of problems in the first category do not have a significant overlap with the class of problems in the second category.  No preacher is out there preaching that God will judge us if we don't put more money into defense, or protect Disney's copyrights, or Texas Instrument's patent portfolio. 

Seriously, CEOs for the most part are not putting money into the Republican Party to fight a woman's right to choose, regardless of the advertising to the dirty masses of the Republican Party.  Nope, the CEO's are voting for more money, more control, more contracts, more pork, less competition.

Just to be really clear, If you got your way totally on every social conservatism issue (non-defense related) ever promoted by some Social Conservative by giving Big Defense and Big Business everything they want, everyone would be happy.  You would be happy cause you got your way on every Social issue (drugs, abortion, gay rights, whatever it is you care about), Big Defense and Big Business would be happy (cause they'd continue to rake it in), and the Social Conservatives would be happy (they could stand up in their churches and happily claim God destroyed this country).

c0f93gr,Christianity,Roman Catholic,1,True,"[This](http://m-francis.livejournal.com/107162.html) is relevant even if belated.

&gt;Everyone thinks this is the Irish Feis Samhain, which began at sunset on 31 Oct and that the Church co-opted the date.  However, Pope Gregory III (d. 741) moved the  feast ""in honor of all the saints in heaven"" from 13 May to 1 Nov to correspond to the dedication day of All Saints Chapel in St. Peter’s at Rome.  There was no connection.  Later, in the 840s, Pope Gregory IV declared All Saints to be a universal feast, that is, not restricted to St. Peter's.  The holy day spread to Ireland. The day a feast is the ""vigil mass"" and so after sunset on 31 Oct became ""All Hallows Even"" or ""Hallowe’en.""  It had no more significance than the ""Vigil of St. Lawrence"" or the ""Vigil of John the Baptist"" or any of the other vigils on the calendar. 

&gt;In 998, St. Odilo, the abbot of the powerful monastery of Cluny in Southern France, added a celebration on Nov. 2. This was a day of prayer for ""the souls of all the faithful departed."" This feast, called All Souls Day, spread from France to the rest of Europe. 

&gt;That took care of Heaven and Purgatory.  The Irish, being the Irish, thought it unfair to leave the souls in Hell out.  So on Hallowe'en they would bang pots and pans to let the souls in Hell know they were not forgotten.  However, the Feast of All Damned never caught on, for fairly obvious theological reasons.  The Irish, however, had another day for partying.

&gt;After the Black Death, All Souls Day became more important, and a popular motif was the Danse Macabre (Dance of Death).   It usually showed the devil ""leading a daisy chain of people — popes, kings, ladies, knights, monks, peasants, lepers, etc. — into the tomb.""  Sometimes the dance was presented on All Souls’ Day itself as a living tableau with people dressed up in the garb of various walks of life.

&gt;""But the French dressed up on All Souls, not Hallowe'en; and the Irish, who had Hallowe'en, did not dress up.""  During the 1700s the Irish and French Catholics began to bump into one another in British North America and the two traditions mingled.  ""The Irish focus on hell gave the French masquerades and even more macabre twist.""

I would never claim that being a landlord ought to be illegal, because really there's no viable alternative short of some thoroughly unlikely and completely unworkable Marxist nonsense.... but still I will maintain that becoming a landlord turns you into an asshole. It's generally a dirty, dishonorable living. My grandmother told me once that in the town she lived in in Austria, there was plenty of rental property, but it was all owned by wealthy semi-nobility. These upper crust folks charged for rent only what it cost to operate and maintain the properties, considering it crass to actually *profit* from it.

c0f9973,business,,6,True,"For a GPS there is an upfront fee for the hardware.  They come with builtin maps and points of interest.  Needless to say the maps and POIs become stale.  GPS manufacturers used to charge around $100 per year to get updated maps and POIs.  Now Garmin charges about $70 for one offs or $120 for unlimited quarterly updates for the lifetime of the device.

Traffic information has to get into the device somehow and is usually done over FM radio (radio stations broadcast it as data).  The MSN data radio service also included flight status, gas prices, stocks, cinema etc.  Data used to cost $60 per year but is now $60 for device lifetime. (MSN cost more but the service is being closed 1 Jan 2012).  Garmin now has the traffic data for ""free"" which is done by showing you ads.  The new [Garmin 1690](http://www.gpsmagazine.com/2009/10/garmin_nuvi_1690_review.php) downloads over the AT&amp;T cellular network and costs $5 per month for that.  In all cases the device would come with some amount of up-front service included in the sale price.  Typically this was 3 months for FM radio, 12 months for MSN and is 24 months for the 1690.  TomTom used to do data via BlueTooth connection on your phone and I believe still do so in Europe.  They then charge ~$10 per month for the data.

The GPS devices work well as a scrolling map, but get expensive if you want to keep the map and points of interest up to date.  It costs yet more to get traffic information which isn't even that good.  For example they typically cover major highways but not major side roads so you still don't know if departing the highway and taking side roads will work.

Garmin especially has also been very guilty of removing functionality from devices and then only having it again on more expensive new devices.  They have yet to introduce detours where you can set the length of detour - without it they just take you off the next ramp and back on again as soon as possible which is pointless.  Look at the various Garmin reviews and there will always be user comments to this effect.

Ultimately the GPS and map companies did this to themselves.  They had a nice high margin business and did their level best to keep it that way.  They did slowly make things cheaper but at nowhere near the normal rate for consumer electronics.  Garmin does have the [Nuviphone](http://www8.garmin.com/nuvifone/) but it is too little too late and took a really long time from announcement to being available for purchase.

 RE: Ownership: Turkey ceded Palestine to the British.  

The Balfour Declaration’s commitment to a Jewish national home in the British mandate of Palestine soon came back to haunt Britain and the Arabs. Arabs were outraged by the implication that they were the intruders in Palestine, when in fact at the end of World War II they accounted for about 90% of the population.

While Jewish immigration to Palestine in the 1920’s caused little alarm, the situation escalated markedly with the rise of Nazi persecution in Europe. Large numbers of European Jews flocked to Palestine, inflaming nationalist passions among all Arabs, who feared the creation of a Jewish state in which they would be the losers. Palestinian resistance erupted into a full-scale revolt which lasted from 1936-39. This revolt, which in some respects resembled the intifada of the late 1980s, was the first major outbreak of Palestinian-Zionist hostilities.

Although the strict terms imposed on Transjordan since 1921 prevented Emir Abdullah from establishing official contacts with Palestinian Arabs under the British mandate, he nonetheless gave refuge to Palestinian leaders and political activists. He constantly warned the British against earmarking Arab lands for a Jewish national home and allowing increased Jewish immigration to Palestine. He also intervened at various levels on behalf of the Palestinians, while warning of impending disaster should a diplomatic solution to the problem not be found. His predictions fell on deaf ears, but came true nonetheless.

As the Jewish population in Palestine increased sharply during the 1930s, fighting between Jews and Arabs increased also. Both sides blamed the British, who failed miserably in their attempts to reach a settlement acceptable to all. The conflict was muted by the onset of World War II, during which both sides cooperated with the British. Transjordan’s Arab Legion also joined the side of the Allies, helping the British and the Free French drive the Vichy forces from Syria.

The crisis of Palestine reached a boiling point in the years immediately after the war. With international sympathy firmly behind the Jews in the wake of the Holocaust, Zionist leaders pressured the British to admit thousands of displaced Jews. At the same time, underground Jewish groups such as the Irgun and the renegade Stern Gang initiated a campaign of terrorism against the British. Washing its hands of the whole imbroglio, Britain declared in February 1947 that its mandate over Palestine would end on May 14, 1948. The matter was then addressed by the United Nations, which, after rejecting various plans, voted for the partition of Palestine in November 1947. The plan called for the partition of Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state, with al-Quds (Jerusalem) to be placed under UN trusteeship. More than half the territory, including the valuable coastal strip, had been allotted to the Jews, who only owned about 6% of the land. The Arabs were shocked, and conflict was inevitable.

On May 14, 1948, the British terminated their mandate over Palestine, and the Jews immediately proclaimed the independence of the state of Israel. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize Israel, followed promptly by the United States. The tragedy of Palestine was born.

Much of the valuable purchased by Jews from Arabs?  When...unbiased source please.

c0f9iq3,AskReddit,,2,True,"Why Americans don't eat horse meat: Americans don't consider horses ""food"" just like dogs and cats. In other countries they do eat horses; some countries also eat dogs and cats. 

More importantly, the slaughter process using the captive bolt - which was designed for the much more docile cattle - is extremely cruel when used on horses. Unlike cattle horses throw their heads in the air when a perceived threat approaches from the front. This makes it almost impossible for the operator to get a clean shot - so many times the horses is shot with the bolt over and over again, causing great pain and terror. Another reason many horses are not properly stunned is that their brain is not in the same position relative to the face as is a cow's. So, many horses regain consciousness while strung up on the meat hook, prior to being bled out. Are you sick yet?

If you're not sick yet, you will be if you eat horse meat. American horses are not raised to be food animals, so they are routinely medicated, sprayed and daubed with substances that are banned for use on food animals. They state plainly on the labels: Not for use on horses intended for human consumption. These are VERY common products used on virtually EVERY horse at one time or another.

Since horses are not classified as food animals in the US, there is NO FDA oversight, NO inspections, NO nothing.

The European Union has recently set extremely strict new rules for horses imported from the US. These rules will permanently exclude most American horses from export to the EU.

Nope.

&gt;It's the same as the Greek Church or Russian Church or the Alexandrian Church and so on.

So, Africans and Asians and North Americans and South Americans and Europeans are all ethnically the same Church? Huh? What about those Churches (Byzantine) that are Catholic but not Roman?

&gt;It should be first among equals which isn't how it ended up being practiced.

That is actually how it is done today- the Pope counts himself as first among equals- among all bishops.

&gt;We call it Dormition of the Theotokos.

Yup, that's why I gave that example.

&gt;If I remember right there are still silver plaques outside the Vatican which have the Nicene Creed engraved on them in Latin sans the filioque (though this was from Pope Leo III at the end of the 9th century).

You may need to be more specific. Are you speaking of a particular basilica? Office? 'The Vatican' is not very specific, especially seeing at St. John Lateran is the official seat, but St. Peter's is the most popular.

&gt;Right except it mostly compounded fractures and should have highlighted errors, such as papal infallibility.

Well, no, seeing as it was finishing Vatican I (stopped by war).

The deal this diplomat was talking about wasn't conceived as a way to checkmate Iran, at least that's not how it was presented to Iran.  It was presented as a gesture to improve the relationship between the US and allow the US to climb down from its unreasonable position that Iran cannot enrich uranium at all.

Very stupidly, the French especially began purposely presenting the deal as an ultimatum that Iran must submit to.  This leak from an EU diplomat is most likely from a French diplomat - aimed at offending the Iranians to prevent Iran from agreeing to any deal.  And it is working perfectly, except if Iran doesn't take this deal, it will continue enriching at the pace it is enriching now and the US is the party that will suffer the most embarrassment at the fact that there really is nothing it can do to stop Iran against Iran's will.

But the Iranians are not monkeys.  The EU never has come anywhere close to getting the Iranians to checkmate and will not for the foreseeable future.

c0fa985,Economics,,1,True,"&gt; I think the fact that the U.S. economy has grown by 100% over the past 25 years while the EU economy has grown by only 50% is a much bigger factor than Americans' happy willingness to be spending today and paying next month and the month after and the month after for things they want.

Yes, however the financial crisis might reset that a bit, given the weight (and subsequent fall) of Wall street (the article is 4 years old). Also GDP growth through asset growth does not directly reflect the spending power of individual citizens. Also, you need to look at the other part of the division too : population growth in America as outstripped population growth in Europe in every single year. While this does not account for the full difference, it shrinks the growth gap considerable. Lastly, part of American GDP growth is achieved by breaking the glass, modern style : locking up 2 million people creates a huge industry that add a nice chunk of GDP but doesn't really contribute to individual well-being.

But, all that said, even when taking all that into account, Americans still have more spending power than Europeans. The reason is quite simple :

The most important factor in spending ability for the average American versus average European is the higher number of hours worked : Americans work longer days, have less vacation, enter the workforce earlier and retire later.

c0fak2k,worldnews,,4,True,"Traditionally, yes, but the contemporary situation only echoes that.  Prior to the European domination of the region, the Tutsi were herders and the Hutu were farmers -- a cultural division that tended to favor the Tutsi economically, and thus in terms of social position.  The Belgians further stratified them by instituting the identity card system (without which, intermarriage would tend to blur the boundaries between the two classes) and favoring the more ""Hamitic"" Tutsi with civil jobs.  After the withdrawal of Belgian rule, those institutions continued to stratify Rwandan society, culminating in the violence of the late 1950s and early 1960s, creating a Rwandan diaspora in its neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire (now the DRC).  Between the 60s and the 90s, Hutu made huge inroads into government, particularly after the assumption of power by President Habyarimana.  Habyarimana led something of a coalition government for a while, but his wife was a member of a powerful clan from northeast Rwanda who began to exercise power through the government and manipulation of the media -- think modern day Lady Macbeth and you'll get the general picture.  They essentially created the Hutu Power party and began the training of the *interahamwe*, semi-official vigilante groups who began training for the massacres long before the outbreak of the genocides.  In April of 1994, Habyarimana's airplane was shot down en route to Kigali, opening a brief vacuum of power.  Hutu Power, who likely orchestrated the assassination, quickly seized power, killing prominent Tutsi in the government, and the next 100 days say the death of around 800,000 people -- a tenth of the population of the country.

So, yeah, it's a little more complicated than a bourgeois uprising, if that's what you're getting at.  The Tutsi already no longer held immediate control of Rwanda, and a high degree of intermarriage within the population meant that a lot of the *genocidaires* were turning against their own in-laws.  Rather, the genocides look to be the result of a concerted campaign of stirring up hatreds in order to serve Hutu Power's political ambitions.

c0faoez,Christianity,Coptic,2,True,"Wow, so you basically are a fascist and a moron, huh? Better to have kept quiet at this point and presumed an imbecile than continue to speak and prove it beyond doubt. But I have to commend you for your ability to induce real disgust. There is so much hostility towards Christianity that people (a term used loosely here) like you direct it towards completely innocent, constantly victimized groups that have done absolutely nothing but to exist.

The ban on Nazism in Germany has some rational basis (though I do not agree with such thought or expression-based legislation). Nazism was a blight on Germany, Europe, and the planet, and as the cradle of a political movement that killed many millions, Germany has reason to be sensitive. Although I have major problems with banning political or religious expression, I have less a problem, say, proscribing anarchism from the public forum than I do Santerians. 

Banning Christianity and ALL forms of expressions of Christianity (even completely innocuous ones like names and tattoos) is, of course, has NO RATIONAL BASIS and is the first step in banning it entirely. Christians in Egypt have been peaceful for many centuries. Many died for their faith, many die for their faith. You obviously fail to grasp how important that faith is for believers. 

That said, you're obviously not American, and you have a diminished sense of the importance of unfettered, free expression. The Supreme Court has done an excellent job balancing the importance of freedom of expression with compelling public interests (safety, etc.). I am perhaps overly idealistic in thinking that should be the *status quo* everywhere, but to think that in a country like Egypt, in 2009, Christians cannot simply exist without fearing for their lives? Absurd beyond belief.

Everything coming out of your mouth is so ridiculous on so many - philosophical, political, social, ONTOLOGICAL - levels, I am again at a loss.

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign (fleshandstone.net)
Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO. www.theflucase.com


Infringements
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;

       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza.

c0fb9jc,DoesAnybodyElse,,0,True,"&gt; Sure, they're not curing cancer, but they're having fun. get it? fun. video-games, music, movies, most of the internet, it's entertainment. The bonus is the fun you have with fellow fans and the economic bonus that is gained from it. It isn't pointless if people are getting something from it. just because you don't.

Again the point you seemed to have missed, is that its too much. I'm even being taxed against my will to wastefully spend it on fancy stadiums. Why don't you sports lovers pay tax money for **my** hobbies?

&gt; i don't know much about other sports, but most NHL players have full College level educations and a lot have degrees from everything from business to art.

Oh you mean all those flunkies who get full ride scholarships on colleges that spend millions on sports and let them fail all their classes without kicking them out? They sure are the epitome of academics.

&gt; Again, your opinion of dubious value. People gain a lot from sport. I for one used to play basketball constantly.

Ok, so it helped you. The point is that overall, it is not helping the US. People in the US are still fatter and dumber than many of other first world countries.

&gt; They do get paid, they're called Sprinters. It's a feat of the human ability. some people can appreciate that.

Sprinters don't get paid nearly as much as basketball or football players. And it doesn't really change my point. How about replacing that with ""slapping someone as hard as you can""? Do you get my point now?

&gt; Sure they get paid lots. but how much do you think they should be paid then? how much does one deserve for being the best at something? for dedicating themselves to something? it's how the world works.

Again, its all about what they are doing is helping the nation. If I am the best in the world in slapping people, according to you, I should be paid billions of dollars because I am good at that.


&gt; Think of all the things that would be gone if sports were gone. Kids would be not active at all. all the millions of jobs created from sports and gain bonuses from sports would be gone. From the hotdog vendor that gets a bonus from a busy night after the game, to the people that manufacture the equipment, to the people who transport them, to the TV crews, and the infinite other things i could name if i cared more.

Oh you mean like China which is kicking American ass in the economy right now without being morbidly obese? Or even Europe being less focused than Americans on sports?

I could think of a million different things that those people could be doing that would be more useful. 

How about money for cures for cancer, or alternative energy so we don't keep spending trillions of dollars to appease terrorists in the middle east because we need more oil? PhD students get something like $20,000 a year doing research. There's something wrong with that.

How about better funding for schools, and impoverished neighborhoods? How about improving roads and highways that have gone neglected so much that people are spending 3-5 hours on a commute? How about better rehabilitation and crime prevention so we don't spend billions on prison fees? 

How about actually giving money to people getting their MDs instead of student loan corporations who get to make a killing off these loans and then we wonder why doctors are so expensive in the US?

I could go on and on about how much money is being wasted on the national obsession with professional sports in America. Hopefully someone out there has seen the light.",t3_a0e0p,t1_c0fb8hy,False,1257305231,t5_2r5vt,t1_c0fb9jc,True,0,veritaba,0,0,0,,,1426088674

* She needs to submit the application with an actual flight ticket, not an e-ticket printout. Which means paying for the ticket before getting the visa and managing to convince the airline to edit a real ticket which is almost impossible for them nowadays.

Some of it depends on age, for young kids who are still learning their native language, teaching them another language isn't so bad.

The local teacher can go over a lesson in their native language and teach them the terms in English. Then the foreign English teacher teachers the lesson, in their own way, and reinforces the concepts and they get to hear how everything should be pronounced correctly.

There's a lot of different ways to do it, but that one is pretty common. No country in Asia is going to expect a European or American to speak their language, although if they stay long enough they will probably learn and it will make their classroom time easier.

(d) support defence technology research, and coordinate and plan joint research activities and the study of technical solutions meeting future operational needs;
(e) contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing
any useful measure for strengthening the industrial and technological base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness
of military expenditure.

Without increased cooperation we will have a very hard future, this is especially true for the UK as we have lost a huge amount of power over the last century, and we are simply not in a position to remain globally relevant without the EU. By creating a European defence force we can combine our resources and field a far more effective defence force than nations can individually, simple things like unified logistics would be a massive help now. We cannot rely on the Americans to look after us forever, and with the increasing signs that Washington doesn't see Europe in the same light as it did during the cold war, we need to think about this sooner rather than later.

As for the European police idea, again this is something we will be forced to introduce simply due to the fact that crime does not respect borders, especially when you effectively have no borders. Unless we work more closely in creating a unified approach to serious crime, we stand to lose out. The mixture of laws, culture and legal systems is an issue, but not an insurmountable one.

Yes. I saw the same lazy arguments about violence in the Islamic world as I hear from my fundamentalist Hindu friends and Fox News.

&gt; All I am saying is that poverty, lack of opportunities, education etc. 
&gt; cannot by itself be the cause of religious extremism.

That is true. But Islam is not the reason. It is a scapegoat and excuse for lazy thinking. The Middle East is largely tribal societies. India is not the same way at all (though strains persist in identification by different ethic groups), but still has not fared as well as China and the West. The book [Gun, Germs, Steel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel) goes into far more detail as to why the divide between civilized societies and tribal societies still exists today.

&gt; Caste based violence does occur in India. But are you seriously 
&gt; suggesting that this is on the same scale as that which is happening 
&gt; in the middle east? I would beg to disagree.

Hindu extremism is mostly contained within India. Islamic extremism is far more spread out, both in the Middle East and reaching out to Europe and the US.  What is happening in the Middle East has a lot more to do with history (Crusades, Ottoman/European conflicts), and in how the Middle East was colonized (India/Pakistan conflict x 1000), and in conflicts between Arabian tribal groups and others spanning millenia. The Middle East and the West have been interacting in history for a very long time, and much of what is happening today is echos of past conflicts. The Islamic world is living in a past glory and sore over past defeats, and this is the source of populist anger against the West. India has largely been a curiosity in that history, and the conflict between Britain and India was of a colonial nature only, the cause of which ended in 1947.",t3_a0m29,t1_c0fbrh0,False,1257343911,t5_6,t1_c0fbt7g,False,5,banfu,0,0,0,,,1426088928

Somehow the idea of a ""cultural melting pot"" has become ""they will adopt our culture the moment they step onto our shores"", which is not the way it's ever worked.  It explicitly discards the notion that we just may acquire some of their culture in return, or that they may maintain distinct groups after time (see: Chinese, Somali, Hmong, Jews, persistence of the Indian caste system)

When the Irish, Poles (any major Catholic group, really), Chinese, Eastern Europeans, and other major influxes of population came to the US, the same xenophobic bullshit was thrown at them.  Has it occurred to you that they came to the UK/US in hopes of providing a better life for their family, but that generations of cultural bias are not so easily dropped?

Moreover, the idea that honor killings are somehow endemic to Islam is galling.  The same shit happens in India and China (to name two), just under different names.  We're fond of condemning actions which don't fit our cultural mores (arranged marriage, continuing to speak their native tongue, et al) and telling the foreigners to ""go back from whence you came"" is a de-facto denial of the virtues (equality, acceptance, opportunity) which you ostensibly stand for.  It's not going to stop the spread of Islam either.  Nor is Islam responsible for this man's actions (see: Philippines, Lebanon, much of Africa, and other areas where Islam is prevalent but there is no history of honor killings).

Restricting your condemnation to ""Muslims who live in the West and dislike it..."" is a false dichotomy.  They did not come here to adopt your values.  They came for the opportunities.  Their children *will* adopt your values after a couple of generations.

Given the Bush family's major land purchase in Paraguay, I'd say you're exactly right about some plotting to escape somewhere with a non-extradition treaty.  I cannot possibly argue that our leaders at present are true to our country (besides a handful like Paul and Kucinich), but I'd still prefer my elected officials to have a life-long understanding of what it means to be an American.  

Surely, you can at least accept that someone whose lived here his entire life has a better understanding of American values than someone who moved here 5 years ago?  Would you really trust America to be run by 535 congresspersons who all emigrated from France for example?  Perhaps some of them came here to free themselves from the grasp of socialism that has such a firm hold on much of Europe, but I can guarantee you Obama would have universal health care by now if that were the case, since most Europeans can't fathom why many Americans prefer that the government stay out of our personal affairs which, by the way, is mandated in the Constitution.  I know our own leaders routinely ignore the Constitution, but I suspect someone who grew up under an entirely different national charter would be even less apt to hold its ideals sacred.  Whether you're a liberal or a conservative, if you grew up here you at least have a pretty good understanding of the other side's ideology whereas someone who came from a one-party nation like China would be more likely to dismiss all conservatives (or socialists if he/she FLED from China) as nutjobs.

When that fuck knuckle suggested that somehow God had determined Jews would have that land, there are a lot of bible-thumping types - not all obviously, but a lot - who would agree.

I am always interested in my own kind of visceral reaction.  I try to remain neutral until I get all the facts, but in any dispute, nonetheless, the guy who says, ""God wills it"" loses with me.

As an American, I support stopping all arms sales and foreign aid to Israel.  I support complete withdrawal from the region.  Israel doesn't deserve the special relationship it was with America...er, the American *TAXPAYER*.

When it begins acting like it wants some kind of solution to this problem, maybe we can talk again.  I've been a long-time tentative supporter of Israel (as a pseudo-democracy in a region not known for democracy), but increasingly through actions such as this, they've completely lost me.  

I don't know that I'm anti-Israel but they can fuck off and fund their little authoritarian apartheid regime on their own.

It'd be interesting to see how Israel would fare without arms and money from other countries flowing in.

What I want for Israel, and for Palestinians, is exactly one thing: respect for the rights of the individual.

And for those who keep saying shit like, you know, they're all a bunch of terrorists or what have you, well, for the same reason we don't lock up every muslim in the US because of 9/11, for the same reason we regret and detest Japanese internment camps in WW2, and for the same reason we don't blame all people of a certain race because someone in that race committed a hideous murder, it is time to hold Israel to the same standard.

Their little lines and barricades don't interest me at all.  No matter where you live in the world, you have a right not to be kicked out of your own home, you have a right to freedom of speech, and movement, and all of those things.

I have had it with Americans putting up with explanations for the widespread disregard of the rights of Palestinians for reasons they would never accept in their own country.

As for the whiney bitch and moaning about a ""double standard"" those who support Israel claim we hold their government to, you're damn right: the only reason you're worth aiding is because you're a western style democracy, and you can damn well bet we hold, and ought to hold, those kinds of governments to a higher standard.

c0fcmio,AskAmericanReddit,,2,True,"I think there's a pretty wide range of how Americans feel about America, honestly.  I'd like to say the younger generations see our place in the world a bit more clearly, but the ""America is the only nation that matters"" type of attitude is passed on in much the same way that religion is passed on I guess.  You've got the fierce conservatives on one end, and the extreme liberals on the other (short of the anti-America Americans who join terrorist and extremist groups, but there are only a handful of them), so I don't think you can really break it down to ""Americans think that..."".  

Personally, I do feel like America has contributed a lot on all fronts (especially in terms computer technology), and we should as such a large and populous nation. 
I feel that we have a long way to go in terms of living more in tune with our environment, but we are miles ahead of some other parts of the world.
I also feel that being aware of our power, as a nation and as a global force, that stepping in to help sort out conflict in other parts of the globe are warranted.  But I also feel that it's been taken too far, and in some cases the motives are more self serving than the public is lead to believe.  

As far as Obama goes, I said this from the day he got elected: I do not envy that man the position he's in.   He took over the nation at one of the roughest times to do so, and to try to turn it around on all fronts is a staggering thought.  Iraq, Afghanistan, the economy, health-care, equal rights, and all the other issues, not to mention trying to improve America's fit with the rest of the world.  People are as quick to judge as they are to hope; patience is not easy.  He may be the president, but he's not the whole government, and bodies that large take time to work and change no matter who is at the helm. 

There's also the fact that, for better or for worse, America is separated from most other nations, physically, and it's pretty big.  As an American, you're simply unlikely to meet many foreigners outside of tourist spots.  Seeing someone speaking French or German is quite the novelty.  I'd expect that with the much smaller countries in Europe, and the ease of travel between them, people tend to see themselves more as members of a broader community.  As I understand it, patriotism in Europe went through the same transition as communication and transportation became more viable.  In early America, most of the devout patriots were loyal to their state before their country.  As America became more connected, it became more cohesive as well.

I'm not sure if this really addresses your questions though.  Probably not, heh.  I'd need a lot of effective polling data to give you to give you a fair and adequate answer.  And as some have said, the overall opinion you get on reddit may be skewed from the American median.  I can comfortably say American patriotism is a little too blind here, but in all honesty I would be very careful who I said that to in person.* I'm glad to be an American, but I'd probably I'd be just as happy as a Canadian.  Australians pay too much for video games though.

I'm not saying Israel is perfect. Nor are the circumstances surrounding the creation of the modern state of ISrael are ""pefectly fair.""  But **absolutely nothing in the Middle East is even remotely  ""fair""**.. from the horrible treatment of women, gays, religious minorities, to the huge disparity of oil wealth distribution,  the millions of acres of land that were stolen from its rightful indigenous owners by Islamic crusaders and the people were forced to covert under the sword... to the way that politics works, where it is tradition for rival gangs and dictators assassinate each other in lieu of democracy.  It's a tough neighborhood where violence is customary, communication is brutal and black-and-white, and only the strong survive.  

I can say, that Israel treats its sworn enemies more fairly than any other regime in the region. It is a moral and rational culture that values human life and telling the truth, and it is sincerely more interested in survival and improving the quality of its own future than in getting revenge or attacking the neighboring tribe .

Critics and antisemites like to apply a Westernized ""Swiss country club"" double standard of conduct to Israel in a brutal, extreme backwater Islamist region where rationality, co-existence, discussion, and ""live and let live"" are alien concepts that do not apply... and Israels enemies don't even pretend to adhere to.

c0fcr9r,philosophy,,6,True,"&gt; The crusades can't be blamed on religion, since the roman church is just a pawn

There were many causes of the crusades. Recent stability in Europe leaving a surplus of armed people with no wars to fight, sitting around picking fights with themselves and causing problems. The same leaving a surplus of nobles with no land, who believed there was land for them to take in the east. The decline of Byzantium and the pressure they put on the west to help them. The need to halt Muslim expansion. Empowered mercantile classes applying pressure to open eastern trade routes.. etc. I've always assumed it to be obvious that wars aren't caused by the one event or cause that people usually believe they are caused by. They're usually the culmination of decades of combinatorial and incremental pressures. They're like a pressure valves for evolving power struggles and expansion.

c0fd2s0,Economics,,2,True,"&gt; I mean that these programs, both in practice and in principle, are bringing us closer to the ""abyss"". I explained why each program is doing so.

Many things have both negative and positive effects. Obviously, the fact that these programs somewhat temper large differences in spending disparity help prevent the economy from falling apart.

Would you disagree with this statement apparently from [Citigroup](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=389&amp;topic_id=6694962&amp;mesg_id=6694962)? ""Spending by the uber-rich overwhelms that of the average consumer... The United States is one of the plutonomy countries countries whose economies are powered by a relatively small number of rich people... In plutonomies the rich absorb a disproportionate chunk of the economy and have a massive impact on reported aggregate numbers like savings rates, current account deficits, consumption levels, etc.""

Or how about this from the [WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2007/01/08/plutonomics/)? *The best way for companies and businesspeople to survive in Plutonomies, Kapur implies, is to disregard the “mass” consumer and focus on the increasingly rich market of the rich.

Obviously since you like to surround yourself with pro-capitalist propanda, you would never hear about things that refute your illusions. Watch this documentary: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-take/

When the employees took over Zanón, they lowered prices to 60% of pre-democratic levels, maintained the same pay, and hired more people.

&gt; Your society will create more poor people because your society would be less productive.

Empty claim. What is your reasoning for believing this?

&gt; The consumer decides.

Dude, reread the question: ""who would judge who within a company deserves how much wealth"" - consumers only decide which company get their business, not whether the CEO gets more money or the janitors get more money.

&gt; The only rightful owners of the products a company produces are the company owners

They only have this ""right"" if others voluntarily agree with their claim to ""their property"".  If others do not agree, then their property claim is not based on consent.

&gt; I am not doubting that government and business can benefit each other via bribes, anti-competitive regulations, corruption, subsidies, privileges, and everything else that is endemic to the real world US economy and other economies like in Asia and in Europe.

So would you oppose control of the mass media by the wealthy? Would you oppose campaign contributions? Lobbyists? Think tanks?  Like those other examples, ownership of the media itself isn't anything scary by itself, but when all those are combined with a society in which some people have much more economic power than others, then there is no way your ""anarcho""-capitalist society can prevent oppression.

&gt; Where they would have to enforce the new employee's claims over the means of production.

They don't. The employees are just controlling themselves. They are not controlling others.

&gt; What if these new employee owners decide to hire wage laborers, and these wage laborers want to take over the old employee owners?

Well, if you imagine the society as being composed almost entirely of anarcho-syndicalists, then you might consider everyone to be the government. What they would to is protect the right of people to control what they are using to produce things.  Thus there isn't even a concept of ""hiring wage laborers"" - new employees just show up and start using things.

Remember, this is also a post-capitalist society where people don't even need to work to survive. If these new employees are showing up to produce things, it is because they are volunteering, not because they are forced by the threat of starvation / death to work.  Why would they volunteer to work if they could just get things for free?  Again, I refer you back to the redesign of the incentive and advertising system - in which the work itself is advertised as the reward - in other words, these activities are advertised as play instead of work.

&gt; the employees would be initiating physical force against the owners, and would hence be violating the owner's property rights.

Yes, I know capitalist ""libertarians"" confuse their bodies with inanimate objects. If somone attacks your body, then I agree you are justified in defending yourself. If someone is using a thing that is not a part of your body, then you are not defending yourself when you attack them - in fact, it is you who is initiating physical force.

The difference between right-wing ""anarchists"" and leftists can be easily summed up by what Henry Edward Manning wrote: ""Necessity had no law, and a starving man had a natural right to his neighbour's bread. Before the natural right to live, all human laws must give way.""

c0fd8px,worldnews,,1,True,"Dude. Look, man, we Jews understand it's not all black and white. That we're not all perfect and that the Arabs aren't  all wrong and they have some valid points and claims. We understand that this situation is messed up, we have compassion that many Arabs lost their homes and were treated like garbage by the other states who started the war, but  many millions more of us lost our homes, mothers, fathers and kids in a lot more countries... and we're trying trying to survive in a very messed up situation. We got genocided out of our European and Middle Eastern ""settlements"" so we returned home to the only place we could get into. The UN, US and UK strongly encouraged us to go to Israel rather than have masses of Jewish survivors coming to their countries. We were thinking that we could some be generous and fair and democratic enough and equally co-exist with the Arabs who were a majority, but not the owners, governors or sole ethnic group in the Holy Land.  We thought we could return to our home after thousands of years of exile, and help improve it and enrich it and share it - and somehow be accepted. But we were wrong, the Arabs would rather die than share with Jews - who are culturally very different and no so compatible with Islamic values.

Palestinain Arabs are human, not cockroaches,  but they have been mercilessly exploited by other Arabs for political purposes, and they've been indoctrinated with intense hatred from birth,  and they are rather poor at nation building / planning. They have never had a state before, and have no frame of reference for a democracy or consensus. It's not their fault, but they are conditioned to accept the legitimacy of thugs like Arafat or  Hamas siezing power and deciding all the issues of life and death. Arabs believe it is ALWAYS honorable to fight no matter how self-defeating and fruitless ,and ALWAYS shameful to negotiate or compromise with an enemy no matter how pragmatic and beneficial it could be. They are proud warriors and conquerors and that is a core point of their culture. 

They have been offered land to build a state on from DAY one, and the offer has been extended to them many times since then with the utmost sincerity... but they have refused it every time...  predictably. 

 They can have a state if they aren't going to use it as an Iranian arms depot and launching pad for terrorist attacks on Israel, like they did in Gaza. If they are serious about peace, Israel is reasonable and willing to compromise &amp; share. It's not black or white for us - we are not trying to destroy Islam, kill the Palestinian Arabs, or claiming that we're the ONLY people who have the right to live in the area.

 If the Pals are going to turn it into a full-fledged terrorist state... with no economy or national ambition other than to start a more intense war with ISrael.. then it would be suicide (for both parties)  to give them control of the land so it can be used to create more fruitless and depressing war.

All timed to take place during the holiday season while the public is distracted.

EDIT: I still think Codex is a big concern, but this woman is disinfo, she's linked up to the intelligence community through her marriage to [Major General Albert ""Bert"" N. Stubblebine III](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/THE_FOUNDATION/Events/codex-moderngeneral.html) (also check out [his Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Stubblebine)) who was the commanding general of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984. 

This guy is also pushing the NWO's New Age religion cult.

He says he ""passionately believes the First Earth Battalion doctrine that **every human being alive was capable of performing supernatural miracles**...""

""Since ""Earthkind"" has grown from pack to village, to tribe, to territory, and then to nation, LtCol Channon **envisions going from nation to planet next, and thereby declares the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance to the planet**. Making the planet whole requires the ethical use of force based on the collective conscience. Therefore Channon believes the Army can be the principal moral ethical basis on which things politics can **harmonize in the name of the Earth.**""

""[The First Earth Battalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Earth_Battalion) was the name proposed by Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Jim Channon, an American soldier who had seen service in Vietnam, for his **idea of a new U.S. military to be organized along New Age lines.**""

""Service members of the First Earth Battalion would practice meditation, use yogic cat stretches and primal screams to attain battle-readiness, and use tui na or shiatsu as battlefield first aid. First Earth Battalion trainees would learn to fast for a week drinking only juice and then eat only nuts and grains for a month. They would be able to: fall in love with everyone, **realize the different paths of spirit, perceive the auras of living organisms**, organize a tree plant with kids, **attain the power to pass through objects such as walls (teleportation), bend metal by using the power of the mind (psychokinesis), walk on fire, operate based on spirit communications (mediumship)**, become a peacemaker, **actually change a violent pattern in the world (Maharishi Effect), calculate faster than a computer, control their heart rate—including making it stop—with no ill effects, intuit information from the past (retrocognition) or future (precognition)**, have out-of-body experiences, live off nature for twenty days, be 90%+ a vegetarian, have the ability to massage and cleanse the colon, stop using mindless cliches, stay out alone at night, and be able to intuit other people's thoughts and feelings (telepathy). LtCol Channon coined the term ""warrior monk"" for these new service members of the First Earth Battalion, which is anyone who has the presence, service and dedication of a monk and the absolute skill and precision of a warrior. The warrior monk will learn different self-defense systems of martial arts (such as taiji, aikido, etc.) based on using the force of their attackers against themselves. To alleviate negative stressors and promote healing in self and others, the warrior monk will employ a number of techniques like relaxation, visualization, qigong and reiki to help strengthen and improve the mind/body connection with spirit.""

c0fdh5u,gaming,,6,True,"Let's take a favorite example of mine -- the digital camera.

_Edit:_ **tl;dr**:  Lots of numbers and boring economic crap.  Fancy toys cost more in Western Europe.

Out here (Amsterdam) Calumet is in a run-down industrial park.  In San Francisco, it's in a crappy, underdeveloped out-of-the-way part of town.  SF is not known for low rents anywhere.  It certainly won't be higher than in this crappy corner of A'dam.  B&amp;H in NYC?  I'm sure they get some cool tax breaks or somesuch, but their rents are not really going to be all that cheap.

Salaries:  SF has a minimum ""living wage"".  USD $15/hour.  Dutch minimum wage is 1301 euros/month.  Work that out per 160 hours worked/month and you get a lower rate.  

Sea transport from Asia is going to cost roughly the same per unit -- the longer distance will not add more than a tiny incremental cost per unit.

Europe has more efficient, denser distribution networks; furthermore, teamsters and longshoremen in the U.S. are heavily unionized.  So there goes the ""higher costs of distribution"" argument.  Granted, fuel costs in Europe are higher, but as with sea transport, you're moving this crap around in big trucks / train cars, so even if there were a difference, incremental cost per unit would be minimal.

The regulatory and accounting cost argument also doesn't hold much water.  Regulatory expenses for business in Europe _are_ higher, but again, we're talking about CA and NY here.  That's comparing red apples to green apples -- whereas if you'd said ""Arkansas"", it'd be perfectly valid.  Again, minimal incremental costs if any difference at all.

That leaves [import duties](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds/cgi-bin/tarlist?Lang=EN&amp;DesLang=EN&amp;SimDate=20091105&amp;Offset=1&amp;Goods=camera&amp;Day=05&amp;Month=11&amp;Year=2009) -- the same across the EU.  Using the TARIC code for 

&gt; Transmission apparatus for radio-broadcasting or television, whether or not incorporating reception apparatus or sound recording or reproducing apparatus; television cameras, digital cameras and video camera recorders

originating in Japan, we get, what do you know, no import duty information.  That doesn't sound right, so let's search for ""European Union import duties on cameras"" and we find [this](http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/news/eu_import_duty_to_hit_future_digital_cameras_news_130299.html) which mentions a 4.9% import duty, on top of the VAT of 19% (specific to countries, this is the case with the Netherlands).  

Let's look up the US [harmonized tariffs](http://www.usitc.gov/publications/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/0911c85.pdf) (PDF) -- in this case, for section 8525.80.40 (digital still cameras) -- I come up with a maximum tariff rate of 2.1%.  Nominally, as I ordered the camera to California, it should have been charged at the CA sales tax rate of 8.25%, but bless them, Adorama didn't. 

I could run you through similar examples with France (which has a very very slightly higher minimum wage and the same import duties), Germany (no statutory minimum wage) and the UK (I don't know enough about the import tariff situation there, but I believe it falls under EU regulations, plus a £5.80 minimum wage -- so even allowing for a pre-crisis high pound, that doesn't explain the disparity.)

Since we're talking about prices outside of sales tax / VAT (as I mentioned -- the NL pre-tax price was higher than the US gross price), that leaves licensing fees, as you say.  This is called ""price discrimination"" (not a judgmental term, that is the name for charging more in country X than in country Y for the same product.)  

According to [this site](http://www.justlanded.com/english/Netherlands/Netherlands-Guide/Jobs/Working-the-Netherlands), the average salary in the Netherlands is 25k-30k euros/year.  My boss is a middle manager in a large bank with ~20 years of experience and a university education, and he pulls about 65k euros a year, which seems average for his level.  I was offered a job as national head of strategy for a big international company in Paris last year, and while their salary was a bit on the low side, the offer including bonus would have been around 84k euros p.a. -- my girlfriend's employees make significantly less than that, and 25k-30k for an engineer freshly out of university is not unheard of.  This also meshes with the experience that MBA buddies of mine have in France and elsewhere in W. Europe (and if you make the ""how can you tell if someone has an MBA"" joke one more time, I'm cramming a spreadsheet up your ass.)

So we're not talking about people working at McDonalds for $5/hour in Bakersfield, but reasonably urban areas with higher wages for comparison.  Looks fairly similar.  Also, remember that for the salary ranges we're talking about who'd normally have disposable income to buy this kind of stuff, income tax in FR/NL tends to be _way_ higher than in the US.  And if you want a more generic approach, look at purchasing power parity for most of W. Europe compared to the US -- it's pretty much the same overall.

Back to Calumet / Adorama / B&amp;H, their employees are hardly unskilled labor, but trained professionals with a fair amount of experience.  Plus, the salaries at the actual retailers aren't going to make much difference -- as evinced by the very small price differences between pure ""put-shit-in-a-box-send-it-off"" e-tailers and specialist stores with an ecommerce page.  

I don't recall Calumet's exact price for the 5D Mark II body, but it was around 2k euros pre-tax.  B&amp;H-- USD $2400 (via Google products).  Amazon.co.uk -- 1808 pounds (on ""sale"") from ~3k, but let's assume that's nonsense.  Dutch prices -- from ~2k to ~2.7k euros.  Similar in France.   So okay, granted, in this particular example, not quite the same in euros pre-tax as in the US, but pretty damn close, given exchange rate of ~1.5 euro to the dollar.  And what do you know?  Same exact thing goes for my Manfrotto DX190 tripod.  AND THAT'S AN ITALIAN COMPANY.

Or, the Seagate Momentus 500GB G-Force hard drive I bought last weekend in one of my ""cheap"" neighborhood electronics districts in Paris:  103 euros, no frills, so about 84 pre-tax, vs. ~100 pre-tax on amazon.fr.  US prices seem to be around USD $109 - $125.

I know these are all anecdotal examples, but I travel a shit-ton, and I run into this _all the goddamn time_.   Even while living in Chile and Singapore, countries with decidedly lower wages than the US, this was the case for electronics (although in those cases I'd very easily chalk a substantial portion of the price up to import tariffs.)

And that brings us back to ""companies charge much more for this stuff in Europe than they do in the US"".  

P.s.:  Lest I give the wrong impression, I am _not_ saying ""Europe is more expensive than the U.S."" -- you can't generalize.  Outside of big cities, rents can be very cheap.  Daily cost of living here (again, A'dam) is lower than it would be in San Francisco; Paris is higher (well, it's Paris).  Zurich was about the same.  ""Fancy"" food in the U.S., such as good cheese and bread, can easily break the bank.

I can see that there is some argument that prices should be set locally (since selling at a fixed USD price would price out most ""poor"" markets like Africa etc).

c0fdlnp,AskReddit,,16,True,"&gt;Is there anyone on this website that doesn't that wouldn't mind coming out and saying so/or explaining why they feel that way?

I have said several times that I oppose gay marriage. Not strictly because of religious reasons (e.g. I do not approve of any laws that govern the sexual intimacy of grownups, so I would be against sodomy laws, etc.)

To **me** the very expression ""marriage"" means a specific (but variable in scope) arrangement between a man and a woman. Just as a tenis match of ""mixed doubles"" means that each team has a man and a woman, and I would find it ridiculous for two men or two women to shout ""discrimination!"" if not allowed to play as a team.

By the way, I don't agree that marriage is a religious thing. Marriage is a cultural thing, the product of specific civilisation, that also aquires religious overtones because of the constant feedback between religion and the overall cultural framework that exists. In a way religion is yet another cultural component. In any event throughout European history marriage has always been perceived as the union of a man and a woman to constitute a new family (and yes, there were exceptions sometimes, but insignificant in terms of describing the common practice).

As such I oppose the changing of this definition because it goes against the very meaning of it. Which is why the objection about ""blacks couldn't marry whites years ago"" doesn't work for me, since it was an extra condition imposed on top of something which didn't contain that prohibition in its very meaning. 

I am not opposed, however, to civil unions that guarantee the same rights (in terms of inheritance, taxes, hospital visits, etc.)

One of the problems here is that, from reading some comments, it being legal is only part of the problem: it seams that I should be *forced* to think that it is the same, even on a *personal* level, since failure to do so is some sort of a hate crime.

&gt;I also ask that if people do come forward that we don't down vote them into oblivion. That is a good way to scare people off.

MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: ""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"".

**USAid Report:** The report, by the US Agency for International Development, showed more than one-fifth of young Palestinian children are malnourished.

Twenty-two percent of Palestinian children under age 5 were malnourished, up from seven percent in an agency survey two years ago. Of that number, nine percent suffered from acute malnutrition—resulting from poor nutrition over the short term—and 13 percent suffered from chronic malnutrition—longer-term deficiencies that can result in stunted growth. About 20 percent of children under 5 had some form of anaemia.

of Danish men are at risk of developing testicular cancer.

sperm quality and testicular cancer.

born after the 1930s-1940s have lower testosterone levels than their

Do not try and tell me that Americans are so much safer with guns in their pockets, because that's completely untrue. In fact, the reason why American police are always so aggressive is because they fear being shot at. When cops pull motorists over in European countries, they can approach vehicles with the confidence that they won't be shot and left to die at the side of the road. 

By the way, also don't assume that I oppose the right of Americans to own guns. It's a completely different scenario in the United States and I recognise the need for guns for hunting and for personal protection for those who live too far from police stations or where wild (and violent) animals live.

What are foreign ministers for, if not to answer these very questions? Fact is, there is no mission. Even if there was, it's already failed.

If you're wondering what he means by ""legitimize"":

I hope one of those nine points was ""tell your brother to stop [smuggling heroin into Europe with CIA money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2yYYrkx7js#t=6s)""...

Recall that Abdullah Abdullah dropped out of the election because he knew it wouldn't be fair. In other words, he refused to legitimize cheating by his participation.

No, Paul was writing to the Christians in Rome, not just Romans in general.  Some of those Christians were Jews, and others were Gentiles.

&gt;No Christian in their right mind at the time of Christ would have even considered homosexuality as anything but the most abominable of sins.

If you can't support that from a broader reading of the Bible (particularly the New Testament), then on what do you rely?

&gt;Jesus Christ did not bring a SINGLE new idea to the table

Not necessarily, but He pulled a lot of old ideas together in a new way -- at least, new for His Jewish audience.  Indeed, He chastized the Pharisees for slavishly following narrow little rules precisely because they took those rules out of context to the point that they lost sight of the big picture.

Because I agree the Bible should not be read literally, I also agree that it should not be treated as the well-spring for morality.  Romans Ch. 14 tells us that we must take personal responsibility for our relationships with God and with others, and choose which rules we follow based on that principle.

&gt;The only thing Christianity has accomplished is the slowing down of human progress THAT'S IT, they have done NOTHING and I mean NOTHING that has contributed the bettering of humanity.

That's not true, historically or otherwise.  Christianity was the primary force for the preservation and spread of literacy in Western Europe between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance.  Christianity has also been associated with a number of charitable works over the centuries.  Many of those efforts were misguided, but at least give them credit for trying.

&gt;In fact on many instances Christianity has been the root cause of retrogression, Main would be a good example of this.

I disagree.  Christianity only gets the blame because fearful, ignorant bigots can cite passages out of context to justify the hatred they would experience anyway.  The voters in Maine were guided by fear and ignorance; the Christian trappings were mere window-dressing.

There's an important distinction between causation and correlation, and neither term accurately applies to an *ex post facto* rationalization of bigotry.  It is easy to blame Christianity, but you have to believe the bigots in order to do so.

Steffanson who had high blood pressure, saw his blood pressure reduced, and a minor case of gingivitis went away.  Those were the only changes in the mens' health.

I think if you put someone from a culture that ate mainly plants on Atkins they would probably be kind of disgusted by it, but it would be healthier.  Indian men for instance tend to be dumpy, with massive bellies.  Those would vanish.  Hinduism frowns on consumption of meat, though.

Indian men also seem to exercise poorly, too for some reason.  I always see fat or skinny-fat Indian guys in the gym doing baby weights with poor form or half-assing lifts on the machines.  I don't get it. ",t3_a11b6,t1_c0feby9,False,1257464309,t5_2qh9z,t1_c0fei7i,False,1,dwils27,0,0,0,,,1426090351

c0fepqh,haskell,,10,True,"There's a video on the site, but there's also a (pretty poorly transcribed, unfortunately) transcript.  I'd generally rather read the transcript than watch the video, but the site is *terribly* designed.

To that end, here's the transcript in two parts:

*I'm Sadek Drobi, I'm here with John Hughes, at Erlang Factory. John, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you've been busy with?*

I'm at heart an academic, I've been a professor for many years and I got interested in functional programming way back in the mid '70s. I've been working with it throughout my career, both with the design of Haskell and more recently, when the functional programming has become to make a move into industry, then I've been working with Erlang. So, I'm very much a fanatic of technology - I love it and very much enjoying seeing that it's finally bearing fruits. In industry, what I've been doing most recently is working with my testing tool, QuickCheck and spending a lot of time with my company that is marketing that.

*From Haskell to Erlang, what made the move?*

We had a customer! Some of the Erlang users at Ericsson, especially ... were interested in using a version of QuickCheck, so I made a version in Erlang. At that time, certainly there weren't very many or perhaps hardly any Haskell users in the commercial world. So, if we wanted customers, then Erlang was a much better choice.

*Do you miss laziness from Haskell?*

Yes, absolutely. I have Macros in Erlang that simulate it and I use them all the time.

*And types?*

Yes, of course. What I miss, when I think of type error, is not immediately discovered and that's very useful, no doubt about that and I do spend some time looking for errors that the Haskell type checker would tell me about immediately. But what that means, is that I have to find my type errors by thorough testing. Oh, wait a minute, I'm working with a testing tool! I actually find that the type errors are found very quickly by QuickCheck tests, so I need to write QuickCheck properties for testing, anyway, so that it's not as big a problem as I might have expected not to have the type checker.

*What attracts you most in Erlang in contrast to Haskell?*

There are advantages than not having type checker, namely generic programming. If you do generic programming in Haskell, you can write a paper about it. If you do generic programming in Erlang, it's 4 lines - one for lists, one for tuples, one for basic values. Maybe they are only 3 lines! But it's very easy to do generic programming and I do that a lot in the Erlang version of QuickCheck. I've been able to make what the user has to write, to write QuickCheck specifications simpler and more elegant, thanks to the lack of a type system in Erlang. Erlang is very good for meta programming. It's not something that is a lot harder to do in Haskell.

*QuickCheck you designed in the beginning in Haskell, right? And then you did a version for Erlang and now you are using it to test race conditions. Can you tell us more about this?*

This is some recent work we've been doing as part of the Protest project, which is a project that the EU Framework Program is financing and what we are doing is running current Erlang programs under control of our own scheduler. We define a scheduler as an Erlang process and we instrument the code under test, so that all of the other processes talk to our scheduler and they say ""Isn’t it my turn yet?"" Then, the scheduler says ""Now it's your turn"".

That lets us randomize the execution and makes it much more likely that we'll provoke race conditions. That's a fairly standard approach, actually. What is more novel about what we are doing is that we are generating the parallel test cases using QuickCheck. We found that we are able to shrink parallel test cases and produce the same kind of minimal examples that make sequential bugs easy to find. We can produce some of those that provoke race conditions. That's very interesting!

*Higher order programming with Haskell is easy because of types. Don't you think that types are enablers for higher order programming?*

Yes. When you do higher order programming, you have to know what the types of your functions are. I do higher order programming all the time in Erlang and I know what the types of my functions are. They are a very valuable intellectual tool for understanding the complexity of higher order programs, whether or not you have a type checker that checks them. In Erlang I don't have a type checker that checks them, but that doesn't bother me so much.

*Both Haskell and Erlang inspire the industry or mainstream in some way or another. Can you tell a bit about what are your favorite features from both languages that are getting mainstream in some way?*

In Erlang's case it must be the concurrency and the very nice error handling and features for fault tolerance. In the case of Haskell, I guess it is perhaps Haskell’s ability to capture domain specific languages very elegantly, this having a lot of impact. There are several features in the language that make Haskell so good for that. One is the type system which is very flexible, another is support for higher order programming, which is really essential for defining many domain specific languages, but also lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is quite critical for defining the interface of a domain specific language.

In Erlang I have to use macros to get the same effect, because you want to be able to define constructions like conditionals that don't evaluate over their branches and lazy evaluation makes that easy to do. Some of my favorite Haskell applications are things like the financial combinators that Lennart Augustsson is working with, where you write Haskell code or what looks like a domain specific language, but is actually Haskell code that then generates Excel interfaces to the computing engines that perform these heavy financial computations - I think that kind of thing is really cool.

*With Haskell you've been always thinking it's side effect free, right? Writing a function is side effect free. In Erlang just the fact of passing a message is a side effect. Don't you find it a bit of a problem or a difficulty when programming with Erlang?*

Most of my Erlang programming is side effect free. I think I probably write very unusual Erlang programs that look a lot like Haskell ones. Now and then, I do write side effecting code. For example, when I use the random number generation libraries that comes with Erlang, it has a side effecting interface. It's very tempting when you are building something on top of the library with a stateful interface to build code on top of that that also has a stateful interface.

That's what I did the first time I tried to use it. That has caused me so much trouble. I think every single bug that I spent hours trying to track down has been caused by a side effect. In a way, I've been programming Haskell for so many years, that I'd forgotten just how devastating side effects are and just how difficult they make debugging. I've learnt that lesson again and nowadays, if I want to use a stateful library, I usually build a side effect free interface on top of it, so that I can then use it safely in the rest of my code.

I'm sure you can appreciate the fine difference here.

Edit: also, btw, Israel indeed notified the European observers in June 2006 that the crossing is closed for security reasons (whatever they may be) after the kidnapping of Shalit; since then the crossing was only partly open. In June 2007 after the new government of the Hamas took its place, Hamas dismissed the European and the PA inspectors from the crossing. As a result, the agreement was broken and the crossing was closed essentially permanently since then. So in that sense, I guess one could say that ""in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel to close the Rafah crossing."" In any case, the above agreement does not restrict Egypt or Israel to do anything in case it is broken. In particular, Egypt can sign a new agreement with the Hamas if it so desires.

Cute start. Also, it's Ps**eu**do.

&gt; How on Earth do we even hold the 'big bang theory' as a real physics theory?

Evidence.

&gt; How does nothing just sit there forever and then just spontaneously explode?

If it was 'nothing' it would, exploding is a misnomer and we don't know much more beyond that. No matter how hard we try, there's probably no way we'll be able to look before Planck time (think of it as a refresh rate) after the start of the universe. Also, since it wasn't the universe before that, it's not really a reachable part of our universe by definition, making determining its nature somewhat difficult. We do know there was a big bang.

&gt; And then what? I'm some evolved ape?

It's slightly more complicated than that. But in a nutshell, look at a chimpanzee, bonobo or gorilla that's lost its hair and you'll see that there is hardly a difference.

&gt; Newton's second law contradicts our very existence (how does nothing sit there, and then after a period of time decide to explode)

First of all, physical laws, especially classical Newtonian physics don't make much sense at the very very start. Also, after that it was not nothing, this is Hydrogen and Helium we're talking about. When gravity, a real force in our universe, forced them together, nuclear fusion and thus heavier elements were inevitable.

BIG SCAR ON THE HORIZON…Dave Marsh writes: As RRC disclosed in September, last May U2’s Bono confronted Irish journalist Gavin Martin and myself in the lobby of Dublin’s Merion Hotel. He asked what I’d been working on. I said “the premise that celebrity politics has been a pretty much complete failure.” Bono replied that he wanted to debate the topic in public. He reiterated the challenge the next evening. The witnesses included U2’s manager Paul McGuinness and my wife, Barbara Carr, among others. 
     
     I made sure that Sirius Satellite Radio, which was to broadcast the debate, knew about Bono’s invitation. By mid-June, U2’s New York office confirmed the plan, asking only that it be delayed until U2 finished recording its next album. I kept it public via RRC and my Sirius show, Kick Out the Jams. 
 
     In November, U2 manager Paul McGuinness rang me. After some brief personal palaver—I like Paul even though I know he’s alluded to me as a “Trotskyist” behind my back—McGuinness sheepishly said “Bono has asked me to ask you if he can withdraw” from the debate. 
 
     I said “Sure.” McGuinness expressed gratitude that I was taking it so well. 
     
     “Of course,” I added, “this was a public challenge. Backing out’s not gonna be private.” I did not ask why Bono ducked the debate. Maybe he’d come to his senses, as his apologetics for world capitalism disintegrated with the stock, housing and employment markets. Maybe he was too busy preparing the banalities he’d blare on the new album. 
 
     In the wake of the New Depression generated by Bono’s tutors in world finance, it’s hardly necessary to issue a point by point refutation of his statements about how the world works,. Based on Bono’s response to criticism of U2’s tax avoidance, he plans to carry to the grave the ardently stupid globalization orthodoxy of Forbes, the Wall Street cheerleading rag he co-owns. Can there be anyone else who’s ventured a deep thought in the last several months who still believes that the only path to change involves bending the knee to the powerful? 
 
     As for the lyrics, don’t jump to the wrong conclusion. It can’t be denied that Larry Mullen, Adam Clayton and the Edge can still make fascinating music. Bono’s yelped vocals are another matter, his hollow lyrics--where every platitude yields to an obscurantist pretension and back again--yet another. Unfortunately, even if he’d come up with a lyric as great as “One,” Bono also carries into each project his off-stage political pronouncements, and his fawning affiliations with war criminals such as Tony Blair and George W. Bush. 
 
     I don’t know why Bono spit the bit on debating these issues in a public forum with a well-informed antagonist. Maybe he decided that he’d fucked up and was about to lower himself by going head to head with a journalist. Maybe he doesn’t want to deal on the spot with descriptions of his repeated appearances at the conferences of the leading capitalist nations where he’s yet to ask his first hard question about anything but Africa; about his settling for promises from world leaders that patently weren’t going to be kept, and never doing more than mewing when they weren’t; about why it is that Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, by no means an anti-capitalist, observes that she met him “at a party to raise money for Africans, and there were no Africans in the room, except for me,” or why so many other Africans have complained that he claims to speak for them but has never so much as asked their permission. In regard to the last, I did receive more courtesy than Andrew Mwenda, the Ugandan journalist Bono cursed for raising such questions at an economics conference. (But then, I’m white and Celtic-American.) 
 
     It certainly isn’t my fault that I have to say “maybe” about all of this. Bono never got back to me, or had any of his handlers get back to me, about the ground rules for our projected “debate”--his term, not mine. I’d have settled for an honest interview although “debate” would have been more fun, even though the result was inevitable. No matter how many people sided with my being able to see through the kind of thing William Burroughs once poetically dubbed “a thin tissue of horseshit” it wouldn’t be enough to outweigh Big Time Pop Star status. 
 
     I don’t know. More to the point, you can’t know either. 
 
     U2 could be in a fair amount of trouble. The band is old by rock standards, and on the cover of Rolling Stone Bono looked much older than the rest  because of a physical makeover that tries to deny it. No Line’s first single flopped on the radio. The band’s decision to have its song publishing company flee Ireland for a tax haven in the Netherlands has been subject to protests in the streets of Dublin and has no obvious justification, despite Bono’s fatuous counterclaim that it is his critics who are the hypocrites because free-market values were what created the “Celtic Tiger” of Dublin’s capitalist boom economy. The Tiger’s death throes look to be particularly messy, in part because of capital flight of just U2’s kind. The band’s attempt to alter the Dublin skyline with its Clarence Hotel expansion is another example of its ruinous distance from everyday Irish reality. 
 
     Bono’s self-promotion fares much better on this side of the Atlantic than at home. For instance, he got away scot-free in the American press after declaring during the Inauguration Concert, “What a thrill for four Irish boys from the north side of Dublin to honor you sir, Barack Obama, to be the next president of the United States.” But Shane Hegarty wrote in The Irish Times that only one of the band now lives on Dublin’s working class north side while Bono has lived more of his life on the south side.
 
     “During the band's performance of ‘In The Name of Love,’” wrote Hegarty, “he described Martin Luther King's dream as ‘Not just an American dream--also an Irish dream, a European dream, an African dream, an Israeli dream . . .’ And then, following a long pause reminiscent of a man who'd just realized he'd left the gas on, he added, ‘. . . and also a Palestinian dream.’ This was his big shout out to the Palestinians… You can't help but marvel at this latest expression of Bono's Sesame Street view of the world. Hey Middle East, we just have to have a dream to get along.
 
     “Just ignore the sound of those loud explosions and concentrate on Bono's voice.”
 
     So listen, Bono, if you decide to suck it up and face me, I’m still available. I can’t win a debate, we both know that, and why you’d want to continue to look feeble and cowardly when you have virtually nothing to lose… well, that’s another question I suppose you’ll never be asked. 
 
     It doesn’t mean that those questions are going to go away. Maybe for the tamed tigers of the American pop press, but not for me, or for those people in the streets of Dublin calling you a tax cheat, or for the Africans who feel insulted by your ignorance of their lives, or for that matter, the fans who wonder why you insist on siding continually, if slyly, with the powerful against the powerless.

I think it is important to point out that Scientology also has its operational base in the United States, and some pretty fucked up shit happens.  In Clearwater, Florida, they more or less payroll the police and own huge sections of city blocks.  

So, because American's aren't willing to shut down cults, many, many people are going to have their lives ruined.  Is never shutting down those kids of organizations, on principle, really more important than preventing these bandits of reasons from stealing away with the freewill and wealth of many thousands of people?

c0ffg6g,IAmA,,1,True,"In this, at least, dippyT is correct. If you want to rework the question, the original bolding is terse, but lacks another critical aspect, which is ""the point remains the same: games bring the player into the story."" That is, key to the medium of games is the requirement of interaction. Without having played the game, the audience can't say they've experienced the game. Without having experienced what you're reviewing or dismissing, you can come off as ill-informed. But that's based on the assumption that Mr. Ebert hasn't actually played many games, which may very well be false (although I've read otherwise). I'm not asking for an about face, I'm asking for a withdrawal of opinion pending further deliberation, this being based on the bolded question which emphasizes knowledge and experience as the basis for judgment, within the context of description of gaming.

What Mr. Ebert rates any given movie (or game) is rather beside the point for me. I might give more notice to highly or lowly rated movies, but what I really get from his reviews are his specific points about the movie, having actually watched the movie. For instance, he could very well have simply dismissed Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, but reading his review, he seems to have actually watched it before rendering judgment. And, of course, this is against the backdrop of all the other movies he has watched over the years. He could have simply and exclusively relied on his tremendous knowledge of the medium to immediately give it 0 stars, but instead, he treated that movie as an individual movie, watched it, and subsequently decided its critical worth. 

As I said previously, I'm not an avid gamer. Lately, I've been playing about an hour a week, if that. **The point, for me, isn't really about games, so much as what I see as a flaw/inconsistency in his reasoning and deliberative process.** Take from this what you will; it just seems like things needed expanding.

c0ffotq,Christianity,Humanist,1,True,"&gt;Division, destruction, and separation are codified into Islam. Women are expressly treated differently; violence is actively condoned; the notion of salvation through a final, righteous act encourages suicide attacks.

All of which is codified in the bible as well as you well know.

&gt;And, lest you forget, it was Christians who were behind the abolitionist movement, movements for equal/voting rights, religious freedom, etc. These movements occurred hundreds of years ago and were championed by Christians.

All of whom had to step outside of the actual religion in order to bring these things about with other Christians condemning them for their actions.  Again this is not intrinsic to the religion.  And there are many Christians that would like to see these accomplishments undone.  There is little in scripture to grant equal rights to women.  

Paul said ""Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all."" Which is quite progressive, but other writings of Paul or attributed to Paul pretty much undoes this fine sentiment as you well know.

What ever the progressives among Christians might say about the equality of women the preponderance of the sacred literature is against that equality.  The actual liberation of women and others to the extent that it has come about in Christian society has its actualization in secular law.  The secular law was necessary to overcome the religious law.

There are Muslims that use the Koran to find a better place for women in the same manner, however fate has it that the fundamentalists who understand and support the core values have the power.  The fundamentalists who understand and support the core values of Christianity, have lost the power at least for the moment. 

&gt;To compare Christianity or any peaceable religion (of which you apparently think there are none) to Islam shows me that you, as a student of religion, need to hit the books a bit harder.

Here we go again.  I express the same sentiment to you in reverse.  If you think that any religion is peaceful at its core you need to hit the books a bit harder.  You might start with the Revelation of John. 

The core of any religion is intolerance, i.e. these people are in, these people are not.  Your continued condemnation of Islam is a case in point.  Other than political development there is no difference between Christianity and Islam.  That is when the Christian religious authorities were in charge, life was equally brutal as it is among Muslims.  When the religion regains authority as happened for a time in eastern Europe, the brutality returns.   Religion requires secular law to keep it in check. 

At the moment Christianity is being held in check, as Islam is not.  This may not always be the case.  All you need do is to read your bible, to see that the evil is still there lurking, waiting for its chance to be let out, waiting for its Imams like James Dobson to get their place in the sun. 

If you want me to believe that Christianity is different, then throw away that bloody book and write a different scripture.  Of course you can't do that because you are people of that bloody book and you can't pretend that it is not there.

**‘Poisoning attempt’** charges filed against French ""swine flu"" mass vaccination campaign (fleshandstone.net)
Jean-Pierre Joseph, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, describes the vaccination campaign as “A veritable attempt to poison.” He confirmed that the charges were filed at the High Court in Grenoble before the court’s senior examining magistrate. He said other court cases involving other plaintiffs would begin soon

The various charges filed included one of “Attempting to administer substances…of a nature which could result in death.”

[http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html](http://www.fleshandstone.net/healthandsciencenews/1662.html)

Criminal charges have been filed in France against the French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, the Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux and the Minister of Justice Madame Michèle Alliot-Marie for their role in preparing, in secret, a forced „swine flu“ mass vaccination campaign starting in September 2009, and also for depriving the people of France of their fundamental civic rights by imposing martial law under the pretext of a pandemic emergency level 6 declaration issued by WHO.

The charges specifically allege that the group have
- violated laws against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-1 of the penal code) by declaring a pandemic level emergency without adequate justification in order to trigger provisions in the national pandemic plan that give WHO and the UN extraordinary powers over the French law enforcement and health services.

- violated laws on a conspiracy against the fundamental interests of the nation (Article 412-2) by conspiring in secret to put in place legislationt that will allow for the forced vaccination of the people of France with a toxic and untested substance.

- violated laws on medical experiments on people without their consent (Article 223-8) by planning to adminster an untested substance to the people of France by force in special vaccine centers.

- violated laws on treason by handing over all or part of the national territoriy to belligerent powers (Article 411-2) by activating pandemic level 6 laws that have resulted in key functions in the French government to have been handed over to a special „crisis committee“ set up in April on the authority of WHO’s International Health Regulations 2005 and which answers to WHO.

- violated laws on the crime of preparing to commit mass murder in an association of conspirators (Article 450-1) by planning to administer toxic „swine flu“ jabs which leading expert Dr Marc Girard has said could kill 60,000 people in the country.


The criminal charges were filed in Creteil, a suburb of Paris, and also in Paris at the State Prosecutor’s office.

Infringements
     1. Attempted administration of substances harmful to health such as to cause death (Art. 221-3 and 221-5 of the Penal Code).

We are witnessing a series of maneuvers whose objective is to sell as quickly possible for the largest share of the population of toxic products.

These maneuvers consist of the following facts.
       • File a patent for the production of vaccines against H1N1 influenza before the appearance thereof.
       • Prepare the manufacture of the vaccine and ensure the exclusivity of the sale, even before the first cases of disease appear.
       • Reveal the disease intentionally spreading the virus in the population.
       • Pressure the media to believe that illness is ""Appeared"".
       • Selling finally a highly toxic product that will sicken thousands of people, including a certain number of deaths.
Because the symptoms of this disease are those of the flu, it will be easy to announce that the pandemic does occur and must continue to vaccinate.

It will be necessary, of course, continue to put pressure on the media so that omits to say that patients are being vaccinated, which will not be difficult when we see the full pages of advertising purchased by some laboratories pharmaceutical newspaper.
These maneuvers are attempted administration of substances harmful to health suffered by any citizen subject for several months to one year
misleading promotional communication of influenza vaccines. 
We are directly involved in the offense, since, if our attention had not been alerted by the above events, we would have made vaccine being misled about the intrinsic qualities of a product that is being actually very dangerous for human health.

The plaintiffs in this complaint are parents of school children eat The most serious concerns about safeguarding the physical integrity of children, where they fear some form of forced vaccination implemented without their free and informed consent based on sound information provided by their doctor.
                                            
2 Endangering the person (Article 223-1 et seq of the Criminal Code) 

The vaccine marketed contains highly toxic adjuvants:
       • thimerosal (or thiomersal) is derived from mercury, highly toxic;
       • squalene, product involved in complaints in the U.S. who have been in vaccines administered to soldiers of the 1st Gulf War, and which would have made thousands of sick soldiers to life.
       • formaldehyde or formalin.
The risk / benefit ratio of this campaign is shamelessly skewed. Influenza A has, during the winter season in Argentina (comparable to France) 4 times more people than seasonal influenza. Thus, allegedly to protect us from what some scientists call a ""Grippette, it could trigger thousands of cases of serious side effects. These victims, instead of having suffered more than 99% of cases, a ""bad cold"" for 8 days will be very sick for life.
The legal procedure in France – and much of Europe, also Austria – is that a state prosecutor reviews criminal charges, and if he or she decides there is enough evidence to indicate a violation of criminal laws, he or she orders a police investigation, as happened in Austria when I filed charges in April against Baxter for contaminating 72 kilos of vaccine material with the live bird flu virus, supplied by WHO.

c0fg5dg,canada,,1,True,"&gt;It is not a discount as you get it for signing a contract that guarantees them profit.

Uhh, sure it is.  I get a discount from a variety of places in exchange for things, wther they be the ability to hoard my information, or whether it's to agree to buy X amount of said product in a year.

&gt;A discount is when there are no strings attached a contract is a string.

This doesn't sound like any definition of discount I've ever heard.  What dictionary are you going by?

&gt;Just because lying is common doesn't make it right. Lying to a longtime customer and using the fact that they are a long term customer in the lie is worse.

For one, someone locked into a contract for 3 years is not a long-time customer.  A customer who comes to you for the last 15 years despite not having any legal obligation to do so, would be a longtime customer.

Second of all, he asked about changing his plan and they offered him a $300 dollar credit towards a new phone.  When exactly did they mislead him about being a longtime customer and due to his loyalty they were giving him an EXCLUSIVE deal?

&gt;I totally understand your point about the sparseness of our population. I was not misunderstanding it I was claiming it was false. As I said if the population is so sparse why are providers claiming bandwidth is scarce? Why can't we pay more but also get more?

If they roll out more bandwidth, they'd have to do it fairly evenly across Canada.  To do this may require upgrades which will add further expense, which will drive already high prices higher.  Percentage wise I also doubt that the majority of the users really want/need more bandwidth, unlike people in the tech industry and things who generally want to tether their phone to their laptops and download like they do at home, a regular user might just use it for email or simple web browsing.  The company shouldn't be blamed for not increasing costs everywhere to help a select few users who want additional bandwidth.  But this is getting off-topic.  If you're willing to pay more to get more, I'm sure you can pay more money to get a higher data plan, or pay the overages.  You can't expect more bandwidth and for it to be cheap, not when we're spread thin already.

&gt;As well our infrastructure does not reach all of Canada and even in populated areas the coverage is sketchy you're assuming they have deployed roughly the same per capita infrastructure as the states has which is a faulty assumption.

I used to work for two of the cellphone companies in Canada and three in the USA.  Towers generally have a 7-10 mile range, and need to overlap quite a bit with each-other to ensure handshaking and high call volumes in a particular area don't affect service.  Take a small section of one of the more barren provinces such as Ontario or Saskatchewan, and calculate how many towers you'd need to provide service to just 100 square miles of land.  Luckily we don't usually make squares unless it's to cover cities, but then we have a LOT of overlap to prevent fast-busy signals.

Do we have exactly the same infrastructure as the USA, certainly not as most of our northern half are simply not worth servicing, but when you think of how small the population is, and how many people actually have a phone, then divided by say 3 for each carrier, and it certainly makes the cost of the network quite large, and a lot per person.

I think you think it's all just some big conspiracy when it really isn't.  It takes a lot of money to cover even a small area, this is why the cost of entry into the wireless phone industry is so high.  Do we have competition problems? Surely.  But even if you try to crunch some numbers on the massive cost of this network and how many users are with each company, you'll see quickly why everything is so expensive.

&gt;The farmer in Saskatchewan gets shitty service just like in many medium sized cities in Ontario and other provinces (I've moved a lot and found a lot of shitty areas.)

No they don't, they get actually pretty good service.  I can drag my phone to any of my friends farms including some acreages pretty far up north and get a signal providing you stick to main highways or even small towns.

&gt;My Bell phone didn't even function correctly in my last condo as I was on the ground floor (Rogers and Telus worked fine despite the concrete.)

I don't know much about bell, but I'd guess they are GSM?  CDMA signals always worked better indoors but with poorer voice quality.  However if you've ever read your terms of service for any Canadian or American phone company you'll notice that they do NOT guarantee that your phone will work indoors or inside vehicles.

&gt;Our telecoms also have a reputation for never upgrading nodes (remember the whole traffic congestion that ""required"" bell to throttle wholesale internet traffic?) that congestion is because they are using 10 year old DSL infrastructure.

You're drifting into Internet usage which I honestly don't know enough to argue about, nor do I deal with Bell, except for Southern Bell in the USA (not the same company).

&gt;There are countries in Europe with population densities more similar to ours and they are not paying as much.

Which country would be even close to our landmass and population density?  Russia would be a good start.  And do you take into account the differences in wages?  I can get a cellphone in China and service for pennies.  Doesn't mean they're getting it cheaper.

&gt;I happen to be a Communications Engineer who understands that infrastructure costs money and knows people who have dealt with Bell in various ways (also Telus) trust me while we do have a more sparse population than the US it does not account for the price gouging and poor service we receive.

So your supposing it's all a big conspiracy and EVERYONE including the federal government is in on it?  I realize it's a reddit group-think idea that the CRTC doesn't stop all this competition business but that's because it's not up to the CRTC, the [Competition Bureau](http://www.cb-bc.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/home) would be the one to harass.

c0fg5ia,atheism,,1,True,"&gt;The American Anthropological Association is of the opinion that there's really no such thing as ""race"":

That's a nice straw man they burn.  By using their logic, there is no such thing as language.  There's no clear line between Italian and French, one blends into the other as you go from France to Italy.  But it makes perfect sense to speak of distinct languages.

I've tried to engage academics on race and Christians and Muslims on God, and I've found the religious believers much more able and tolerant of divergent viewpoints. In the hard sciences appeals to authorities work, but not in the social sciences, which are heavily influenced by politics.  

Amount of gene differentiation isn't important.  It's what genes.  The difference between males and females is one chromosome, but there are different physical and behavioral differences.  Once again, dog breeds differ less genetically than human races.  Geneticists can't tell a dog apart from a wolf.  But since there are universal physical and behavior differences between the species we accept them as different.  A geneticist can tell the major human races apart by looking at the DNA.  Now whether those differences have real world implications in things like intelligent and propensity to commit crime is an empirical question.

&gt;Off the top of my head? The statistics quoted were not ""who commits the most crime."" They were ""who is arrested most frequently."" If arrest rates are skewed, which indeed they consistently are, you can draw no conclusion from these statistics.

Why is it always blacks everywhere?  Maybe you'd want to argue that minorities are oppressed by majorities, by why do blacks as minorities always get arrested but not Asians or whites?  

Ever heard of Occam's Razor?  The most simple explanation is probably the correct one.

&gt;There's no such thing as white culture, or even white genes. ""White"" is a blanket term for cultures stretching from Western Europe to Scandinavia to Greece to Russia and all points in between. There is no unified ""white"" culture.

You can go buy the book ""A Race Against Time"" and see that every American hero before 1950 or so was by today's standards a flaming white supremacist.  Whites defined themselves as a distinct culture throughout most of American history.  They don't any more, but if they wanted to do so again (as I wish they would) it wouldn't be your place to tell whites they don't exist.

Baxter International Inc. in Austria unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in three neighboring countries, raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease. 

The contamination was discovered when ferrets at a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples early this month. The material came from Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter, which reported the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health, Sigrid Rosenberger, a ministry spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview. 

The virus material was supposed to contain a seasonal flu virus and was contaminated after “human error,” said Christopher Bona, a spokesman for Baxter, in a telephone interview.

Any sane person knows that is not possible, but they try anyway. That would be the same as trying to genetically prove that white people in America are different from white people in northern and western Europe. Genetically they are not. There may be differences physically, due to different climate and food sources, but genetically they are the same. 

As I mentioned, institutional racism is alive and thriving in Japan, as is evidenced not only by the treatment of people of Korean descent who have for generations been born in Japan, needing to carry a gaijin card, but also in the fact that they can't even vote. And don't get me started on the skewed and misread crime stats used to perpetuate the fear and hatred of gaijin. Because as everyone knows gaijin commit all the crimes in Japan. And it is also used to institue discriminatory policies here such as the finger printing of foriegners at the airport. Oh they say it's for terrorism, but in fact they are used to track visa over stayers (which by the way is the crime foreigners commit most here) and, unlike the US where TSA collected biometric and finger print data is not allowed to leave their care, in Japan they will use those finger prints to compare against any that are found at crime scenes, and pity the poor foreigner who may have been near the crime scene at any time.

If the government treats foreigners like this, is it any wonder there are people like this in Japan?

As for the hating of the Brazilian Japanese, well, they are race traitors aren't they. They left the holy moterland to go and live among the sub humans. It's no different than skinheads killing whites who marry blacks.

I often hear your argument and it is plain false. Laws that take guns away from the legal citizens only hurt those who obey the laws. Criminals who are already robbing you do not care about the law, because if they did, they wouldn't be robbing you. Now you are likely to say that it would be harder for them to get guns, or that gun violence would go down, while the first may be *slightly* true, but the latter is a flat out fallacy. to prove my point I'll use the United Kingdom, which in the fast 10-15 years has seen it's violent crime rate fucking exploded(sources:[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime)   [telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5712573/UK-is-violent-crime-capital-of-Europe.html)). It is also true that the UK's(and other European nations) crime rates were already very low(compared to the US's) when they banned guns([source](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf pages: bottom of pg.653 to pg.655)).  On the availability of guns to criminals front, criminals *already* traffic guns and  narcotics across our borders on a daily basis. There are always illegal sources for everything.

The simple matter of it is that banning guns does not stop violent criminals who can either just stab/beat/choke you to death. You must remember that knives are just as dangerous, if not more so than guns(more easily concealed, easier to handle and hit a target, and silent). And while I realize that carrying a firearm won't prevent me from getting robbed any more so than banning them will protect me from being robbed, I'd rather have it and never use it, than need it an not have one. I don't know when that crack head will just take the money and run, or stab me to death. I don't know about you, but I value my life, so I'm not going to take the fucking risk.

Anyway, to PlinyHarris, if you made the most casual reading of the history of the USSR, Communist China, North Korea, or East Germany, etc, it's pretty obvious that communism has been an utter failure every time it's been tried. Most Americans are hard pressed to forget that, especially when you see the horror reports regularly coming out of North Korea (I happen to live in South Korea right now).

And yes, before I get flamed, I know that Communism and Socialism are not the same thing. Communism is a political system, and socialism is an economic system. But the two are very closely intertwined (""USSR"" referred to Union of Soviet **Socialist** Republics, for example), thus the stigma.

Another reason is that Americans have also long prided themselves on their free market, and personal independence, and love contrasting this with European nations. That's why it took so long to start social security, and why universal health care is such a hot topic right now. What most Americans don't realize, is that due to slow mission creep, our economy is already thoroughly socialized, and the government indirectly ends up paying the lion's share of health care costs anyway.

The US thought of itself a part of England and saw the heavy burden of the taxation. The States had been minting gold and its people were living prosperously. The King of England forced them to accept a fiat currency before levying its burdensom tax. It became quite unbearable within a few short years with massive inflation to along with the new taxes.

The communism and fascism are also terrible words here. Most people that have actually studied governments realize that the US is not a truly free market society, as creeping forms of socialism have taken hold since our formation. Those socialistic programs have actually caused most of our current problems.

This is not to say that a free market is perfect, but socialistic programs serve the upper class. This includes, ironically, progressive tax systems. The US is devoutly against a forced class structure, but that is quickly becoming the norm. The US is a wealthy nation.

Granted the religious police are a nuisance, people still live their lives normally. Ive been caught by them twice now. I havent been tortured/whipped or beheaded.

Back on the topic of women driving, right now only the princesses can drive without getting into trouble. to explain why, here's my two cents.
The country has a population of Muslims, liberal, moderate and extreme. The extremists are the loudest ones and therefore are in power of the 'council' or whatever. Since they are loud, people listen to them when they make sense.

Islam, from its earliest of days has promoted, a form of democracy. There is no King, there is no royal bloodline. Its whomever the people chose to lead.

Contrary to that, Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, The leader is the king, the next in line is his son and so on.

If the 'council' decides the king is no longer serving their agenda, they can just claim that the Kingdom is prohibited in Islam and that we need a democracy. This is gonna rile people up into revolt.

So to avoid that, the king is powerless to just say that driving for women is legal.

But else where, we found the US so ""scared"" and judging of us, the idea of strangers getting together from around the world...they just didn't seem to want us in ""their"" state.

Fine.  I didn't present my results as scientific in any way.  I just made some samples.  Regarding ""evolutionism"" and ""creationism"" however there are no synonyms I think though.

If you want I can go on: ""evolutionism wrong"", 36 million; ""evoluzionismo errato"" 231.000 + ""evoluzionismo sbagliato"" 300.000.  In English,  9 of the top 10 results are about ""Proof evolutionism is wrong"".  In Italian, the first article is about creation of Earth by extraterrestrials (nothing Christian it it)! And a few of them are about ""common mistakes made _about_ evolutionism"" (for example that ""chimps are ancestors of man).

Nothing definitive, I concur.  But pretty much everything points in the same direction.  Which is what I _know_ about because unlike you I live in Europe, I was just making examples.

&gt; If anything, because the poll allows for the non-religious to answer (and the non-religious are generally not creationists), the numbers for those in the religious community would be higher.

What I'm saying is that people with a lower education would probably say ""what the fuck are you speaking about"", which counts as ""no"" or ""don't know"".  Independent of their religion.  At the very least, the poll should have included four results: ""yes"", ""no"", ""I don't know"", ""I don't care"".

It's noticeably less severe that any reports you would find from Human Rights Watch or Amnesty, but still worth a read.

Two noteworthy items about this report

1) The US state department calls Palestine the ""Occupied Territories"" meaning they recognize Israel does not own it, but is occupying it. This means even Israel's biggest ally recognizes Israel it is stealing what is not technically Israel's (everything beyond the pre-June 1967 borders).

2) The US government quotes B'Tselem, one of the most respected authorities on human rights abuses of Israel.  Israeli apologists like Alan Dershowitz try to attack their work.  This is because apologists for Israel's state crimes would prefer to bury the facts they don't like.  I've even heard supposedly liberal Jews at my university call them ""extreme leftists"".  For many Israeli's and supporters of Israel's current way of dealing with Palestinians, what B'Tselem has to say is controversial.
     
The value of the US state department quoting their work though, is that it legitimates B'Tselem's work, and makes it hard to deny the things they are saying.  Also, B'Tselem is run by Israelis, and receives funding from member countries of the EU, which isn't exactly descriptive of ""extreme leftists.""",t3_a20u2,t3_a20u2,False,1257631138,t5_2qh13,t1_c0fh8m8,True,12,TweakTastic,0,0,0,,,1426091724

We talked about how males and females have similar body parts (gonads) that make the parts (egg and sperm) that go together and make babies. I recall understanding that and saying ""Hey! that's how you made us!"" Much hilarity followed.

We always had these conversations at home openly. We were raised to know these conversations were for our family and not everyone else wanted to hear it. Mom and Dad said ""This is how we talk in our family about this. Other families are going to be different so leave them be.""

You know how that holiday started? Haymarket Massacre in Chicago in 1886. You know why they have huge bonfires? Because there was shitloads of fire that day.

Americans, basically, started the global holiday for celebrating socialism.

Yet, no single American thinks about this every single time May 1st comes around. We don't even celebrate May Day like many other countries. We've got Labor Day - but that's as close to ""socialism"" we can get.

Regarding why America has a troubled past with socialism - it started earlier than the McCarthy-era and the Cold War. Pretty much every single industrial country in the world around the 1910-1920s or so got their own socialist party because of labor movements. However, the United States was (if the only one) country where it did not materialize to the same large extent as elsewhere.

c0fhhyg,atheism,,1,True,"&gt;You come across as an apologist for religion who would say anything to show christianity in a good light. 

I really don't understand that statement, as we're both showing Christianity in a good light. Your argument is that the classical works were preserved in Greek libraries whence they were re-introduced to Western Europe (which I haven't argued against, but more later), and those were run by Christians. Well, I don't know for sure [clarification edit: I don't know for sure that they were Christian], but I'm willing to bet.

&gt;your argument shifts and changes between replies so much that it contradicts what you said earlier

I've made three claims that I can remember:

1. The Dark Ages were dark largely because of the fall of Rome.

2. Christians preserved classical works through the dark ages.

3. Classical science and philosophy is largely consistent with Christian theology (by design of the Christian theologians).

If you detect an inconsistency in what I've said, please be specific, so that I can respond appropriately. Blanket accusations without bothering with specific examples is weak.

Here, I'll start with the specificity. My biggest issues regards your position that Christian monks did not preserve any books about subjects other than Christian theology. I already showed you the link to the pop-history book by Cahill, but since you're so discriminating of the source material provided by others, here's an excerpt from a scholarly work available on [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=JskpAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=9gEv58rmF6&amp;dq=classical%20works%20preserved%20by%20monks%20during%20the%20middle%20ages&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=classical%20works%20preserved%20by%20monks%20during%20the%20middle%20ages&amp;f=false).

&gt;&gt;In the first [monastic] schools, founded by Cassian [late 4th C], the course was of an elementary and narrow sort, and was intended to prepare for only the bare duties of the monastic life. The embryo monks were required to learn to read, in order to study the Bible; to write, that ehy might copy the sacred books; and to calculate, for the sake of computing Church festivals. This limited training became even more formal and illiberal under the immediate successors of Cassian, but by the time of Benedict [early 5th C], the Christians, having succeeded in establishing their ideals, felt that the pagan culture was no longer threatening and began to introduce the Graeco-Roman learning into the course of study. By this time the pagan authors themselves had somewhat fallen into disure, but practically none of the actual knowledge of the classical times had disappeared. It remained in that condensed and rather dry form known as the Seven Liberal Arts.

Later:

&gt;&gt;As we have seen, a knowledge of classifcal literature had never altogether disappeared, and various works had been preserved by the monks and others. To search out the manuscripts of the Latin and Greek writers, the monasteries, cathedrals, and castles were now ransacked from end to end.

I honestly didn't try to find a refutation to your claim that the Greeks were responsible for the re-introduction of classical works leading to the Renaissance, but I found one nonetheless:

&gt;&gt;The old statement that the Renaissance was caused by the accidental recovery of classical works, or, still worse, by the Greek teachers taking refuge in Italy after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, shows an ignorance of the social movements in the Middle Ages.

c0fhj0m,IAmA,,6,True,"Not the OP, but I can answer the first one:  
You can find freezers and fridges of all shapes and sizes in Germany, but especially for single (person) households it's quite common to just have a fridge that has a small freezing compartment inside that (at best) only a few frozen pizzas will fit into. This type of fridge is called a ""[Kühlschrank mit Gefrierfach](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22K%C3%BChlschrank%20mit%20Gefrierfach%22&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi)"" (literally ""fridge with freezing compartment""). On the whole, Germany is probably keener on fresh and non-processed foods (and home cooking, often the hard way) than the US, and on the whole there is less of a suburban sprawl and mall shopping model than in the US. It would be relatively uncommon for Germans to drive a big car to some ginormous mall and load up and fill the freezer with a month's worth of food (not that I'm claiming that everybody in the US did this either).

Its a sort of natural selection. Those countries which deliberately isolated themselves managed to save themselves from subversive American interference. And Libya and Syria are much more open, peaceful, tolerant and stable compared to the US sponsored regimes in the area.

Pretty much. Since the West actively sponsors and props these regimes up. 

&gt;and the Middle Eastern dictatorships with no real diplomatic connection to the West are also America's fault?

They are a distinct minority but American is still to blame for that. They wouldn't be so dictatorial if it wasn't for America's subversive aims in the region.

We've done this before, Ocin. From this point out I'm not going to address your ridiculous assertions which have no basis in reality.

I'll simply direct you to any number of objective studies and rankings of political, social, media freedoms in the region. For example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index

&gt;Until European colonialism starting raping and fucking up the area it worse no worse than the rest of the world. Further Muslims can't take responsibility because its out of their control. The West, particularly America now, is primarily responsible for the mess in the region.

The idea that the 19th century European adventures in the middle east is soley responsible for the miserable state of the Middle East is indefensible. 

The Muslim world has *always* awful government. Since the time of the prophet. It has been run by a succession of theocratic, imperialistic Caliphates, brutal Ottomans, self-interested European empires and all the way down to the Gaddaffis and Ayatollahs of today

In fact, up to about 300 years ago, just about every nation in the world was a repressive dictatorship, Europe included. 

But we in the West and Europe had something called the Enlightenment. There's where we decided that autocratic Monarchies are shitty and Christianity is fucking stupid. So you know what we did? We cut off the heads of the kings and wrote the separation of church and state into our constitutions. 

The Islamic world has never had any sort of ideological shift of that scale, and as a direct result still, for the most part, lives under the same level of political and social freedom of a medieval Europe. 
In fact, with the exception of pre-Civil War Lebanon (which I'll even ignore was mostly Christian at the time), not a single Muslim nation has ever proven itself as capable of conducting it's affairs in a way that half-way resembles civility. And unfortunately, the vast majority of the Muslim world doesn't really seem to have much of a problem with this. 

If the Islamic world truly does desire freedom and democracy, it needs to realize that the power and responsibility of a batter fate and future lies not in 7th century desert myths and half-baked historical grievances, but their own will and propensity for stand-up and demand it.

I think Israel is looking for a more peaceful solution but it's difficult when withdrawals from Palestinian territory don't ensure peace (look at Gaza post-pullout, and the absurd amount of Qassam rockets fired since).  I think most Israelis are indifferent to the concept of settlements but resent that the issue is being hijacked to block the peace process more than anything else.  

In any event, I had to take issue with your characterization of Israel as a European colony.  We're Israelis and we belong to nobody but ourselves.  And Europe can go take a flying fuck for how much support we've received from them lately.  If they're in on this unilateral declaration of PA independence on the horizon, they can stop considering themselves friends of Israel.

It's not that I don't want the Palestinians to have a state; it's that I think that a move back to the '67 borders without modifications is essentially a death sentence for the state of Israel.  The borders would be indefensible at points - Haifa would be a short walk from the borders and once the Golan were cut off from the rest of Israel it would fall very quickly to Syria.

It's odd how the international community is very quick to say that Israel is at fault for not providing the Palestinians with infrastructural support to get water (thanks Amnesty International) or that Israel is at fault for clumsy handling of urban warfare (thanks Goldstone), but nobody can point to a time when they've treated a refugee population any better, and nobody pledges monetary or logistical support to solve the problems on the ground in Palestinian life tht they claim are so important, and nobody points out that Hamas and Fatah are responsible for managing the development of their own fledgling state (which they're getting better at, I'm a fan of Salam Fayyad as far as his domestic priorities go), and nobody talks about Gilad Shalit, and nobody mentions that the Palestinian leadership bore the sole responsbility for abandoning the Clinton Plan (not to plagiarize Babylon 5, but that looked like our last, best hope for peace) on the eve of the millennium.

I never felt like I was in danger but I did get fucked with a couple of times when I was walking alone, once in Berlin and once in a small town in Germany.  In both cases, they tried to verbally harass me, and in the second case, I have to say, I'm really proud of the way I responded.  A dude who started talking to me pleasantly on the bus got off with me and started trying to follow me home.  I said ""Leave me alone"" in German, which is the only phrase I knew to use in that sort of situation.  I really didn't want to leave the bus station on the long dark walk to my home with this creep trying to talk to me.  (I looked to a passing German lady who was the only other person around, and she looked at the situation and was like ""Too bad.  You should call a cab.  Don't be stupid.""  and walked away.  Yeah, like there were cabs around there.)  

I finally gave up trying to communicate in German with him and just started yelling at him in English, cursing him off and telling him to get the fuck away from me.  He nevertheless continued to follow me home, and went about halfway there, with me yelling at him and cursing him out.  I faced him, walking backwards so that he wouldn't have the opportunity to grab me by the hair, which I had heard is a common tactic in rape situations.  All the yelling I did served a dual purpose of attracting some attention from the surrounding homes, though no one actually came outside.  After a while he lost his mojo and started to just feel stupid, turned around and left me alone.  It was thrilling and I was so happy that I could protect myself using only my voice.  Pretty great.  There's no way that would work in an American city, LOL.  So, I guess my point is, it's pretty safe.

Edit: Also, watch your stuff.  I never got mugged anywhere, but I did have a bag stolen in, of all places, Leuven, Blegium, which has a ridiculously low crime rate.  The trains going through Italy are notorious for thieves who target tourists.  I know two people who had their backpack (containing all their travelling possessions) stolen on a train in Italy.  You never know what might happen, so keep your valuables in a money belt, get a cord with a small padlock to lock up your bag in your hostel or on a train, etc.  

Sorry that this comment focused on the negative.  I just wanted to say that you should be careful.  But **you should definitely go!!!!**  It will be amazing and it's very easy to meet fellow travelers on trains and in hostels.

1. Germany is an EU country hence if you can get yourself a visa for any other EU country you can live there but maybe not work there. Because the EU is supposed to be borderless this makes restricting the residence of someone who has a visa fro one EU country practically impossible between the EU states. Here is a list of EU countries (not EEC this is different for visas)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_EU_countries.

2. If you have a degree you may automatically qualify for a visa from some EU country.

3. You're Austrailian so at some stage in you families history you were a European. This might help you get an EU passport. For example if you have 2 grandparents that were Irish citizens you yourself can get an Irish passport. The repatriation process for Ireland in particular is somewhat simple but I believe you may have to live in Ireland for some time before you can take advantage of it.

But for almost 8 years she was here on temporary visas. I always found it incredibly easy for her to stay in Germany, all that was necessary where a few forms and about an hour every year to get your visa renewed.
Since you did an exchange year here you should already have ties to a German university, it should be fairly easy to sign up at that university (or any other for that matter) for a similar degree ... so instead of acquiring an Australian degree you'll strive for a German one. You should already know the department at your university that can help you with this, there are guidance departments for foreign students at just about all German university.
You will have to give your local Ausländeramt a short update about how your studies are going and when you will probably get your degree every time you want your visa renwed but that's usually just a short and friendly conversation and they have always been quite understanding even if the final date kept slipping ...

If you finished your studies already or you don't want to study any more for whatever reasons a temporary work visa is an alternative. The official guidelines for a job that would qualify you for one are complex but I believe it has to officially be temporary in nature (e.g. three years, four years etc.) but your work contract and visa can always be extended and I think it is supposed to be a job that you are uniquely qualified for, i.e. a German just wouldn't be as qualified. For you as a native English speaker there should be hundreds of jobs like that.

If you don't speak french already this is going to be hard, except in Montreal. And then, if you move to Montreal, you never really have to learn french because every shops/stores/restaurants have bilingual people to serve you.

This being said, there are probably a lot of programs to learn french through ""French as a second-language"" courses in universities/colleges and such.

The best way to learn a language however is to be in it. If you move to Quebec City, you'll have trouble finding a job ( because few jobs don't require french ) but you'll be in a world where you will have to learn some french to get by and this is a great incentive...

As it being ""proper"" french, it only means that you will speak with a slightly different accent than they do in France. Analog to American english VS British english. Being a french-speaking Canadian myself, I never had any problem being understood in Europe.

What is your college degree ? If you majored in History, I am not sure you can move to Canada and hope to get a job or a work permit. So this is a consideration... Before making the big move, you should make sure you have the proper papers to work in Canada. 

On another note, I have seen Americans coming here and thinking that they own the world; arrogant bullies making a lot of noise. These types of people are never welcome anywhere.

c0fihyi,photography,,2,True,"Hi,
    DONT spend that much on a camera for this trip. Insuring gear on long distance cycling trips is hell. I am due to leave in february, for a similar trip through europe and asia. Im going to be using a k200d with a sigma 10-20mm, and the stock 18-55mm lens. It is the perfect camera for travel: Its weather sealed, cheap, and uses AA batteries(you really cant rely on a solar charger. Although i am taking one, im making sure most of my stuff can run on store bought batteries; the sun doesn't always shine.) It's also a superb camera, with a huge, cheap back-catalogue of lenses.. It'll take as good a picture as you'll ever need. But the key bit is cost: all in, with some decent lenses you're looking at no more than $700. And that's essential, when you cant insure it. And, trust me; if you plan to be gone for more than 3 months, you aren't insuring it, and if you can find a company who will do it, you can't afford it. Same applies to all your other equipment.

So, for my second point: Don't buy expensive touring gear. For the past year of touring scotland, ireland and france(15000 miles) I have used a £100($160) steel frame mountain bike, with schwalbe  road tyres, cheap steel pannier racks, and muilitary surplus adapted canvas panniers. All in, including tent, camera, bike, panniers, utensils, etc I travel with £800 pounds worth of gear, and plan to go up to no more than £1200 for my world trip. And, not because I couldn't afford to spend more; because I couldn't afford to lose more. Insurance is either impossible, or not worth it for world travel; so go cheap.

c0fitex,AskReddit,,1,True,"&gt;Isn't that common in hardware companies?

It's common in hardware companies that are writing a proprietary realtime OS (or firmware for that matter - as in many cases it's hard to even call it an OS) to work with one piece of hardware performing one set of tasks, optimized to work with one set of hardware to keep costs down.  It is not common at this point for a general purpose Operating System.

The OS for those devices aren't products in any real sense of the word.  There's no market.

In both your console example and your DVD player example, this is the case.  You're talking about hardware companies that wrote the software as a necessity for performing tasks related to hardware that they are selling and optimized that OS for the hardware.  The reason that you can't run Sanyo DVD firmware on your Panasonic is not because Sanyo is afraid that you'll try to use their awesome OS on another DVD player.  It's because they wanted to write for exactly one set of hardware and deal with writing an entire driver layer to deal with every other DVD player out there.  

The primary difference?  No one cares.  There's no consumer market for DVD player OSes and it's pretty hard to abuse a market that doesn't exist.

&gt;The only thing that Apple really does is say ""If you want to run our OS, you have to run it on our hardware"".

Right, and with their marketshare, they're likely to be okay saying that.  If they had a larger marketshare, they'd be in court for it.  Imagine Microsoft buying out Dell and making their OS only run on those machines (for absolutely no technical reason - just to force you to buy their hardware.)  Tell me you'd be okay with that.

As to the browser, there's nothing forcing you to use IE on Windows either, and yet they still ended up in court for reasons related to this and still had EU forcing them to make a list offering alternatives.  

The difference is that Microsoft holds a large segment of the market.  If Apple did, they'd be in a lot more trouble.",t3_a228j,t1_c0fidgn,False,1257733505,t5_2qh1i,t1_c0fitex,False,1,[deleted],0,0,0,,,1426092481

Consider the fact that ""historically, the idea of race emerged in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, coinciding with the growth of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade."" Scientists have also questioned the validity of the US Census because ""the number of potential biologically based racial groupings is enormous.

Don't bother asking the Ausländerbehörde. I don't want to say every case manager is like this, but chances ending up to talk to someone grumpy are not small.

Your best bet to get useful information are:

- The office for foreign students or whatever it's called at your uni. (The Studentensekretariat or the AStA should be able to tell you where you have to go at your university.) They know the immigration rules and loop holes, have experience with people in similar situation like you are currently in and know what to do and which forms you have to fill out and what you should and shouldn't tell or do at the Ausländerbehörde.

- The AStA at your university might be a good place to ask where you can get information, as well. In case you don't have an AStA, the Fachschaft of your faculty can tell you the equivalent for the AStA at your uni. Maybe they have an own Referat for foreigners. Some universities do.

- The Studentenwerk

- There are immigration boards in Germany for people who want to immigrate to Germany. You might be able to get some useful information there, too. 

- Other foreign students at your university. Are you living in a dorm? Go next door and ask the guy/girl from South America, Africa, China or whereever from outside of the EU they are from. What do they do? Where do they go for advice and support? Where do they get their information from? What are their experiences? You are not alone in this situaton.

c0fk0sh,pics,,2,True,"Thanks for the reply. 

You made the point that people living 200 years ago could not forsee all the changes that would occur. and that government and finance developed in reaction to changes that took place, learning lessons and adapting. Point well made, although I don't think you should have brought up the complexity of machines at the time, as that does not have as much bearing on real economics.

Yes, gold is a ""barbaric metal"", but *all* money is barbaric. I'm not sure why the anti-gold crowd should single out gold. *All* fiat monies are prone to wild swings in evaluations. How many trillions of them went to bit heaven over the past year, since the last crisis provoked by the capitalistic excesses of the current regime? Would a gold standard have proven more robust? Can't know for sure.

How about housing? That's fluctuated wildly. Commercial real estate is on track to crash this year. Add that to the ""fluctuation"" index. 
Nothing is really stable, even with (or maybe especially with) politicians and bankers jiggering up the money supply.

Another kink in your argument: you said that rampant pollution was bad, AND that slow growth was bad. Pollution corresponds to fast (uncontrolled, cancerous) economic growth. Look at much of the developing world today.

What we have is a fiat money system, characterized by periods of credit-fueled expansion, where individuals go into debt to the banks, followed by periods of economic contraction, when indebted individuals lose their farms, homes, and businesses in foreclosure. 

Loose money - mania - expansion - debt - the wave comes in. 

Crunch - tight money - contraction - the wave retreats, taking the real property of the people and handing it to bankers who produced nothing tangible.

This is what the gold bugs say, anyway. They figure that you can't print up gold like you can paper money, and that giving anyone the power to do so is giving them too much power, period. ""Shaving"", the practice of shaving parts of a coin and making new coin out of the shavings, can be discovered, and is obviously fraudulent. In the fiat, digital money economy, there's no way for regular people to detect it. No ridges on the edge of a digital dollar. No way for them to judge it fraudulent, because they generally don't understand.

Certainly, Jefferson understood. There were periods of globalization in Europe before Jefferson wrote that. There was an active and open debate on what is good monetary policy. Even regular Americans knew enough back in the turn of the century to form an opinion on it. Today, not so much.

I don't think that we can overcome the inertia of the past and change the money system in America, or influence the rest of the world very much. Because of that, I am absolutely positive that there are going to be further crashes, and crises caused or exacerbated by the current money system. Real people are going to suffer.

Debt-based, interest-bearing money is not sustainable. I think the people that ""TJ"" debated with back in his day understood that very well. I don't think the system was designed to be sustainable.

c0fk2ld,Economics,,1,True,"&gt;Number one, please explain how any countries without massive water reserves don't have shortages, and why Venezuela does.

Other countries do have shortages... You can't be suggesting that only Venezuela has such issues, countries in the EU have issues with this, I'm sure the US has issues with this on occasion too.

&gt;But no, supply is not completely inelastic. In practice, there is always more water to be found in new rivers, streams, springs or lakes,

But that is water that is either needed elsewhere, simply not there (in a drought) or in the wrong place to be treated and distributed...

&gt;some countries they even desalinate sea water, or immediately reprocess used water.

Indeed, but that involves both time and investment, neither of which are going to help in the short term.

&gt;There is absolutely no basis for saying supply is completely inelastic.

So how the hell do people and indeed cattle die in the hundreds of thousands when conditions are poor?  Why do these places not simply do one of the things you suggest? Hell I can even answer that, either it is a situation that hasn't been planned for and cannot be dealt with in the period in which it is needed, it is rare enough that no preventative measures have been taken (EU, US etc..), or there is no interest in investing in the distribution or supply because there is little or no profit to be made (look at both domestic and international water companies operating in continental Africe for this...).

&gt;And ""necessity"" is subjective, demand would still be a better way to phrase it. Besides, eventually it would be cheaper for any person to move somewhere where there was a river or other source of fresh water if the cost of getting water where they were was sufficiently high.

Right, move somewhere were there is fresh water (not clean water I note), I see.  Mass movement of refugees is better than doing something to ensure equitable distribution.  I'm sure that is less dangerous to the economy of a country than the rationing of water.

&gt;That's why people tend not to live in deserts. But all this is sort of irrelevant--free countries all meet demand for water, 99% of the time.

Funnily enough quite a few countries we would not deem free meed their demand for water 99% of the time too, it has less to do with economic system as it does with environment, investment and planning.

&gt;Supply and demand are much more powerful than you give them credit for.

But still not easily dealable with when there is an issue that needs dealing with in the short term.

c0fk2ww,AskReddit,,3,True,"A few tips:

- Hostels are your friend. Find them. All major cities and even many smaller cities in Europe and South America have them. They're cheap and you'll probably meet interesting people here. In fact, this is probably where you'll meet most people. 
- If you're looking for a good time, find some Australians at your hostel and tag along with them in the evenings.
- Don't waste money on hotels. It is not worth it. 
- Try to avoid renting a car unless you have a specific destination in mind and there's no other (practical) way to get there. This is another money sink. There are more interesting ways of getting around.
- Don't bring anything that can't be easily replaced. Bring a cheap cell phone (leave iPhone at home). No computer (find an internet cafe, they're everywhere). 
- You can't beat having a local to show you around. If you are havign trouble deciding where to go, go where you know someone. Family, friends, whatever. 

Other than that, what are you interested in? I've been to Europe and South America. I'd say if you are looking for adventure and don't have a lot of cash, South America is the way to go. Europe is more touristy and better if you're into things like museums and castles.

c0fk9dz,AskReddit,,39,True,"Okay, I'll bite.

What irritates me about the ""other"" Western nations is that too often they come across as all bitch and no bite (this article is a good jumping off point:  http://www.slate.com/id/2196200/)

In other words, it strikes me that the rest of the Western world is often very quick to complain about each and every thing that the United States does without bothering to suggest serious, credible alternatives that don't resort to fluffy, pie-in-the-sky idealism.  The article I cited discusses one such example - it is surpassingly easy to complain about the execution of the action in Afghanistan and the damage that it has caused, but it is incredibly difficult to come up with serious, workable alternatives.  It's not good enough simply to say ""Just get out of Afghanistan!"" or ""Kill less civilians!"" or ""US are just imperialists and this is all about oil!""  None of those are taken at all seriously by anyone with a close knowledge and serious engagement with the problem.  And yet this is often what the criticism devolves into.

It strikes me that Europe _could_ have the influence that it sometimes desires, _if_ it were willing to unify around a foreign policy.  This, though, would require giving up a level of sovereignty on the local level, which no one seems willing to do.  This makes the more hysterical criticism ring rather hollow.  Various Europeans will hop up and down about vagaries like human rights and how America is screwing things up, but if they wanted to have _real_ influence they would have to unify around a strong, centralized Europe.  Very few people seem willing to do this, which makes their dear, dear commitments to human rights seem a bit more like easy cudgels with which to beat a big player they don't like.

Another thing that annoys me is how the rest of the ""west"" finds it useful to channel their frustrated political ambitions through ""impartial"" international bodies.  Because they can't convince the people to unify behind a strong foreign policy, instead they decamp to various arms of the UN and make it a platform to try to get their views heard.  A good example would be the way the UN recently just happened to drop a report about how the American actions in Afghanistan might violate ""international humanitarian law.""  First of all, people have a hell of a time agreeing on what international law is even in the most clear-cut of circumstances.  It's furthermore even more difficult when you get to something as fuzzy as ""international humanitarian law,"" even moreso if you're talking about a context of modern warfare. 

There is a book, _The Case for Goliath_ that discusses this in more detail (I actually didn't like it much, but that's for other reasons).  The basic argument is that the dirty little secret in international relations is that most high-level players on the international scene have little problem with the current hegemonic position occupied by the United States and the public goods that ensue from that, but they know this is politically unpopular so they make much of USA-bashing back at home.

None of this is to say that criticism is neither justified nor welcome - indeed, much of the time I both enjoy and agree with what I hear.  The problem is when the criticism masks a deeper disingenuousness, that it's easier to nay-say than to propose workable solutions.

And the entire rest of the world besides the US is ignoring the fact that those ceasefire lines allowed the Arab armies to launch a second extermination attempt that could, with but a few wrong chances, have succeeded.

c0fkdfo,AskReddit,,1,True,"I haven't been to many places in the World, but I do recommend traveling. I like cities, people, and metropolitan culture. It'll obviously show in my responses.

&gt; What is your favorite place you've ever been and why?

Tokyo Japan. Never been to a more convenient city in my life. Sure, it isn't pretty, but being able to ride trains and subways literally everywhere in the city is insane. There are so many people and the fact that they still manage to make the city work as smoothly as it does is amazing. It is also hard to imagine how big Tokyo really is until you actually go.

&gt; Any place you've hated and would absolutely avoid?

Los Angeles. I would avoid it, but I don't recommend others avoid it if they've never been. It has a lot of sites and things to see but the city is really a giant mess of crap. You drive everywhere yet you can park nowhere. It is exactly how not to build a city. I do recommend Pacific Coast Highway and stopping around Manhattan and Hermosa Beach.

&gt; Any places in specific cities you'd recommend staying away from that are tourist traps that are actually nothing special?

I'm not sure. I tend to avoid the tourist traps because you can smell it. A good example is Roppongi in Tokyo. Not necessarily a tourist trap but when you start seeing a high ratio of foreigner to Japanese it is obvious. The only benefit is more people speak English. The bad thing is you no longer feel like you're in Japan and you're spending more money.

If you're going to travel, don't bother to try to be a tourist. You'll have ample opportunity to do touristy things whether you want to or not. Do try to dig into the local culture. It'll open up some experiences you can't have just by being a tourist.

&gt; Any special precautions to take that I should know about and otherwise wouldn't read about?

When traveling internationally, always check with the embassies early for Visa requirements even if you're just passing through a country. Make sure your passport will not expire within a year as many places will not accept a passport that will expire in a year.

Do pack as light as possible (carry-on backpack max, check in one bag, 7 days worth of clothes or less). If you're going to a metropolitan area (civilization exists) you can find most common necessities (tooth brush, soap, etc) easily. 

The reason why you don't want a lot of crap on you is TSA especially at major airports is a bitch. You may also find that you're going to have to lug your crap sometimes up stairs. So the lighter the better. Wheels are good. Leave with your bag slightly empty because it is likely you're coming back with more stuff than you came.

&gt; Any other tips you could throw out, that'd be awesome.

Just go, anywhere. Obviously if it is a place you want to go, it will be better. But if you're thinking about going the best decision you can make is to stop thinking and actually go. Going into different cultures and seeing other parts of the world will really open your eyes and give you a lot of learn and experience.

If you can't speak any other languages, be sure to buy a ""pointing guide"" from a store. A pointing guide is basically a sheet or book that has phrases written down in both languages such that you can point to a question and the other person can read the appropriate translated question in their language. They then point to an answer so you know what they mean. This is particularly useful for ordering at restaurants when you can't read the menu and no one can speak English.

Traveling can be done cheap if done right. The reason why travel is expensive by most is because they want to stay at a nice hotel. You can find hostels and cheaper places especially in the off-peak seasons. There's also a lot of restaurants or street food that is good, cheap, and frequented by locals. Be brave and try these places. 

Certain travel agencies will be better at finding deals on airplane tickets especially if they're working with natives of that destination. For example standard fares for Japan on major sites on the internet usually come up around $800 to $900 round trip from los angeles to narita. But a local travel agency fluent in Japanese often has ads for tickets in the $600 range. Some destinations like Europe might have more competition and thus easier ways to find lower fares. It all depends. But don't just go to one agency or one website and think that's the cheapest you can find it.

Before traveling, check with your bank and the country your traveling to for ATM transactions and how prevalent credit cards are accepted. You may be surprised to find many places outside of the U.S. don't accept credit cards. If you can do international ATM transactions, do these rather than the currency exchanges. The exchange rates are generally much better even after all the fees. I would still obviously take cash in case your cards don't work and you need to figure out how to get money transferred. I would also take a spare card and leave it separate in your suitcase in case you lose your bag or wallet. I also heard photocopying your passport is a good idea but I'm not sure how much trouble that will save you in the long run. You also have to notify your bank before you depart if you're going to do international transactions so they don't block your cards while you're away. It would also be smart to ask for the daily limits on ATM and credit transactions.

Another good idea is to check with the CDC and your local doctor or travel clinic for recommended vaccinations and immunizations. I would do this at least 1 year prior but it isn't required. Some things like hepatitis need multiple shots before you're immune for life. But I'd still get the usual influenza shot because there's nothing like some common disease ruining your entire trip.

If you want to learn some of the local language prior to going, practice learning common food terms and ordering terms especially if you're going to a country where you can't even read the writing. A language dictionary isn't going to save you in these situations since the terminology is too specific.

Try hard to meet a local or get in contact with a local prior to going. The best way is through friends. If you don't have friends, make new ones. Even if you don't manage to get in contact before going, try again when you arrive. The best method is face to face as their online social networks can often be completely different from what we have here and people are generally fearful to the idea of meeting random strangers through online encounters. 

If you're going to a generally safe place, don't be afraid to go alone. When traveling alone it is much easier to modify your schedule and do things with people you meet on your trip. If you do travel with friends, make sure they aren't picky. Don't travel with more than a few people as it gets too hard to manage and becomes a ""group"" event rather than a travel event.

c0fkhr7,politics,,1,True,"&gt;so europeans and canadians and australians have a similar system? 

Well, the Australians and the Canadians have universal public health care systems, where everyone is insured.  Canada is universally public, in that the government insures everyone and everyone pays taxes for health care. Australia's system is public-private, where people are govt-insured by default but can opt out to take private insurance policies and receive a tax rebate.

As for Europe, I hate to break it to you, but Europe is made up of like 50 different countries, each with its own healthcare system. I'm not going to look them all up for you. I will mention Switzerland, which has  a system a lot like the one in the current House bill: mandated, universal, regulated, privately provided coverage. Their insurance is relatively cheaper than ours in terms of total cost per capita, but still a lot higher than countries with public systems. It's considered to be very high-quality, also.

&gt;they are criminalized for not getting health insurance? 

Yes and no. I explained this in my first comment. In the case of Switzerland, the answer is a simple yes-- people who don't have insurance are breaking the law. In Australia and Canada, it's not technically possible not to get insurance-- by law, every citizen is covered. It's impossible to be an uninsured Canadian or Australian. However, the effect is the same: as mandating insurance: the costs of these programs are paid  taxes, which citizens are required by law to pay.  In any of these countries, if someone doesn't pay for health care, they're breaking the law.

This is the way it works: If you want universal health care, you have to mandate it. With a public universal system, you don't have to explicitly mandate coverage by law because people are covered by default, but in the end, no matter what kind of system, it only works if everyone is covered.",t3_a2hau,t1_c0fk9sh,False,1257814947,t5_2cneq,t1_c0fkhr7,True,1,alpacalypse,0,0,0,,,1426093422
