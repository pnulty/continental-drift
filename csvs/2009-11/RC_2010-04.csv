My idea for starting the country over is to try to split it into hundreds of smaller countries or something...

This would also make people more reliant on people from other ""countries"" so there was a greater sense of working with people from different cultures and stuff... :-)

Europe is a template for that, but Europe has got some big countries that could be split into smaller ones for instance. :-)

You also have to remember that the Americas were the next to last major land areas ever to be explored/settled by ancient humans (with Antarctica being the last), around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Tech advances didn't really allow the populations there to explode until the European colonization efforts got into high gear around 500 years ago. So the Americas likely have lots more areas still pristine to human touch than most of Europe and Asia and Africa.


I do suspect Australia beats everything but Antarctica for this honor though-- despite people first getting there maybe 50,000 to 60,000 years ago-- simply because it never did get more than sparsely populated, and so damn much of its huge interior is simply too much of a hell hole for anybody to live in.

&gt;In AD 1000, the Earth was experiencing an episode of climate warming similar to that of the present day. Temperatures in many parts of the world seem to have risen by at least two or three degrees Fahrenheit. 

&gt;Although the scale of this ""global warming"" may seem small, its effects on human societies were profound. In Europe, several centuries of long hot summers led to an almost unbroken string of good harvests, and both urban and rural populations began to grow. These centuries are known as the Medieval Warm Period. One of the more dramatic consequences of the Medieval Warm Period was the expansion of Viking settlements in the North Atlantic. From their Icelandic base (established in AD 870), the Norse people began to move west and north to Greenland, Canada, and eventually above the Arctic Circle.
LINK

&gt;The Medieval Warm Period was a time of warm weather around 800-1300 AD, during the European Medieval period. Initial research on the MWP and the following Little Ice Age (LIA) was largely done in Europe, where the phenomenon was most obvious and clearly documented. The Vikings took advantage of ice-free seas to colonize Greenland and other outlying lands of the far north.

Go take a vacation in Gaza. It is a mass extermination camp. Do you really think Israeli are going to be stupid as to actually build gas chambers and crematoriums? No amount of propaganda is going to whitewash that. Yeah, they would love to eliminate all the Palestinians in one day. But ""unfortunately"" those days are long past. 

However, there is another approach. For example, here is one recipe (in 5 easy steps): 

 1). Israel should enclose the area with a big wall, prevent everyone from coming and going. [CHECK].

 2). Destroy schools, hospitals and water treatment plants -- that, right there is plain and simple biological warfare. [CHECK]

 3). To speed things up a bit, they should restrict food supply to keep people malnourished as much as possible. That makes sure they will not be able to procreate fast enough. [CHECK].

 4). After all that is done -- just sit and wait for about 100 years if not less. 

 5). In the meantime make sure to correctly manage the public perception in world's most powerful countries (US + Western Europe). This is done via AIPAC in US, for example. They can both bribe and 'punish' (using slander campaign) politicians and journalists to make sure an 'appropriate' public perception is created. [CHECK].

As for clean water; if by that you mean ""municipally treated water"", then it should be obvious to anyone with even half a brain that taxes HAS to predate them - tax is how the government gets money, and you can't build a water system without lots of money.

There is an equal age of consent set at 12 years of age in Art. 331 (1)[32] [33] . When there is a relationship of dependence (like teacher/student, etc.) the age of consent is 15 years in Art. 331 (2)[32]

The age of consent in the Codice Penale from Italy was changed in 1930, but this no longer had any effect on Vatican City. Vatican law provides that criminal suspects arrested in Vatican City are to be tried under Vatican law in Italian courts, while those who escape to Italy before their arrest are to be tried under Italian law, even if their alleged crime occurred on Vatican territory.[32]",True,t1_c0naxr9,False,,t5_2qh13,,c0naxr9

[Climategate: Follow the Money](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703939404574566124250205490.html)

&gt;Last year, ExxonMobil donated $7 million to a grab-bag of public policy institutes, including the Aspen Institute, the Asia Society and Transparency International. It also gave a combined $125,000 to the Heritage Institute and the National Center for Policy Analysis, two conservative think tanks that have offered dissenting views on what until recently was called—without irony—the climate change ""consensus.""

&gt;To read some of the press accounts of these gifts—amounting to about 0.00027% of Exxon's 2008 profits of $45 billion—you might think you'd hit upon the scandal of the age. But thanks to what now goes by the name of climategate, it turns out the real scandal lies elsewhere.

&gt;Climategate, as readers of these pages know, concerns some of the world's leading climate scientists working in tandem to block freedom of information requests, blackball dissenting scientists, manipulate the peer-review process, and obscure, destroy or massage inconvenient temperature data—facts that were laid bare by last week's disclosure of thousands of emails from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, or CRU.

&gt;But the deeper question is why the scientists behaved this way to begin with, especially since the science behind man-made global warming is said to be firmly settled. To answer the question, it helps to turn the alarmists' follow-the-money methods right back at them.

&gt;Consider the case of Phil Jones, the director of the CRU and the man at the heart of climategate. According to one of the documents hacked from his center, between 2000 and 2006 Mr. Jones was the recipient (or co-recipient) of some $19 million worth of research grants, a sixfold increase over what he'd been awarded in the 1990s.

&gt;**Why did the money pour in so quickly? Because the climate alarm kept ringing so loudly: The louder the alarm, the greater the sums.** And who better to ring it than people like Mr. Jones, one of its likeliest beneficiaries?

&gt;**Thus, the European Commission's most recent appropriation for climate research comes to nearly $3 billion, and that's not counting funds from the EU's member governments. In the U.S., the House intends to spend $1.3 billion on NASA's climate efforts, $400 million on NOAA's, and another $300 million for the National Science Foundation. The states also have a piece of the action, with California—apparently not feeling bankrupt enough—devoting $600 million to their own climate initiative. In Australia, alarmists have their own Department of Climate Change at their funding disposal.**

&gt;And all this is only a fraction of the $94 billion that HSBC Bank estimates has been spent globally this year on what it calls ""green stimulus""—largely ethanol and other alternative energy schemes—of the kind from which Al Gore and his partners at Kleiner Perkins hope to profit handsomely.

The problem with the ""triviality-to-value"" balance is that it doesn't work in this case: a trivial patent might cover a scroll-bar, but the value for GUI implementations is extremely high.

Non-trivial patents such as RSA, or various compression methods for either images, audio files or even [surface-transfer of 3D objects](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7633503.html) are indeed complex enough for most people to accept that this could be valid. But for instance with lossy compression, it is clear that all these patents fundamentally are expressions of the Fourier series, which isn't patentable because it's a mathematical statement. As is RSA. Or the Pythagorean theorem, or the Sieve of Eratosthenes, or the K-Means clustering algorithm, or ...

I have no clear answer on where the trivial ends and truly patentable begins. That of course doesn't mean there should never be software patents, but at the moment I don't see any clear method that the patent office could use to distinguish a real patent from a bogus one. The linked-list patent is just one of many examples.",True,t1_c0nb0o3,False,,t5_2fwo,,c0nb0o3

First one, chain came off my bike while I was mid corner, went wide, hit the gravel, went down.  Ripped a chunk out of my knee.

6 weeks in and out of hospital.  Total cost to me $15.  (For a crutch).

2nd, came down on the sydney harbour bridge on the way to work.  Gave myself a concusion.   Cat scan, x-ray etc.  1 day in ER on observation.  2 days off work.

Eastern Europe is amazing; one of the few places in Europe that still maintains (IMHO) a strong cultural and regional identity.  
  
It's safe as long as you're not stupid. Unfortunately, American travelers are *oftentimes* stupid. Have you traveled alone before? How familiar are you with Europe? Do you speak ANY of these languages? The language barrier once you get East of Bratislava can be pretty rough -- be prepared (!) for NO ONE you meet to speak English. This is a huge problem for many Americans, and is likely going to lead to a lot of uncomfortable situations, regardless of preparation. Be ready.  
  
When I spent some time in Sarajevo, I took a cab through the infamous sniper's alley (near this giant decrepit abandoned Holiday Inn) to the city center with a cabbie who didn't know a word of English and had never met an American. Between my slight competence in French and broken Czech, we managed, somehow, to get me to an ATM, and eventually where I was staying. You would be best learning Cyrillic and a few phrases. Don't carry cash. Don't flaunt that you're an American. Again: *Don't be stupid*.  
  
Learn the local laws. Serbia, when I was there, required registration with the embassy/consulate for Americans in the city for more than 48 hours. No one takes credit cards or debit cards -- so, even though I already said not to carry cash, you will have to -- but be really fucking careful with it. Violent crime isn't as bad as is likely perceived in these areas, but muggings/robberies/etc. are VERY likely/prevalent, especially among tourists. ALSO: when I was there (2007), there were a lot of issues changing money. Especially when I went Hungary --&gt; Serbia; for some reason changing Hungarian Florents (sp?) to Serbian money was a real pain in the ass and no one would do it. Keep this in mind.  
  
At all costs, avoid looking rich/Western/American ... people aren't anti-American, exactly, but it makes you a clear target. The Serbians and Bosnians that I met were among the most genuinely gracious, friendly, hospitable, and amazing people I've encountered while traveling. You will be impressed with their desire to practice English, and how welcoming they are. Belgrade is like stepping back in time -- the air is very very dirty, traffic is crazy.  
  
The Balkans are some of the most beautiful landscapes in Europe, I think. One of the most beloved memories I have is of entering Sarajevo at dawn, with the fog over the mountains and the sun starting to peek through. It was incredibly moving.

The key problem with the Pacific has been the lack of character development so far.

And even then, as Beatle_Matt called out, many people didn't even realize who the soldier was that died from the mortar attack.  We see him in the opening scene of the first episode with the other two sergeants, but there is so much going on that you never really feel the emotion or loss of his character because they never developed his character.   The director tries to elicit that emotion from us through the eyes of his buddy, the MoH winner, but it isn't enough because we don't have a connection to him yet.

Character development was what made BoB an incredible story for many of us.  We become invested in the men from Easy Company because we ""go through"" basic training with them.  We see them suffer as they run Currahee and come together as a unit under the painful leadership of Captain Sobel as their antagonist.

I think that there *are* legitimate concerns that go along with the burqa and the niqab, but that wide scale bans are often attempts the resolve those concerns with a sledgehammer rather than the scalpel they deserve.  And in part, that's because a lot of the opposition to those kinds of attire seems to be motivated not by those legitimate concerns, but rather by xenophobia.

What's a legitimate concern?  Sometimes it's necessary for legal reasons to be able to identify a person, and to the extent that a burqa stands in the way of that, it's a civil concern.  Some countries have dealt with that concern by, for example, having female security officers who can verify the identity of women wearing burqas in a controlled environment.

Yeah, that places a small additional burden on government institutions, but that's the price of pluralism.  If Belgium isn't comfortable with pluralism, I suggest it close down its borders (my passport wasn't even checked riding the train in from Amsterdam) and ask the EU to relocate its headquarters to somewhere with an appropriately open policy.

What's not a reasonable concern is the idea that the burqa and niqab are somehow tools in an Islamic takeover of Europe.  It's no more reasonable to suppose that a person wearing a burka is strapped with plastique that it would be to suppose that everyone wearing a Gortex jacket is going to detonate themselves in your local cafe.  I'd say the Gortex jacket is a better bet, actually, since suicide bombers are surely aware that any outside emblem marking them as devout Muslims are sure to arouse suspicions in the Islamiphobic climate that pervades much of Europe these days.

The right to cover your face is *not* a civil right according to the Belgian constitution. And according to polls (see below), most people agree with this ban. You may not like that, but calling it a minority which wants to limit civil rights is 2 times wrong.  

According to a large poll conducted in the Netherlands, more than half of the people find Islam to be a threat to the Netherlands[[1]](http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_url?doit=done&amp;tt=url&amp;intl=1&amp;fr=bf-home&amp;trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elsevier.nl%2Fweb%2FNieuws%2FNederland%2F132855%2FPeiling-meerderheid-vindt-islam-bedreiging.htm&amp;lp=nl_en&amp;btnTrUrl=Translate). Yes, that's right: those liberal, free-minded Dutch find Islam to be a threat. Similar results are found in most countries in W-Europe, including Belgium. 50% finds Islam to be a threat, and only a small minority is against the burka ban. So you can't really say this is just some anti-constitutional minority. From the article: the vote was unanimously, both coalition and opposition were in favor of the ban. So no, it's not only a ""hardcore minority"" which is afraid of Islam. And you can say that 50% of Europeans are retarded rednecks, but those are the same people who legalized same-sex marriage and pot. (I vote for a party which favored same-sex marriage and still wants a ""burka ban"", exactly because radical Islam and our culture are not compatible.) West-Europe and the US may have different public opinions on some things, for example same-sex marriage and wearing burkas. 

&gt; It does have to do with Muslims and limiting their freedom.

In your previous post, you agreed that 99.99% of the Muslims won't be affected. If they would ban the headscarf (hijab), *then* you could say that Muslims would be targeted by that ban, but now? You can't really equate a couple of dozen Muslims and the whole Muslim population. That's equation Islam terrorism and Islam as a whole in my opinion. Most Muslims do *not* wear burkas, and they are *not* bothered by the ban. So you have to call it what it is: this ban will affect ultra-radical Muslims, which constitute about 0.01% of the total Belgian Muslim population. 

&gt; who else wears shit covering their face?

Prosecution is still a sore issue (hardly any complaints, very hard to make a case and most of the complaints get dropped eventually) but alot of social workers are out on the field daily trying to cope... 

Similarly: banning burkas isn't just an attack on the symptoms. Multiculturalism is about sampling different points of view and finding your own path between it all. How easy can you do that when you're dressed in a burka everytime you're outside? Even if you disregard the obvious physical issues, how do you then cope with the other side of the issue? Do I have the right to be offended by what, to me, is a symbol of women's oppression? Is that a cultural sensibility that I should just ignore? And even if I don't give a shit, how easy is it possible to integrate into a society in which alot of people think burkas are horrid (both due to racist reasons, and women's rights issues) when you're wearing a burka? Aren't you effectively shutting women out of society by allowing them to wear burkas? What is sensible policy here? 

Right now, it looks as though we're slowly moving to a segregated society. If anything, that should be avoided.
 
I'll agree that Europe has alot to learn about multiculturalism. There is alot of racism here, and it's an absolute disgrace. It's one of the biggest hurdles we as a society need to take atm and I do hope we do it sooner then later. But until we get there, imperfect measures are going to be needed.

Europeans are clearly not retarded rednecks and on some issues (homophobia, drugs) they are more liberal than your average American. On others (racism and other forms of xenophobia), it is less clear. Concerning Muslims, Europeans are reacting to the fact that their main immigration is from Northern Africa, mostly Muslim, and that these immigrants have clear difference from the native population (culturally, physically, ideologically perhaps).

It will affect only 0.01% of the population but it is enacted because of a rampant and irrational fear of Islam. More than any practical effect, what is scary about this law is the message it sends and the motive behind it.

As you can guess from the name, it refers to how many times you could (at a given speed) travel around an NHL hockey rink within 20 minutes.  Miles and kilometres were never truly accepted here, and during the Northern M-eh-surement Reform Act (which happened around the last time the Leafs won the cup; some time in the 19th century), this method was decided upon.  One rink per period equals approximately 0.33 miles per hour.  

As for other units of measure:

Height is measured in cubits.

Distance is measured in fathoms.

Weight is measured in ounces troy.

Ounces troy become less useful at larger weights, so we also have the beaver, demibear, and polarbear measurements.  The beaver is equal to around 50 pounds.  The demibear is actually set by the federal government and fluctuates year to year. They increased it recently to help offset the recession, soI think it's sitting around 560 pounds.  The polarbear (which, contrary to popular belief is not equal to two demibears) behaves similarly, and I believe is around 1700 pounds.

Volume is tricky, because it's actually measured using two units: cents and Beer (one of the few units with capitalization).  Beer bottles would hold about 341 European ""millilitres"", but only give you 10 cents when you return them, so small volumes are measured in cents.  Every cent is equal to 3.41 mL, or about a quarter of a cubic inch, or a sixth of a fluid ounce.  The Beer is also a unit, meaning 10 cents.  There are numerous denominations, such as the quartercase, halfcase, case, and cube.  The cube is slowly being phased out, and can actually be seen more frequently in America, though it is not referred to by that name.

First is our relatively open immigration policy. The US has a long history of growing because people in other countries see the benefits from living here, and the US (usually) recognizes the benefits of letting immigrants into the country. 

The second factor is our native birthrate, which is somewhat higher than many European countries. This is due to a number of factors, but one that's often cited is the fact that many of our recent immigrants come from countries with traditionally higher birth rates.  

Interestingly, China may see its population peak in the very near future, as a result of its one child per couple policy. While a country's economy may be able to grow and thrive as its population shrinks, with everything else being equal, it's much easier to have a growing economy with a growing population.

Making amends for such a thing is easy and straightforward. Under no one's belief system do you go straight to hell for any and all things you do in life that God doesn't like.

It's good that you've read those books, too. I'm a grad student in religious studies, so it's not often I meet people who have read anywhere near the body of literature I have. That said, you should know that the olympian gods made a very clear distinction between sins against other people and sins against the gods. One was not even worth controlling, the other got you tortured. That dichotomy doesn't exist in the Judeo-Christian teachings.

""Also the British were probably seen as anti-Catholic because the Church of England changed from Catholicism to Protestantism in the 1550's due to the widespread knowledge of the Catholic Churches corruption.""

Actually it was because Henry VIII wanted a divorce, and didn't want to pay taxes to the Vatican anymore after they didn't have his marriage annulled. As sad of a picture as this paints of European history, there really wasn't a whole lot more to it than that.

There's a book called Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England by Elizabeth Reis that goes into all the gruesome details about witch hunts, but basically they were everywhere from Boston to Philadelphia, to every podunk village in between (Ipswitch and Andover, to name a few). The trials in Salem were one of the most outstanding, since they involved some of the most bizarre and well documented cases, but they were pretty prevalent throughout New England. Most of those historical cities back there still have the old gallows and stuff that they used. Even the ones in Salem were actually people they had dragged in from villages in three different nearby counties.

""By the way the fight between Protestants and Catholics is still waged to this day in Ireland where Protestants and Catholics kill each other in the streets.""

I don't really want to go into detail on this, but the Irish wanting to break away from England has been going on since long before there was any religious division. I'm sure it enters into the conversation now, but at its root that's almost entirely an ethnic conflict.

""It figures the only person actually willing to have a conversation with me on this is a Buddhist...""

I'm not Buddhist, but it is funny you mentioned them, since it was actually they who started the notion of hell to begin with. One of the levels of reincarnation is a ""Hell-sufferer"" This is for those who are so bad that they can't even be reborn as ""hungry ghosts"" which is the next highest rung on the ladder. There was also the idea of the perfect universe, in which everyone there had attained nirvana, called the 'Western Universe.' 

Before Alexander The Great's invasion of India, all ancient near-eastern ideas of the afterlife were basically 'sheol,' literally, 'the house of the dead.' It's just a house where dead people are. Hades was exactly the same. There were no Tartarus myths until after AtG's invasion of India. Afterwards, however, two things happened. One, Tartarus started being mentioned as a place where tortures happened to those who personally offended the gods. This later got ingested by Christianity into the idea of Hell, and capitalized on by Muslims, and now we've got a lake of fire somewhere. Two, the elysian fields started cropping up in greek myths, which were located, not coincidentally, in the west, beyond the river ocean. That got incorporated into the afterlife ideas, too, and now Sheol has become either a lake of fire or some kind of resort on top of the clouds, and it's all thanks to the buddhists!

""There is no defining viewpoint of Christians because there is 30,000+ different denominations of Christianity.""

Perhaps, but if you're thinking the Bible-Belt experience of Christianity is a representative sample with a normal distribution relative to your population, then that's an incorrect assumption that will lead you to some statistically non-robust ideas about Christianity as a whole.

"" in which case it would be the Catholics.""

If you're taking the catholic viewpoint, then why exclude purgatory from your line of reasoning? Sure, when you take half of a dogma it sounds insane, but when people try to understand the whole thing, it becomes at least more sane. That's the problem with so many Christians today: they're operating based on like 60% knowledge of a belief system that continually turns previous lessons on their ears, and assuming the last 40% is just like what they've learned so far. Catholicism is one of the only branches of Christianity that preaches purgatory, so why leave that out if you're taking their views as your baseline reading of Christianity?

""Also they have maps of America based on religion, the majority of america is Catholic though the crazy fundamentalists tend to occupy the media.""

I'm glad you enjoyed that link I posted, but their techniques were pretty flawed. Their datapoints on 'most catholic' etc. were based on search terms on the internet, (problematic enough) but basically whichever denomination got the most internet hits got their color of datapoint on the map. Catholicism, while it is the largest minority of Christian sects in America, is still only 20% of Christians in the US, so there's still the 80% of American Christianity you'd have to contend with. It's a step towards accuracy, but it's not entirely there yet.

""The government cannot take sides when it comes to religion.""

I'm not talking about the government keeping people in check, I'm talking about higher ups within the church. In the catholic church, if a priest preaches something that's totally not inline with the church's beliefs, for better or for worse, they're often defrocked, and can't get a preaching job anywhere ever again. In the US at the local baptist church, if the pastor says something that's batshit insane, for better or for worse, nobody within the church has the authority to tell him to shut the hell up.

BTW, you know those assbags holding the signs that everyone hates? They've got other denominations of Christianity up there on their lists of people going to hell right with the gays, new agers, etc. There's plenty of mud slinging among different religious groups. Nobody's outraged about the pedophile priests because it's old news and the media has lost its mind. A bad sign, but not a Christian issue.",True,t1_c0nbs1d,False,,t5_2qh6c,,c0nbs1d

Why is that every single white man is always considered (by everyone but white men) to have had privileged entry to all that society offers?

Is it beyond all possibility to be a poor white man and be denied elements of society taken for granted by other social groups. I and many poor white men I know could give a slew of anecdotal evidence but that's it there isn't any serious organization studying the effects of modern society on a group of whom everyone assumes to be privileged (to my knowledge.)   

The accepted notion that the denial of one group equates to the privilege of another group is also wrong. Black people say *all* white people enjoy privilege, feminists say *all* white men enjoy privilege. The most hypocritical to me are Latino people, whose ancestors might very well have been European invaders themselves complaining about white privilege (all of the sudden it kicks in when you get to America, we truly are the home of the disadvantaged.) 

I am not saying that groups haven't faced oppression and discrimination but once groups like Jews, Italians and Poles were not even considered white in America. This was pretty much up until their many sons fought in WWII. Now it isn't really that they gained acceptance in society through heroism and honor; but no simply because the GI Bill thrust many of them into middle class and they subsequently decided to move their families out of the crowded urban cities and into the suburbs - Which has now recently been determined to be a form of racism and termed ""white flight.""

Really the only quantifiable factor that decides privilege in a capitalist society is the amount of capital or wealth you have. All those other isms tend to simply accumulate wealth in another privileged individual's coffers and divide the poor masses amongst themselves. 

Granted women have been also an extremely oppressed and exploited group. They fought and won fundamental rights to equality like voting and discrimination in the workplace. Overcoming that history in America was a hard fought battle that still continues to an extent. 

But OP is pointing out that women are now being afforded privileges that are unequal as a result of the real history and this is wrong to him as it is creating discontent and an unfair workplace.

Its one thing to be feminist and fight against the practice of clitoridectomy in Africa or the treatment and oppression of women (like being stoned to death for breaking marriage vows) in fundamentalist Muslim countries but it is another thing to expect that because of historical abuses towards women like this, women in America should be given ten extra minutes of break time for feminine needs.

Did you even read what I said? To repeat myself, yes, the group that has received the largest chunk of privilege would be wealthy white men, but that does not mean that working class white men don't also receive some privilege. They have simply received less. (I should clarify and say that I can only really speak about Western society.)

&gt;Is it beyond all possibility to be a poor white man and be denied elements of society taken for granted by other social groups.

Not at all. Is anyone here claiming class privilege doesn't exist?

&gt;The accepted notion that the denial of one group equates to the privilege of another group is also wrong.

I'm sorry, what? If one group of people are denied opportunities, it follows logically that other groups of people will benefit. If people whose first names begin with A are discriminated against in hiring, it is automatically easier for others to get a job, because they face less competition.

&gt;The most hypocritical to me are Latino people, whose ancestors might very well have been European invaders themselves complaining about white privilege (all of the sudden it kicks in when you get to America, we truly are the home of the disadvantaged.)

How familiar are with South American society? There are race based divisions between the whiter population, the mixed European-indigenous population, and the indigenous population. The vast majority of Hispanic immigrants to the United States are not of full European descent - they are mixed.

Additionally, the fact that someone is privileged in one society has no bearing on how they will be treated in another society. I hope I don't have to explain why that is.

Based on all of our existing experience with giant networks of distributed things... and at this level of analysis, it doesn't matter if we're talking about generators or file servers or cars on the street or whatever... weird stuff happens as the scale increases.  Why do servers go into ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" mode?  Why do cars slow down and create a traffic jam in the absence of external stimulus?  When there's just ten cars over a small set of roads, you don't see the sort of effects that happen when you've got ten thousand cars over a road network.  And those effects are different from what you'd see over a country with over 250 million cars.  How can a simple race condition and a few failures of fairly insignificant equipment in our existing power grid can cause a blackout?  

The thing that will cause constant blackouts in Europe if they install this ""super-smart"" grid isn't that magically solar cells won't work or windmills won't spin or even that switching systems won't switch.  It's the software underlying it.  It's about race conditions and hard-to-find bugs in signaling.  It's about teenagers discovering that they can screw with their town by building something they found the plans for on the Internet.

Just because the things that will break in a ""super-smart"" grid aren't physical things like a pipe belching steam doesn't make it any less vaporware.  Remember, the word ""vaporware"" was invented to describe software.

And, especially in the European case, I think there's plenty of evidence to show why it's unpleasant to rely upon another country for energy security.

The 1947 resolution, which was based largely on scattered populations, did not create a viable state, but rather a hodge-podge group of Zionist versus Arab areas.  As if that was not enough, right after the British pulled out, 5 Arab nations invaded.  The borders that most people refer to when discussing Israel giving ground are those borders from 1948.  There is no legal basis to these borders, but rather military; they were the lines which the Jewish army could push the armies back.  

By defining ""occupied"" or ""stolen"" land, you are loading your question and therefore it is basically moot.  There are even more pressing questions; should an international body be allowed to declare borders?  What basis do they have for this right?  It hasn't exactly worked well in history; just look at countries created after the Versailles Treaty based on ""national self determination"".  Many of them no longer exist.  What about regions in Eastern Europe where there are large areas comprised of local minorities, like in Serbia?  What about the large Kurd centers in Turkey and Iraq; do you think Turkey will allow a country to be created?  The list goes on.  

Borders are a political concept, but where to set them is largely military.  Any land captured by Israel is under Israeli legal authority, just like with the US.  US annexed Texas, conquered parts of Florida, and later conquered Puerto Rico and Guam during the Spanish American War.  As such, they are still under American legal authority.  Israeli conquered territories are under the same legal authority.  In fact, Israel has even given territory back in the past in order to promote peace.  

Borders in the Middle East and Africa are completely messed up anyway, so talking about stolen and occupied is just a ridiculous concept.  Allegedly, countries are supposed to exist based on national self determination, as are their borders, but the borders of the Middle East and Africa are largely a result of British and French demarcation under Sykes Picot Agreement and the Balfour Declaration.  What bearing does that have on self determination?  Israel's borders are the only to change significantly, and it has done so with force.

The burden still lies on you to prove Jesus didn't exist *as a non-divine individual*.  

And as for a point-by-point refutation of your highly-spun rhetoric regarding other debatable characters...  

I'd love to see your *proof* of Romulus and Remus not existing, of your examples they're the ones I'm most shaky on - everything I've read held that they were real people at the core of the founding of the empire, but the more fantastic/dramatic aspects of their lives were exaggerated and their noble lineage was concocted by the Roman Aristocracy to give undue legitimacy to their rule of the Italian peninsula.

As for Socrates, taking a highly-controversial and academically weak (not refuted, but certainly not supported by current academia) viewpoint and stating it as fact is a spectacular error if done inadvertantly and downright maliciously deceptive if done consciously.  The *Platonic* Socrates in Plato's second work is entirely a creation, but there is character consistancy between the Socrates discussed in Plato's first work (rather than conversed with, as in the second piece) and the Socrates discussed and (effectively) cited in Xenophon and Aristophanes' works.  Most important is Aristophanes, who was a peer of Socrates rather than Plato and Xenophon, who would have been of an age to have been Socrates' pupils rather than peers.  

Your point about Kim Il Sung supports my point more than yours - there is a real person, with that name, at the core of the giant mysticized and romanticized cult of personality that has been created around him.  A large part of it is utter fiction, but that doesn't change the reality of the existence of the bloke at the center.  

And you're right in terms of the mechanics regarding Christianity's ascendancy in Europe, but as with your previous points, you've twisted the facts to try and fit them to your argument, rather than the reverse.  Constantine *officially* accepted Christiantity into the Roman Empire's pantheon, however, it was growing at a since-unrepeated rate of popularity within the subjected peoples of the empire and the Roman lower classes; his conversion, *officially* attributed to the influence of his mother, was also in part a gambit to regain political support from Christian elements in the empire after significantly weakening blows inflicted by his military losses of that era.  It wasn't a moment of personal faith, but a political move made to court the support of a large part of his empire's population.  I honestly doubt his (private) faith practices changed one bit after his ""conversion.""

Assess the two cases here: that there was a giant conspiracy, 100's to 1,000's of people strong, sometime in the vicinity of 150 to 200 CE actively working to create a religion of peace based on a manipulation of Judaic belief in a messiah and planting evidence of past ""christian"" activity, *or* that there was this bloke who preached some crazy shit and attracted a few followers, who then went on to keep passing on his message and story, allowing it to distort and grow on a genetic model rather than a mechanistic one; his legend having since taken on Kim Il Sung proportions of reality vs. fiction.  Occam's Razor says without further evidence, accept the simpler case - which is the snoballing personal legend of a dude preaching a crazy message akin to Kim Il or even Scientology's gradual deification of Hubbard, as opposed to a mass conspiracy at multiple levels of (highly stratified) Roman society to fabricate &amp; spread a new religion as well as concoct evidence of its past growth.

Nothing in the medieval period was ""religiously neutral""  - secular really didn't exist, for anyone (except maybe the Chinese..but thats a different story).

And like I said, only the homeless are left out of that system as far as I'm aware.  I'm curious how many of that 50 million are homeless or choose not to take advantage of the food voucher programs.

Well here's something you may not know.  In the US, universities are a haven of left thinking.  Socialism and anti corporate thought are absolutely at their epicenter in universities, in our country.  The so called free market ideas are NOT the standard values there.

1) Ask hostels if you can work out some kind of work-to-stay arrangement. Some places, especially bigger hostels, are more willing to work with you on this. Maybe you can call ahead and find out if they do this. 

2) Look into WWOOFing. The deal is that you do a day's worth of farmwork and you get meals, a place to stay, etc. If you've got the energy but not the money, it's a great way to go. 

3) If you're certified for it, you can make money in almost any part of the world by teaching English. The certification is not hard to get and you can sometimes find shorter jobs that pay under the table if you're good at seeking out that sort of thing. 

4) Camp. If you don't mind getting a little dirty, it's often very cheap to camp near a city. On the other hand, if you plan on seeing things, it might be worth your time just to pay up for a hostel and spend less time and money transporting yourself into cities.

Even if the world as we know it collapses, western society falls into decline, what will stop us from recreating a society that will eventually grow to be even more complex than we are now? The Roman empire collapsed and eventually Europe fell to the dark ages, but after many centuries, it became undeniably more powerful and more complex than ever before. The British Empire was able to span half the globe, though its collapse did not shatter the world at the time because others took the up the mantle. 

Even if WWIII broke out and a nuclear winter destroyed the world as we know it today, within a millenium, human civilization would no doubt be infinitely more complex than today. The only way to move forward is through increased complexity. There is a always point where a system no longer facilitates the optimal rate of growth. The only way humanity would step into a more simplistic society is if it becomes the cultural norm for ALL humans, across the globe, to shun technology and development. Otherwise, there will always be individuals who strive towards complexity, towards increased development. Does this seem probable?

And you speak of materials necessary for an industrial/technological revolution. First and foremost, we will always find a way to make ever more efficient technology from existing materials, or less materials than we use now. A single breakthrough could mean growth at rates that we could not possibly imagine today. Then consider, two millennium from now, will we not be obtain materials from other planets? Humanity went from first flight (as defined by the recognized hot air balloon flight in 1783) to space flight in less than 200 years. Do you honestly think our resources are limited to what we have here on the top layer of the Earth's crust forever?

I will not deny that in the short term, there may be a collapse of this complex civilization we see around us today. But when thinking in terms of hundreds, thousands of years, unless the human race eradicates itself entirely, it will move, eventually, towards more complexity.

Is empirically observable. JUST like Nazism, Islamists seeks to dismantle democracy in Europe, by means of democracy. Once the Islamic hoards have breed enough to vote down democracy they will, revealing their true face and supporting the Ulema. THEREFORE Islam is the new Nazi. 

There are no moderate Muslims, just like there were not any moderate Nazis. There might have been inactive Nazis, but no one can claim to be a moderate follower of an extreme ideology.

&gt; No it is not. How come you don't use the same argument with crosses

Because they are actively seeking to dismantle democracy in EU and in general it is uncommon for both of those religion to have followers speak about dominating the entire world. Islam on the other hand  has the built in concept of Ulema - and Muhammed had an army. Plenty of more differences could be pointed out.

&gt; Even if it were, they have every right to say that the whole world
&gt; should be Islamic. They can't force anyone though. And they don't.

Yes they do, in every European country we find ghettos where Islamists are setting up shop. Typically in the local Mosque. Islamic people are the only ones that have utterly failed at integrating into the open culture that feeds them.

They are just waiting to reach critical mass, the fist signs of this are very clear, especially in: UK, Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden.

We had great democracies *until* your kind arrived. Despite having been given room to leave Islamic countries, you still maintain that Islam is not an issue at all. Well, why did you have to leave your own contry then?

I hate these people. I always thought they were harmless nuts until I read a book called ""Bad Science,"" by Ben Goldcare. It describes how a naturopath named Matthias Rath fooled the then-president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, into destroying all the anti-retroviral medication that had been supplied free by ""Big Pharma."" Instead, Mbeki bought vitamin pills from Matthias Rath. 

Keep in mind that anti-retrovirals don't just slow the progression of AIDS; they also greatly reduce the probability that the disease will be passed on to the infected party's sexual partners. The World Health Organization set up a program to contain the African pandemic when it first started. A massive quantity of free medicine was sent to South Africa and clinics were set up to dispense medication to the infected people. Even if nobody used condoms, and nobody became monogamous, the distribution of medication would have reduced the transmission rate enough to prevent it from reaching pandemic status.  The entire AIDS crisis in Africa could easily have been prevented if not for the interference of a European snake-oil salesman. These people, even the fools, are pure evil. Dangerous.

The same sort of startup-heavy software environment generally does *not* exist in Europe; I know a great many people who have moved to the US because such an environment is more startup-friendly.  The US restrictions on Microsoft were pretty laughable and promptly dropped -- harm that Microsoft sees is because another company (Apple) or a collection of technology enthusiasts and companies (Linux) is moving in, not because of any sort of effective limitations placed by the government.  I can't speak as to the restrictions placed by *every* European government, but generally I have a hard time seeing how those did much to encourage Microsoft to open up the application space; the most extreme example is probably the Media Player/MSIE restrictions, and just what is the real-world impact of that?

World politics is mostly sabre-rattling. NK has been threatening to destroy SK for decades. Likewise Iran concerning Israel.

This is true but power is relative, especially historically. Yes, some countries in *today's* world are more powerful than Germany was at it's prime in WW2. But the superpowers, namely those in the G8, are more powerful *still.* All countries had the same 70 years of advancements.

Again, this is true. But given the scenario I presented in my first post, it wouldn't take 50 nukes. 50 nukes would be totally unecessary. Heads of state and scientists behind nuclear programs know the science behind the blast. Cooler heads would prevail before even 5 nukes were dropped in one conflict. No one, in their sane mind, would completely fly off the handle and drop 10+ nukes in one region. It just wouldn't happen. Now, I said *sane*, which implies that the insane might. Like Kim Jong-Il. Like Ahmadinejad. But they don't have that kind of firepower. Nor would they waste it so quickly and so finally. 

&gt;This ""someone"" could be any terrorist organization with very unclear ties back to a nuclear state. This uncertainty would make the US unable to clearly pinpoint their attacker and cause retaliation to be seen as an act of aggression, as Iraq was. A nuclear retaliation would be a threat to the world and thus be treated as such by other nuclear weapon states.

As far as unclear ties to a nuclear state goes, it really wouldn't be that unclear as the number of countries in the Nuclear Club is tiny. If al-Qaida got a nuke, who would they get it from? Pakistan. Of course Pakistan. There would be no other way. Not only that, but US wouldn't retaliate nuke-for-nuke until it was absolutely positive who to nuke. Nukes aren't something you mess around with and go throwin' around willy-nilly on a hunch or a suspicion.

And finally, 

&gt;Small wars will turn into big wars as time and technology drive bigger and bigger weapons into their hands and a cold war is the best we can possibly hope for

Well, all right, you could call something else property, but property as we know it would not exist.

&gt;No it doesn't. Without this constraint the strongest get to acquire, not only the property they create themselves, but also any property they can take by force.

Yes, and as I pointed out, the *long run effect* is negative.  I agree that if one person can simply run out and loot and pillage, they have it good in the short run.  If *everyone* is doing it, the economy breaks down and everyone is worse off.

&gt;It is a constraint specifically aimed at protecting the weak from the strong.

There I'm going to have to disagree with you, and I think that you'll find that there are no shortage of property laws through history that rather *disadvantage* the weak.  It might be that property crimes against nobility or the church in Europe were more-harshly punished than those against commoners, or that that women or Jews lacked property rights at various points in time.  Slaves *being* property didn't really do much for the weak, I'd say.

&gt;The same arguments can be made for UHC, the sick and injured are drains on society, at a minimum based purely on a loss of productivity.

But if I am providing a net benefit to society (that is, in excess of the costs that my care would impose on society), I can pay for care sufficient to provide a return.  The expected value of my future contributions might exceed that of my costs, in which case I can obtain a loan.

I think that both of us would agree that there are medical situations where the cost significantly outweighs the return; it is hard to argue that someone dying kept in a coma for six additional months and utilizing medical resources that could alternatively have been used on several people who can be healed and are providing services to the doctors is a net economic win, right?

Clearly the solution is the elimination of elites. 

There are few things better for a nation or a group of nations than the elimination of an entrenched plutocracy. The plagues of the middle ages with their equal opportunity death opened up social and economic opportunities all across Europe and there was a surge in innovation, invention and scholarship by those able to move up from the lower classes. This produced the Renaissance.

After the French Revolution they attempted to bring to justice those who had exploited and abused those weaker than themselves. This wiped out most of the hereditary classes and the result energized the entire nation. Within a dozen years France had conquered most of Europe.

Russia did much the same and became powerful despite having an incompetent and brutal leader and despite suffering terrible losses during WWII. Before that Russia had only been an unimportant backwater nation. After that it was one of the two most powerful nations on earth.

The American Revolution and the huge amount of land left vacant after the plagues that devastated the native American population made it possible for people (usually white men, it is true, since women and blacks were still subjugated) of ability to achieve their potential and to enrich the nation and make better the lives of most people.

After the civil war the entrenched plutocracy of the north grew in power until the depression. In the 1930’s when progressive income and estate taxes were enacted (instead of the guillotine), the power of this plutocracy was brought under control, leading to a surge of innovation and inventions that continued till recently. Sadly, this movement has ended as such taxes have all but been eliminated. Innovations are now likely to come from outside the US as the plutocracy tightens its grip on the American population and makes it harder to get a good education or to profit from your own training or inventions. The plutocracy understands that change frequently displaces them and they meant to stop change by limiting education and innovation. Progressive income and estate taxes can reduce their wealth and therefore their power and energize the rest of the American public. But it will take a fight to accomplish that.

Incorrect. Both the US and the Soviet Union had tactical nukes (small yield, small range) in both Korea and Vietnam.

The Pentagon's Jason Division met in 1966 and came up with a 55-page report discussing the use of nukes in Vietnam. It concluded the costs outweighed the benefits: only limited damage against a dispersed, guerrilla group and it opened up nuclear retaliation by Soviet forces.

Beforehand, however, in Korea, after China became involved in the Korean war, we tried our best at a [scorched earth policy](http://hnn.us/articles/9245.html) with B-52 raids and napalm strikes but kept getting beaten back.

&gt;MacArthur's orders were ""to destroy every means of communication and every installation, and factories and cities and villages. This destruction is to start at the Manchurian border and to progress south.""

When the use of our largest conventional weapons failed (12,000lb fuel-air bombs with a ~10 ton TNT equivalent) it was than MacArthur argued that a nuclear wasteland was the only thing which would stop the Chinese. MacArthur went public in criticism against Eisenhower, through a congressman, and released the following letter:

&gt;It seems strangely difficult for some to realize that here in Asia is where the Communist conspirators have elected to make their play for global conquest, and that we have joined the issue thus raised on the battlefield; that here we fight Europe’s war with arms while the diplomats there still fight it with words; that if we lose the war to communism in Asia the fall of Europe is inevitable, win it and Europe most probably would avoid war and yet preserve freedom. As you pointed out, we must win. There is no substitute for victory.

Alarmed, an [emergency meeting of Eisenhower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur#Dismissal), his generals and advisers convened and decided to fire Eisenhower because of his fervent suggestion to go nuclear. They replaced him with Ridgway.

Ironically, in the book [Mao: The Unknown Story](http://www.amazon.com/Mao-Story-Jung-Chang/dp/0679422714), it talks about how Mao had gone to war in Korea against the US, without any real discussion with the Kremlin at all, with the sole purpose to provoking the US into a direct war with China. His reasoning was that the Soviet Union would then provide him with modern militarized weapons and industry, things his country badly needed during the Great Leap Forward; and, also, because he had world-conquering ambitions.

All Iranian citizens are not Persian, and all Persians are not Iranians by nationality.

As far as the persecution of Shi'ites, it has little to do with the ""odd things"" that they do. There are other political and sociological reasons at the root of these conflicts. Superficial reasons like, ""they act weird"" are retrospective justifications for the actions of their antagonists.

What do you mean they look different from Arabs? They aren't a racial group. Arabs and Persians are both classified as Caucasians. The difference is linguistic/ethnic, not racial. There might be differences in traits in the same way that tall, blond people are more common in Scandinavia, but that doesn't mean that there are not tall, blond people throughout the rest of Europe.

How does someone ""look Indian?"" How can you say what a Pakistani ""looks like"" any more accurately than you can say what an American looks like? Pakistan is multi-cultural. 

A portion of Pakistan's population actually immigrated from India in 1947 during Partition (more that 7.2 million people). Additionally, more than ~20% of the population is Iranian, including ~15% Pashtun and ~3% Balochi. The majority of the Pakistani population (~75%) is Indo-Aryan, a subset of the Indo-Iranian ethno-linguistic group. There are several subgroups within this category.

Among Indians you'll find: Indo-Iranians, Dravidians, Austro-Asiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Afro-Asians, Europeans, Tai, and many other groups.

Additionally, Hinduism is an extremely diverse religion and is not cohesive in the way that religions like Christianity and Islam are. Also, most Muslims in India received Islam from Persian rulers, not Arabs. But either way, religion and ethnicity are not the same. There are light-skinned, Punjabi-speaking Pakistani Hindus and dark-skinned, Malayalam-speaking Muslim Indians (Malayalam is a language spoken in south India and India has more Muslims than Pakistan; the largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia).

It doesn't matter how complex they are. It's still perfectly possible to put lines through the core, including cooled lines, vacuum insulated lines and lines containing moderator, if your energy spectrum is wrong.

Again, if you can build and operate a reactor (any reactor) you can breed enough fissile weapon-suitable material.

Again, if you don't want to do it, use (H)EU or a Pu-239 bomb.

I think you're forgetting the part where we were still out west ethnically cleansing the land. Also, why don't you ask a black person if there was peace in the US after the Civil War. The reason there were no further civil wars was due to the US government becoming all powerful and usurping all of the important rights of the state so that they couldn't hope to rebel again, even if they wanted to. The government *also* kept attention focused beyond the borders, launching imperialist war after imperialist war, and even getting involved in Europe's imperialist wars. Just because we aren't having a civil war every week doesn't mean that people aren't still fighting with each other. 

&gt;How about the 50 years of (relative) peace among nuclear states since WWII?

Yeah... you're not a big fan of history, are you... Just look at all the conflicts the US and Russia have been in with proxies and other third parties. Just because we aren't fighting Russia doesn't mean we're not fighting. You're really bad at this logic thing. You should probably quit.

&gt;Indeed, our DNA prepares us to fight but not indiscriminately. There are rules, rules that can be understood and manipulated so that war happens rarely, and when it does happen, it is subdued.

HAHAHAHAH! What a load of SHIT! Go take a look at Africa and see how ""subdued"" they are. The only thing that keep western and western-influenced countries from fighting every second is our culture. We understand that we are better off *NOT* fighting all of the time, if only because when we *really* need to fight for or against something we might not be ready. The reason we ""subdue"" ourselves in war is that we don't want that action visited upon ourselves.

&gt;In fact, I see no reason why we can't theoretically achieve the same peace worldwide that the US has enjoyed within its borders for the last 150 years.

You don't understand human nature; *that's* why you don't see a reason. The only hypothetical situation that could *ever* bring humanity together would be an alien invasion or something.

See, the problem is that it *does* matter what he wants to do.  Your goal in ""rescuing"" him from his alcoholic dad and your shared deadbeat mother seems to be to improve his chances in life.  Maybe he's not mature enough to understand that, but if he's unhappy about living with you or resentful that he's being moved around with no input, chances are he's not going to feel any more in control of his life or any happier living with you than he does living with June.

**Edit:** I qualify this remark with the confession that I'm a child of divorce.  My parents split when I was 6, and my mom had primary custody of my brother and myself for nine years while my dad spent time in Europe, remarried, and (without the burden of fully financially supporting two children), managed to accumulate a decent amount of savings.  When I was fifteen, after a rough patch with my mom, I made a change to live with my dad.  As a result, I spent 5 years in a home with near strangers, was separated and grew apart from my brother, and have had the incontrovertible urge to self-sabotage when handed opportunities that relied on my father's increased wealth (the money he made after the divorce while sending minimal child support payments -- my mom worked odd jobs for nine years to raise my brother and I -- a fraction of my clothes were secondhand for most of my childhood).

Obviously, my situation growing up is *VERY* different from Chris', but I'm just saying that my resentment at having been through this experience has really cancelled out most of the benefit of being transferred to the care of someone financially better prepared to see to my needs.  If you're serious about this, you're going to have to talk to Chris about it sometime, and it's better that he hears of it from *you* rather than overhears June on the phone with someone or his dad drunkenly raving about how you're trying to take Chris away from him.",True,t1_c0ndi3i,True,,t5_2qh1i,,c0ndi3i

During the first crusade, after the catholics took Jerusalem, they killed pretty much every person in the city.  During the second crusade St. Bernard said ""The Christian glories in the death of a pagan, because thereby Christ himself is glorified.""  
  
In 1209 Pope ""Innocent"" III ordered another crusade into France which killed another 200,000 actually innocent people.  About 20 years later Pope Gregory IX ordered the extermination of an entire people claiming that the devil regularly appeared among them as a goose or a duck.  
  
The inquisition was also a lot of fun, resulting in the torture and butchering of ~350,000 innocent men, women, and children - including some of the world's greatest thinkers.  
  
Witch hunting was responsible for the deaths of up to another million or so people.  These people were killed for things such as the weather (which, if it's bad, must have been caused by witchcraft).  Pope Innocent VIII declared that witches pretty much caused everything from disease, bad weather, accidents, etc.  
  
This all continued after the catholics paved the path with the protestant churches around the world and the salem which trails in the US.  This still continues today.  
  
In 1524 the church conducted a cleansing when Thomas Muentzer said ""curse the unbelievers ... don't let them live any longer, the evil-doers who turn away from God. For a godless man has no right to live if he hinders the godly. The sword is necessary to exterminate them ... if they resist let them be slaughtered without mercy ... the ungodly have no right to live, save what the Elect choose to allow them ... Now, go at them ... it is time ... The scoundrels are as dispirited as dogs ... Take no notice of the lamentations of the godless! They will beg you ... don't be moved by pity ... At them! At them! While the fire is hot! Don't let your sword get cold! Don't let it go lame!""  
  
In 1588 the pope gave his blessing to Spain to conquer England and promised a forgiveness of sins for all who took part.  
  
The 30 years war was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history and was fought over religion between catholics and protestants.  That killed somewhere in the range of 3 to 10 million people.  
  
About 14 million native Americans were slaughtered by Europeans driven by Roman Catholicism.  About 17 million more Africans were killed by catholic driven slavery trade.  
  
The Holocaust, which this guy attributes to atheism was really the culmination of a thousand year campaign of killing by the christians.  It's no accident that the jews were the target.  The catholic church supported anti-semitism and supported nazi germany in various ways.  
  
Croatia in WW2 was a roman catholic nazi state.  They killed almost a million serbs with enthusiastic support from the catholic church.  
  
This continued as recently as the 90's, when about 200,000 more ~~strikethrough~~serbs were killed~~ were killed by serbs (edit: thanks, dev).  
  
Then there's the protestant death squads in ireland.  
  
Then there's 1994 rwandan genocide, committed by christians.  
  
Then there is Uganda.  85 per cent christian - death penalty for homosexualty, mass rape and murder, etc.
  
Then there is Zimbabwe.  
  
Then there is the witch hunting in Africa - targeting primarily women and children.  (http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4470).  This is happening today.  
  
Then there is the suppression of progress for a thousand years which lead to disease, death, and all around crappy lives for pretty much everyone who was around.  That's more of an indirect consequence of the influence of religion.  
  
So, in summation: Fuck you Bishop Fisher.  The saddest realization for the atheist is that people like you and the church you represent will not end up in hell where you belong.

I guess my biggest complaint is that 90% of it is either:

1. Set against a backdrop of medieval European folklore, with dragons and other creatures borrowed from fairy tales.
2. Urban fantasy where vampires (themselves a product of European folklore) are real but somehow manage to keep it a secret. 

I don't know if it's that authors lack the imagination to adapt fantasy elements from other cultures, or if there's simply no market for other types of fantasy, but the lack of diversity is really annoying. I feel like I've read one fantasy novel, therefore I've read them all.

There's a lot of folklore from Native American, African, and Asian cultures which could be adapted for a fantasy story that wouldn't read like a Tolkien knock off, but that simply never happens, or at least it's not common to do so. Let alone seeing anything that's actually original.

(For an example of something more original, ReBoot was a kids show, but it used a computer as the basis of its fantasy setting. That's a million times more interesting than yet another novel with Kings and swords and wizards and orcs. But we never, ever see anything as creative as ReBoot in fantasy literature, why?)

Let me make this very simple for you, because I can tell you're a very simple individual:

The term ""conservative"" is relative.

Because it's relative, you cannot say that one person is a ""true"" conservative while another is not.

""Conservative"" is proprietary political terminology, so it's meaningless for the sake of definition, since the ideas behind our political system are global. You can call Ron Paul a classical liberal or a 19th century libertarian if you want to be academic about it. 

&gt;If so, it's been pretty unclear.

I can tell that you struggle with grasping this whole idea of proprietary terminology.

&gt;The most that congress does on a daily basis is to add laws or restrictions, most of which don't amend the constitution any further. The constitution doesn't consist of all laws.

So, consider it a modification of the enforcement of laws as governed by the constitution. What is the difference? The law is in a constantly modifying dynamic state as serves a developing nation. The very procedure of it is explicitly constitutional. 

&gt;Just in this most recent post, the fact that you defend neocons, the removal of habeus corpus, and claiming that we've not been attacked again because of the removal of habeus corpus, is why you come across as a neocon.

The suspension of habeus corpus is allowed. That's the point-- the president was acting within his power as the executive. Whether or not it was correct, it was effective. What do you think prevented terrorist attacks here while they continued in Europe? 

&gt;You're basically an asshole. You disagree with other political views, so you demean them and dismiss them as much as possible.

Libertarians are a bit too far off the political spectrum for me to consider their perspective relevant. It takes an excessive degree of ignorance to look at the modern world and believe that heavy reduction of the United States government would fix any societal problems. It takes a childlike mind.

&gt;You know nothing at all about the libertarian philosophy

It's about cutting costs, profits, capitalism.

That includes 'immigrants' from other EU countries. I don't think there's any tracking of interstate 'immigration' in the US.

Time for a lesson:
Number of foreign born in the US: 

&gt;[**34,860,000**  2004(40.5 million est in 2010):   In 35 of the country's 50 largest cities, non-Hispanic whites were at the last census or are predicted to be in the minority. In California, non-Hispanic whites slipped from 80% of the state's population in 1970 to 43% in 2006.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Origin)

The population of the US is around [**307 million**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/publicdata%3Fds%3Duspopulation%26met%3Dpopulation%26tdim%3Dtrue%26dl%3Den%26hl%3Den%26q%3Dpopulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bunited%2Bstates&amp;ei=5nG2S-HTJobGlQedldh9&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=prbx_publicdata&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=002662436500654163341&amp;ved=0CAYQ4wEwAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo3QfJVPqNcdqDqC1bc5yev01BCw). That means about **13.2%** of the population are foreign born.

No let's look at europe:

&gt;[At the end of 2006, according to official national statistics and Eurostat estimates, the total number of non-nationals living in the EU Member States was **29 million**, representing **5.8 %** of the total EU population......according to Eurostat estimates, the proportion of non-nationals is 10 % or higher in Latvia (19 %), Estonia (18 %),......The figures for Latvia and Estonia include people who have been resident in the country since before the Soviet Unions' break-up, but they have not yet acquired citizenship of Latvia or Estonia. ](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Migration_statistics)

&gt;[The combined population of all 27 member states has been forecast at **501,259,840** as of January 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Demographics)

Nope. 

As for the Playstation store selling FF games more than others, the reason why they sell more is for this reason, their stories and gameplay are proven, and they're already completed. Now obviously graphics is important and really that's the main reason why we pay so much for games, and why someone would think it's crazy to pay full price for a game full of sprites, especially on the PS3. 

BUT! oddly enough the 5.49 million people that have bought Pokemon since December of last year ( Japan since december selling 3.72 million copies, North Americans buying 1.29 million since the 14th of march, and europeans buying 480,000 copies since the 26th of March disagree with you that people don't buy Pokemon games, or sprite based games despite their system (the DS) being much more capable than it's graphics show. Same with Dragon Quest 9 on the DS, selling 4.27 million copies in Japan alone. Even though they don't have flashy visuals, they are some of the top selling games in their markets and they're paying 40 dollars in NA, and even more everywhere else.

As for the industry being inundated with crap games that look pretty, that's debatable, most games that are truly crap are built for the Wii to get mothers to grab it for their kids when they're out at the grocery store, but then again you can't mar a medium for the worst that comes out especially video games because there isn't as much of a filtering process to getting a game published as we do in lets say movies. If a movie is total crap it won't get shown in theaters and will get put out on DVD, because the distributor needs to keep an image, and it cost a lot to promote a film. Games on the other hand can be released straight away, and the market will dictate what's worthwhile. Saying that the games market is bad because you have games that are crap but look great is like saying the movie industry is crap for having blockbuster films that look good but suck. (which a LOT of them do). 

Oh well, we'll have to agree to disagree, because gaming certainly is an interesting medium, I'm hoping that it will continue to grow artistically, and people will be interested in the old classics so they can get some perspective. Maybe gamers of yesteryear will show their kids games from their childhood just like our parents showed us movies, and then their ""literacy"" will increase, who knows! The biggest risk game so far this year Heavy Rain has certainly paid off, selling over a million in 5 weeks, despite most people believing it would be a critical success but not a commercial one (I've heard that they had to print more because the demand was way higher than they anticipated). You can't say that the gameplay was a big seller in that one that's for sure, but the story was something new and interesting. If there's a market for interesting IPs like Heavy Rain in the industry it will continue to grow, even if the spotlight is centered on mindless shooters.",True,t1_c0ne5d6,False,,t5_2qh03,,c0ne5d6

Most bike travelers who ride across the globe use a similar frame, simple and sturdy, though the somewhat Spartan feel (when riding high-pressure slicks to save energy) is often compensated with suspension in the seat tube.

If you've done 100 kms a day and liked it, i'd definitely recommend to pack your bike and ride into the adventure. With a bike you can carry all you need to roam for a few weeks, traveling and sleeping independent. You can live off the grid most of the time, only having to enter the normal world now and then to fill your bottles and buy your groceries. If you're a person that's comfortable on it's own but also confident enough to share a part your life with the next complete stranger you run into, you will have a good time.

I don't know for Canada, but in many countries in Europe wild camping is outlawed. Not that it bothers the experienced bike traveller; after some practise you'll get better in reading the landscape and predicting how it's used by humans, finding spots where you can virtually disappear from the views of law enforcers and lawless forces. Don't spoil the fun for future generations though, minimize your traces, clean up your camp ground when you leave.

When you're on cultivated soil, many of the farmers are your friend, as soon as they feel they can trust you. In my case the recumbent bike was great for making a good first impression. Familiarity with animals and some knowledge of farm practices helped too. If you show you can help them a bit, they will offer you space to sleep, and even food. It's nice to keep some small presents or gift vouchers in your luggage to drop in one's mailbox when you leave.

I have a packing list with recommendations, it's in Dutch, but i can translate and comment some of that through this weekend. To be independent from motels, you'll need some camping equipment, which is expensive to get both lightweight and reliable. A 'Quechua' tent would be a good low cost alternative, but i've read in Canada they don't sell this brand, but inferiour lookalikes instead. Maybe you can borrow a good lightweight tent, or buy a personal shelter from an army dumpstore.

He said ""Clearly the solution is the elimination of elites."" - that means that the people in charge of executing that elimination becomes the de facto elite.

Then he cites the French Revolution and then ""in a dozen years France had conquered most of Europe"".

One has to be completely ignorant of history if one thinks that Russia became powerful because of revolution. Russia could not even defeat Norway militarily in the Winter War (only nominally, that was one of the reasons Hitler invaded). Russia only defeated Hitler because of American aid and the refusal from Norway to retaliate the Russian past treacheries.

After defending such bloodthirsty soon-to-be elite and its bloody revolution he mentions progressive income and estate taxes - points #2 and #3 in Marx' manifesto. His worldview and ideas are, evidently, recycled Marxism.

The Spanish language is a Romance language which began its evolution from Latin in the 3rd century BC.

Spanish is now spoken by over 400 million people from many parts of Western Europe to South, Central and North America. There are even a number of Spanish speakers in West Africa and Australasia. There is also a lot of history in Spanish culture.

As a result there is a great demand for non-Spanish speakers to learn the Spanish Language.

I have been introduced to many languages in my life but none are as passionate or expressive as the Spanish language. If you can remember the exploits of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek in Desperado or Gomez from the Adam’s Family you may have an idea what I am talking about.

There are many Spanish language training courses being offered on the internet they range from fairly poor quality where the trainer seems to think that beginners have some sort of grounding in Spanish, to high quality courses with voice and text, some even video, that contain loads of phrases and vocabulary. Some courses offer the opportunity to start to learn at a beginner level and some courses take you from the beginner to the advanced level in one course.

The prices of these courses range from low cost (under $10) to over $300. In most cases you get what you pay for in terms of quality. But there are some courses available for under $100 that rival the expensive courses and those are the ones that we will be seeking out and reviewing.

I hope that the information that we provide will not only help you to save money but also make your Spanish language learning experience a pleasant one.

Since you mention an interest in Victorian sexuality, I wonder if you are familiar with the history of vibrators, which in the [Victorian era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) became a labor-saving device for doctors who previously were expected to manually cure ""[female hysteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria)"" by bringing them to ""hysterical paroxysm"". I've included a paragraph from 
[The Astonishing History of Vibrators](http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4180/language/en-US/The-Astonishing-History-Of-Vibrators.aspx):

&gt; Mention vibrators, and most people think of women's sexual pleasure. But that was the furthest thing from the minds of the male doctors who invented them more than a century ago. They were more interested in a labor-saving device to spare their own hands the fatigue caused by treating ""female hysteria."" This condition involved a number of vague, chronic complaints in adult women, including: anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability, nervousness, erotic fantasies, and moisture inside the vagina. Female hysteria was actually women's sexual frustration. The history of vibrators is a strange tale that provides insights into both the history of sex toys, and cultural notions about women's sexuality.

The Wikipedia article on [female hysteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria) mentions the following:

&gt; A physician in 1859 claimed that a quarter of all women suffered from hysteria. One physician cataloged 75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria and called the list incomplete; almost any ailment could fit the diagnosis. Physicians thought that the stresses associated with modern life caused civilized women to be both more susceptible to nervous disorders and to develop faulty reproductive tracts. In America, such disorders in women reaffirmed that the United States was on par with Europe; one American physician expressed pleasure that the country was ”catching up” to Europe in the prevalence of hysteria.
&gt;
&gt; Rachel P. Maines has observed that such cases were quite profitable for physicians, since the patients were at no risk of death, but needed constant treatment. The only problem was that physicians did not enjoy the tedious task of vaginal massage (generally referred to as 'pelvic massage'): The technique was difficult for a physician to master and could take hours to achieve ""hysterical paroxysm."" Referral to midwives, which had been common practice, meant a loss of business for the physician.
&gt;
&gt; A solution was the invention of massage devices, which shortened treatment from hours to minutes, removing the need for midwives and increasing a physician’s treatment capacity. Already at the turn of the century, hydrotherapy devices were available at Bath, and by the mid-19th century, they were popular at many high-profile bathing resorts across Europe and in America. By 1870, a clockwork-driven vibrator was available for physicians. In 1873, the first electromechanical vibrator was used at an asylum in France for the treatment of hysteria.

If you're really into lyrics, then you're not going to enjoy the vast majority of pop music. To take two canonical examples, take Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" or pretty much any early Beatles song: the lyrics are not exactly Shakespeare (Beatles: ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, ... with a love like that, you know it can't be bad"" -- then they rhyme that with ""sad"" -- not breaking new territory I think!). The point about pop music is that you try to make an utterly compelling combination of melody, harmony, and rhythm -- and you stick to that combination, keeping things nice and tight and simple and easy to follow. Lyrics really are secondary and are important insofar as they help to set the mood, and they give non-expert listeners something to latch on to (their brains, without realizing it, are *actually* latching on to the underlying harmony, rhythm, etc. but people, when they don't know harmony theory, intervals, etc. latch on to the lyrics instead -- there was an article posted recently on how Japanese always hear things 'instrumentally' and I think it made a lot of valid points). Countless pop songs have pretty ordinary lyrics (coupled with great or compelling music), but it's rather hard to find a hit pop song with great lyrics but crap music. (There are exceptions: try as I might, I can't find anything remotely enjoyable in Gwen Stefani's ""Hollaback Girl"" -- terrible lyrics, and basically atonal [and fucking awful] music. It's an attitude song, I guess... and also the exception on the album -- see the awesome ""Whatcha Waiting For"" [produced by another surefire hit producer, Great White Duke]) Music is distinct from poetry!

A lot of our appreciation of pop music really falls in the realm of cognitive science IMHO. There's a pretty good book on the topic called ""This Is Your Brain On Music"" -- in it, he relates studies that show how the major scale is literally hard-wired into your brain. Ditto certain (e.g. 4/4 which is used almost universally in pop music) rhythms. Finally, the tempo is usually set between 110 and 130bpm which is quite close to our heart beat especially when active, e.g. dancing.

Anyway, as to why I think the song's a hit. I'm doing this all just by recall -- I don't have the music in front of me now. 

Key to almost all big hits is that:

- They use diatonic harmony. Diatonic harmony means that the chords that you use for the song are derived from the major scale (note, the song can be in a minor key, because the natural minor [or aeolian] scale is is the sixth mode of the major [or ionic] scale). Using major harmony, it's actually pretty hard to make a chord change sound unpleasant. Sometimes songs use a few more tricks, like secondary dominants to spice things up (this is an old jazz [and, actually, jazz stole it from classical and european popular music] trick) which is used e.g. in Michael Buble's ""I Just Haven't Met You Yet"" (another song, incidentally, with pretty atrocious lyrics and yet to my mind a rather pleasant song to listen to and another surefire hit). In the specific case of Tik Tok, you've got an extremely simple IV -&gt; V -&gt; vi (assuming you're in B, for example, you'd play G -&gt; A -&gt; Bmin). What other songs share the same chord change? Well, if you turn the sequence around you get the chord change for ""All Along The Watchtower"" (I'm guessing you don't think Bob Dylan is shit -- but I bet you would if he had put the lyrics of ""All Along..."" to the music in ""Hollaback Girl""). There are literally countless more examples, but that's just off the top of my head. 

- That chord change is played right at the intro of the song by a synth. The chords are roughly spelled out. Normally you need three notes to make a standard chord -- the root, the third, and the fifth. The fifth, however, is not really that informative because both major and minor chords share the same fifth, so in practice you can elide it, keeping only the root note and the third, and still retain the overall color (jazz guys do this all the time). In this case, we have the root note panned hard left, and the third panned hard right (or vice-versa, can't remember, and it doesn't really matter as you can just switch the headphones :) I for one think that intro sounds really cool! The synth sounds bright and definitely catches your attention. And of course, as mentioned, the chord change is diatonic so it's harmonious. A little more on the chord change: there is something in harmony theory called diatonic substitutions. The vi (minor) chord is a diatonic substitute of the I (major, root) chord. In other words, you can roughly exchange one for the other. Why? Quite simple: out of the three notes to build a chord, they share two of the notes -- only one note is different. So you'd expect them to sound similar, and indeed they do. So what have you got now? IV -&gt; V -&gt; iv &lt;=&gt; I  i.e. IV -&gt; V -&gt; I. Now, a little more theory, the IV chord is called the sub-dominant. The V chord is called the dominant, and it is characterized by a strong pull towards the tonal center -- the I chord. If you listen to almost ANY piece by Mozart, a significant component will be Tonic -&gt; Sub-Dominant -&gt; Dominant. It simply sounds good! By the way, ""Not Fade Away""? Same principle. Most Beatles songs too. Also, ""Wild Thing"" and even the blues follows the same principle! We musicians really are extremely lazy ;)

As far as harmony and melody goes, that's pretty much it! You'll note that the chorus follows the same progression as the verse. And actually, it's pretty hard to make that not sound boring: Dr. Luke did a great job making it sound distinct, using...

- Different rhythms. If you look at the first verse and chorus, you start with basically no beat -- the beat is implied by the rhythm in the synth line (once again, that synth line is really clever!). Then she goes something like ""boys try to touch my junk"" (or something... who cares what the hell she says? it's about dancing and having fun!) and the beat comes: BOOM cha BOOM ... cha. BOOM cha BOOM ... cha. The first cha on an off-beat, for interest, the second one cha on the standard 2 beat which is par for the course for almost all pop (another example: The Strokes, ""Last Nite"" pom cha pom cha pom cha-pom-pom cha -- again all the cha's are on the 2 or 4 -- it's almost like mini call and response twice within a bar). Going back to the song, we're now at the verse-pre-chorus, right before the chorus we drop out (giving strong anticipation) and BOOM we hit the chorus with a massive four on the floor bass drum which is sure to get butts moving on the dancefloor. Now for the second verse: same thing as in the first, but now everything is under-girded by that four-on-the-floor kick drum, giving the song a dance feel and moreover basically propelling it forward, kicking it into a higher gear. I find it hard to listen to that second verse without tapping my foot... it's almost automatic and uncontrollable, similar to how I can't stop myself from tapping in ""Last Nite"" -- exactly what you want in a pop song.

- We go into a second chorus, this time adding more of what the guy who produced my record (Mike Crossey -- he worked with Arctic Monkeys, Razorlight, and recently Blood Red Shoes [they rock! -- and so young it makes me jealous :) ] ) calls ""ear candy"". I call it flair: basically extra shakers and rhythmic sounds and whistles and stuff to keep stuff interesting.

However... by this point the same chord change over and over is starting to get a little boring. And no sooner does that happen than Dr. Luke expertly moves you into...

- the breakdown: ""you build me up, you break me down, you've got that sound"". Now we have some new harmonic material! But what is it exactly? IIRC, it's ii -&gt; iii -&gt; vi -&gt; v (repeat). And guess what? ii is a diatonic substitue of IV! iii is a substitute of I (although think in this case it almost acts like a V to the vi). vi as mentioned, is a substitutes of I, and then the v. So we've got diatonic substitutions of IV -&gt; I -&gt; V, which is just a simple permutation of the original sequence -- i.e. the wet dream of the record label: ""The same, but different"" :)

And finally..

- we end it all with another couple of banging choruses.

I'd like to add that the lyrics are incredibly cheap and schlock -- I don't deny that at all. But, again, I don't think that's the point. Her semi-rapping delivery is undeniably credible -- she sounds like she's not really trying; just having fun. And that's the point. In an interview, they asked her if she's a bad influence on girls. She took the example line: ""brush my teeth with a bottle of jack"" and said something to the effect of: ""do people *really* think I do that? of course not!... it's just a song, a fun song"". 

I really understand where you're coming from, by the way -- I don't want to sound judgmental. I spent 6 years playing only jazz -- if it wasn't Charlie Parker, if it didn't go outside harmony, etc., I just wasn't interested. Similarly, if I thought the lyrics were puerile or mundane, I just wrote the music off. I really had to force myself to open my mind to music that, simply said, serves a different purpose. Once I did that, I found that I was more happy, because I could still listen to all the ""headier"" stuff, but I didn't beat myself up anymore when I caught myself tapping my foot to supposedly crap, ephemeral music.

As George Martin said of pop: it may be ephemeral, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.

End of diatribe... please do listen to my tracks if you get the chance! I love hearing other peoples input, even if it's: dude, that sucks :)

That makes perfect fucking sense. I bet you didn't know that slavery was alive and kicking in Africa long before Europeans made contact and adopted the slave trade, and it even continues today in parts of Africa. So why isn't Chris Rock making racist songs about black people, since they have been oppressing themselves as a race for a much longer period of time? 

Mostly I agree. Slavery didn't exist purely out of racism, but rather it was a natural byproduct of the necessity for the 'developed' enslavement of people in undeveloped parts of the world for cheap labour. 

Fully understood. It existed not only amongst blacks, but among whites as well (hence the plural suffix for several whites to this day, e.g ""Saunders"", remnants of the name of their ancestral slavemaster).

&gt; I can't think of anyone less entitled to make racist comments than Chris Rock. That guy has been handed life on a silver platter and has not even remotely experienced oppression from what I can tell; if he can be racist and get away clean with it, anyone should be able to.

I'm not sure you can make this claim. I've not read any biography about him, but I don't think we can make the assumption he lived a poverty-free and priveleged upbringing.

Unfortunately for blacks today, remnants of slavery remain. Over three hundred years of unpaid labour and the large majority of whom were forced into a vicious cycle of poverty, the prison system or military to become martyrs to a state which racialized and oppressed them in the first place. 

Anyway, this is getting a bit overly ideological. Obviously he didn't mean it nearly as seriously as you and I are taking it. I happen to think it's a fun song .

Protestantism flourished there when Catholicism solidified its power on the continent. Atheism's first European scholars took refuge there, and wrote vast swaths of texts. Francis Bacon, a friar but a man who questioned god, was both revered and the creation of the scientific method--a contradictory manual to that of St Aquinas who preached syllogism, an illogical doctrine.

Please notice the trend I'm building here. Britain has always appreciated eccentricity and change. Atheism is a change. And Atheism is changing Britain as we speak.

The constitution and the presence of god therein the political systems of Canada and Britain do not harm atheists. In fact, the set up not only allows for them it is encouraged. The current system, with an absent god and a quiet queen, is perfect for an atheist society since neither of them demands anything from their subjects other than a nod and a chuckle.

Trying to pass the church off as 'violent' is historically inaccurate, because the church reflected the times. Medieval Europe did *not* value life the same way we might - and the crusades were largely fought by bored aristocrats who wanted to make some $$, and they fought it just like they did wars at home, with peasants seen as a resource of the enemy's to be destroyed. 

Life in medieval Europe was brutish, and things like burning witches or torturing heretics weren't aberrations in a peaceful world - they were exactly in line with what secular powers thought counted for justice too. This wasn't an outgrowth of christianity either - the pagans that had been living across europe who later became christians had similar notions about the value of human life. In fact, i can't think of a single pre-modern civilization that shared our enlightenment values...and that includes largely secular China.

The Chinese will produce products and materials with the specifications demanded by the buyer, and do it consistently and reliably.   Their quality and safety on average is far better than that which we found in the US providers we formerly relied upon.  It is up to the importer to properly test and evaluate the product he imports. There are plenty of dodgy characters in the construction trade, based upon my experiences with contractors working at our facilities.  These firms use price as their only consideration when sourcing materials, wherever they buy them.  We see companies in our industry who buy raw material and finished products via email from China.  They never visit the factory or meet the managers and technicians.  For all they know or care the products they import could be made in a farm shed or a filthy sweat shop.  Doing business in China requires regular personal meetings.  Mutual trust is very important.  Relationships will almost always take precedent over profit.  The Chinese will size you up on the basis of two email messages and if they feel that you are incompetent, lazy or unconcerned about quality they will react accordingly.  The average manager or technician in China is extraordinarily qualified and knowledgeable. They are also very aware of the reputation China has in the US and Europe for dodgy quality and safety and know that it is extremely important to avoid these problems.  In the few instances we have had quality failures the Chinese manufacturer has been very responsive and cooperative in resolving the issue. Very often it is women who run the businesses although usually a man has the formal title of managing director or president.   Given the enormous quantity of goods imported into the US from China the number of serious quality issues is infinitesimal. The US media, not so much in Europe, and politicians exaggerate the extent of the problem, for whatever reason.  Racism probably inters into the equation as well, possibly, as the fear that China is, or already has, eclipsed the US in manufacturing and raw materials.

It's not that they weren't asked to, pretty strongly. But the elites knew it would be political suicide, so they chose to fund and supply the war instead so that the blood would be on somebody else's hands.

The more we study the biochemistry of appetite and satiation, the more we realize how complex these things are. The amount of food it takes to light up satiety centers in the brain which tell you to stop eating, is different for different people. Production of [leptin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gnd&amp;part=obesity) by fat cells varies among people - this hormone is important in curbing appetite, and some people have genetically lower levels of leptin.

Then there are substances such as [neuropeptide Y](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide_Y), [melanocortins](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v26/n1/full/ng0900_8.html), [agouti-related protein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agouti-related_peptide), and [melanocyte stimulating hormone](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v24/n10/abs/0801400a.html), which are important for regulating how much we eat. They all vary among people, often for genetic reasons.

There are obesity-related genes, such as [HOB1](http://hum-molgen.org/NewsGen/10-2002/000014.html), which are different in many obese people. Obesity is likely polygenic, and we will no doubt find many other genes as well that relate to it.

Then there's the fact that people are [born with different numbers of fat cells](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24895105/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/). If you are born with more fat cells, then your chances of being obese are much higher than someone born with less, even though you eat the same and live similar lifestyles.

Then there's the effect of various drugs (such as antidepressants), steroids, or medication for some separate condition (such as insulin or related drugs) which can cause people to overeat.

&gt;Meanwhile, considerable changes had been made in other parts of the continent. The occupation of Algiers by France in 1830 put an end to the piracy of the Barbary states. Egyptian authority continued to expand southward, with the consequent additions to knowledge of the Nile. The city of Zanzibar, on the island of that name, rapidly attained importance. **Accounts of a vast inland sea, and the discovery of the snow-clad mountains of Kilimanjaro in 1840–1848, stimulated the desire for further knowledge about Africa in Europe.**

&gt; In the mid-19th century, Protestant missions were carrying on active missionary work on the Guinea coast, in South Africa and in the Zanzibar dominions. Missionaries visited little-known regions and peoples, and in many instances became explorers and pioneers of trade and empire. David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the Orange River. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the Kalahari Desert from south to north and reached Lake Ngami. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper Zambezi River. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous Victoria Falls, named after the Queen of the United Kingdom. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the Shire River and Lake Nyasa were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of António da Silva Porto, a Portuguese trader established at Bié in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853–1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. **A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857–1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria.

That has been massively influential in my thinking about war and World War 2. I think we confuse the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the sordid history of nuclear weapons afterwards. The bomb was just another weapon of war that was trying to end a suicidal total war that Japan seemed determine to pursue even if it meant all of its young men dying on islands and in its conquered asian holdings , and old men and women rushing at American soldiers on the beaches of Japan with bamboo spears. I don't think the motives behind the bomb were any more crueler than the firebombing of cities to hasten the end of the war. People need to stop pretending like there was some peaceful alternative to the bomb. The alternative was an Okinawa style invasion for the entire island of Honshu. If a nuke could have ended the European war in 43 or 44 before millions more had been killed I think that would fully be worth the cost of 2 nuked German cities.

This is why Inuit, who have all kinds of cold adaptations like more brown fat, and more blood vessels in their fingers and toes, do not have the mutation that makes people white.

Operation Downfall, the plan for the invasion of Japan, was updated after Okinawa. 500,000 US casualties were expected, along with untold MILLIONS of Japanese. They were expecting street to street fighting across the entirety of japan, with suicide bombers, civilians going at them with pitchforks, IEDs, etc etc. It would make the war in Europe look like a walk in the park.

So in the end, the bomb WAS considered the best choice. Japanese The casualty figures for Nagasaki and Hiroshima were lower than those predicted for Downfall.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall

&gt; Through April, May, and June, Allied intelligence followed the build-up of Japanese ground forces, including five divisions added to Kyūshū, with great interest but some complacency, still projecting that in November the total for Kyūshū would be about 350,000 servicemen. That changed in July, with the discovery of four new divisions and indications of more to come. By August, the count was up to 600,000, and Magic cryptanalysis had identified nine divisions in southern Kyūshū—three times the expected number. (In fact, this was still a serious underestimate of Japanese strength; see above.) Estimated troop strength in early July was 350,000,[30] rising to 545,000 in early August.[31]
The intelligence revelations about Japanese preparations on Kyushu emerging in mid-July transmitted powerful shock waves both in the Pacific and in Washington. On 29 July, [MacArthur's intelligence chief, Major General Charles A.] Willoughby … noted first that the April estimate allowed for the Japanese capability to deploy six divisions on Kyushu, with the potential to deploy ten. ""These [six] divisions have since made their appearance, as predicted,"" he observed, ""and the end is not in sight."" If not checked, this threatened ""to grow to [the] point where we attack on a ratio of one (1) to one (1) which is not the recipe for victory.""[32 
A study done for Secretary of War Henry Stimson's staff by William Shockley estimated that conquering Japan would cost 1.7 to 4 million American casualties, including 400,000 to 800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities. The key assumption was large-scale participation by civilians in the defense of Japan.[1]
Outside the government, well-informed civilians were also making guesses. Kyle Palmer, war correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, said half a million to a million Americans would die by the end of the war. Herbert Hoover, in memorandums submitted to Truman and Stimson, also estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 fatalities, and were believed to be conservative estimates; but it is not known if Hoover discussed these specific figures in his meetings with Truman. The chief of the Army Operations division thought them ""entirely too high"" under ""our present plan of campaign.""[47]
The Battle of Okinawa, the very last pitched battle against Japan, ran up 72,000 casualties in 82 days, of whom 12,510 were killed or missing. (This is conservative, because it excludes several thousand U.S. soldiers who died after the battle indirectly from their wounds.) The entire island of Okinawa is 464 square miles; to take it, therefore, cost the United States 407 soldiers (killed or missing) for every 10 square miles of island. If the U.S. casualty rate during the invasion of Japan had only been 5 percent as high per square mile as it was at Okinawa, the United States would still have lost 297,000 soldiers (killed or missing).

Also, the Japanese didn't surrender after the first bomb drop. And even after the second bomb, the Japanese high command was trying to prevent the Emperor from broadcasting a surrender, but he managed to avoid his potential captors and broadcast a surrender.

The Japanese Govt was FULL of crazy mofos.

Their govt has yet to fully accept all the atrocities they committed, because vets and nationalists get pissed. And while everyone always goes how the bomb was horrible, the Rape of Nanking and Unit 731 never gets as much play.

If the US hadn't dropped the bomb, we'd all be bitching here how ""We could have ended the war with the bomb, why didn't we use it? It could have saved millions of Japanese lives, and several hundred thousand american lives""

Im sure you read all those books that make America to be such a great nation founded on hard work and labor. Yes maybe at first, but those same words are meaningless in todays context.

&gt;First off, claiming we ""stole"" land from Spain and France is utter nonsense. Where do you think Spain got Florida from? The natives wanted them there?? 

Just because Spain/France stole their lands doesnt negate that we took it from them. If a kid stole a candy bar from another kid, and a BIGGER kid takes it from him and gives it someone else, isnt that still theft? Just because the BIGGER kid gives it to someone else doesnt eradicate what he did before.

&gt;Most land was ""stolen"" before america was even a nation.

So you agree then? 

&gt;No one here has worked except minorities and poor whites? So Andrew Carnegie, who came penniless from Scotland and build Carnegie Steel ""didn't work""? Rockefeller, who if I'm not mistaken didn't even go to college and built Standard Oil, ""didn't work""? The pioneers who built the early infrastructure of our nation ""didn't work""?

And look who they turned out to be? Greedy, selfish  thugs who kill people in order to get what they want. Yes ""pioneers"" indeed.

And I was referring to minorities and poor whites in todays era. But yes, back then, blacks, minorities, and poor whites bore most of the manual labor, in addition to many lower-income Europeans.

&gt;Our clandestine services aren't as competent or important as you seem to think. America didn't get powerful because we overthrew Iran and a couple of Banana Republics. In fact, we probably would have been better off promoting free trade with those countries instead of worrying about what kind of government they had. The CIA has been little but a parasitical drain on our nation, not the reason our nation is rich.

WOW!! Talk about ignorance. You think the CIA is like reddit. A bunch of nerds just looking at computers and papers all day. Some employees do that but the rest are sent in to change entire govts just to suit our interests. And yes we did get rich though the CIA (and taxing the hell out of the working class as well). How else did we get plentiful fields of oil? Thousands of pounds of opium and other drugs? Please, dont act as if the CIA is some newborn child. They know what they are doing and so should you.

&gt;Our nation was built on free enterprise, industry, and resource development, and we are falling because we increasingly don't have these things.

Maybe for the first part of this country's existence sure.

&gt;They're just clueless people uniting to hate on a scapegoat. 

Exactly. And the reason that's ""fascist"" is not because the encompassing political ideology but because the ultimate goal is militancy through statism.

Opposing the government in favour of an ideologically different political flavour of government to preserve conservative rules and isolate people from new ideas and different demographics is the embodiment of the spirit of fascism - totalitarianism.

Tea Party rhetoric would have people believe that the threat is in the fact that the wrong kind of people have power to make laws, wage war and run multinational conglomerates rather than the fact that *anyone* can have the power to make laws, wage war combined with the fact that multinational conglomerates exist. In short, they advocate a power shift in order to *fix* the system.

This is exactly what the European fascist movement advocated  in the 1930's.

But the correlations don't just end there. National socialists and Mussolini's blackshirts also used fearmongering to marginalize leftist ideology as a terrorist threat, government personnel of different creed as treasonous, welfare programs as theft and non-conservative social norms as deviant.

In addition, European and US wealthy industrialists sponsored and supported right-wing movements both at home and abroad as a good opposition to leftist unions and the perceived ""communist threat"" - Rockefeller for example.

Weather it's the KKK in the 1800's seeking to divide people on racial lines, fascism in the 1900's seeking to divide people on national lines or ""Libertarians"" seeking to divide people on class lines - it is always in the interest of the rich elite to add confusion and congregate the mass against true socialism and keep them afraid and thinking they can change their lives for the better through state reform and elimination of egalitarian values.

In truth, I never thought of this as my ""first kiss"" until I read this thread and other people's stories.  I was somewhere 8-10 years old... somewhere in there.  My mother and I were visiting my grandmother who lives in Virginia.  (I live in Cali)  An old family friend and her 2 daughters came over for a visit.  I didn't really know them incredibly well, but I had met them early in life.  At that point in my life, they were considered ""family friends.""  The older sister was probably less than 1 year younger than myself at the time, and the younger one was 1 year younger than her.  Myself and the two girls were hanging out in my grandmother's back yard (which is only about 8x25ft).  I didn't have any real romantic or sexual interest in any girls at the time, the idea was still foreign to me.  But these girls were all about the kissing.  I don't remember which one was first, or which one was last.  It started out with simple kisses on the cheek.  But eventually both girls were taking turns kissing me (with tongue on the lips), while I just kind of sat there in the patio chair in a state of shock.  Eventually I think my mom asked them to stop (cockblock mom!).  Like I said though, I don't really count this one, except as a funny story as a child.  But in retrospect, it probably served to shape my sexual identity later in life subconsciously.

My next story, which I still can't ""really"" count, took place on my trip to Europe after graduating high school.  I was one one of those tours for people under 35 touring Europe with a bunch of people from all over the world who I had never met before.  It was a lot of fun.  In any case, throughout the trip I had several (and almost all at least partially alcohol induced) ""kisses.""  None of these turned into ""real kissing"" with tongue, or any type of makeout sessions.  But I did have ""peck"" type kisses going back and forth ""playfully"" throughout the trip.  Though on my end, I did want SOMETHING to happen more than that. ;)

My first ""real kiss"" that I can count in full took place very shortly after my return from Europe (later during that summer after graduating high school).  This was a girl I had known very casually as an acquaintance during my last three years of high school.  I never really talked to her much, or paid her any mind.  The only thing that can be said is that during 10th grade badminton, her group of friends would always egg me on to hangout with this girl, and to ""ask her out.""  But I was very naive, and on my end it felt more like they were teasing me.  The girl herself though was very quiet, and it was her friends more than anything, so she could have said something to them in retrospect.  Anyway, she and I started talking more briefly before going to Europe (thanks myspace!).  Even while in Europe, I had a few aim chats with her, but I didn't really know her well.  My newly more liberated personality was merely open to the idea of talking to her.  Little did I know what she had in store at the time...  So I had talked to her about drinking and alcohol on the trip.  I guess this really tickled her fancy, because as soon as I got back she suggested that we hangout, and that I should get alcohol.  I was actually able to obtain a nice selection of alcoholic beverages, as well as the apartment to myself for the afternoon.  When she came over, it began very innocently with me telling her about Europe, showing her pictures, etc..  Within a very short period of time we were both feeling a heavy buzz (I think her more than me).  And within seconds she is all over me, touching me, feeling me.  Now before this I had never had ANY of this happen (no girlfriend, no anything).  Pretty soon we end up in my room, where conversation soon leads down sexual avenues.  We were talking about something related to alcohol and our sex drives.  When I told he that alcohol lowered that sense for me, she said something to the effect that SHE could fix that.  Well anyway, very shortly after that she leaned in and started making out with me.  Now I will say, this was very awkward at first.  They say kissing comes naturally, but it is definitely learned.  I really had no idea what to do with my mouth and tongue at the time, though the alcohol probably didn't help.  But in a couple minutes I figured it out.  The story develops further, and this was also my first time fingering a girl, squeezing her breasts, and eating her out.  After she ""finished"" (Which to be honest with myself and everybody else, I don't really think she did.  I think she was just trying to be polite to my inexperience.), she went to sleep laying there, and I laid there with her unsure of what had just happened, and what was going to happen.  The following couple weeks I tried to ""hang out"" with her again, but she more or less completely avoided me.  Essentially, she ""one afternoon standed"" me.  But whatever, a long time has passed, and I met my current girlfriend shortly after that.  ",True,t1_c0nfd2z,False,,t5_2qh1i,,c0nfd2z

What makes you think libertarians want either? We do not need an army... the age of large standing armies is over, and even the US military discusses their own attempts to scramble and keep up in a world where such things are a burden rather than an asset.

And the police? Why would I want tazer-happy goons around to harass me?

&gt; Let's pretend that scientists knew what they were talking about, and that they claimed catastrophic global disaster was eminent unless CO2 emissions were curtailed.

Let's pretend that.

There simply isn't enough left to burn to make a difference. We may only be roughly halfway through the oil, but the first half was easy to get... it bubbled out of the ground. Remaining oil takes almost as much hydrocarbons to pump out of the ground as you get from the endeavor.

Some scream about coal, but coal won't fill up your gas tank, or the gas tanks of the trucks that bring food to your local grocery.

Things will fall apart. Even if the climate change believers are right (a big if), it's a self-solving problem. I suspect it may even be the solution to Fermi's Paradox.

&gt; Wouldn't regulation requiring CO2 curtailment then fall under the category of defense

So, socialized health care is also defense, because someone might die without it? What can't we twist into being defense (that most libertarians don't even agree is a necessity or desirable) with logic like this?

That quote you selected was from the preamble discussing trepidation about the law, before going into great detail about how well it worked out in the end. To add onto that quote you selected, from the end of the report:

&gt;With time, people coped and acclimated, and now could never imagine having it any other
way. Despite concerns in other European nations about affirmative action or tokenism, “back in
Norway, the ‘tokenism or talent’ debate has already been consigned to history. Women just picked up
the baton and ran with it.”

Internalised patriarchy (or relevant system of oppression) is precisely the thing that makes a person fear tokenisation.

Largely because people who think as you do automatically see successful women and minority as tokens due to how the media frames these issues. Partly because the Big Lie about affirmative action (as I said earlier) is that it elevates the incompetent due solely to the group membership. This is false. It elevates the most talented, and usually people who (like myself) often work three times as hard to prove they are not some token skating by on government regulation, but a real person of worth.

Ironically, the reverse (i.e. the Old Boys Club) *does* reward incompetence and group membership (membership in certain families, in certain schools, coming from the white middle class, etc. etc.). One need only look at the plague of cronyism scandals surrounding the Bush Administration, or the recent economic disaster to see what incompetence can be wrought by the white men who supposedly ""earned"" their jobs through ""hard work"" and ""talent"" which we just so happen to need to reward in the most exorbitant ways possible.

Instead you entreat us to pay attention to efforts to ensure people who actually *are* competent and discriminated against get the fair chances their talents ought to earn them.

As to feminism and female supremacy/man hating that gets advanced through ""judicial activism"" (another right wing buzzword. Brown v. Board of Ed was called judicial activism, enough said, I believe) feminism has a very diverse history and canon. Selective readings will ensure you find the worst of the worst and ignore the best of the best.

Such feminists who *have* argued females are just plain better are usually these days shouted down simply because such notions trade on patriarchal stereotypes of men and women, and it is the latter (rather than men per se) that we are now committed to fighting against. Feminism is very decentralised, diffuse, and non hierarchical (one might dare say a la libertarianism) so I cannot speak for all of us. But for the ones I know, read, and work with who are pretty mainstream so far as I can tell, *that* is the primary goal.

I strongly disagree.  First, I assume you do not recognize a difference between libertarianism and anarchy, even though they are very different.  A de-regulated market it not anarchy or lawlessness.  It is a market where rules exist, but the rules neither favor nor disadvantage anyone and regulation does not prevent competition.  Anyone who reads history can easily see that capitalistic societies (i.e. free markets) trounce every other type out there.

And also, there has been significant intervention by foreign governments, including the US.

&gt; Are there any examples of functioning Libertarian governments, either today, or at any time in history?

Early US (say 1700s - 1913) featured a pretty free market economy. Growth was great.  Or hell, look at Hong Kong vs. China, South Korea vs. North Korea, East vs. West Germany.  Freedom always wins.  The Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom correlates sharply with economic growth.  Basically, just start studying [basic economics](http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf), and you'll come to a political ideology very close to libertarianism.  Also, recent data from Europe shows that [smaller government correlates very strongly](http://workforall.net/EN_Tax_policy_for_growth_and_jobs.html) with economic growth

&gt; Ideologically, what's the difference between tax-supported army/police and other tax-supported services? Is the former just viewed as a necessary evil?

Minarchists would say government should provide it, anarcho-capitalists should say the service should be provided by competing companies in the market instead of a monopoly.

&gt;  Wouldn't regulation requiring CO2 curtailment then fall under the category of defense, and thus be allowed by Libertarians?

Moderate libertarians may support it, but others would take a more comprehensive approach, including analysis of government as an institution, and generally come to the conclusion that operation of this institution does not give way to the correct incentives (see public choice theory), is the institution that is most responsible for pollution (directly and through prevention of establishing actual private property rights), and that government cannot perform economic calculation, and hence government regulations are 1) arbitrary 2) often controlled by special interests (see regulatory capture and public choice, again) and 3) more likely to do more harm than good.  Also, centralized regulation will likely stifle the market activity which is actually necessary to create innovation which will lower carbon dioxide pollution, etc.

Or hell, look at Hong Kong vs. China, South Korea vs. North Korea, East vs. West Germany. Freedom always wins. The Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom correlates sharply with economic growth.

Given the general lack of laissez-faire capitalism in the world, examples to show its benefits are few and far between. Rather than admit that the ideal is simply impossible, conservative and right-""libertarian"" ideologues scour the world and history for examples. Rarely do they let facts get in the way of their searching -- until the example expresses some negative features such as economic crisis (repression of working class people or rising inequality and poverty are of little consequence). Once that happens, then all the statist features of those economies previously ignored or downplayed will be stressed in order to protect the ideal from reality.

Hong Kong is often pointed to by right-wingers as an example of the power of capitalism and how a ""pure"" capitalism will benefit all. It has regularly been ranked as first in the *""Index of Economic Freedom""* produced by the Heritage Foundation, a US-based conservative think tank (""economic freedom"" reflecting what you expect a right-winger would consider important). Milton Friedman played a leading role in this idealization of the former UK colony. In his words:

&gt;*""Take the fifty-year experiment in economic policy provided by Hong Kong between the end of World War II and . . . when Hong Kong reverted to China. *

&gt;*""In this experiment, Hong Kong represents the experimental treatment . . . I take Britain as one control because Britain, a benevolent dictator, imposed different policies on Hong Kong from the ones it pursued at home . . . *

&gt;*""Nonetheless, there are some statistics, and in 1960, the earliest date for which I have been able to get them, the average per capita income in Hong Kong was 28 percent of that in Great Britain; by 1996, it had risen to 137 percent of that in Britain. In short, from 1960 to 1996, Hong Kong's per capita income rose from about one-quarter of Britain's to more than a third larger than Britain's . . . I believe that the only plausible explanation for the different rates of growth is socialism in Britain, free enterprise and free markets in Hong Kong. Has anybody got a better explanation? I'd be grateful for any suggestions.""*

[The Hong Kong Experiment] 

It should be stressed that by ""socialism"" Friedman meant state spending, particularly that associated with welfare (*""Direct government spending is less than 15 percent of national income in Hong Kong, more than 40 percent in the United States.""* [Op. Cit.]). What to make of his claims? 

It is undeniable that the figures for Hong Kong's economy are impressive. Per-capita GDP by end 1996 should reach US$ 25,300, one of the highest in Asia and higher than many western nations. Enviable tax rates - 16.5% corporate profits tax, 15% salaries tax. In the first 5 years of the 1990's Hong Kong's economy grew at a tremendous rate -- nominal per capita income and GDP levels (where inflation is not factored in) almost doubled. Even accounting for inflation, growth was brisk. The average annual growth rate in real terms of total GDP in the 10 years to 1995 was six per cent, growing by 4.6 per cent in 1995. However, looking more closely, we find a somewhat different picture than that painted by those claim Hong Kong as an example of the wonders of free market capitalism. Once these basic (and well known) facts are known, it is hard to take Friedman's claims seriously. Of course, there are aspects of laissez-faire to the system (it does not subsidize sunset industries, for example) however, there is much more to Hong Kong that these features. Ultimately, laissez-faire capitalism is more than just low taxes. 

The most obvious starting place is the fact that the government owns all the land. To state the obvious, land nationalization is hardly capitalistic. It is one of the reasons why its direct taxation levels are so low. As one resident points out:

&gt;*""The main explanation for low tax rates . . . is not low social spending. One important factor is that Hong Kong does not have to support a defense industry . . . The most crucial explanation . . . lies in the fact that less than half of the government's revenues comes from direct taxation. *

&gt;*""The Hong Kong government actually derives much of its revenue from land transactions. The territory's land is technically owned by the government, and the government fills its coffers by selling fifty-year leases to developers (the fact that there are no absolute private property rights to land will come as another surprise t boosters of 'Hong Kong-style' libertarianism) . . . The government has an interest in maintaining high property values . . . if it is to maintain its policy of low taxation. It does this by carefully controlling the amount of land that is released for sale . . . It is, of course, those buying new homes and renting from the private sector who pay the price for this policy. Many Hong Kongers live in third world conditions, and the need to pay astronomical residential property prices is widely viewed as an indirect form of taxation.""*

[Daniel A. Bell, *""Hong Kong's Transition to Capitalism""*, pp. 15-23, Dissent, Winter 1998, pp. 15-6] 

The ownership of land and the state's role as landlord partly explains the low apparent ratio of state spending to GDP. If the cost of the subsidized housing land were accounted for at market prices in the government budget, the ratio would be significantly higher. As noted, Hong Kong had no need to pay for defense as this cost was borne by the UK taxpayer. Include these government-provided services at their market prices and the famously low share of government spending in GDP climbs sharply. 

Luckily for many inhabitants of Hong Kong, the state provides a range of social welfare services in housing, education, health care and social security. The government has a very basic, but comprehensive social welfare system. This started in the 1950s, when the government launched one of the largest public housing schemes in history to house the influx of about 2 million people fleeing Communist China. Hong Kong's social welfare system really started in 1973, when the newly appointed governor *""announced that public housing, education, medical, and social welfare services would be treated as the four pillars of a fair and caring society.""* He launched a public housing program and by 1998, 52 percent of the population *""live in subsidized housing, most of whom rent flats from the Housing Authority with rents set at one-fifth the market level (the rest have bought subsidized flats under various home-ownership schemes, with prices discounted 50 percent from those in the private sector).""* Beyond public housing, Hong Kong *""also has most of the standard features of welfare states in Western Europe. There is an excellent public health care system: private hospitals are actually going out of business because clean and efficient public hospitals are well subsidized (the government pays 97 percent of the costs).""* Fortunately for the state, the territory initially had a relatively youthful population compared with western countries which meant it had less need for spending on pensions and help for the aged (this advantage is declining as the population ages). In addition, the *""large majority of primary schools and secondary schools are either free of heavily subsidized, and the territory's tertiary institutions all receive most of their funds from the public coffers.""* [Bell, Op. Cit., pp. 16-7 and p. 17] We can be sure that when conservatives and right-""libertarians"" use Hong Kong as a model, they are not referring to these aspects of the regime. 

Given this, Hong Kong has *""deviated from the myth of a laissez-faire economy with the government limiting itself to the role of the 'night watchman'""* as it *""is a welfare state.""* In 1995-6, it spent 47 percent of its public expenditure on social services (*""only slightly less than the United Kingdom""*). Between 1992 and 1998, welfare spending increased at a real rate of at least 10 percent annually. [Bell, Op. Cit., p. 16] *""Without doubt,""* two experts note, *""the development of public housing in Hong Kong has contributed greatly to the social well-being of the Territory.""* Overall, social welfare *""is the third largest [state] expenditure . . . after education and health.""* [Simon X. B. Zhao and l. Zhand, *""Economic Growth and Income Inequality in Hong Kong: Trends and Explanations,""* pp. 74-103, China: An International Journal, Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 95 and p. 97] Hong Kong spent 11.6% of its GDP on welfare spending in 2004, for example.

Moreover, this state intervention is not limited to just social welfare provision. Hong Kong has an affordable public transport system in which the government has substantial equity in most transport systems and grants franchises and monopolized routes. So as well as being the monopoly owner of land and the largest landlord, the state imposes rent controls, operates three railways and regulates transport services and public utilities as monopoly franchises. It subsidies education, health care, welfare and charity. It has also took over the ownership and management of several banks in the 1980s to prevent a general bank run. Overall, since the 1960s *""the Hong Kong government's involvement in everyday life has increases steadily and now reaches into many vital areas of socio-economic development.""* [Ming K Chan, *""The Legacy of the British Administration of Hong Kong: A View from Hong Kong,""* pp. 567-582, The China Quarterly, no. 151, p. 575 and p. 574] It also intervened massively in the stock market during the 1997 Asian crisis. Strangely, Friedman failed to note any of these developments nor point to the lack of competition in many areas of the domestic economy and the high returns given to competition-free utility companies. 

The state did not agree to these welfare measures by choice, as they were originally forced upon it by fears of social unrest, first by waves of migrants fleeing from China and then by the need to portray itself as something more than an uncaring colonial regime. However, the other form of intervention it pursued was by choice, namely the collusion between the state and business elites. As one expert notes, the *""executive-led 'administrative non-party' state was heavily influenced by the business community""* with *""the composition of various government advisory boards, committees and the three councils""* reflecting this as *""business interests had an overwhelming voice in the consultation machinery (about 70% of the total membership).""* This is accurately described as a *""bureaucratic-cum-corporatist state""* with *""the interests of government and the private sector dominating those of the community.""* Overall, *""the government and private sector share common interests and have close links.""* [Mae Kam Ng, *""Political Economy and Urban Planning,""* Progress in Planning, P. Diamond and B. H. Massan (eds.), vol. 51, Part 1, p. 11 and p. 84] Sizable fortunes will be made when there are interlocking arrangements between the local oligarchies and the state. 

Another commentator notes that the myth of Hong Kong's laissez-faire regime *""has been disproved in academic debates more than a decade ago""* and points to *""the hypocrisy of laissez-faire colonialism""* which is marked by *""a government which is actively involved, fully engaged and often interventionist, whether by design or necessity.""* He notes that *""the most damaging legacy [of colonial rule] was the blatantly pro-business bias in the government's decision-making.""* There has been *""collusion between the colonial officialdom and the British economic elites.""* Indeed, *""the colonial regime has been at fault for its subservience to business interests as manifested in its unwillingness until very recently, not because of laissez-faire but from its pro-business bias, to legislate against cartels and monopolies and to regulate economic activities in the interests of labor, consumers and the environment . . . In other words, free trade and free enterprise with an open market . . . did not always mean fair trade and equal opportunity: the regime intervened to favor British and big business interests at the expense of both fair play and of a level playing field for all economic players regardless of class or race.""* [Ming K Chan, *""The Legacy of the British Administration of Hong Kong: A View from Hong Kong,""* pp. 567-582, The China Quarterly, no. 151, p. 577, p. 576, p. 575 and pp. 575-6] Bell notes that a British corporation *""held the local telephone monopoly until 1995""* while another *""holds all the landing rights at Hong Kong airport.""* [Op. Cit., p. 21] 

Unsurprisingly, as it owns all the land, the government has *""a strong position in commanding resources to direct spatial development in the territory.""* There is a *""three-tiered system of land-use plans.""* The top-level, for example, *""maps out the overall land development strategy to meet the long-term socio-economic needs of Hong Kong""* and it is *""prepared and reviewed by the administration and there is no public input to it.""* This planning system is, as noted, heavily influenced by the business sector and its *""committees operate largely behind closed doors and policy formulation could be likened to a black-box operation.""* *""Traditionally,""* Ng notes, *""the closed door and Hong Kong centered urban planning system had served to maintain economic dynamism in the colony. With democratization introduced in the 1980s, the planning system is forced to be more open and to serve not just economic interests.""* [Mae Kam Ng, Op. Cit., p. 11, p. 39, p. 37 and p. 13] As Chan stresses, *""the colonial government has continuously played a direct and crucial role as a very significant economic participant. Besides its control of valuable resources, the regime's command of the relevant legal, political and social institutions and processes also indirectly shapes economic behavior and societal development.""* [Op. Cit., p. 574] 

Overall, as Bell notes, *""one cannot help but notice the large gap between this reality and the myth of an open and competitive market where only talent and luck determine the economic winners.""* [Op. Cit., p. 16] As an expert in the Asian Tiger economies summarizes:

&gt;*""to conclude . . . that Hong Kong is close to a free market economy is misleading . . . Not only is the economy managed from outside the formal institutions of government by the informal coalition of peak private economic organizations, but government itself also has available some unusual instruments for influencing industrial activity. It owns all the land. . . It controls rents in part of the public housing market and supplies subsidized public housing to roughly half the population, thereby helping to keep down the cost of labor And its ability to increase or decrease the flow of immigrants from China also gives it a way of affecting labor costs.""* [Robert Wade, Governing the Market, p. 332] 

This means that the Hong Kong system of ""laissez-faire"" is marked by the state having close ties with the major banks and trading companies, which, in turn, are closely linked to the life-time expatriates who largely run the government. This provides a *""point of concentration""* to conduct negotiations in line with an implicit development strategy. Therefore it is pretty clear that Hong Kong does not really show the benefits of ""free market"" capitalism. Wade indicates that we can consider Hong Kong as a *""special case or as a less successful variant of the authoritarian-capitalist state.""* [Op. Cit., p. 333] 
There are other explanations for Hong Kong's high growth rates than simply ""capitalism."" Firstly, Hong Kong is a city state and cities have a higher economic growth rate than regions (which are held back by large rural areas). This is because the agricultural sector rarely achieves high economic growth rates and so in its absence a high growth rate is easier to achieve. Secondly, there is Hong Kong's location and its corresponding role as an entrepôt economy. Wade notes that *""its economic growth is a function of its service role in a wider regional economy, as entrepôt trader, regional headquarters for multinational companies, and refuge for nervous money.""* [Op. Cit., p. 331] Being between China and the rest of the world means its traders could act as a middleman, earning income from the mark-up they could impose on good going through the territory. This is why Hong Kong is often referred to as an entrepôt economy, a place that imports, stores, and re-exports goods. In other words, Hong Kong made a lot of its money because many Chinese exports and imports went through it and its traders marked-up the prices. It should be obvious if most of Western Europe's goods went through, say, Liverpool, that city would have a very good economic performance regardless of other factors. This option is hardly available to most cities, never mind countries. 

Then there is the issue of state ownership of land. As Mae Kam Ng reports, monopoly ownership of all land by the state sets the context for super-profits by government and finance capital generally. [Op. Cit., p. 13] Unsurprisingly, most government land *""is sold to just three real-estate developers""* who *""sit on huge tracts of land, drop-feeding apartments onto the market so as to maintain high property prices.""* Between 1992 and 1996, for example, prices increased fourfold and profits doubled. The heads of two of the property firms were on the list of the world's ten richest men in 1998. *""Meanwhile, potential new entrants to the market are restricted by the huge cost of paying land-conversion premiums that are the bedrock of government revenues.""* This is a *""cozy arrangement between the government and major developers.""* [Daniel A. Bell, Op. Cit., p. 16]

The role as headquarters for companies and as a financial centre also plays a part. It means an essential part of its success is that it gets surplus value produced elsewhere in the world. Handling other people's money is a sure-fire way of getting rich and this will have a nice impact on per-capita income figures (as will selling goods produced in sweat-shops in dictatorships like China). There has been a gradual shift in economic direction to a more service-oriented economy which has stamped Hong Kong as one of the world's foremost financial centres. This highly developed sector is served by some 565 banks and deposit-taking companies from over 40 countries, including 85 of the world's top 100 in terms of assets. In addition, it is the 8th largest stock market in the world (in terms of capitalization) and the 2nd largest in Asia. By 1995, Hong Kong was the world's 10th largest exporter of services with the industry embracing everything from accounting and legal services, insurance and maritime to telecommunications and media. The contribution of the services sectors as a whole to GDP increased from 60 per cent in 1970 to 83 per cent in 1994. 

Meanwhile, manufacturing industry has moved to low wage countries such as southern China (by the end of the 1970's, Hong Kong's manufacturing base was less competitive, facing increasing costs in land and labor -- in other words, workers were starting to benefit from economic growth and so capital moved elsewhere). The economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in southern China in 1978 where important, as this allowed capital access to labor living under a dictatorship (just as American capitalists invested heavily in Nazi Germany -- labor rights were null, profits were high). It is estimated about 42,000 enterprises in the province have Hong Kong participation and 4,000,000 workers (nine times larger than the territory's own manufacturing workforce) are now directly or indirectly employed by Hong Kong companies. In the late 1980's Hong Kong trading and manufacturing companies began to expand further a field than just southern China. By the mid 1990's they were operating across Asia, in Eastern Europe and Central America. This shift, incidentally, has resulted in deindustrialisation and a *""decrease in real income among manual workers""* as they moved to the lower end service sector. [Simon X. B. Zhao and l. Zhand, Op. Cit., p. 88] 

Then there is the criteria Friedman uses, namely per-capita GDP. As we have repeated stressed, averages hide a lot of important and relevant information when evaluating a society. So it must be stressed that Friedman's criteria of per capita income is an average and, as such, hides the effect of inequality. This means that a society with huge numbers of poor people and a handful of ultra-rich individuals may have a higher average income than a more equal society. This is the case of, say, America compared to Sweden. Unsurprisingly, Hong Kong is a very unequal society and this inequality is growing (so his claim that Hong Kong is capitalist refutes his 1962 assertion that the more capitalist economies are more equal). *""Behind the impressive GDP figures,""* indicates Chan, *""is a widening income gap between the super-rich and the grassroots, with 650,000 people reportedly living below the poverty line.""* [Op. Cit., p. 576] As Bell points out, 13% lived below the poverty line in 1999, compared to 8% in 1971. This is partly explained by *""the rising proportion of elderly people and single-parent families.""* However, economic integration with China has played a role as Hong Kong's manufacturing sector *""has been almost entirely transferred to the southern province of Guangdong (where labor is cheaper and workers' rights are practically non-existent), with the consequence that Hong Kong's industrial workers now find it much harder to find decent jobs in Hong Kong. Most end up working in low-paying service jobs without much hope of upward mobility.""* [Op. Cit., pp. 21-2] 

As other experts note, while Hong Kong may have a GDP-per-capita of a developed nation, its distribution of household income was similar to that of Guatemala. Looking at the 1960s onwards, income distribution only improved between 1966 and 1971, after this period the share of the bottom 30% of the population went down continuously while the top 20% saw an increase in their share of total income. In fact, from the 1980s, *""the top 20% of households managed to account for over 50 per cent of the total income.""* In fact, the bottom 60% of the population saw a decline in their share of income between 1971 and 1996. Overall, *""high-income households increased their wealth progressively faster than low-income households.""* This polarization, they argue, will continue as the economy de-industrialises: *""in the absence of proper social policies, it will generate a small, extremely wealthy class of the 'new rich' and simultaneously a large population of the 'working poor.'""* [Simon X. B. Zhao and L. Zhand, Op. Cit., p. 85, p. 80, p. 82, p. 84 and p. 102] 

Given that everywhere cannot be such a service provider, it does not provide much of an indication of how ""free market"" capitalism would work in, say, the United States. And as there is in fact extensive (if informal) economic management and that the state owns all the land and subsidies rent and health care, how can it be even considered an example of ""free market"" capitalism in action? Unless, of course, you consider that ""economic freedom"" best flourishes under a dictatorship which owns all the land, which has close links to business interests, provides a comprehensive, if basic, welfare state and is dependent on another country to provide its defense needs and the head of its executive. While most American's would be envious of Hong Kong's welfare state, it is doubtful that many would consider its other features as desirable. How many would be happy with being under a *""benevolent dictator""* (perhaps being turned into a colony of Britain again?) whose appointed government works closely with the local business elite? Having a political regime in which the wealthy can influence the government without the need for elections may be considered too a high price to pay just to get subsidized housing, health care and education. Given a choice between freedom and a high rate of growth, how many would pick the latter over the former? 

It is no coincidence that like most examples of the wonders of the free market, Hong Kong was not a democracy. It was a relatively liberal colonial dictatorship run. But political liberty does not rate highly with many supporters of laissez-faire capitalism (such as right-""libertarians"", for example). However, the two are linked. Which explains why we have spent so much time debunking the ""free market"" capitalism claims over Hong Kong. It is more than simply a concern over basic facts and correcting inaccurate assertions. Rather it is a concern over the meaning of freedom and the dubious assumption that freedom can be compartmentalized While Hong Kong may be a more appealing example that Pinochet's Chile, it still rests on the assumption that the masses should be excluded from having a say over their communities (in their own interests, of course, and never, of course, in the interests of those who do the excluding) and that freedom is simply the ability to change bosses (or become one yourself). Ultimately, there is a big difference between ""free"" and ""business-friendly."" Hong Kong is the latter simply because it is not the former. Its success is testament that dictatorships can be more reliable defenders of class privilege than democracies. 

This can be seen from the attitude of Hong Kong's business elite to the democratic reforms introduced in the 1990s and integration with China. Significantly, *""the nominally socialist Chinese government consistently opposed the introduction of further social welfare programs in Hong Kong.""* This is because *""it has chosen to enter into a strategic alliance with Hong Kong's business class""* (*""To earn support of corporate bosses, the Chinese government organized timely interventions on behalf of Hong Kong companies""*). Unsurprisingly, the first Beijing-appointed executive was made up of successful business men and one of its first acts was to suspend pro-labor laws passed by the out-going legislature. [Bell, Op. Cit., p. 17, p. 18 and pp. 19-20] The Chinese government opposed attempts to extend democracy, imposing a complex electoral system which, in the words of the Asian Wall Street Journal, was a *""means of reducing public participation in the political process while stacking the next legislature with people who depend on favors from the regime in Hong Kong or Beijing and answer to narrow special interests, particularly the business elite.""* [quoted by Bell, Op. Cit., pp. 18-9] 

This reflects the fact that business tycoons are worried that democracy would led to increased welfare spending with one, for example, predicting that the *""under-educated, and those who did not pay tax would elect candidates who stood for more social spending, which would turn Hong Kong into a 'welfare state' . . . If we had a 100-per-cent directly elected LegCo, only social welfare-oriented candidates will be elected. Hong Kong is a business city and we [sic!] do not want to end up being a social welfare state.""* [*""Tycoon warns on protests,""* The Standard, 29 April 2004] Such a government can ignore public opinion and the electorate more than in an independent democracy and, of course, can be more influenced by business (as the history of Hong Kong testifies).

1. A motorcycle is a viable year-round mode of transportation wherever you don't get nasty rain/snow for a large part of the year.  Otherwise, reconsider.  5-10/year of dangerous icy/snowy roads for *cars* means at least a month of motorcycle danger.  You will need a rain suit, maybe a seat and handlebar warmers, and warm clothes.

2. There is the Hurt Report, and the MSF and states have stats of accidents.  Non-trained riders are 4 times more likely to have a fatal motorcycle crash.  The biggest culprit for untrained rider accidents is not knowing about counter steering and about friction zones on those tyres.

2.1 Whenever you ride, wear a full face helmet.  Your likelihood to survive triples vs. no helmet, and doubles vs. idiotic head buckets, open face helmets, etc.  Even if you are on a scooter.

2.1.1 [This is not a full face helmet](http://www.benhopson.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/flip-face-helmet-ii.gif) - it's a flip face and the face will flip if you hit it hard enough.  Full face is one piece.

2.2 Appropriate gear that you MUST wear at all times if you're a commuter:  helmet, **leather** jacket, **leather** gloves, ankle-high boots.  Kudos if you wear some form of leg protection.  If you have a rain suit, wear it ON TOP of the leather kit or get one made of abrasion resistant material.  Leather works best, though.  Get a **leather** jacket with vents for summer, but always you and your passenger must wear leather.  No other material has its resistance to abrasion and I rather mess up the cow's skin than my skin with road rash.

3. BMW motorcycles come with ABS - I'm a BMW rider and can attest that ABS saved my life at least once on bad road conditions (wet, gravel).  Harleys are fine if you're into that sort of thing, I guess... but I don't know if they are as well-engineered as a BMW.  The company priorities are different.  BMW bikes are designed to be ridden year-around in Europe, if that's any guide for you.

4. Insurance cost:  expect to pay a LOT right off the bat; divide it by half when you get an MSF course under your belt, then knock another 30% off if you take the advanced rider MSF course (you need to have ridden for 3 years or have 3,000 miles at least under your belt).  The insurance rates also vary by state.

4.1 Some states will automatically give you a motorcycle license upon successful completion of the MSF intro course.  Check MD's laws and go to the MSF site for infos.  Their web site is out of date for some reason so you may want to check with the DMV.  Unlike car driving tests, the motorcycle riding test is very, very, very hard and easy to flunk.  Kill two stones with one bird ( ;) ) and do the course + license if you can.

(On the other hand, do the course then the license test and you're almost guaranteed to pass - extra kudos if you do!)

Good luck, have fun, and keep the rubber side down!

I've also had many discussions with anarchists and read and watched Chomsky's stuff on anarchism.

What got me interested in the subject was that anarchism as presented by Chomsky and many others isn't quite the radical, violent anti-state stuff that I always thought it was. Certain movements within it are, but this definition problem is, well, a problem by definition. That's anarchism, and part of why, as a movement, it is not always effective.

By and large, the *ideal* of anarchists is no government, at least not in it's current form. However, I rarely meet an anarchist or read anarchist material that suggests we do away with all forms of structure. Rather, anarchists promote other kinds of structure and 'management'. It's too simple to say that anarchism promotes 'no government' and equate that with 'no public services' or 'total anarchy'. I would really recommend you read up on what they actually propose, because I found it quite fascinating (whether it's feasible is a whole other story).

So basically, while you are correct that anarchists are against government, most of the actual anarchist stuff I come across seems to simply define certain elements as not being part of 'government' while essentially serving similar purposes. Which makes sense, because only an idiot would think that anomie is in any way good. I don't think Chomsky, even with his lack of political knowledge, could ever support anarchism if it simply promoted a society devoid of any structure.

tl;dr anarchism is so wildly different that it is really easy to pigeonhole and oversimplify it (which I think non-european-libertarians also suffer from). Which is a shame, because there's much in there that I like, and at the very least it gives me a radically different perspective.

Now on libertarianism specifically: from what I gather, the term was originally actually used to refer to the more extreme anarchist types, and the 'American' interpretation (which I admit is what I generally think of on reddit) is more of an exception, rather than the other way around.

It would probably take a few years to develop a useful product and after you have put so much resources to develop it you definitely want to patent it because you want to make up for the invested time and money. Open source is not the way to go when you are developing an actual product (at least in this case). But you could still do it and not act like Monsanto.

I think that the problem you will run into is that certain groups do not want to let you sell the seeds. It may not be big problem in America but in Europe a lot of governments have made very strict laws in regard to planting GM crops due to lobbying from environmentalists.

For example [Golden rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice) is one GM plant that has been given free license for humanitarian use and could actually save lives in certain parts of the world but have been largely not used.

You first stated this:

&gt;Look, when Monsanto puts out a movie that explains their actions in a meaningful and justified way then you can declare Food Inc sensationalist. Until then, the statements and observations in this movie seem spot on and in direct accordance with the literature I have read and other documentaries I have seen on the topic.

You did not put out a photgraph of Monsanto. Where is that photo? How does this photo demonstrate Monsanto polluting the environment.

Let's also talk about pollution and cancer. Please show the link of the pollution being created by Monsanto. Please show that urban pollution is primarily caused by Monsanto rather than automobile traffic. The incidence of lung cancers in urban settings, as far as I know is primarily linked with particualtes, which is primarily from auto emissions.

So which is this a picture of a refinery? or something else? Based on the stacks, it is either a refinery or plastics production process. The steam you see rising is likely from a cooling process and not polluting at all.

The links you provided on Occidental are from Peru, and Columbia, not Niagra Falls.

You also seem to be confusing SO2 from Coal power plants with refineries. SO2 is dipersed temporaly and spatial by the use of tall stacks.

Steam is not a polluting source. Steam is not used to disperse SO2. 

CO2 is simply carbon dioxide. You breathe that out.

Dioxins:

The chemical industry is not an important source of PCDDs/PCDFs according to national emission inventories in European countries such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. Combustion processes are considered to be an important primary source of PCDDs/PCDFs (ref. Wormgoor, Björndal). Most thermal processes which involve burning organic and inorganic compounds containing chlorine atoms e.g. sodium chloride, result in the formation of PCDDs/PCDFs. Of special importance is the incineration of various types of municipal, hospital and hazardous wastes. Production of steel and non-ferrous metals (copper, magnesium, nickel…) are other notable sources.

It is commonly accepted today that formation of dioxin-like compounds in flue gases happens in a temperature range of 200 to 400°C, especially in poor combustion conditions leading to incomplete conversion and the formation of carbon in the fly ashes. Levels of dioxins in flue gases of incinerators depends on the well known 3 T rule:

    * Temperature above 850°C
    * Time (residence) typically 2 seconds
    * Turbulence optimised by furnace geometry and secondary air.

As PCDDs/PCDFs are mainly fixed onto fly ashes, the effectiveness of the dust separation is of paramount importance.

Recently the UK Authorities published a review of dioxin emissions into air (1995). The dominant source was the incineration of municipal solid waste representing 70% of the total industrial sources. Other major emissions, representing 23% of the total industrial emissions were:

. steel mills

. combustion of coal (energy, fuel)

. iron and steel plants

. non-ferrous metals operations

. hospital wastes

Each of these 5 sources as of approximately equal importance. Emissions from the chemical industry are very much smaller than the above sources.

So first explain the connection between Monsanto and your pic, and then explain the connection between the Niagra polutants and whatever chemical plant you photographed, and then explain your apparent lack of knowledge about polution control, sources and finally link the polutants you cite with whatever diseases you claim they cause.

But the housing bubble didn't only make the richest richer. There are plenty of ""normal"" people who flipped real estate at huge leverage, it was so popular they even made a [tv show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_This_House). You can be sure, a third of them left the game early enough to not be harmed by the crash, at least another third stashed their profits where no one can get them and just declared personal bankruptcy - at the cost of the banks. Also ""normal"" people were selling these cheap loans to people that couldn't afford them and got rich in the process.

Even Goldman Sachs (the conspiracy theorist favourite) would probably be better off today, had they sold their toxic stuff earlier, warned people from the crash (nobody listened anyway, there were enough warnings) and bought again at the bottom - but who knows maybe they did sell early and are faking their books to avoid more public scrutiny and to get more bailout ""money"" - should be impossible, but who knows? On GS: I doubt they need a conspiracy, they have the best people and a great company structure. It's no surprise they came out on top and Lehman -the stereotypical 80s coke and hookers bankers- went bankrupt.

Most banks suffered through the bubble, especially if they didn't have much to do with real estate derivatives, so didn't even make money before.

Billionaires net worth rose a lot last year, but it also went down a lot the year before. And don't forget the dollar was really low - €1.50 - when Forbes collected the data for end 2009, so international assets (in India or Europe for example) went up in dollar terms just by the dollar going down.

Overall I doubt many rich people benefited from the crash, most are happy if they today are back where they were in 2006.

It's funny you argue that we were prospering the most in our history at this point and so we have social programs.  How does that work?  The people made so much money they needed help paying for things?  If we were that prosperous at that point we wouldn't need the social programs.  Use your own logic, social programs have been growing since the 1950's and we have been going down hill. 

Also, another funny fact, everyone keeps yelling we spend too much on military!

If you look up the budget for U.S. (2005 last complete graph I found on WIKI) says we spent 18% on military, but 22% on social security alone. If you add up S.S., medicare, education, health plans, and income securities, it comes out to 63% of national spending.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_budget_process#Direct_Spending

I just thought it slightly odd that in a thread directly relating to cultural ignorance, you referred to somebody as ""a European"". This is something that no person living in any country in Europe would do, besides maybe a politician in the midst of extolling the virtues of the EU.

Europe may be mostly landlocked, borders occasionally blur, and ease of travel makes it more likely that people living in European countries can visit others - but there is still a deep sense of national identity in each of the individual countries. When asked where they're from, there is no Brit, German, Spaniard, Italian, Latvian, Russian, Ukrainian, Sicilian, Cypriot, Turk, Scot etc. that I can imagine who would *ever* introduce themselves as ""a European"". Just like a Japanese person would never call themselves ""an Asian"". The adjective is so non-descript and non-specific, given the breadth and range of the continents in question. It doesn't matter how well travelled you are, or how many countries you've lived in. Add to this the fact that most European countries have been at war with one another at some point in the long history of the continent; many would not want to run the risk of being confused for another race.

I just thought it was odd, that's all. I'd never say ""I'm a European"" for fear that somebody would mistake me for a fucking *Frenchman*.

OKi... so about bikes after your edit:

Pick the bike that you like aesthetically and just concern yourself with the following items:

1. Both of your feet must touch the ground comfortably while straddling it.
2. If you're planning on going on freeways, get something with at last 500 cc; the sweet spot for a new rider.  750 cc would be the max I'd recommend for a new rider; think like Spider-Man: with great power comes great responsibility.
3. Keep the plastic to a minimum.  A faring is cool and will help you ride comfortably even at a high speed.  Too much plastic is expensive.  You're going to drop the bike.  It's normal.  Hopefully you'll drop it at low speed.  More plastic == more expense.

You said in your post that you don't care about having tons of power -- fair.  Here is the other side:  power saves lives.  When you take your MSF courses (intro a bit, more details in the advanced one) you'll learn that applying the brakes is the safest thing to do about 90% of the time facing a hazard **if you are in a car**.  On a motorcycle, 50% of the time you want to brake, and about **50% of the time you want to get out of the way as fast as you can**.  So... recap:

* Too much power for a n00b:  bad
* Not enough power for anyone on a bike:  bad
* Not enough power to outrun idiots in cars on the freeway:  bad
* Not enough power if you find yourself going up hill in a place like San Francisco:  bad

Here is another pro tip:  when you ride, regardless of where you are, you will want to ride at ~5 mi/h faster than surrounding traffic (unless you're next to someone grossly speeding; in that case pull over and let them pass).  The +5 mi/h is to make you more visible without freaking out peeps in cars.  Going at the same speed as surrounding traffic == bad; you're not visible in someone's rear view mirror or next to you.

One last thing:  regardless of how much power, experience, mucho macho bike kung f00 you have, **always** be a very polite rider.  If you cut someone off, get away from them as fast as you can after you wave in apology.  Never be a dick (and some times idiots in cars beg that you act like a dick with them).  Even a Smart 4 two has more mass than you + motorcycle, so you will always lose if someone gets pissed and decides to cut you off or bump you in a car/truck/etc.  You, the guy on the bike, have more power, more maneuverability, and better driving skills than the idiot on the car.  You don't have to prove anything.  You **know** you can outrun them or get through nooks, or even park on sidewalks.  You're Mr. Miagi or Yoda.  No need to prove anything.

I found some links to the Hurt report:  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~john/vfr/hurt.html

Feel free to email me if you want more nitty gritty about riding, or let me know if it's OKi to continue posting here.  I feel like some of the replies I give are way too detailed for peeps.  redditmoto AT ciurana.eu

Governments and their armies are made up of people who willfully choose violence of their own free will.  Even drafted soldiers can claim conscientious objector status (although past wars, such as WW2 and prior, this may not have always been available).

I'm unaware of any proof that humanity would give up systematic violence without the presence of governments.  The systems which promote such violence may simply switch from governments to religions (eg Crusades), corporations, unions, etc.

&gt; Early US (say 1700s - 1913) featured a pretty free market economy. Growth was great.

Economic growth is not the only measure of a society and often comes at a price:

* Slavery was legal in the south until 1860.
* [Child labor was legal until 1938.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States)
* Working conditions were often abysmal: railroads, mines, and other industries were often not only dangerous for workers &amp; ecologically devastating, but also often managed to treat workers as indentured servants.

&gt; Or hell, look at Hong Kong vs. China, South Korea vs. North Korea, East vs. West Germany. Freedom always wins.

True, but none of the countries you listed were strictly Libertarian:

* Hong Kong - All land is owned by the government and leased to users.  This helped keep taxes low despite the existence of public works projects and social welfare.  (Having a 0 defense budget helps keep taxes low as well).
* South Korea - A dictatorship until the 1980s with violence and oppression filling the period between independence in 1948 until democracy was finally established in the late 80s.
* West Germany - Benefited from the Marshall Plan and progressive government action.  Very impressive economic growth, but hardly a *libertarian* victory.

&gt; Basically, just start studying basic economics, and you'll come to a political ideology very close to libertarianism.

You're absolutely right: economists love libertarianism.  It's a bit like saying religious fanatics love theocracies.  Essentially libertarianism is the belief that with a very small number of exceptions, free enterprise should be the government (in the sense that free enterprise takes on most roles we currently leave up to the government).  I would expect that to sound appealing to economists!  Humans in general are eager to frame the world in the terms with which they are the most familiar.

&gt; Also, recent data from Europe shows that smaller government correlates very strongly with economic growth

&gt;I'm 28. I was paddled at least 45 times over a few weeks in a public high school.
&gt;
&gt;I accumulated so many after school detentions that, as an added deterrent, the school decided that every further detention would mean one swat with a paddle.
&gt;
&gt;During this time, my feud with some teachers grew so intense that any infraction could result in a week or more of attention in one go. I would sometimes get two or three weeks of detention in one class.
&gt;
&gt;This meant that I had a balance of many, many swats with the paddle. To work off that balance, I was paddled three times each day (the legal maximum). I'm not talking about pussy shots either. I'm talking about full-on, hurts the hell out of a high school kid swats.
&gt;
&gt;That went on for somewhere between a few weeks and a couple of months. I don't remember exactly how long it was, in part because it was pretty traumatic. It eventually quit when I was kicked out of school all together.
&gt;
&gt;It lasted around 3 weeks to 8 weeks, so I was paddled between 45 and 120 times.

--While you think you are all 'British', the Scots, Welsh and others are fully aware there are the 'English' and 'others'.

  of us British, apart from the Scots, who retain their distinctive name, unless they are politicians in London, in which case they are at all times British. Got it?

  There is no dialect, there are many.  No wonder you were confused.

--You treated Di like shit until she was dead, then had a nationwide attack of amnesia.

  Di was such an example.  The people didn't treat her like shit, it was other aristo's.

--For a people so concerned with 'good breeding', you pointedly ignore the several hundred years you've been exporting your best DNA.
  You really don't get aristocracy do you ?  It has nothing to do with ""quality"" of DNA or quality of anything else for that matter. 
  It has everything to do with how long your family have owned their stately pile and how long they have been at court, in this case the royal court.
  But you are quite correct about exporting the best DNA, much of it has gone to your own country.  Even so, even the best DNA can't perform miracles against the rise of
  Chinese DNA.  The US is fucked, just like the rest of the west.

--1066 was actually a defeat.
  Jesus Christ ! Aristocracy again, FFS stop passing comments on something you clearly have not got a clue about.
  1066 was regime change.  The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was replaced by the Norman aristocracy.  Again, to keep it brief, William, Duke of Normandy got a lucky win
  against the Anglo-Saxon king Harold, who had just seen off the Norwegian King Harald, so was feeling a little tired and not at his best.
   
  William declared himself king and owner of everything by right on conquest. Now, to be fair to William, he didn't just think one day that ""me and my posse"" are going to have
  a piece of England, he thought he had a valid claim to the English throne, but he was not the only one, Harald of Norway thought the same.
  This came about because of the way these people were all interrelated through marriages.
  Once again, keeping if brief, if king A wanted to conclude a treaty with king B he would send a daughter to be married to one of king B's sons.
  So if a king died without any obvious heir (ie a son or brother) then the throne could be legitably be taken by anyone with a valid claim.
  Now the previous Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the confessor, had indeed died without an heir, leaving the throne available to anyone who could show they were related.

  That is why the aristocrats have such a thing about producing an heir, and incidentally what Di was all about.  


--The Romans left due to problems elsewhere, not due to one posed by the locals.

Easy, read on. (Oh, and the image that started this debate was not about Monsanto, It was about factory farming, so you might want to keep this whole debate on target.)

&gt;You did not put out a photgraph of Monsanto. Where is that photo? How does this photo demonstrate Monsanto polluting the environment.

It is one of the Occidental Chemical plants that produce chemicals used in factory farming. I already explained this in detail. Check the thread. And this is not about Monsanto, it is about the environmental effect of factory farming and it's relationship to the original photo.  Not my photo.  Monsanto is just one example of factory farming, but is not related to either photo.  Please keep this on target. 

&gt;The links you provided on Occidental are from Peru, and Columbia, not Niagra Falls.

There are 2 links in there about the pollution effects directly addressing Niagara Falls. The other links are directly associated with the company producing said chemicals. The majority of the chemicals being dumped outside the US, originate here.


&gt;CO2 is simply carbon dioxide.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas. In fact, it is the #1 greenhouse gas. 

&gt;The chemical industry is not an important source of PCDDs/PCDFs according to national emission inventories in European countries such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Look up Love Canal. Tell me what the top pollutant in that nightmare is/was. All of it originated in Niagara Falls, from Hooker Chemical (a subsidiary of Oxy before the complete merge). It seems that you are doing some research, so research that. None of those chemicals came from the categories of Dioxin sources you listed. That said, Oxy does not fall into the categories that you posted but is an obvious source, especially from this particular plant.

Like I said, they are a manufacturer of chlorine products for use in meat treatment. Please take note of the the fact that CDDs are the primary byproduct of this type of manufacturing:

Good question. The novel takes place in England, and as we all know, the black plague came to Europe from the Near East and took awhile to reach England. The black plague in the novel existed months before the time traveler is deposited outside a medieval English village. So, the answer is no, a future virus does not create the black plague. The plague is brought to the village by nobles who go there to celebrate Christmas and get away from neighboring areas where people are already sick. The novel contrasts a medieval Christmas, when nobles travel for the holiday and spread disease as they go, with a future Christmas, when the time traveler's university is under quarantine because of a mysterious disease outbreak. IIRC, there is the question of whether the future virus caused the time traveler to arrive at the wrong year in the past. Another question is whether the time travel gizmo let a medieval disease slip from the past into the future.

*Doomsday Book* is a good novel, enjoyable both as medium soft-hard SF and as historical fiction. It's also an unusual combination of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy.

You're seeing a significance that just isn't there.  If I were to say to you that ""you should remember the number 3. It's important!"" -- and then, on March the third, 2013, you win the lottery -- did I predict your good fortune?  Or did I make some generalized, vague statement that just happened to be coincidentally close to something that actually happened to matter later on?  

So is it with the time-unit and the estimated age of the sun.  As to the age of the universe itself -- the actual age of the universe is something like 9\*10^-5 times younger than the Hindji number; whereas the Christian number  is 4\*10^-8 times younger than the real age.

When the guess is more than *three orders of magnitude* off -- it's just plain wrong.

Also -- the reason why you see such a large age assigned is incumbent in the world-view of recursiveness.  They needed a sufficiently huge number as to be incomprehensible.  It's like saying ""A million billion jillion years old!""

&gt; I couldn't find much reading discussing any of this from a secular or skeptical perspective either, hence why I posted it here. Do you have anything?

Any textbook on comparative world religions or anything like that would probably be a good start.  You might also find some googling on kabbalism and the history of numerology in the European tradition interesting given your reaction to the Hindu version. :)

In EU we have seen several examples of undemocratic conduct. The typical pattern is that the Islamists vote the way their Imams tell them to. Thus Muslims don't vote with the same diversity as other groups. They just vote for whatever party that has influence and also are willing to engage in appeasement. Once there are enough Muslims with enough power its bye bye freedom. Rotterdam is a good example of this. Rotterdam has fallen.

AD 2: ""What tells you there is no moderate Muslim?"" - well the fact there there is nothing moderate about Islam. We don't speak of moderate Nazis either do we? Same reason, there is noting moderate about extreme ideologies, that aim at dismantling democracy.

AD 3: That may be true from a theoretical perspective, but as Islam is an evil ideology it also has quite clear rules on apostasy.

AD 4: Not at all, we will not share our tolerance with the intolerant. Also, if you want to live in an EU country because you own Islamic country suck, don't try to make EU Islamic, so that EU will also suck. Its really not that complicated. Freedom is something, that it took a long time to get in EU. Many people fought giving their lives. Last time it was the Nazis, this time its Islam. 

AD 5: Given from your writing and your questions I would say that you are either at multiculturalist or a Muslim. This would indicate that you have no clue about EU and freedom and why we should disallow evil ideologies.   

&gt; I didn't give you any argument for not fearing them because the burden of proof is on you, not on me. 

Not at all, if you want to make the implicit suggestion that EU should allow for Islamification, then you have to explain why that is a good idea. 50 years ago we hardly had any Muslims in EU - why was it smart to change that?

Here's a bit of history about copyright that not many people know:


England used to have a problem with the Stationer's copyright. In the 17th century, Bloody Mary chartered the Stationers' Company to act as a censor for the state. It was a time of a lot of Catholic-Protestant Tension in the country, and was likely used to oppress the speech of the Protestants (Mary was a Catholic). In exchange for acting as censors for the crown, the charter granted any individual who was part of the Stationers' Company an exclusive right to publish a book that he registered *in perpetuity*. Authors were banned from joining the Stationers' Company. In effect, authors were unable to copyright their own books, and the publishers had a never-ending, exclusive right to publish the book.


Fast forward a bit: Bloody Mary dies, is replaced by (Protestant) Elizabeth, the Glorious Revolution comes, the Star Chamber is replaced by Parliament. It's the end of the 17th century. The Stationers' Company keeps pestering Parliament to renew a charter that had, for the better part of the century, granted them some additional powers. Parliament doesn't like them much, and is fed up with listening to them. And so in 1709, when the Stationers' Company is petitioning Parliament *again*, Parliament throws down the gauntlet: the Statute of Anne - the first modern copyright law.


The Statute of Anne makes two important changes. First off, it vests the copyright in the *author* instead of the publisher. Second, it reduces the copyright term from *forever* to 14 years, with a 14-year option to renew at the end of the initial period, if the author is still alive.


Fast forward again: the end of the 18th Century; the fledgling United States. The founders are well aware of the problems of the Stationers' Company and want to avoid perpetual copyright. They also recognize, though, that encouraging artists to create ultimately leaves us all with a better society. That's where the Constitution's copyright clause comes from. Art. 1 § 8: ""The Congress shall have power to . . . promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.""


Congress figures the Statute of Anne strikes the right balance, and so in 1790, we get the first Copyright Act in the United States: it has the same 14-year term as the Statute of Anne, with the same optional 14-year renewal. It makes registration of a copyright a fairly expensive and difficult process, and it applies to maps, books, and navigational charts.


Let's compare that to copyright today, after 200+ years of bloating copyright power:


**Copyright Terms**
&gt;**1790:** 14 years, 14-year optional renewal

&gt;**2010:** Life of the author +70 years


**Copyright Subject Matter**
&gt;**1790:** Maps, books, charts

&gt;**2010:** Virtually any conceivable form of art or creation that requires creativity and isn't covered by trademark or patent law.


**Method for Securing Copyright**
&gt;**1790:** Submit a copy to the local federal district court, submit another copy, within 6 months of publishing, to your secretary of state. The work must bear a notice of copyright, and upon publishing, you must run advertisements in a sufficiently large local newspaper for four consecutive weeks, letting people know you copyrighted your work.

&gt;**2010:** Nothing at all. Copyright is automatically applied to every single piece of copyrightable subject matter as it is created. No notice of copyright is necessary, no filing, no advertising. The only catch is that if you want to sue for damages, you have to register it with the Copyright Office.


Copyright is out of control, and the Supreme Court and Congress are to blame. Consider some of these statements:

&gt;Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution. I invite all of you to work with me to strengthen our copyright laws in all of the ways available to us. As you know, there is also Jack Valenti’s proposal for term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.

*--CA State Rep. Mary Bono, speaking of the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA; named after her husband)*


&gt;The purpose of the bill is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works in foreign nations and the continued economic benefits of a healthy surplus balance of trade in the exploitation of copyrighted works. The bill accomplishes these goals by extending the current U.S. copyright term for an additional 20 years. Such an extension will provide significant trade benefits by substantially harmonizing U.S. copyright law to that of the European Union while ensuring fair compensation for American creators who deserve to benefit fully from the exploitation of their works. **Moreover, by stimulating the creation of new works and providing enhanced economic incentives to preserve existing works, such an extension will enhance the long-term volume, vitality, and accessibility of the public domain.**

*--Senate Report 104-315, explaining the official purpose of the CTEA (emphasis added)*


(N.B. the CTEA extended all copyrights, then existing and future, by 20 years, and is the act that saddled us with the current life + 70 years term.)


...because terms that can easily run 140 years (i.e. guy creates work at 30, lives to 100 - that's 70 years - and then another 70 years) are great for improving the public domain and our shared culture, right? Think about that: if we'd had these 140-year terms all along, right now, *today* we'd be getting public domain works that were created in *1870*. In 1870, there was no electricity, no car, no airplane, no internet, no movies, no recorded music. And yet those works would *just now* be entering the public domain.


But if you think Mary Bono and her ilk are just some wingnut politicians who are in the minority and pose no harm, consider this: the CTEA retroactively added 20 years to all copyrights in existence when it went into effect. This means the rational behind the Copyright Clause didn't apply; those works were already created, and so simply tacking another 20 years onto their copyright duration could not possibly serve to encourage their creation. Furthermore, a retroactive extension of copyright served to set precedent for Congress: they can go back, at any time, and extend old copyrights. That, at least arguably, violates the ""limited time"" provision of the Copyright Clause. And after the CTEA was passed, a group of companies - represented by Lawrence Lessig - sued over just that issue in *Eldred* v. *Ashcroft*, 537 U.S. 186 (2003). And writing for the 7-2 majority, Justice Ginsberg wrote:


&gt;Guided by text, history, and precedent, this Court cannot agree with petitioners that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress' Copyright Clause authority. Although conceding that the CTEA's baseline term of life plus 70 years qualifies as a “limited Tim [e]” as applied to future copyrights, petitioners contend that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not “limited.” In petitioners' view, a time prescription, once set, becomes forever “fixed” or “inalterable.” The word “limited,” however, does not convey a meaning so constricted. At the time of the Framing, “limited” meant what it means today: confined within certain bounds, restrained, or circumscribed. Thus understood, a timespan appropriately “limited” as applied to future copyrights does not automatically cease to be “limited” when applied to existing copyrights. To comprehend the scope of Congress' Copyright Clause power, “a page of history is worth a volume of logic.""

*--Id. at 186-187.*


Or the tl;dr version:


&gt;So long as Congress doesn't extend copyright using specific language like ""forever,"" they're free to extend it as much as they want, so long as they do it for a fixed number of years at a time.


So, anyway, long story short: stop blaming the lawyers. It's stupid and insulting. Blame your politicians for failing to grasp the Constitution and the purpose and function of copyright. Blame your Supreme Court for torturing language to more or less the same ends.


Copyright law, as it's structured, doesn't have any party in the process who stands up for the public.

Democracy exists only when there's peace and prosperity. Democracy does not bring it, nor does it ensure it. Look at history and look for examples - you'd be hard pressed.

My favorite cafe in Prague is called Dobra Trafika, it's in the Vinohrady neighborhood.

If you like partying, you may want to check out Ostrava.  It's a city in the Czech Republic's far east, nearly on the Slovak/Polish borders.  There's a street downtown there called Stodolni street, which has roughly 90 or so pubs/bars/discos/etc.  My favorite might be the Amsterdam Coffeeshop, Medvedev, or Barney's.

Other cities in Czech that are amazing: [Jindrichuv Hradec](http://www.zamky-hrady.cz/3/img/jin_hradec_centr_let.jpg)  Has the third largest castle in the country, behind Prague and Cesky Krumlov, respectively.

[Cesky Krumlov](http://leto.in-pocasi.eu/cesky-krumlov/cesky-krumlov2.jpg) is a gorgeous, quaint little medieval town which has been kept in good shape.  If it looks familiar, you've probably seen it in the film Hostel.  There's a gypsy bar here that is AWESOME.  

Beers to drink: obviously Pilsner Urquell.  Go to the bar and say jeden Plzen, prosim (yeden pullzen, proseem).

Staropramen.  Brewed in Prague.  Fucking delicious.

Radegast.  Harder to find around Prague, as it's brewed in Nosovice, which is closer to Ostrava.  This one is my favorite though.

Gambrinus.  Heaven, in liquid form.

LAST BIT OF ADVICE: You will pay up to 5 times more for food, drinks, anything within the 'old city' area of Prague.  Venture out into the neighborhoods to get food, alcohol, souvenirs, etc.

You have to buy ""One Seat for Named Individual, blah blah blah"".  In this case, the plane ticket was purchased for Kid A to Europe on Date.  Plane tickets are NON-TRANSFERABLE.

You cannot use a ticket that says ""Kid A"" for ""Kid B"" even if they have the same last name and a note from the parents explaining why it's Kid B instead of Kid A.

So, yeah, Kid B could have gotten his own passport.  No reason he couldn't, actually.  He still can, because there is no passport under the name ""Kid B"" with Kid B's information on it.

2) As for the Zionism = racism b.s., Zionism is a response to racism. There wouldnt be an Israel or a need for a jewish country if the jews werent chased there by Europeans who killed 3/4 of european jewish civilians throughout all the european countries for reasons of ethnic hatred/ethnic cleansing.  There was no place better to go pushed by the world at the time.  They didnt select themselves by their ethnicity, they were peaceful members of the societies of their home countries, and THEY were selected by ethnicity for murder.  It's crappy land in many ways - the potential displacement of the jordanian (palestinian) inhabitants being one of them - but it was necessary for survival.  

The palestinian leader before Israels creation, during WW2 (Grand Mufti al-Husayni) allied himself with the nazis, spent much of WW2 in berlin, broadcast nazi propaganda throughout arab countries, and may have been involved in final solution planning:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Amin_al-Husayni.

The palestinians rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and delcared war on Israel the day it was created, and failed to live up to every peace pledge since then.  

Palestinians also have a country called Jordan, which is 70% palestinian but governed by a minority monarchy of Hashemites.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people.  But instead of moving there or anywhere else in the arab world (which covers 25 countries in 14 million square kilometers) and accepting reparations, the PLO and Hamas insist on eternal war at any cost.  

There have been many instances of people losing wars and having to move in world history, without them resorting to decades long campaigns of anti-civilian terror.  I'm not sure how you can read Hamas' charter and then think to yourself ""oh well that probably has nothing to do with Hamas, its only their official charter, Imsure some jews faked it or something.""  You might want to reflect on that.  Saying its your religious duty to kill jews isnt racist?  Please.  

[    some quotes from Hamas charter:  

""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it."" (The Martyr, Imam Hassan al-Banna, of blessed memory).

    ""There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. 
Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time 
and vain endeavors.""

 The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree,  would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Muslim). ] 


Harassing the Israelis with your Zionism = racism b.s. is also something you should reconsider - a vast oversimplification of a very difficult history, in which the palestinian arabs have plenty of responsibility for their plight, as do the israelis for their abuses.  But spreading hateful speech and denying the right of Israel to exist, etc. makes the problem worse because its unfair and typically motivated by hate.

The problem isn't so much that the voice actors are bad, but that quite a few things might very well be *untranslateable*. It's very hard (read: and expensive) to translate any work, especially one containing voice, properly and, most of the time, you'll end up with pretty mediocre translations. This applies to everything from best sellers to top Hollywood flicks. However, because the cultural backgrounds of, e.g., most Europeans and Americans are so similar, you probably wouldn't even notice anything or write off the poorer bits as stupidity of the original author/film director.

This is simply not the case with Japanese cinema or, for that matter, anime. The presentation is completely different (note the long scenery scenes and gaze in the camera in Kurosawa films), the historical and cultural knowledge of the audience is completely different to our own and, last but not least, the non-verbal communication (mimic, gesticulation, etc.) is very different too. The first point might be one of the reasons you like anime, the second why you like fansubs (and most notably supertitles) and the third why most dubs don't work at all.

Some series are very easy to translate, because they aren't all that different in all those aspects except #1, e.g. Black Lagoon, Cowboy Bebop, some of more action-focused GITS episodes. Get a good voice cast and off you go. Now take something like Haruhi Suzumiya (there are better examples, but most of you probably know this one) and you'll either end up with something that is completely different from the original or a series that sounds like it was translated by a five-year-old.

The reason for this is that there are two ways of translating a foreign work (think more along the lines of *translating* the culture rather than words). You can either alienate the reader by tossing them into this unfamiliar world or you can try moving the world from the work into the reader's world before exposing it to him. Most of you already know, but might not have noticed, this. Think of a film taking place any time before or after the 20th/21st century. You will either experience something that is mysterious and foreign or something that is very familiar despite taking place elsewhere. Something very similar happens in translation and is usually a concious choice on translator's part (assuming he has university grade education).

Let's now apply this to the above mentioned anime by taking the character of Mikuru Asahina and focusing solely on her intonation (regardless of the fact that she is a consciously exaggerated character, she is also an archetypical character, which makes her a good example). Mikuru usually speaks in a very high-pitched voice, something not uncommon for certain (Japanese) sales employees aiming to invoke admiration in real life. Alienate the viewer by letting the American/British/whatever voice actress speak with a similar pitch and he will think that somebody must be suffering from down's syndrome. Let Mikuru's voice speak with a normal pitch and you've lost the character. This isn't the sort of problem you'll run into while translating Revi (Black Lagoon), however, without going into too much detail, by evading it you've leapt only over the first barrier and there are many more to come.

There are possible solutions for this and some people, myself included, are very interested in their execution, but, unfortunate or not, they aren't quite as simple as hiring a better cast.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a disconnect in her head about actually caring about the consequences of her actions. She got accepted to a top art school, and we sent her off last year - almost straight F's. And apart from lying to us about her grades (so she wouldn't get in trouble), we just don't feel like she has any shame about fucking up so badly.

So let me get this straight. You have a smart, talented 19 year old daughter who suddenly starts failing almost every class the first time she gets out of the house and has some freedom.

Before that, she probably went to school every day high school, day in and day out getting pretty good grades and was an all around good kid, right?  She's been doing what she's been told pretty much ever since the day she was born.  And now that no one is there to tell her what to do, she's stumbling out the gate.

I propose to you that she doesn't know *why* she is going to college or what she is going to do once she graduates.  She is probably questioning if she really wants the art degree or if it is taking her down the wrong path.  Without knowing for sure what she wants, she isn't putting her best behind it.

This isn't something you can resolve in a singular parental chat of ""What do you want to do with your life.""  It's probably the first time she has started asking herself these types of questions and doesn't even know how to go about thinking about them.  Most high schools don't have classes on philosophy, or career development, or existential dilemmas.

These are the kinds of things that need to be hashed out in long deep nights of conversation with friends, coffee and exploring the world.

This may sound counter-intuitive to reward such lousy performance, but consider letting her backpack around Europe or elsewhere in the world, or if she is interested in donating time on charity work there are plenty of options out there in the world.

Most right wing (and plenty of liberal) critics attack Islam for its misogynist excesses for two reasons.

* They're Muslim and thus ""foreign."" Unlike Christianity, which one is to suppose is the devil we know.
* They can point at that and say ""Look! Women here have it great! So stop complaining!""

Does anyone really believe that the armies of conservative critics, either in Europe or in North America, are feminist lovers of women's agency and freedom? Hardly. Their supposed concern for Muslim women, I find, is just a form of cultural colonialism and deeply insincere. One need only look to the Republican Party's repeated efforts to undermine women's right to choose, or the fact that they voted as a bloc (and, quite literally, to a man) to oppose the Franken anti-Rape Amendment.

I do not feel that Islam is beyond criticism, certainly. But the vituperative Western critics (the vast majority of whom are white and usually male, as well as practising or culturally Christian) are not a little hypocritical on the subject. Some ugly things happen in Muslim communities, but we only know about them because the connection to faith is spun into the report. How many instances of domestic violence do we hear about in the US that are tied to religious ideology? Precious few, not because it is not there, but because it would be 'politically incorrect' to link Christianity to such.

Despite the fact that I've seen many times, in my own family, how a real attitude of ""submission"" has been created by the Catholic faith, we do not get public campaigns against Christianity or referenda on church steeples (indeed, it's taken a shocking amount of rape and abuse by the Holy Church to gin up as much criticism as is now going around; the frocked elephant in the room none in the West can afford to ignore any longer).

Muslims are targeted because they are, by and large, not white and do not worship at an altar built by European culture. Thus the religion seems threatening.

But the solution to the problems that do exist in all monotheistic faiths, systemic as they are, is to integrate them into society- not to ghettoise them- and to give them the nurturing they need to evolve. I've already seen this happen at some Christian churches and it's a sight to behold. Many Muslims want their faith to evolve too, but instead of listening to them, we pay attention only to firebrand westerners who cast Islam as alien and other.

Ayan Hrisi Ali is in many ways an exception, and I respect her for experience that the vast majority of western cultural critics do not have. But she is not the only woman out there with a voice, she's just the one saying things certain white westerners like to hear. She has her reasons, and powerful, harrowing experiences to buttress them. But the claiming of her as the sole voice of dissent strikes me as still more cultural imperialism.

Northern Europeans, who tended toward ancestor worship, people of Hades, always portray Jesus on the cross.  You can also see this integration with holidays.

Pakistan is anything but perfect but not for religious reasons as far as I know. I would like to point out that for a long period of time, it is the countries with a majority of Christians that sucked while the ones that were Arab (and generally Muslim) were way more advanced. See Middle Ages. Also remember that Latin America and big parts of Africa are Christian (the same type the Europeans have) and I think we can argue it would suck to live there.
There are lots of Imam, therefore even if what you say were true, there could be a wide variety of Muslim opinions. See the different sects inside Islam (Shiah and Sunnii for one, more inside of those). Also note that a lot of people that feel a strong appartenance to a minority vote together (Blacks or Hispanics in the U.S. for example). Nothing specific about Muslims. If Muslims were attacked less by the majority, they would probably focus less on Muslim issues and identify themselves more as citizens of their host countries.
2. I already covered that point. The Nazi party and Islam are entirely different. The Nazi party had a head (Hitler) and very specific guidelines to be a Nazi member (agree with the Nazi party program for one). To be a Muslim all you need to do is say ""There is only one God, Allah, and Mohammad is his prophet"", at least according to some. It's pretty broad. I've met several Muslims in my life, from Iran to France to the U.S. and believe me they all believe different things.
3. That you may choose to ignore. Christianity also has rules concerning apostasy...
4. ""We will not share our tolerance with the intolerant"". That's not tolerance you have, or freedom, if it doesn't apply to all. You cannot call yourself moral if you are not moral with everybody. Lead by example. My country (France) probably suffered more than any country but Germany under the Nazis and my grand-parents took part in WWI and WWII, I am aware of the sacrifices. I try to make the EU free and secular. You try to make it intolerant and anti-Islam.

Canine jobs in police and other martial fields, once held by German Shepherds, are now being held by their lesser known neighbor breeds from Belgium and France who were not mutated in the cruel fate of an animal that becomes popular in film.

Maybe they don't go for the squatty look as much, but Euro's don't breed for performance or health any better. Both sides of the Atlantic it's breeding for Neoteny -- they're making cute, functionless, child replacements not dogs. 

For example, if you tried to find a pug anywhere that looked like the breed did a hundred years ago, good luck. Instead it's a genetic miscarriage that can't breath, is plagued with skin and spinal problems but is really kewt. A recent genetic profiling of Pugs in the UK revealed the breed has less genetic diversity than the endangered Panda. There really are no more pugs, they've been replaced by a cartoonish borg clone.

The pugs are just pets and always have been so maybe this result is to be expected. But the attrition has been worse on working breeds who have systematically had all their working qualities replaced with artificial fluff to become hollow, vacant, fashion accessories. 

Just try and find a Malamute with good paws. And that curly tail standard in Siberians and Mals is cute and puppy like, and might be useful for a bird dog to make them visible when flushing birds, but for a running dog it indicates a short spine and bad hip angle that will result in frequent injury and poor running abilities. A traditional Alaskan or Siberian nomad tribesman from which the breed's name originates, wouldn't bat an eye at putting a curly tail dog down. In fact, they would see it as their responsibility. But both Euro and Americans value this artificial standard because it is cute.

For this same reason the Border Collie people fought tooth and nail to keep the AKC from establishing a breed standard. Fortunately, working Border Collies are part of a strong profession and a large population of dedicated breeders and handlers who know that a Kennel club certificate only certifies as a warning label of malignancies. Thus the best collies come without such documents.

We are rapidly losing that what was once known as dog. The animal the Inuit described as the one that jumped across  the divide that formed at creation, between man and animal. The dog, pitying us, jumped across to help us. And for centuries we took good care of dogs and bred excellence and they returned the favor.

But these days, breeders are more like pimps pumping out profits to people who don't know what a dog is or should be and see them only as widgets. This makes it hard for good breeders to make a living or perpetuate good breeding. And to make matters worse, there's this popular misconception that avoiding a breeder and ""adopting"" a dog saves a dog that otherwise would be put down.

While this sounds all good and noble, the converse is true as well -- adopting a dog ensures a well bred dog may not be placed and a knowledgeable breeder and an important line may be lost, not just a wayward pup. The whole shelter system, while well meaning, reinforces human tendency to be shortsighted and impulsive and has played a critical role in the destruction of so many breeds. Animal Shelters justify punters everywhere to pick up a dog as an accessory fully aware that once they get bored with it the can guiltlessly dump it off on some other schmuck. This is sharp contrast to more ""primitive"" traditions that  believe when you die your dogs are waiting for you to decide your fate in the afterlife.

Shelters may help some individual dogs, but the system propagates a culture that values poor breeding over the long hard work our species has put into cultivating great dogs. It undermines a long standing relationship that has not only created some outstanding animals but has improved our lot considerably. 

Without the dog, we'd have never come down from the trees. And this is the thanks they get. In a short time, so much of this has been lost.

I wouldn't touch a German Shep or any breed with a Kennel club certificate. I'd rather a dog with integrity. A working companion. My family has worked for generations with Border Collies, Lurchers and in the last century or so Alaskan Huskies. 

 I detest the short sighted and egotistical mentality of pet rescue. The fact is, the dog is the one who is rescuing you and will do so even if you are unable or unwilling to make the connection. Saying that when you get a dog, you are responsible for it for the rest of it's life (unless you really have to give it to a shelter) is short sighted. I was raised to understand I am responsible to the breed for generations to come in return for all it has done for my species. And this commitment is antithetical to popping out puppies for profit. Instead, it's a commitment to careful breeding where you are not diluting the gene pool with rubbish, but guarding it vigilantly.

Fuck you.

He neither broadcasted propaganda nor was involved in the final solution. What utter rubbish. His relationship with germany (and the rest of the axis powers) makes perfect sense in the context of the war for independence from Britain, and the prevention of the theft of Palestine by European Jews. Palestinians couldn't care less what happened to the Jews in Europe.

&gt;The palestinians rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and declared war on Israel the day it was created, and failed to live up to every peace pledge since then.

Yes, and rightly so. Why don't you mention the terms of the partition? Because it contradicts your argument? More than half the land given to a third of the population who only owned 10% of the mandate. Not to mention half the population the new Jewish state would be Arab, who would become subservient to the other half that have come onto their land from afar. No self-respecting human being would agree to such rubbish.

&gt;Palestinians also have a country called Jordan, which is 70% palestinian but governed by a minority monarchy of Hashemites. 

Except they don't and it is not their country. It is 70% because most of those have been expelled from their homes in palestine. The fact that you can't tell the difference between Jordanians and palestinians only speaks to your racist mind,

Maybe because....(GASP) it's their homeland? It seems you're having a hard time comprehending what it means to lose the land of your forefathers. But yea, if those pesky Palestinians would just forget about their expulsion and move on!

&gt;And while I do not (yet) think the Pope is in any way guilty, I am frustrated and confounded by his inability to properly handle the situation. 

i'm not sure what you mean by ""guilty,"" but i have yet to see any evidence that he did any molesting himself. there is, however, credible evidence pointing to his likely role in abating the church trial of fr. murphy, who admitted to molesting children, and is estimated to having abused as many at 200 deaf boys.  this evidence, produced by the church in a lawsuit, has been posted online by the new york times. the following documents show that then cardinal ratzinger, as head of the cdf, most likely had a role in abating the trial of fr. murphy:


*  [direct appeal to cardinal ratzinger by molesting priest citing 30 day statute of limitations and requesting the trial be halted.](http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p54)

*  [letter from ratzinger's personal secretary citing the letter from the molester, the thirty day statute of limitations, and suggesting ""pastoral measures.""](http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p57)

*  [notes from bishop richard sklba, who attended the meeting in rome with the cdf: ""It became clear that the Congregation was not encouraging us to proceed . . . ](http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p61)

*  [the meeting minutes from the meeting in rome note ""the danger of big scandal,"" that there ""are not enough elements to instruct a canonical trial,""  and the secretary pointed out ""some problems it introduces.""  the meeting ended with a discussion of pastoral measures to be applied, that murphy ""must give clear signs of repentance, **otherwise** he must be applied to a trial,"" and that weakland ""reaffirmed the difficulty he will have explaining this to the community of the deaf.""](http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p72)

*  four days after getting the translation of the meeting minutes, [weakland wrote to the cdf, stating ""after i returned home from the ad limina visit, i met with my advisors and put together a pastoral plan. . ."" and that he ""instructed my Judicial Vicar to formally abate the judicial process that had begun against Father Murphy.""](http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p75)

the only way for cardinal ratzinger to not have had a role is for him not to have been in control of the department he was the head of.

although i haven't been following it very closely, [it appears that cardinal ratzinger also presided over a meeting in which a child molesting priest in need of ""psychiatric treatment""and ""room and board"" had his ""request granted,"" and cardinal ratzinger was copied on a memo five days later returning that same priest to ""full duties.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/world/europe/26church.html?pagewanted=2)",True,t1_c0nhc6z,False,Atheist,t5_2qh6c,scarlet,c0nhc6z

Pretty much, yes.  I don't post what I post because it's part of a propaganda campaign, because if it were it would be the most obvious propaganda campaign *ever*.  I post what I post because I honestly believe it.

&gt;But aside from all that, I'm not sure if the anti-Israel down-voters are just deluded kids with a cause, or if they're actively working for the terrorists in some capacity. My guess is it's a little of both.

My honest opinion is that it's probably mostly the former.  Ocin is a UK Islamist and Sailer a non-Middle-Eastern Muslim of some sort, but, to current knowledge, that's the closest the Reddit Anti-Israel Brigade gets to actually being a part of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

Me?  I'm a Jew and a Zionist who has spent (short, due to having to complete university on time) time living in Israel.  I plan to return permanently once I have my degree and my life sorted out wrt to family and long-term girlfriend.  To me, Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinian Arabs are real people who all bear a level of responsibility for the current situation.  To me, it's way more subtle and gray than people on the anti-Israel circlejerk or the Zionist counter-circlejerk believe.  I'm not neutral, but I think I know what I'm talking about pretty accurately.

&gt;To have the maximum positive effect, you may want to make an effort to 'come off' as the most calm and rational person here, while still making your point. This issue is not about facts, so just presenting those without an effective emotional appeal is a waste of time. Be the rational person, and you'll automatically have points against the haters.

You are, of course, correct, but it's extremely difficult to come across as calm, rational, ethical, and humane in a discourse where the local circlejerk has effectively redefined the terms required to make my point to mean not only things that they don't mean but things that trigger an immediate and highly negative emotional response.

It honestly is beyond me to find a way to say to people that Israel really just wants to be a normal country when, to them, the very name ""Israel"" means a colonialist apartheid state built by exclusively European settlers on land belonging to Middle-Eastern people with no justification but invented religious doctrines and delusions of racial superiority.  I don't know how to talk about this situation when terms like ""Zionism"" and ""Jewish self-determination"" have come to mean an ideology that uses the invented fiction of a unified Jewish nation, rather than the nationally disparate religious community believed to actually exist,  to steal land, aiming at regional or world domination.  It's tough to avoid getting emotional when genuine Judeophobia has reemerged, shielding itself in the ""anti-Zionist"" mantle, and when the acceptable discourse of supposedly non-Judeophobic ""anti-Zionism"" has come to include notions that ""these Jews"" control a Gentile-majority nation using banking, media manipulation, and illicit lobbying/connections in government to leech benefits for the imagined ""Zionist"" cause.

The entire language once used for talking about Jews, Jewish doings, the Jewish world, Jewish affairs, and *especially* the Israeli-Arab conflict has been redefined, in a truly Orwellian way, so as to render Zionist opinions inexpressible without the appearance of inhuman malignity.

Of course, the fact that certain anti-Israel users appear to operate voting bots doesn't help either.  The votes on a story in /r/politics or /r/worldnews will behave normally, with people on all sides getting a few up or down votes each, until they show up.  Then, suddenly, everything anti-Israel gets +7 and everything pro-Israel - or simply unapologetically pro-Jewish in any way that doesn't explicitly renounce Zionism - gets -8 or so.  After that, the votes continue to follow that pattern since many of the people who might have agreed with points of view like mine simply never get to read the posts, and thus can't upvote them back to normal levels, while the people who have anti-Israel views find them for upvoting quite conveniently.",True,t1_c0nhmei,True,,t5_2cneq,,c0nhmei

[Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization: A Message from the Drug Enforcement Administration](http://www.justice.gov/dea/demand/speakout/index.html)

----------------------------------

""Fact"" 1: We have made significant progress in fighting drug use and drug trafficking in America. Now is not the time to abandon our efforts.

[""The cost of heroin at the retail level declined from an average estimated $1,974.49 per gram in 1981 to $361.95 per gram in 2003.  The average purity of heroin on the US market increased in that time as well, going at the retail level from an average of 11% in 1981 to an average 32% in 2003""](http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/price_purity07.pdf)

[For 2008, an estimated 117,325,000 Americans aged 12 or over (47% of the US population aged 12 and over) report having used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k8nsduh/2k8Results.pdf)

[From 1975-2008, between 83 and 90% of 12-graders have reported that marijuana is ""fairly easy"" or ""very easy to get""](http://monitoringthefuture.org/data/08data/pr08t13.pdf)

------------

""Fact"" 2: A balanced approach of prevention, enforcement, and treatment is the key in the fight against drugs.

[Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption) despite an approach lacking prevention and enforcement.

--------------

""Fact"" 3: Illegal drugs are illegal because they are harmful.

[DEA Administrative Law Judge, Francis Young: ""Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.""](http://www.iowamedicalmarijuana.org/pdfs/young.pdf)

---------

""Fact"" 4: Smoked marijuana is not scientifically approved medicine. Marinol, the legal version of medical marijuana, is approved by science.

[Medical and scientific organizations based in the United States that support access to therapeutic cannabis include: the American Academy of Family Physicians (1989, 1995); American Academy of HIV Medicine (2003); American College of Physicians (2008); American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs (2001); American Medical Students Association (1993); American Nurses Association (2003); American Preventive Medical Association (1997); American Public Health Association (1995); Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (1999); Federation of American Scientists (1994); HIV Medicine Association (2006); Institute of Medicine (1982 &amp; 1999); Kaiser Permanete (1997); Lymphoma Foundation of America (1997); National Association for Public Health Policy (1998); National Nurses Society on Addictions (1995); and Physicians Association for AIDS Care.](http://www.medicalcannabis.com/PDF/Grouplist.pdf)

-------------

""Fact"" 5: Drug control spending is a minor portion of the U.S. budget. Compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction, government spending on drug control is minimal.

[A 1998 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) estimated the economic costs of illegal drug abuse in the United States to be $97.66 billion in 1992. Sixty percent (60%) of drug costs were due to drug-related law enforcement, incarceration and crime. Only 3% of drug costs were borne by victims of drug-related crime.](http://www.nida.nih.gov/economiccosts/index.html)

--------

""Fact"" 6: Legalization of drugs will lead to increased use and increased levels of addiction. Legalization has been tried before, and failed miserably.

[The Portuguese government in 2001 decriminalized the use and possession of illicit street drugs.  Five years later, the number of deaths from street drug overdoses dropped from around 400 to 290 annually, and the number of new HIV cases caused by using dirty needles to inject heroin, cocaine and other illegal substances plummeted from nearly 1,400 in 2000 to about 400 in 2006.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization)

--------------

""Fact"" 7: Crime, violence, and drug use go hand-in-hand.

[55% of Americans drink alcohol at least monthly](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k8nsduh/2k8Results.cfm)

[In addition to the 54% who drink coffee everyday, 25% of Americans drink coffee occasionally.](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/market/usa.htm)

[Frequently, drug-related violent crimes, such as homicides and assaults, are linked to drug marketing activities (e.g., disputes among rival distributors or between buyers and sellers of drugs). For example, of the 347 drug-related homicides reported in New York City in 1984, 67 percent were in drug locations and were generally in areas where drugs were sold](http://www.nida.nih.gov/economiccosts/Chapter6.html)

(The absence of a criminal element at your local Starbucks requires no citation, eh?)

--------

""Fact"" 8: Alcohol has caused significant health, social, and crime problems in this country, and legalized drugs would only make the situation worse.

[Alcohol prohibition didn't work either.  By 1925, in New York City alone, there were anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasy clubs.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States)

-------------

""Fact"" 9: Europe’s more liberal drug policies are not the right model for America.

[American students are much more likely to have used any illicit drug other than cannabis (23% vs. 6%). For example, 6% of US students have used ecstasy at least once in their lives vs. 1% in Europe.](http://www.unodc.org/youthnet/en/youthnet_youth_drugs_trends_drug_trends_eur_us.html)

-------------

""Fact"" 10: Most non-violent drug users get treatment, not jail time.

This one is actually almost true, as far as jail time goes.  Of course, the [1,300,000+ arrested every year in the US for drug possession](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/arrests/index.html) get a lot more than mandatory ""treatment"" -- they also receive permanent criminal records.

The Senate is directly elected instead of being elected by the House. There are term limits for the President. People besides white male landowners can vote. And much of that was still within the time of the founders. So while they might not have wanted a (direct) democracy, We the People of the early 1800s demanded a move closer to one.

You have to remember who The Economist is written for. (Classically) Liberal as it can be at times, it has very mixed views on issues regarding women.

To be honest:

&gt;IF YOU are a youngish man who sits on a European corporate board, you should worry: the chances are that your chairman wants to give your seat to a woman.

This is precisely the sort of scaremongering that had me rolling my eyes from the word 'go' in this article.

There are also a few other matters to consider:

&gt;According to a study by the University of Michigan, Norwegian firms have lost lots of boardroom experience: the new, younger women directors have spent less time running companies on average, are less likely to sit on other boards and are more likely to come from middle management.

This will be part of the growth process. The suggestion that these women are *incompetent*, however, is one that is not borne out by the actual reported experience of many Norwegian businesspeople. Of course women en masse will be less likely to have umpteen decades of combined experience. That's part of the whole problem they're trying to address with this system. If you keep waiting (as the Economist suggests at the end) for it to happen ""naturally"", you'll be waiting forever.

Remember, the sexual revolution was in the 60s and early 70s. If it wasn't happening now, it was never going to happen, unless something came in and broke the resistance.

What the Economist is advocating at the end is what has been tried for the last 40 years: ""Let women [and ostensibly minorities] toil away in lower management and then appeal to the Old Boys Club for promotions they'll never get.""

The quotas represent an acknowledgement that the culture is not going to change on its own.

Towards the end:

&gt;Some do so by choice, but others fear they will not get ahead in more chauvinist parts of a business.

Precisely. How does one undo that chauvinism? Ensuring close to 50% of the bosses are women does do a rather good deal for that. At any rate, grooming a *large* new generation of female executives will pay off great dividends in the end, I feel. This process will provide a wealth of new role models who will, in time, have accrued a good deal of experience.

Ok. So it's alternate reality where something akin to scientology is followed secretly by government elect, who are all celebrities voted in because of voter stupidity (In the lines of Schwarznegger). The story starts out with the public stupidly happy, but with growing signs of oppression; cover ups, political assassinations, etc. The protagonist is a journalist who is trying to expose the cult behind the government, probably from a society that has already collapsed, and can see the signs here. Let's say an educated asylum seeker from Israel.

One day, he comes home to find his home under armed fed arrest. He is confronted, but manages to run away. His family is captured however. He then falls in with mercenaries, as they pick him up when he's lost in a shady area. They confirm some of his suspicions: the government is using mind control chemicals to keep the populace sedated and happy, and that there's something darker behind scenes. He also learns the identity of who ordered his family's arrest.

Goes to where his family are held, which is a giant government citadel thing, witnesses fatal experimentation on his family (turns out to be psychic, but he only finds this out later.) On a revenge trip he destroys a psychic reactor with some of the mercenary's gear.

The reactor starts melt down, and he escapes in a thrilling underground bullet train after some absolutely crazy fighting. Then you've got the psychic fall out (like that bridge sequence in WitB), and it turns out that the reactor actually was the main suppressant for the populace. Naturally with it gone, all hell starts to break loose. There's no organised rebellion, just anarchy.

Making his way through the street gangs, the protagonist learns that the heads also survived the blast, and boards their air convoy, which is heading north. At the arctic, there is a large facility overseen by a contemplative AI. Helping a prisoner there escape, he learns about the psychic projects of the government, and how this is linked with their cult.

Something big comes up, and the entire facility arranges itself into a psychic amplifier. The culmination of the government's work is approaching. And the twist? It turns out the government were vying desperately to amass enough psychic potential in order to save the species from some kind of warp death (predicted by the AI), which is bearing down that very night. This is revealed just as the protagonist has the device sabotaged and the antagonist at gunpoint.

The warp starts, and the protagonist's latent psychic powers are awakened, and the extracted power from millions of sacrificed psychics manifests itself onto him, turning him into something god-like.

This blessing of power also becomes his curse, as he is left immortal as the world perishes.

* Building planes (see [Cargo Cults](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cults))  

Of course, you could twist some of this, or find obscure counter-examples, but it really has had no major accomplishments on the level that science has.  Indeed, for contrast, let's recall a few of the things science has done:

* Extended human life expectancy by decades  
* Eradicated smallpox (Smallpox was responsible for 300,000,000 human deaths)
* Found the cause of the Bubonic Plague and stopped it (The Bubonic Plague wiped out 1/3 of Europe's population, causing massive strife and suffering)
* Explained the motion of the cosmos so accurately that we now routinely fly crafts to other worlds.  
* Explained the reasons for earthquakes, volcanoes, lightening, eclipses, and other things that used to frighten humans.
* Given us worldwide communication devices, the ability to travel the globe in days rather than years, and near instantaneous access to nearly all human knowledge.

I could go on (indeed, it was kind of fun), but I think I've made my point.  To be fair, I suppose I should yield a bit.  Religion does have some minor accomplishments.  Buddhism, for example, seems to have some interesting things to say about human consciousness, and I suppose Christianity has inspired some charity (although I think its net effect has been quite negative, even if we only count very recent history).  Of course, science has done some terrible things, but the point I'm trying to make is that science gets things done.  It moves us forward, and has made so many contributions to human well-being that we cannot image what live would be without its impact.",True,t1_c0ni264,False,,t5_2qh17,,c0ni264

&gt; The assumption you're making, that most or all of the people at the tops of these organisations are talented and competent and being asked to hang their hats to make room for incompetent women is largely false.

In my question about those losing their jobs, I'm really not making any estimation about the competence of their female replacements - in no way do I think that they'll definitely be incompetent, or be any *kind* of incompetent.

I was making the general assumption that the men who's hats are being hung are probably generally competent, but insofar as I think that European nations have more competent executives (I mostly know about Germany - I have dual citizenship with it, and half of my family lives there)  

Compared to Europe, I see the American elite as a bunch of greedy morons who are paid astronomically high wages - they deserve no sympathy.  Honestly if they were all replaced with a sample of American citizens selected completely at *random,* we could easily be better off than we are now.  

European executives are nowhere near as fat and greedy as in the US, because their gov't legislates so many other parts of the socioeconomic climate (which I support - I subscribe to democratic-socialism).

Read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism At least the first paragraph. Now, note the principle of non-agression on which anything that has prefix ""Anarcho-"" is based. Here it is, as stated by Murray Rothbard, directly from wiki.

""I define anarchist society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual. Anarchists oppose the State because it has its very being in such aggression, namely, the expropriation of private property through taxation, the coercive exclusion of other providers of defense service from its territory, and all of the other depredations and coercions that are built upon these twin foci of invasions of individual rights."" 

Ok. Now, did you catch the part about ""legal possibility of coercive aggression""? Good. 

Let's look at Somalia. It is a collection of constantly warring petty warlords who use their power to levy ""taxes"" (or rather protection money) on the people who work the land they control. They also rob steal and pillage for personal enrichment and rule ""their"" people in a totalitarian manner. Some scholars call this system warlordism but it is essentially feudalism minus the hereditary inheritance. Also, large portion of the country is controlled by Islamic Courts Union who use this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia as the legal basis for their state and power. Now, neither Feudalism nor Sharia law share the basic principle of all things ""Anarcho"", non-agression. Moreover neither of the two systems provides for ""free exchange of goods and services"" nor for ""personal freedom"". 

There is very little similar between Somalia and Libertarianism/Anarchism/Anarcho-capitalism/etc. Do not confuse the absence of centralized government or ""state"" with a stateless society. And moreover, since Somalia does not exist as a ""nation-state"" in the modern context, do not assume this means the absence of government (government = ruling authority). Somalia is like Europe in the dark ages. There may not be a state but there are many little mini-tyrants ruling a few villages here and there. There is no judicial code or social contract and whoever has the most power does what he may. 

This has absolutely nothing to do with Anarchist society which, although rejecting the state, does invite order, cooperation and above all NON-FUCKING-AGRESSION.

The Good:

1. One of the best economies in the world, innovation and technology in every sector. Jobs are plentiful, given the right credentials.

2. Great foods, there are bakeries and butchers at every corner, food is not as processed. Beer! Also the lowest grocery prices in Europe. 

3. A political discourse that allows all opinions to be heard, a lot of political diversity. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press is granted. 

4. Education still one of the world's best, health care for all, (almost) free university education, modern and clean cities, vast public transportation system, no speed limit on the Autobahn. 

5. Culturally and historically rich, great diversity of beautiful landscapes, the Alps, the North Sea, castles, historic town centers etc.


The Bad:

1. Heritage is a big factor for success, your roots are important. German is hard to learn, and it's hard to get integrated into society without speaking it. 

2. Big government, resulting in a lot of bureaucracy

3. Big division between the social classes, a consequence of pupils in 5th grade getting split into three different forms of high school, by intelligence and educational prognosis. This has its pros and cons, I tend to support it actually. 

4. Big sense of entitlement, unemployed workers demanding more social benefits paid for by high taxes on income and sales. Top earners pay up to 60% of their salary to the state.

Q: Can I undo attribute points already allocated?
A: With great power comes great responsibility. The Twelve have deemed you unworthy of that responsibility (at this time).

Battle
Q: I’ve arrived in Limsa Lominsa and watched the event scene with Baderon, the potty-mouthed proprietor of the Drowning Wench. What do I do next?
A: Access your Journal from the main menu. Select Class Quests to view a log of all that has transpired, as well as what lies immediately ahead on your path to adventure.

Q: My weapon is drawn, why isn’t that plague rat DEAD!?
A: Just as Van Ghoh could have never painted a single sunflower without clicking the Paint button in his action menu, an adventurer cannot thrust, swing, or throw her weapon until the corresponding button is clicked.

Q: Do blacksmiths and miners have any battle options other than throwing stones?
A: Not during the Alpha/Beta tests. Though perhaps through prayer will the Twelve one day grant the Disciples of the Land and the Hand with new ways to fell Eorzea’s nasty beasties.

Items
Q: Why can’t I fight barehanded?
A: Because the Twelve do not wish it. Eorzean adventurers must have a weapon or tool equipped at all times.

Q: Where can I learn synthesis recipes? I tried copying the recipes introduced in certain levequests, but was told I do not have the crystal required for starting the synthesis.
A: Synthesis recipes are as elusive as the answers to questions such as the meaning of life and our purpose here on Hydaelyn. They must be sought for, and only the diligent shall be rewarded.

While normal synthesis requires the correct combination of crystal type and amount, levequest synthesis is often simplified, with the quest clients providing adventurers with crystals, thus their absence from the levequest recipes.

Q: How do I obtain crystals?
A: Crystalline manifestations of the planet’s aether are rare, but under special circumstances will form within the bodies of certain creatures. It is up to you to get those crystals out...

Other
Q: Where can I synthesize items?
A: If your current class is one of the Disciples of the Hand, you can perform synthesis anywhere your heart desires.

Q: Where can I mine/quarry?
A: All miners have the ability to uncover the rough locations of mining and quarry points via their Prospect and Lithoscan abilities.

Q: I’ve found a Quarry Point, but I can’t quarry!
A: Ah, but do you have a knapping hammer equipped as a secondary arm?

Q: I cannot synthesize with my secondary tool!
A: Ah, but do you have a file equipped as a secondary arm?

Q: I’ve fallen into a rift in the planet’s surface and cannot escape! Whatever should I do?
A: The Land is a treacherous place, littered hither and yon with crevices, chasms, and bottomless pits, all waiting to consume the unsuspecting passerby. If you find yourself stuck in one of these not-so-proverbial ruts, simply open up your main menu and select Return to warp back to your home point.

The opening date for the FINAL FANTASY XIV Alpha Test phase will be Thursday, April 8th, 2010.

Login Limitations
The number of characters capable of logging in simultaneously will be somewhat limited during beginning of the Alpha Test. This will gradually be　increased over time as server load balancing adjustments are made. However, should a tester receive the message, “The server is experiencing unusually heavy traffic. Please try again later,” we ask that they immediately log in once more. Doing so will put them on a waiting list which will grant them access to the servers in the order in which they logged in. Please note, testers must re-log in within 3 minutes of receiving the aforementioned message to secure their place on the waiting list.

Providing Feedback
As indicated above, the first part of the Alpha Test phase will cover the game’s battle system, basic controls, and user interface. Your feedback on any and all of these aspects of the game is both highly encouraged and greatly appreciated. While playing, please feel free to submit your opinions on anything at all regarding these topics, such as game balance issues, settings that you may have found difficult to understand, and features that you felt were inconvenient, unintuitive, or required further explanation.

Feedback threads are organized by topic. Please be sure to post your feedback in the appropriate thread.

– Opinions on and suggestions for the battle system: First Alpha Test Feedback (Battle System)
– Opinions on and suggestions for basic controls and the user interface (UI): First Alpha Test Feedback (Basic Controls)

* The first feedback submission period will begin with the launch of the first Alpha Test and last until just before the launch of the second Alpha Test. Posts to threads cannot be made once the relevant period has ended.

Replies will not be made to bug reports posted in this thread. Please submit bug reports here. Bug reports may continue to be submitted even after the first Alpha Test phase has ended.

In practice, however, Britain just cannot manage it. The last 10 years has shown massive bureaucracy, investment into a ""nanny state"" etc. Conservatives will reduce this for the time being - until power is decentralized I would rather we were left to our own devices in terms of monetary management.  
  
For example, I believe in a heavily reinforced benefits system, but in practice, Labour has funneled money into a system that is easily abused, and while it give people the chance to ""start at the same level as everyone else"" etc, the system does not encourage people to use this opportunity.  
  
Ultimately, however, I *would* vote labour if all other parties ended this plan: [Moving all services online (timesonline)](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7069240.ece)
  
The reason for this is that ultimately this is what will result in power distribution to citizens. (This opens up the possibility for low cost decision making with referendums). So really it is the most important. (one of the few things in UK politics that I am pretty optimistic about)

Interestingly, the Miliband brothers (in particular Ed Miliband) are the UK politicians which I respect the most - they seem to share the desire to move power back to the people and are championing the idea(source: [Us now](http://vodo.net/usnow))&lt;-- I recommend this to everyone  
  
So I would vote for Labour if:  
- David Miliband was standing for PM  
- Conservatives outright declared that the plan was going to be scrapped  
  
To be completely honest I don't have much trust in my own opinions, as I am not very educated in these regards. I am completely disillusioned with current UK politics though. I see my vote as fairly redundant - party policies are fairly similar in the grand scale of things.

Thoughts? I would be interested to see whether people are in complete disagreement with me.

I mean, I wanted to get into contemporary arts since I was about 14 (1993ish); stuff like Visual effects for film, or Model-building for film studios, Visual effects animation - But then learned that Game-development was a really viable and emergent art-form, with huge scope for not only similar work as Visual effects..etc, but also interactivity. To get into art-productin relatively soon after that particular artform had really taken off, was very appealing to me. 

The High demand for jobs, I think, is symptomatic of video-games' position in accessible entertainment-forms. Everyone still loves to perceive games as a lesser artform, and toyish - without giving them what I believe to be 'appropriate respect'. 

Most applicants, I'd guess, believe that because it's 'only games', that their artwork is good enough. and so the Statistical demand is very high; whereas I'd guess out of the applicants for one post, 15% are worth considering, and 85% are probably ""what-the-hell"" applications.
(and the one person that ultimately gets the job, heard about it from a current employee, and has had their internal recommendation)

The casual application would simply not get work at a AAA-game studio, on the basis that noone in western companies can hire anyone less than acreative contributer. The polygon monkey has no place in european, american, and Aus/NZ companies any longer, on the basis that the small stuff gets outsourced for little cost.

Quality will ALWAYS be recognised - that's a promise; and that's the only way to get attention by sending CVs out. As an applicant, you simply have to make sure that all the information is there, for the company to see, and that you're greasing the wheels as much as you can; because the wheels can turn slowly anyway. 

What is ""quality""? I'd say ""quality"" is stuff that is visually unique, largely free of Cliché and derivation, and 'correct' where appropriate (I could go into 'correct' further if you wish?). 

Quality always should adhere to technical requirements, too - Mesh budgets/Texture budgets/shader budgets. Technically-informed artwork that is also beautiful gets recognition straight away. 

I'd say, even if you apply as a 0-year's experience trainee/junior, you have to have a low wage expectation, and a folio that will tell your interviewer that you are AT LEAST capable of Senior-artist-level work.

Some companies will give measured tests to applicants, to gauge ability.

Anyone hiring for a games-dev position, has to be aware that a lot of proprietary tools/software has to be learned quickly. 

Would I dissuade people from attempting getting into the industry? That's a really excellent question - 

There are occasionally moments... :)

The only grounds where I'd dissuade someone from making a ""from-scratch"" effort, would be if it was a quick decision, because they think making games is a pushover. 

Games as an artform are just as much a product of their time in terms of technology, politics, world-events, trends/fashions, and cost.  And i genuinely believe that they (in some cases) have the capacity to be remembered as ""High-art"".

In terms of artwork, and time spent, it's some of the hardest artwork I think one can do. The ongoing demand for rich environments, and the escalating expectations of game-art, means that way more has to be done per in-game unit of area.

I absolutely would not dissuade anyone who's dream it was to work in the games industry. BUT I would **absolutely** make sure that they were aware of the significance of the work, and ultimately of their individual responsibility to art history; everyone in a dev-team should be able to contribute.

That's where my passion is, in games...
To not treat my projects as ""only a game"", and cut corners because the project is simply not deserving of the effort. 

Does it make me a better artist.. lol, probably not - 
but i try to inspire similar sentiments in my team...!


Hopefully there's something in there that works as an answer :P lol

Nope. But I know it's fun for you to make things up. The Christians themselves only took the majority of their ideas from previous Greek stoic philosophers. What Jesus taught himself was not good enough to sustain a religion on, he wanted you to give away everything you have abandon your family and follow him as the world was about to end. Christianity here is far more of a cult than an organised religion. Later Christian writers, starting with Paul really, were forced to write about how Christians should lead their daily lives as they realised that the stuff Jesus said about the world ending evidently wasn't going to be happening any time soon. Hence why much of modern Christianity is far more Paulism than anything else.

&gt;Considering that Christianity is about loving your neighbor, this just shows that people will use any belief to justify anything.

I suppose you ignored all the passages justifying homophobia, killing your enemies, telling women to be silent and blaming them for all sin, saying that rape victims should be stoned to death, saying we were created out of dust, saying we were created in 6 days, saying 'lust' is equal to rape/adultery and 'hate' is equal to murder, saying that we'll all burn in hell if we don't follow god, saying god will strike down enemies with fire, plague and torture, saying we should kill disobedient children. The 'love your neighbour' parts are miniscule compared to the hate, bigotry and violence within the text. 

If you honestly can't see how people could easily justify horrendous acts by believing in the bible you're blind. Of course history is clearly on my side as well, your religion was NOT spread by 'loving your neighbour' it was spread by incredibly amounts violence. Christianity was lucky enough to become Romes state religion and then throughout the the multiple centuries afterwards was forced upon Europe, the Middle East and eventually the New World through murder and fear. 

&gt;Morally disgusting based on what?

Based on modern ethical values and philosophy as opposed to iron age ethical values and philosophy. Have you checked out the American constituition? Or the bill rights countries have? It guarantees EVERY citizen human rights and equality no matter what the sex, race, religion or sexual preference of that individual. 

&gt;What are secular values?
Removing the church from the state allows a government to be run free from religious oppression and allows all the citizens to have full religious freedom. America is BASED on these values. 

Try reading about the entire period of enlightenment to see how we only became civilised when we reduced the huge power religion had over the populace and seperated it from the state itself.

**Frenquently Asked Questions (Updated)**

If you have a question of your own please [ask us](http://www.posterburner.com/ContactUs.aspx) and we will reply promptly and add your question to our FAQ.

**Does my image have to be high-res to make a suitable poster?**

Moderately high-res images (anything above 72ppi with a resolution around 1000px x 1000px) make the best posters, but smaller images work well too. We use bicubic re-sampling and custom filters to get the clearest possible picture. Plus we review the quality of each file and will contact you before printing if the resolution is not high enough.

If you order and don't like the quality of the final print we will give you a free replacement print or refund the entire purchase no questions asked.

**What is the maximum size you can print?**

We are now offering extra-large sizes! We can print posters at any size up to 60"" by 1200"" (that's 5 foot by 50 feet!)  Metric: 152.4cm x 1524cm (1.5m x 15.5m)

**Do you offer international shipping? If so, what are the options?**

Yes we will ship anywhere in the world. We have added over 40 countries to our supported shipping list. Shipping to Canada is $4.99 and worldwide is $9.99. If you would like to order and your country is not in the list send us an email. We will help you place your order immediately and add your country to our shipping system for future customers.

**If I order today, when can I expect arrival?**

Our average delivery time within the US is 3 business days. The average delivery time to Canada is 6 business days.  To Europe, Australia, and the rest of our supported countries the estimated delivery time is 6-10 days.  Rush delivery is available.

**Where is my poster shipping from?**

We are based in Chesapeake, Virginia USA.

**What is your maximum DPI resolution?**

2880 x 1440 dpi. This is the listed specification from the manufacturer of the printer and has to do with variable droplet sizes on the print nozzle.

**What is the difference between RGB and CMYK? Which one do you use when printing?**

Most images and graphics found on the web are in RGB format and all printing is done in CMYK color. If your image is RGB we will set up the pixel depth and overall resolution to so it amounts to a certain ratio of the selected dpi (ppi is usually half to 3/4 of the dpi) so it accurately reflects the color saturation and intensity of sRGB. There is no quality loss or color degredation when using RGB or CMYK.

**Will my poster have a border?**

All our posters come with a standard 3mm white margin around the edges. We are working on adding a ""borderless"" option to our site, but in the meantime you can email us after placing your order and let us know you would like your poster printed without the 3mm margin.

**How exact is my poster going to be cut?**

We are very careful about the cutting and alignment of your poster. Once you upload you are given two choices; one is to ""print as is"" where we will fit the image to your selected print size (and add black letterboxing if it doesn't fit), or you can choose ""customize"" and use our flash tool to align your poster exactly how you want it. The customize tool will show you the exact printing area for the poster size you chose. 

**I've wanted this picture as a poster forever. I really can't find a higher quality image than this one unfortunately. What options do I have?**

Most low quality images turn out great at a medium size like 16x20 or 18x24. If I were to print a low quality image at 18x24 and you looked at it very closely you would be able to notice tiny uni-color lines called artifacts that are the result of extrapolation. If you were viewing it from 3 or 4 feet away you won't see the artifacts the but it will appear slightly out of focus.

I'd say go for it, only for the fact that if you think it's too blurry when it arrives just let me know and you can swap for a bigger image or get your money back, no questions asked.

**Is there a way to have a poster made from a non digital photograph?**

Absolutely. You can mail the photograph to our office, address is [here](http://www.posterburner.com/ReturnPolicy.aspx).  We will scan it, make it into a poster, and ship both pictures back to you. You can email us once the image is on the way with the size and any alterations you'd like to make.

**What printing process do you use?**

We use Adobe Photoshop with a couple custom plug-ins to reduce quality loss if upscaling is necessary. Each poster is hand created to match the submitted order exactly (if you customize by adding text, styles, or a template) and is then sent to our large format printer. From there we will cut any excess margins and roll it up into a shipping tube and it's on it's way.

**Is there a choice in paper stock?**

At PosterBurner.com we only offer high-mil photogloss paper, if you are interested in getting a stretched canvas print please check out our sister site [RoyalCanvas.com](http://www.royalcanvas.com).",False,t1_c0nitry,False,,t5_2r4w1,,c0nitry

Typically, the US (via the IMF, WB, and WTO) mandate the elimination of agricultural subsidies in developing countries while retaining their own right to subsidize agriculture. This makes it cheaper for people in developing countries to purchase food imported from the United States than food literally grown in their own backyards. Because of this, local farmers cannot make enough money selling their crops to survive, and have to sell their land. Frequently, the only groups buying up farmland at this point are multinational agriculture concerns (usually US or western Europe based) such as Monsanto, GM, etc. These groups can then use this land to grow crops for export that don't grow in the US, like coffee, cacao, and others.

They were technologically and scientifically advanced, incredibly rich, culturally sophisticated, and thoroughly Christian. The Byzantines never experienced a dark age after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and maintained the cultural legacy of the Romans and the Greeks while Western Europe spent the next 1000 years as a cultural and technological backwater.

The fun starts after 6pm.  Before 6pm is quiet time for the old folks.  They play quiet oompa music.  After 6pm things get roudy and loud.  Big chested ladies with a lot of cleavage start to magically appear.

I recommend the Hofbrau-Festzelt (Hofbrau festival tent) for a tent.  It's where a lot of the English speaking folk tend to hang out.  They serve Hofbrau Beer, which is pretty good.  You can get this in the states if you want to try it before choosing.  If you want to listen to rock music instead of traditional brass bands, try the Hacker-Festzelt instead.  

If you're allergic to smoke (it's legal to smoke in the tents), then I think there's non-smoking sections you can possibly snag a seat in.  Or if you're a smoker, you're in luck.

* Going back to the recent EU high court ruling regarding Cyprus, you're suggesting fixing one injustice by creating another one.  The right thing to do would be to compensate all those whose land was taken.  Note that even in Israel proper there are legal mechanisms for confiscating land in certain cases, for instance if I own property that is needed for a superhighway (Arthur Dent, beware), but these mechanisms include monetary compensation.  I don't think Israel should wait for an agreement to do that, because, as you say, it's simply the right thing to do.

* Regarding the checkpoints, you make it seem as if they're in place merely to protect the settlements.  Those checkpoints are in place to protect Israel proper (of course, the settlements are protected as a side effect).  Many are the suicide bombers and other terrorists who have been caught by these checkpoints.  You forget (or didn't know?) that the *only* reason they're there is because Israelis were blowing up in buses or being shot in the highways.  You're mixing cause and effect.  If the Palestinians stop their terrorism, there should be keep them from traveling freely.

Regarding Hamas and ""long term"", they obviously don't say what they plan after that. However, it would be stupid of Israel to make serious concessions based on a truce that lasts only 10 years.  It's easy to say that if Hamas returned to conflict, Israel could too, but take a look at Lebanon.  Israel left Lebanon unilaterally with the promise that it would stay out so long as there was no violence from there.  However, when Hizbollah crossed the border, killed some soldiers and captured 2, Israel went in, and received very little international support.  Why do you think that Israel would receive support if the conflict resumed after the truce expired?

Regarding the declaration of independence, I repeat that nobody used it to justify a land grab. In fact, even if it *was* on the agenda, it wasn't justified by the declaration of independence, but by the mere fact that Israel was invaded.  No invasion --&gt; no land grab.  Simple as that.  It was a case of the 200 pound bully being beaten up by the 90 pound weakling and complaining about it.

&gt; I would rather not go into pre-1967 history, because it will be a competely waste of time.

Is that because for the most part Arabs were the aggressors in that time period, much more than Israel was?  It's inconvenient to your argument, is what it is.

•Three quarters of those polled are happy with their sex lives.

•Eastern Europeans (Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Russians) are the most sexually active (150).

•David Beckham was chosen as the sexiest man. George Clooney and Ben Affleck round out the top three.

•Jennifer Lopez was chosen as the sexiest woman. Catherine Zeta Jones came in second. Halle Berry and Britney Spears tied for third place.

•45% of those taking the survey reported having a one night stand.

•Those in Thailand, China, and Vietnam were the most contented with their sex life.

•Fins and Russians were the least happy.

•Americans were low on the frequency list in 2003 at 118 times per year.

•The three countries with the lowest sexual frequency were Sweden (102), Maylasia (100), and Singapore (96).

•48% of women admitted to faking an orgasm.
According to the Durex Survey (2001):


•Americans appear to have the most sex at 132 times a year, with the Russians close behind at 122 times a year, the French at 121, and the Greeks at 115.

•The countries with the lowest frequency of sex are Japan (37 times per), Malaysia (62) and China (69).

•Couples living together report having sex 146 times per year.

•Married couples make love 98 times per year.

•Single folks are having sex the least at 49 times a year.

•Four percent of the respondents to the survey claim to have sex daily.

•57% say they have sex at least once per week.

You're talking about an investigation and subsequent trial. That is not the case at hand. We're talking about the news media. If the media doesn't jump on this there won't *be* an investigation/trial!

Stop watching movies and spend some time as an actual reporter, and you'll see that it's a bit harder than your childish idealism.

Oh fuck you and your insults and your strawmen. It's called sticking a TV camera in somebody's face an asking for a comment.

If none of them will talk you take a look at documents and evidence such as videos from Apache helicopters! I guess you're not much of a reporter if you don't know that. Maybe that's why a bunch of bloggers are putting you inept douches out of jobs. Not that you were doing your jobs in the first place.

The media does investigate when it comes to Tiger Woods, but not for powerful people who are actually supposed to be accountable.

Officially the story was that the reporters were killed as a result of crossfire in a conflict the military had with ""insurgents"".  The leaked video today shows a completely different story.

Here is the article on the incident from the New York Times in 2007:

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/world/middleeast/13iraq.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss

And here is the decrypted video of the attack as released by Wikileaks today (Apr 5, 2010).  They have registered this domain name specifically for this video, and have chosen the title to lessen the media's ability to spin this another way. 

http://collateralmurder.com/



Other news sites have already broken this story, but so far the North American news media has been silent.  So far Al Jazeera has reported the story and it is starting to break throughout Europe:

http://english.aljazeera.net/

http://www.dn.se/


It is a very disturbing video and the implications are very serious.  I hope that we still live in a world where this is considered bigger news than Tiger Woods playing in a golf tournament or the release of a new Apple device.  If we are to allow the official story to stand then we are complicit in allowing the military, of any country, to freely kill whoever they like and to lie to our faces about it.

I hope &lt;insert station name&gt; does the right thing and gives this story the time and focus it deserves.

Thank you,

&lt;your name&gt;""",True,t1_c0njgsp,True,,t5_2cneq,,c0njgsp

First of all, there are some horrible acts of stupidity and carelessness, but either way, a lot of people twist this into a terrible story.

1. The helicopter was called down there for the means to engage because there were reported small arms around that area, and soldiers were in danger. They weren't cruising around for fun and zooming in randomly. There are a LOT of people involved.
2. They supposedly found RPG's and that photographer did look like he was holding an RPG. On that note: A lot of pictures on that site are looked at from the side.

Very, very true. Even in the US, a large project like this would have a constant struggle to keep on track, and to prevent theft and destruction of assets. It certainly isn't going to be easier to prevent that across 8 or 10 countries--each with their own local laws and jurisdictions. 

My point is that plans like this emphasize the gulf between haves and have-nots. Humans are terrible at restraining themselves for the sake of ""potential rewards"". If any country attempts to build a 10 billion Euro solar plant in the ""middle of nowhere"" it is going to take 20 billion worth of Euros to keep people away from it long enough to get any energy out of it--especially if it is well known that the energy is being sold to Europe rather than used locally.

Here is where this whole plan will go horribly wrong: *It is left to the sovereignty of the producing countries ...*

&gt;the costs and risks are outweighed by the potential rewards

The costs and risks will be paid by the same people who always pay for the costs and risks--the poorest of the poor. Many of them will pay with their lives. A few will become richer but most of the poor will become poorer. Rewards, if any, will be split among the company officials, government officials and the security force bosses.

The whole idea is a wonderful plan and it has been in the works for a while, but so far, I do not see a single African country signing up to host the solar plants. Looking at the map, I would also say that there are a lot of African countries that are going to be unhappy about being excluded, even if they wouldn't participate anyhow.

&gt;they won't need fences or much security because it'll be largely inaccessible.

I'm sure it took a lot of planning to get the war going, because it is not just the president but also Congress who authorizes war.

It all boils down to this- why are we the world's police force? George Washington told us not to get involved in another country's problems, yet here we are doing exactly that.

Oh, probably. They've actually studied this, Stockholm Syndrome is a subset of it, or related to it somehow. And there's an average time after which people stop screaming, and then an average time after which they start identifying with their captors. Both periods are measured in hours and days, not weeks or months. There are outliers, no doubt... but those who try to poison their ""husbands"" generally didn't survive to pass on their genes to new daughters.

&gt; The character in Gor didn't. 

Plausible, but probably less common. There are some women who are too afraid to scream, and where that subset overlaps those who are receptive/submissive...

&gt; How long would it take before she was so broken that the man felt comfortable letting her out in public?

At a guess? I'd wager that this period was typically less than a year. In all cases, I'd think it was less than 2 years. Any woman who can last longer than that, probably would be unbreakable... but also probably either escaped, or killed the man and was then killed by his relatives.

This isn't all prehistory either, you can look back just 1000 years or so, and see evidence of this sort of thing in Europe. If you're truly curious, read some of those stories, see what happened. Some will just be tall tales, but other places it will be somewhat plausible, I'd think.

&gt; In Gor apparently a day or a few days is enough to break her will.

This has to be at the one end of the Bell curve, of course. But I wouldn't rule it out. And again, remember the source.

&gt; On top of that the character doesn't even question the fact that she was transported magically to another world outside of a few sentences...

That's hard to gauge. On the one hand, if such a thing truly happened, I'd imagine that a sizable fraction of the subjects would be vegetables out of sheer shock. Whether that reduces or heightens the submissive effect, I have no clue. (I speculate that it might actually reduce it though.)

&gt; I don't care how you cut it, that just unrealistic characterization and sloppy writing.

Well, there's no disputing that.

And while I in no way suggest that anyone kidnap or rape women, accepting these things as true will give you insight.

That's just good business. Who are these employers that routinely take unnecessary risks? Two weeks payroll, after three months, isn't a big deal.

The only valid argument is that it decreases the number of jobs available, and that is arguable.

&gt;What part of the workforce is more affected by these regulations you defend?

They would also be the main beneficiaries of such policies. Picture your stereotypical hard working single mother who suddenly got fired over bullshit. Two weeks of cushion doesn't sound so terrible, does it?

I guess you could tell her to push herself up by her own bootstraps.

&gt;You don't know this. You can presume that in the majority of cases, and you might even be right if you did that, but in reality you have no idea the variety of jobs, with the range of demands, that exist out there.

It's economics. If you can't make payroll, it's probably a temp position, to which these sorts of rules don't apply.

&gt;You talk numbers and averages. I talk people. You say ""oh, but the benefit of this regulation outweighs the detriments"" -- I say, not only have you not proven the efficacy of this regulation, you would not  like to sit down and have a talk with one of the human beings your idea disenfranchised.

You **have** to talk about numbers. How else can you rationally determine the effect of a given policy?

We haven't talked any metrics along the lines of which we can evaluate this. Frankly, I'm grossly uninformed and I suspect so are you (or else we both would've posted something more substantive).

You talk about enhanced job accessibility. In this context, that can only be achieved by greater numbers of available jobs; talking about increased employer risk aversion is valid, but I remain unconvinced it's applicable in this scenario because it's a fairly small benefit (compare standard western european conditions of 4 weeks of holidays and 1 month of severance pay). 

Does this provision in particular dramatically reduce competitiveness? How does it affect the average earning potential compared to that person going immediately on the dole? (i.e. suppose it takes four weeks to find comparable employment; what's the effect on the tax burden, etc etc)

Would it be more efficient to substitute severance pay with slightly higher payroll taxes to pay for unemployment benefits? Are you against unemployment insurance altogether? 

Furthermore, is this even the kind of job creation we *want* to encourage? 

&gt;""I really care about the poor and the worker, so let's invent new rules that directly affect them the most. So fuck the poor!""

Actually, I'm all about measuring what works best; we're both guilty of the same crime in this instance - neither of us really knows what we are talking about, and are going at it from our own ideological standpoints.

So, my position overall is that maybe it's ok to trade some competitive advantages for better living conditions, and to a great extent this is the bargain most Western European nations assumed in the aftermath of World War 2 (England in particular deciding that full employment was vastly preferable to the civil unrest large scale unemployment yields). Now that their populations are declining it might not be possible to continue to fund the same schemes on the same large scale.

Just how far we should tweak it remains an open question. But I do tell you that I much prefer a system that aims to minimize shittiness in general than continuing to live in misery over a love affair with laissez faire capitalism. ",True,t1_c0nk77d,False,,t5_2qh1i,,c0nk77d

My dad talks about living in Seattle in the late 60s, how the local economy was bad and people were leaving the city in the thousands, a local real estate company put up that famous sign 'Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.' My dad talks about this time and says ""the city felt more like a town, with a lot of stubborn locals, fishermen, loggers and regular Boeing folk, working through the hard times."" Then, with the tech industry boom came a lot of new jobs, and therefore, a ton of new transplants. Many of whom were working in newer industries, making a lot of money and raising property values, which then, inadvertently, caused many long time residents to move farther and farther from the city center. My dad also talks about all the burnt out hippies coming from all over, trying to ""escape"" greed and oppression and reconnect with nature. There were also the well to do yuppies migrating up from the southern coast, trying to implement their California culture and way of life.

Seattle used to be a working class city, with the majority of people being of a German/Scandinavian background. Culturally, Seattle is known for being polite and friendly on the surface, yet evasive if roused beyond that. If you look at most Germanic and Scandinavian cultures you usually find the same distinction. The climate is also very similar to the climate of Northern Europe, bleak and cloudy. I find that during the winter most Seattleites stay indoors with people they really know, family and close friends. However, in the summer everyone is out and about, celebrating culture and diversity and glorious sunshine, but in the winter you hole up and stick together to get through it. This might be where transplants have it the worst. I have a group of friends I've known since High School, and a lot of friends I've met since, but I have to admit that during the winter I mostly gather with my older friends. Why? I'm not sure, perhaps it's easier or more familiar, or maybe it has something do to with the ingrained culture of cold weather peoples. I don't really know.

Now, I'm no expert on the socio-economic history of Seattle or anything, just thought I'd share my, and my dad's perspective. Also, sorry if I've never called you back, I still think you're awesome people.

A combination of religion, a misplaced sense of entitlement, and, most importantly, the desire for conquest.

basketball.  I don't like it.  I don't think of it as a team sport.  There appears on the surface to little strategy, to much ""give it to the all star to dunk or free throw.""  It's to loud in the arena to enjoy.  Just don't care for it.  In the interest of full disclosure, I can't dribble or shoot to save my life either.

Soccer.  Dull, dull, dull.  I have never been to a professional European match, but I think being part of the crowd would be more fun than watching the actual game.  To me, the field seems to large for real excitement.  An hour and a half and a score of 2-1 is plain dull.  Most of the time the game seems to be run and kick, run and kick, rinse repeat.  To me its like NASCAR nothing exciting to watch unless there is a wreck, in soccer its when its right down to the goal.  There is to much theatrics that makes the game silly...sorry but after watching a guy in American football, Australian football, or rugby take a diving tackle at full speed makes that little trip seem..kinda pussy-like.  To me, to make the game more exciting, they should make the field about a third or half the size and high glass walls so the ball doesn't go out of play.  That way the game has a faster pace, more excitement from closer chances at a goal.  Also, do like the NFL did and start throwing red cards for over theatrics.  You are going to sit there and hold your shin then hop up and run after a ball like nothing happened?  Yellow card for attempted delay of game.  Of course let me be honest and say that I'm an American and probably have a lot of the cultural bias that comes with that, I'm sure that if I was English I would be singing the praises of Manchester United right now.

Hockey?  Well, being an American from the deep south I don't have much cultural attachment to it like Canadians or Northerners do.  However, I do remember the hockey popularity surge of the 90's.  I did watch a few games and saw the appeal.  Sure the scores are just as low as soccer, but the action is very fast and intense.  The puck rarely stops, the players not only have to be able to ice skate very well, but handle a stick deftly.  The wall checks can be brutal and that honestly can be very appealing.  The skill it takes to get the puck into such a small net past what is a rather large man who isn't afraid of a large piece of hard plastic hurling at his face at 80 miles an hour is impressive.  I see the appeal of hockey, but again, I don't have much cultural ties to it.

Other sports?

I prefer boxing and pure martial arts over Ultimate Fighting.  Boxing seems to come with a bit of greater skill, while MMA needs little skill in my opinion but a lot of endurance.  I honestly would rather watch middleweight boxing or a Judo tournament over MMA.
Motorsports are dull.  I commute to work.  I get the experience of taking a highspeed turn boxed in by several large cars at 80 miles an hour on the interstate five days a week.
Extreme sports, i.e skateboarding, BMX, snowboarding, etc. are quite exciting to watch as well as participate in.

The U.S. has systematically gone through Iraq and destroyed, degraded or subverted every organization that has tried to oppose it militarily. That's what war is. It is perfectly just and proper to oppose such behavior when done for profit. But the goal of the U.S. is simply control the resources of that country and use it as a jumping-off point for any further attacks against any other regional forces that might try to oppose our aims. The U.S.'s goal is not personal. It's not genocide - it's ""just business."" The U.S. is not systematically destroying a cultural group - overtly or covertly - we are destroying opposition. If we really wanted to destroy an entire cultural group, it would have been done by now. Calling it genocide is hyperbole. I understand your emotional revulsion towards what has happened, but we have different words for these types of conflict for a reason.

&gt;The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal.

After eight months, the second in command at the doctrinal office, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, now the Vatican’s secretary of state, instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to Father Murphy’s dismissal.

&gt;But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church’s own statute of limitations.

To believe the Bush admin wanted democracy (evidence: they said so) in Iraq is like believing they wanted Iraq to align itself with Iran (even a moderately democratic Iraq would obviously want to normalize relations with shiite Iran -- a nightmare for Washington planners). According to the Financial Times, the Bush admin predictably fought really hard to prevent elections in Iraq. It was only because of Al-Sistani and huge non-violent demonstrations that the US was forced to allow some sort of elections.

Financial Times:

""the reason the elections took place was the insistence of the Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who vetoed three schemes by the US-led occupation authorities to shelve or dilute them.""

ME scholar Alan Richards:

""although the United States initially oposed early elections in Iraq, after Ayatollah Sistani turned huge numbers of his followers out in the streets to demand such elections, Washington had little choice but to agree.""

The WSJ:

""[Ali Sistani] gave his marching orders: spread the word that Ayatollah Sistani insists the new government be chosen through a direct election, not by the US or US apointed Iraqi leaders.""

Veteran war correspondent Patrick Cockburn (one of the very few journalists who actually got out of the Green Zone, and who is perhaps the most respected reporter on the region):

""it was only when it became clear that the US could not withstand a Shia uprising that elections turned out to have been an immediate American goal all along.""

And come on! The Halabja massacres? Why was Saddam accused of that and not the Reagan admin, which supported Saddam during and long after those very atrocities? The same year as those massacres, the US removed Saddam from their list of terror states. From your own reference:

&gt;The provision of chemical precursors from United States companies to Iraq was enabled by a Ronald Reagan administration policy that removed Iraq from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

So if the neocons of the Bush II admin (largely the same people as the Reagan admin) were so upset about Halabja leading up to the invasion of 2003, why did they deny it and protect Saddam *while he was comitting them*?

Saddam became a target when he disobeyed Washington orders and invaded Kuwait when he had been instructed that he could only correct borders.

You'll just have to put up with my terrible powers of description. I'm not a geneticist either, so you'll have to put up with the possibility that I'm wrong.

When people first hear of evolutionary facts like:

&gt;everyone in this area of the world is descended from ancestor ""x"", or group of people ""p""

they often make the same mistake I made. That mistake is to forget that when ""x"" was alive, say 10,000 years ago, there were also lots of other people, ""y"" and ""z"" for instance. The simplistic view is to forget (or never realise) that the modern population is also descended from ""y"" and ""z"" (unless they died before breeding) despite having a gene that was only present in ""x"". Or that, even if you have solid evidence that every current member of society is descended from group ""p"", that groups ""r"", ""s"", and ""t"" also contributed genes to the gene pool.

Extreme example following: imagine an island in the Pacific. It has roughly 1000 inhabitants on it, and has had a similar population for many thousands of years. Normally there is no travel on or off the island. The inhabitants of the island have brown skin. Now imagine that a few hundred years ago a white, red-headed European man visited, had a few children by a local woman and then died. No-one else ever visited. It's possible that the gene for red hair could spread through the population until every single inhabitant had it. Now, in the present day, the islanders don't look any different (it's a recessive gene), but if you do an analysis of their genes, and look at one particular gene (in this case the gene for red hair, in the original article it was the gene for lactase) then you will come to the conclusion that every single inhabitant of the island is descended from our red headed sailor boy. However, they all still have brown skin and they still look identical to the population of the island to the north, and the island to the south (apart from a few redheaded individuals). They are all descended from a single individual, and simultaneously also from a whole bunch of other single individuals, but everyone forgets that.

It's entirely possible that I have some Neanderthal DNA in me (apart from the 90-something percent that we share with all other great apes, that is. *Obviously* I share that with the Neanderthals too). There could have been a gene which wasn't present in any other ape but evolved once and once only in a Neanderthal. That Neanderthal could have bred with an ancient Homo Sapiens (no one knows) and that gene could have entered the H Sapiens gene pool. It might be in my body right now, I might have passed it on to my children. However, and this is the bit that confuses the hell out of people, myself included, I'm not a Neanderthal. In fact, all the Neanderthals are extinct. But it's theoretically possible that, if you looked at that one gene, you would discover that an entire population is ""descended"" from an extinct species. If you introduced yourself ""Hi, I'm srshouse and I'm descended from Neanderthals"" then you would get some funny looks because everyone assumes that you can't be (what with the whole ""extinct"" thing going on).

The (my biased) jist of it in the US is this: 

Libertarians with the capital ""L"" are actually wolves in sheep clothing. They're actually capitalists who don't even necessarily oppose corporatism but are in fierce of opposition of regulated markets  - which makes no sense to me but that's just the beginning of the confusion. 

They favor right-wing political ideology and are, actually, minarchists, i.e.  would like minimal government involvement to *only* police private property and organize the military against foreign governments. Here I again get confused as they are anti-government but would like the government to police their property... 

They are also reformists - they believe that Ron Paul/Sarah Palin as president would serve their minimal, right-wing government goal to provide a free-market... and then dismantle the legislative branch of government and abolish taxes... Here, again, I get hazy as I don't get weather they first get the legislative branch to pass a law that gives them the power to do such things or do they force a coup d'etat that establishes a minimalist totalitarian government that then grants them by extension the power to do anything? Presumably, either way, after they're done with this exercise they would benevolently relinquish all the executive power they needed to achieve these goals.

Anyhoo - then we all live in a capitalist utopia where we all volunteer to do whatever we want to and everyone is free to get what they can based on their abilities while the lazy, the weak and the stupid get their just reward of starving to death and taking care of the sick, the elderly, the handicapped, the mentally disturbed and the criminals is privatized and tendered to the lowest bidder for profit. I think that about covers it all.

For an anarchist perspective - which, IMO, completely discredits these goals both intellectually and morally - you'll have to read the available linked resources on the right of the subreddit:



&gt;An Anarchist FAQ is an excellent resource with answers to questions you might have.

&gt;Anarchy Archives is a fairly comprehensive archive of primary sources on anarchism.

&gt;Anarchism is a political perspective which aims to create anarchy, ""the absence of a master, of a sovereign"" [P.J. Proudhon, What is Property, p. 264]. In other words, anarchism aims to achieve a society in which people freely cooperate together as equals. As such, anarchism generally opposes all forms of hierarchical control as not only harmful to the individual and society, but unnecessary.

&gt;We have our own FAQ. Please check it out if you're new and thinking of making a self post.


It's a little bit more complicated than ""Change guvmant, moran!"" and ""Austrian, Keynesian or Chicago economy?"" 

And because it's so complicated there are many overlapping, opposing, intersecting at all angles and parallel views that are open to interpretation and criticism. That's why there are probably at least 2 points of view *per anarchist* on *every, single issue* raised.

Also, anarchism is much more international - you'll probably find anarchists on r/A from all corners of the globe (UK has a strong contingent, continental western Europe too, as well as Greece, South America and so on) even though the lingua franca is English and the topics are mainly UK/US orientated. 

I would wager that given 8,000 readers (and not counting the +- 1,000 are Libertarian trolls) there are probably around 14,000 opinions on this subreddit per post.

Most are more or less inline. Others, not so much. This one, in particular, is highly contested as it touches on the highly sensitive issue of violent protest to achieve goals.

It's a tender topic for pro and anti factions alike within the community that, effectively, splits the movement down that line.

The general consensus is that ""*sometimes* it is useful/appropriate"" but when is ""sometimes"" valid - I have yet to see a unified response to.

My own personal view is that ""sometimes"" is the nothing-left-to-lose, must win or die, absolutely uncontested self-defense, everything else must be tried first, absolute last resort. Proactively perusing a riot means to an end leaves room for - as rightly pointed out by the OP - the Brandon Darby effect and a myriad of other infiltration techniques into the movement, again, in my view (granted, the state would find a way to infiltrate, anyway).

Also ""Unemorsefully Anti-Capitalist *And* Anti-State"" like the title says. 

So opposing the Tea Party rally - yay or nay? Good question. 

'Nay' for now? That's my rubbernecking 2c worth.

Subsidies should be routed to other grains - there are so many other options, so there really is no need to subsidize wheat so heavily:  
  
1. Cereal Grains   Barley, corn, millet, oats, rice, rye, sorghum, tef and wild rice are all in the same cereal grain family as is wheat. All flours ground from cereal grains may be used as a wheat substitute. Commonly available are barley, buckwheat, corn, rice and rye flour. The less utilized flours may be purchased online or from natural food stores. Note: people with a gluten allergy must also avoid barley, oats and rye.  
  
2. Non-Cereal Grains   Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are three grain-like seeds unrelated to cereal grains. (Despite its name, buckwheat is not a wheat-relative.) It is rare for anyone to develop a sensitivity to these non-cereal grains. Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are gluten-free and therefore not suitable for making leavened bread; however, they make excellent quick breads and cookies.  
  
3. Nut Meal   Ground nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts make the richest flour substitute for cookies and cakes. Because their fragile fatty acid content gives them a brief shelf life, it’s preferable to grind your own nuts in a food processor just prior to use. Nut meal requires a binding agent such as eggs. Because chestnuts are lower in fat than other nuts, chestnut flour has a longer shelf life. It is available online.  
  
4. Bean Flour   Dried beans, such as navy, pinto, soy and chickpeas may be milled and used, in combination with other flours, as a wheat alternative.  Bean flour is, however, not one that I recommend. Bean flour tastes like beans and makes baked goods dense and hard to digest.  
  
5. Other Flour Substitutes   Potato starch, arrowroot powder, cornstarch and tapioca are thickening agents that substitute for wheat in sauces and gravy. In baked goods these starchy ingredients serve as a binding agent.

EDIT: On a relatively related note; here in the UK, we received cooking lessons as part of the curriculum when we were in primary school (ages 6 - 9) - which I think is part of the solution to a healthier nation. However, all that I can remember cooking were cookies, 'traffic light' scones and cakes. Complete waste of such a good opportunity. Is there a similar program in the US at all?

&gt;The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal. 

Let's look at what we have here:

* A church that cares more about scandal then they do about protecting children

* A Cardinal (now Pope) who chooses to ignore it anyways, after being notified (but he had nothing to do with it! My eyes are rolling out the back of my skull)

&gt;The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vatican’s chief doctrinal enforcer. 

* He did this as an archbishop too.

&gt;But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church’s own statute of limitations. 

* Other cardinal puts Vatican laws ahead of government laws.  Is now the Vatican's secretary of state.

You are either delusional or lying.  The Pope (then cardinal) was notified, and either did not pay attention, or did not care, and in this matter both are completely unacceptable.

I think the difference between ""insurance mandate"" and ""two-tier"" is that in the two-tier system, *everyone* has basic coverage from the government which is payed for through taxes.  With an insurance mandate, there may be a public option that is government run where a large majority may participate in, however there are individuals who can choose to not pay into and be covered by the public option, and receive completely private insurance.  With the example of Germany, it becomes a bit gray because

&gt; All salaried employees must have a public health insurance. Only public officers, self-employed people and employees with a gross income above ca. 50000 EU (adjusted yearly) may join the private system.

So, there are some people who must be in the public health insurance program, however there is a portion that can completely opt out, which is why I think they would still be classified as ""insurance mandate"".

There are roughly 600 Members of Parliament that sit in the Commons (also just known as Parliament), and they're all affiliated to a particular party. Labour and the Conservatives combined hold an overwhelming majority of seats, making our political system practically a two party system. However the Liberal Democrats hold over 60 seats in the Commons, a significant minority. 

At the next election there is a real chance that neither Labour or the Conservatives will be able to acquire over 50% of the seats in the Commons (laws are passed by a simple majority, if you have &lt;50% of the seats you can't pass any laws if every other party is opposed to your bill). This makes the relatively small amount of seats held by the Liberal Democrats very important, because their cooperation will enable either Labour or the Conservatives to create a functioning government, depending on who they side with.

Also, a lot of people here mention the 'first past the post' system we have, I feel it is important to clarify what this is. Come election time, our nation is split up into about 600 different areas called constituencies. In each constituency every political party fields a candidate, and people in that constituency vote for whatever candidate they support. The candidate with the most votes becomes the Memeber of Parliament for that constituency.

A lot of people (including me) have a problem with this winner takes all system because it perpetuates two party politics. Take, for example, the Green Party. They generally gain 1% of the votes in a General Election. Obviously they never come first in any particular constituency, so they get no MPs, and no representation, despite the fact that 400,000 people voted for them. This in turn convinces people not to vote for the Green Party, because they feel their vote has no effect. This affects the Liberal Democrats as well. They're the 3rd largest political party in the country, and tend to come 3rd everywhere, rarely winning a constituency. Despite gaining 20% of the vote in the last general election, they only won 10% of the seats in parliament. This in turn convinces people not to vote for minority parties because they feel their vote is wasted.

Proportional representation would get rid of constituencies; everybody would vote for the party of their choice, and if a party wins x% of the vote, they get x% of the MPs in parliament. This in turn has its flaws. For example, with this system, no party would gain 50% of the seats in parliament (I don't think any party has won over 50% of the votes in many decades). This would force parties to have to form coalitions to govern, and politics in this country is notoriously partisan. You would likely end up with a watered down, fractious government prone to infighting and regular collapse. This isn't just theoretical musings, nations in Europe with proportional representation often suffer from these problems. In Belgium, the political parties are so partisan that a functioning government hasn't been formed for over five years! In Italy only one person has ever completed their 5 year term since World War Two (Berlusconi).

There are of course other systems, often compromising pure proportional representation with first past the post. But I've gone on for long enough, I'll let others explain if you wish to know more!",True,t1_c0nl2om,False,,t5_2qh1i,,c0nl2om

I'm not saying it's right to bring training to the level of indoctrination we have, but it's effective in absence of a true community bond as regiments of old had. Kill all Musselmen before they invade Constantinople had a special sort of draw to it, for the middle ages warrior. The kid in Carolina in 71, or Florida in 01 didn't have anything approaching that, even with the common founders mythos we share. 

What we have now is a shared culture of TV from Ed Sullivan in nam to Duck Tales in my and your case. It won't sustain the bond and Grossman's book mentioned elsewhere is the tip of the training iceberg (as we know).

Fuckin A right man. It's my only minor disagreement though is there. I'd say that it goes back well into the late 50's, and in earnest by the 70's, and we just missed it being 18 year old, and young dumb, full of cum. as we creeped away from true defense to win the cold war and fuel the MIC econo-war, training morphed into proactive defense and that requires a conqueror mindset. It's a shitty result, and frankly ...

**I think it's the greatest self-sacrifice any nation has ever collectively made in all of human history.**

Much the same way the USSR built a huge war machine to deal with the Axis powers, the US did the same. A nation that in 1937 was pretty non-interventionalist, and among the most neutral and peaceful on Earth (as far as developed nations go) had become arguably the largest war machine the world had ever seen. No good can come of that in peacetime. It is the military-industrial complex that Ike spoke of. A lot of people knew the inevitable result of that, and we had no option to dismantle it. Uncle Joe's was just as big, and he wanted large chunks of Europe now, at a time where the nations of Europe were in no position to hold off Soviets.

The United States may not have ""saved"" Europe, as reddit is fond of pointing out. The USSR had a large hand in that particular goal. However, isn't that a lot like saying the guy who draws the fire away from hostages and gets shot didn't help the snipers get a clear shot? Right or wrong, the USA as it was certainly committed suicide for the good of the world, and it's people, the ones the rest of the world understandably are frustrated with at the moment, once upon a time sacrificed everything their once free nation was, and resigned to live under the largest and most powerful regime the world has ever known without knowing it.

The products which copy your idea are called 'me-too products', and every successful product out there has them following them, and sometimes the me-too gets more popular than the original. 

The core of the problem for the patentholder is that s/he holds a patent for ONE WAY of doing things but there are always ways around that. In europe for example, many countries have the rule that you can't patent an idea, you can only patent an application of an idea. This leads to different implementations of the same idea which don't violate the patent. So companies instead try to patent tiny elements of their product, which are for example hard to make differently to avoid having a lot of me-too products. 

The existence of me-too products alone makes the patent system void and useless unless you're a pharmaceutical for example, as some patent systems allow a patent on a molecule. 

Software patents are even more silly, because they tend to patent an algorithm, but to what degree is algorithm X the same as algorithm X' ? For example the concept of Object Relational Mapping is patented over 280 times in the USA alone. How come?

European honeybees aren't native to the area where these hornets live, so when beekeepers import European honeybees to the area, they frequently are wiped out.

However, Japanese honeybees have a response to the threat of a giant hornet.  When the first one shows up to pheromone-mark the hive, so that other hornets can find it, the Japanese honeybees will lure it into the hive and then surround it in extremely large numbers, a few hundred at a time.  They'll dogpile on top of the hornet (a formation known as a Bee-Ball) and completely surround it, then quickly flex &amp; release their flight muscles over &amp; over again.  The combined exertion of all the bees flapping simultaneously causes the bee ball to dramatically rise in temperature to over 46 C / 115 F.  It also traps carbon dioxide around the hornet.  The hornet can't survive the bee ball and dies.

Ten to twenty bees are taken out with it, but by killing the scouting hornet, they prevent a swarm from showing up.  Absolutely fascinating.

- European 2009 Offshore Wind Market Growth 54%. 2010 projected to grow 75%. There are currently 17 offshore wind farms under construction in Europe, totalling more than 3500 MW. In addition, a further 52 offshore wind farms have won full consent in European waters, totalling more than 16000 MW. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/01/european-2009-offshore-wind-market-growth-above-50

&gt; Oh no! The standard social science model (SSSM)! Here we go… another treatise on how society never gives girls a chance to succeed.

And quotes ""girl power"" of all ludicrous things to back that up. This is clearly going nowhere good, if the author can't tell empowerment from the mere commercialized message of empowerment. 
 
&gt; By page four, Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard? Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard? This in itself denigrates females.

This does have some validity. In particular, while women are not overtly discriminated against nowadays, *femininity* still is. Career women often have to walk a fine line: feminine enough to avoid being considered unattractive or pushy, masculine enough to be taken seriously. But this isn't what's going on here - Ms Pinker is suggesting that wanting ""male standards"" like CEO jobs, math PhDs and political representation is somehow anti-feminine.

&gt;Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don’t have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually choose different paths

This is old. Very old. The claim of ""fundamental biological differences"" has been made since the very first stirrings of feminism, and oh-so-conveniently those differences always align with the prevailing gender roles. Much learned nonsense has been solemnly pronounced. For this reason, the claim is so tainted it sets klaxons blaring.

&gt; Let’s throw out the seemingly societal mandates and all that socialization and delve into actual differences, not perceptions or relative status, but the biology of the matter. Pinker “…began to wonder what would happen if all the ‘shoulds’—the policy and political agendas—were shifted to the side for a moment to examine the science” (p. 5).

A laudable aim. A very *hard* aim, because it glosses over at least two important cautions:

- The brain is known to rewire itself and literally change form according to use. What you're looking at in an adult is the product of 20+ years of plasticity and practise.

- The experimenter is full of gendered assumptions and many years of skill at detecting subtle cultural gender cues, and if they fail to properly double-blind then they will definitely throw the results.
 
&gt; she examines the role testosterone plays in male risk taking (including those amusing Darwin Awards) and the role oxytocin and empathy play in female career choices.

There's not enough detail given to be sure, but this sounds like lazy reductionism. Are we talking about hormonal differences *between* the sexes, or *within* the sexes? You get smaller or no effects in many cases on the latter - meaning in other words that the former was an unrelated correlation. Just as if you had measured the relationship of risk taking to facial hair.

&gt;He read a line about gender differences out loud, and immediately launched into the SSSM explanation; “because that’s what girls are told to do.” Then he read farther. He became quiet.

Fails to understand that children *learn* and *practise* their gender roles. There are real differences in older children and adults, just because of differing personal history.
 
&gt; Pinker does more than dryly discuss the biology; she provides example after example of women who have succeeded in this “man’s world” and found it wanting.

Has she done a comparable study on men? Or considered how different the working environment might be for women? This sounds like the worst kind of anecdote driven BS, if it isn't being misrepresented.

&gt; As Pinker explains, let’s move on past the idea that a woman can’t do the same work as a man, and discuss why she may not want to.

You'll find any number of conservatives spouting the same line, and what it really means is ""go back to the kitchen"". Again with the klaxons and flashing red-alert lights. This is exactly the direction you'd take if you were a pop sci hack trying to make a buck by playing the contrarian.

&gt; These “opt out” women can be found, as Pinker states, “in every major university, law, engineering, and accounting firm in North America and Europe” (p. 64). Women are 2.8 times more likely than men to leave science and engineering careers for other occupations and 13 times more likely to exit the labor force entirely.

Ever considered how relatively easy it is for a woman to do that? The values of the prevailing culture don't see her as a failure, a drop-out, a slacker, having abandoned her dreams, betraying her gender. Contrast men.

&gt; As one woman put it, “…work is not the only thing I do. I have a life” (p. 90).

Men who ""have a life"" are slacking. They're probably childish or effete, having some unmanly goal like art.

The patriarchy stiffs both sides. Guys are whipped to work until they drop. Gals are pushed away from success into more feminine backwaters. And yes, the world of work draws its values from ""manly"" virtues, so it doesn't make space for having a life. That's fucked up, too.
 
&gt; Boys are three times more likely to be placed in special education classes, twice as likely to repeat a grade, and a third more likely to drop out of high school.

They've practised from childhood gendered skills that don't help them in class, and avoided getting too good at other skills, such as impulse control, that would make them ""a sissy"".

&gt; However, males also dominate the highest percentiles of achievement, from math competitions to scrabble tournaments.

Again, this is hugely culturally conditioned. There are experiments showing that if you emphasize ""men typically outperform women at this test"", an insignificant difference between the scores blossoms into a glaring disparity, with men actually raising their scores and women lowering theirs.

&gt; One little known topic that has resonated strongly with female readers is the concept of being a “fraud.” [...] Pinker hypothesizes that it is linked to gender differences in depression, but admits that no study on this link has been published. This gender difference in the “imposter syndrome” needs to be investigated more fully, especially as more women succeed in their fields.

This except doesn't tell me anything about the relative prevalence of this feeling in men. That means I can't draw any gendered conclusions at all from it - tempting as it might be to blame the way women are often socialized to not rock the boat.

Most Arab countries are run by repressive American, Zionist sponsored regimes. Get a clue.

&gt;2) As for the Zionism = racism b.s., Zionism is a response to racism. There wouldnt be an Israel or a need for a jewish country if the jews werent chased there by Europeans who killed 3/4 of european jewish civilians throughout all the european countries for reasons of ethnic hatred/ethnic cleansing. There was no place better to go pushed by the world at the time. They didnt select themselves by their ethnicity, they were peaceful members of the societies of their home countries, and THEY were selected by ethnicity for murder. It's crappy land in many ways - the potential displacement of the jordanian (palestinian) inhabitants being one of them - but it was necessary for survival.

In other words, zionism is racism. And Palestine was not ""crappy land"" - http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter02_1of3.htm

&gt;The palestinian leader before Israels creation, during WW2 (Grand Mufti al-Husayni) allied himself with the nazis, spent much of WW2 in berlin, broadcast nazi propaganda throughout arab countries, and may have been involved in final solution planning: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Amin_al-Husayni.

Pure realpolitik. Palestine was colonised by the British and being invaded by European Jewry. Many anticolonial movements (eg. in India) sided with the Nazis too. Its very understandable. But to argue that the Mufti was involved in the planning of the final solution is absurd zionist propaganda.

&gt;The palestinians rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and delcared war on Israel the day it was created, and failed to live up to every peace pledge since then.

Bullshit. Firstly the UN partition plan was only a non-binding recommendation. It could only have been implemented if both sides freely consented. It was also very unfair towards the Palestinians so not only did they have the right to reject the plan but it was also rational for them to do so. Further, by the time Israel's independence was declared (itself an act of war since its had no international warrant), zionist militias had ethnically cleansed 250,000 Palestinians from their homes during the civil war. This created a huge refugee and humanitarian crisis in the surrounding states. It was only a matter of time before the surrounding Arab states were forced to intervene. Israel's declaration of independence was the last straw. By the time the 1947 war ended, nearly a million Palestinians were deliberately ethnically cleansed from their ancestral homes by zionist paramilitary groups - around 80% of the total Palestinian population at the time. 

&gt;Palestinians also have a country called Jordan, which is 70% palestinian but governed by a minority monarchy of Hashemites. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people.  

No, the Palestinian in Jordan are the descendants of the refugees who were ethnically cleansed by Zionists. Their home is in Palestine and they have a right to return to it under International Law.

&gt;But instead of moving there or anywhere else in the arab world (which covers 25 countries in 14 million square kilometers) and accepting reparations, the PLO and Hamas insist on eternal war at any cost.

Wrong. The PLO and even Hamas have been willing to negotiate. Unfortunately Israel doesn't want peace with the Palestinians. It wants land, at any cost. 

&gt;There have been many instances of people losing wars and having to move in world history, without them resorting to decades long campaigns of anti-civilian terror.

Like when? And what civilians are you referring to? Israeli adults aren't civilians since they're hostile colonists and also obligated to serve in the IDF. And please show me an instance where a people have peacefully accepted being colonised and ethnically cleansed by invaders.

&gt;I'm not sure how you can read Hamas' charter and then think to yourself ""oh well that probably has nothing to do with Hamas, its only their official charter, Imsure some jews faked it or something."" You might want to reflect on that. Saying its your religious duty to kill jews isnt racist? Please.

What official charter? 

&gt;[ some quotes from Hamas charter:

""Senior British diplomat and former British ambassador  to the UN Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated in early 2009 that the Hamas charter was ""drawn up by a Hamas-linked imam some [twenty] years ago and has never been adopted since Hamas was elected as the Palestinian government in 2006"". Greenstock also stated that Hamas is not intent on the destruction of Israel.[57]""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas

&gt;Harassing the Israelis with your Zionism = racism b.s. is also something you should reconsider - a vast oversimplification of a very difficult history, in which the palestinian arabs have plenty of responsibility for their plight, as do the israelis for their abuses. 

This is no oversimplification. ISrael and zionism is overwhelmingly responsible for starting and perpetuating this conflict. You are just trying to obfuscate the truth. 

&gt;But spreading hateful speech and denying the right of Israel to exist, etc. makes the problem worse because its unfair and typically motivated by hate.

There is nothing hateful in stating that the apartheid state of Israel has no right to exist and that zionism is racism. Get a clue and grow a moral backbone.

&gt;Rebecca L. Burch, Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Oswego, Oswego, NY. Email:  Rebecca.burch@oswego.edu

Oh a psychologist. A total authority on biology and evolution /sarcasm

How many times must we debunk the bullshit of alleged ""evolutionary psychologists?""  Every time they make a claim, usually based on a monkey study, another monkey study or something else comes alogn 5 months later and blows it out of the water.

These are professional projectionists, people. Beyond our patterns in developing language, math, our instinctive need to survive when our lives are threatened and to look for food, there's nothing much else that's ""hard wired"" for us.

You can't just look at a trend on some subject and make up an evolutionary imperative that describes it after the fact.  This is called post-diction.  Not prediction.  A scientist should be able to come up with a hypothesis or theory that predicts future behavior or unknown patterns in the future before we become aware of them.  What evolutionary psychologists do is the opposite.

&gt;Here we go… another treatise on how society  never gives girls a chance to succeed.   While this may be true in other cultures and in some facets of our own, in the present day US there are plenty of programs, incentives, and encouragement for girls to find themselves and find their niche.

But this isn't even _about_ biology so far.  This is another, ""you girls complaining about sexism here are just spoiled bitches. They have it worse in other countries, you know!  If they have it worse, it means we don't have it at all!""

&gt;There is even a retail and entertainment industry based on “girl power” that rakes in billions a year.

No, there's a retail and entertainment industry that enforces gender stereotypes and concern trolls women under the guise of ""girl power"" to enforce both old and newer stereotypes of women being evaluated by the things they buy to adorn their bodies, and their sexuality.

But I guess Burch thinks no companies ever lie and distort.

&gt;Whether this is encouragement or exploitation is also a matter of debate

No, it's not.  It's almost exclusively exploitation.  That's the nature of an amoral business in capitalism, and we need to get real about it.  Get as much money out of customers as you can, as quick as you can. And you do it through exploitation.

&gt;but the message of “a girl’s freedom to do anything” is clear.

Yeah.  Anything that fits certain pre-defined parameters. Which means, **not** _anything_.

&gt;These are the conclusions a reader may jump to within the first few pages, but worry not.   Thankfully, Pinker has other plans.

So what, all that was sarcasm?  You don't make it clear.  You're a horrible writer.

&gt;By page four, Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard?   Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard?   This in itself denigrates females.

Now for the thousandth time I have to explain that women's liberation, feminism, equality, is not about trying to turn women into men!!  goddamnit, what the fuck is wrong with you assholes who get printed?

&gt;So many books discuss how females are discouraged, disenfranchised, and disenchanted, citing numbers of women leaving traditionally “male” careers.   Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don’t have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually  choose different paths, not be forced into them by the patriarchy.

She _dares_? That's not daring.  _Or_ original.  ""They just don't want those jobs"" has _always_ been a spoken excuse for discrimination against women in the work place.  Discrimination is neglecting to hire based on their sex _even when they are choosing that career_.  No statistics on how much one sex wants one career or another will change the fact that what that employer is doing is discrimination.

You don't have to examine biology to find discrimination or rule it out.  All you need to look for is this: You have 100 positions to fill.  There are just as many qualified female applicants as there are male applicants. Yet they hire 95 males and 5 females.  Ask why.  If you rule out race and class and disability, and the only thing left is sex, you have found yourself a probable case of discrimination.  Then when you find the interviewers and company owners express patently misogynist views, you've clinched it.

&gt;Now we’re talking!   Let’s throw out the seemingly societal mandates and all that socialization and delve into actual differences, not perceptions or relative status, but the biology of the matter.   Pinker “…began to wonder what would happen if all the ‘shoulds’—the policy and political agendas—were shifted to the side for a moment to examine the science” (p. 5). 

Let the bullshit commence.

&gt;He read a line about gender differences out loud, and immediately launched into the SSSM explanation; “because that’s what girls are  told to do.”   Then he read farther.   He became quiet.

What a great way to disregard somebody's observation that people often only believe things because they were raised to as children, such as religion and gender stereotypes, than to say ""It's just PC"" or as this author puts it, ""SSSM.""

Her brother, you may note, does not have a doctorate in any of the fields that apply. So his ""oh..."" doesn't really mean much.

&gt;Pinker does more than dryly discuss the biology; she provides example after example of women who have succeeded in this “man’s world” and found it wanting.

Newsflash: rising to the top ranks among assholes doesn't eliminate what sucks about sexism.  Can we have a ""duh?""  This happens to people in all kinds of careers.

&gt;As Pinker explains, let’s move on past the idea that a woman can’t do the same work as a man, and discuss why she  may not want to.   Any woman who has wondered if her preferences run counter to the feminist cause should pay close attention here; believing that a woman should have every right to pursue the same goals as men is different from believing that every woman should want to.

Strawfeminist alert!  It is not feminist theory that women should automatically want to make the choices that they are now more free to make.  The point is that women that _do_ make the choice should not be punished for it.

There are no feminists out there saying, ""You should want to make it in a largely misogynist chauvinist company _and like it, damnit!_  It's a strawman to say that feminists are telling women to ignore misogyny, to make themselves not feel hurt by it, just because they can make it to the board of directors.

If you don't think that all the emotional, psychological, verbal, and physical abuse that tends to come with success in business, or the sheer emptiness of a
company life, is worth it, then more power to you for choosing integrity and self-worth over 'success'.  _That_ is the feminist message.

&gt;Time and again, Pinker points out how women have sought those goals, attained them, and then shifted their eyes to a different prize.   These “opt out” women can be found, as Pinker states, “in every major university, law, engineering, and accounting firm in North America and Europe” (p. 64).  

Again, people do this in every career in existence.  People go from, say, haliburton, to vice president. Or congressperson to CEO. Or chairman of one company to another company.  Maybe Burch means the women she's talking about go from finding success in a career, to settling down as a stay at home parent or a hourly wage job.  But she doesn't.  She leaves it vague, so you fill in the gap with whatever you think she's getting at.

Of course feminists are working on communicating with people on how we can change the way corporations, companies and other businesses do things and treat their workers so that women, non-whites, and other disparaged classes can find success without trading in their dignity.  But you won't find Burch or Pinker mentioning that.  The strawfeminist who's supposed to have invented the Fabio-advertised romance novel is more important.

&gt;However, it is just as important and just as outrageous an idea in today’s society that men are at a biological disadvantage, or for that matter, that males can top the charts in achievement for a reason other than an oppressive patriarchy. 

There's also religious, classicist, and racial discrimination, too.  Thanks for making yet another strawman argument that we think it's all just patriarchy turtles all the way down.  Turd.

&gt;Speaking of outrageous ideas, another common belief that is torpedoed is the concept of female solidarity or sisterhood.   Pinker “blows the lid off female aggression” (p. 220).   Girls are often taught that females bond together while males are cutthroat.

How many movies, tv-shows, radio programs, and blogs has Burch had to skip over, that say over and over that women are distrustful, traitorous bitches, to make this statement?  It is _not_ popularly believed that women stick together.

&gt;Pinker hypothesizes that it is linked to gender differences in depression, but admits that no study on this link has been published.

So Pinker is more than willing to make a grossly generalized statement about gender differences on a subject, but also admits that there's no study supporting it.  Know what we call that?  Bullshitting.  Bias.

And we're just supposed to be OK with it.

Namely that land may not be seized and then repopulated with one's own population, that refugees should be afforded the right to return at the earliest opportunity, that land may not be annexed.

The four Geneva Conventions don't mention any right of return. Refugee rights were primarily laid out in a [separate treaty from 1951](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees), which deals largely with the right of asylum and non-refoulement and doesn't mention a ""right of return,"" either. 

It's also worth noting that right after WWII, [the victorious Allies forcibly uprooted 12-14 million ethnic Germans whose families had been living in various parts of Eastern Europe for centuries and expelled them to Germany *en masse*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II). They were never given any ""right of return"" or even compensation for lost property, even though their claims were at least as strong as any Palestinian claims. This happened just a couple years before the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War and was the closest thing to a guiding precedent in dealing with the Arab refugees from that conflict. It's ridiculous to take international humanitarian law on refugee rights that only developed in subsequent decades and then apply it to the Palestinians *ex post facto*. If we did that, then by the same principle we'd be obligated to reverse the Trail of Tears and let the Cherokee reclaim their ancestral lands in Georgia due to legal developments that happened in the 20th century.

The fact is that under the international law and precedents that existed in 1949, Israel doesn't owe the Palestinian refugees anything. Whatever concessions Israel decides to make to them during peace negotiations now are voluntary gestures of goodwill.

&gt; Join me now in condemning the Nazi persecution of Jews, amongst many others, and accepting the lessons learned. That under international law a Palestinian refugee's right to return, 1967 borders and the handing back over of the illegally annexed West Jerusalem.

False,1426266257,0,0,t3_bmxas,LWRellim,1,t1_c0nlvht,,1,1270592242,economy,0,"&gt;I agree, but I must also add that the world prior to the industrial, medical and technological revolutions was a far different one than today (consumer driven economy, highly efficient farming and food surplus, average age into the 80's, communication technology, overwhelmingly powerful weapons, etc.). To say that the same level of taxation and government today would unequivocally be acceptable at the levels present prior to these things is not possible.

Actually, what has happened is that a lot of taxation has been *shifted*.

Whereas in previous era taxes were mainly on exports and imports (which were vastly lower in unit quantity) today taxes are mainly raised on domestic things.

And ridiculously, the vast majority of taxes are ""there and back"" in nature -- the local population is taxed by the Federal Government which then ""grants"" the money back to the States, which then ""distribute"" the money back down to the local county, and municipal levels.  

Meanwhile local *control* over the expenditures is also gone -- instead along with the stream of monies (which is really LOCAL money) comes a full laundry list of mandates and regulations.

**And some of this is highly relevant (for example) to your anger &amp; concerns over churches.**

What I mean is that for a lot of communities, their local public school was once a truly LOCAL thing -- it was not only created by, supported, controlled but responsive to local people; it was often a true ""community center"" around which a lot of activities focused (even those without children were often made to feel a part of the effort).

But, as local control has been reduced stage by stage -- and the schooling system has been used for a host of ""other"" purposes (many political in nature) -- it has also LOST it's ability to be a true community center (about the only remnant being the local ""sports"" teams, namely the football games and ""homecoming"" activities).

So where have people turned instead but the churches which have once again become much more than merely churches and instead (especially the trendy ""fundy-mega-churches"") are fulfilling a LOT of the roles of ""community centers"", integrating schools, day care, women's groups, men's groups, ""Book clubs"" and a host of other things (I know people who spend 4, 5, or even 6 out of 7 days/evenings engaged in one ""church"" activity or another -- most of them really *not* that religious in nature, although there is nearly always some ""purported"" religious aspect.)

Thing is that human beings have an inherent need and desire to be sociable -- and they prefer to CHOOSE who they are sociable with.

So when they had ""control"" over their local schools (and we are not merely taking about electing a slate of people to a board -- we're talking about a true community involvement here -- when schools were much smaller and more closely related to the neighborhood, rather than the massive consolidated mega-building major employers of the town); anyway back then people did not feel like a ""number"" they were INVOLVED and felt that there was much more of a give-and-take aspect.

But stage by stage, all of that has been taken away -- a combination of unions (which were at first merely local) and governments -- have bit by bit taken over the schooling system.  

So, instead of a local community center for the people to gather around, it has become a means of imposing federal and state ""political views"" down onto the population, indoctrinating the children (AND their families) into whatever the current governing regime believes is the most important ""fad"" of the day -- whether it is racial integration (let's buss the kids all over), environmental concerns (think Earth Day, ""Save the Forests"" etc), or national pride and GDP concerns (keeping up with the Soviets, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Europeans, ""No Child Left Behind"", etc.) -- or worst and most offensive of all, imposing the particular ""moral/ethical"" views of a subset of society onto everyone else (Planned Parenthood, AIDS, ""all sexual lifestyles are equal"" etc.)

Point is that the local community feels it has lost control of its center in its children and families -- that it has indeed been ""infiltrated"" with the equivalent of a Leninist/Stalinist ""five year plan"" mentality.

Hence the divisiveness of those things -- they do not spring up FROM the community (the local parents did not get together and by majority referendum decide that: ""Hey, we WANT our schools to focus on teaching our kids about sexuality."") -- but rather such things are ""imposed from above"" as if they were orders from a king with delusions of divine grandeur.

Is it really surprising then that there is a backlash?  Or that the backlash should become passionate, outraged or vociferous?

You yourself are testimony that the same is true from the opposite view -- you'll be DAMNED if you want to let Preacher X (from State A) dictate what your children should or should not learn in your local school in State Z.

Does that make sense?

I think that it does, and that the issue here is really NOT one of any particular issue/agenda, but rather -- at its root -- it is really about power and control; it is about the population feeling (validly so IMHO) it is being made increasingly *powerLESS* in the face of an ever-more-intrusive, and ever-less-accountable distant governing ""elite"" who have a threateningly unknown (unknowable, and therefore ""fear"" engendering) agenda.

Egads... I think the only people who WOULDN'T fear such a thing would be those who are in direct alignment with the (current) views being ""imposed"" -- and who are also foolish enough to think that they always WILL be in alignment with such things (if the Federal government has the ability to dictate the teaching that 2+2=5, what's to say that tomorrow an entirely different administration might not dictate something *else* that is even more inane or offensive).

&gt; Our ""forefathers"" who wrote the Dec of independence were not the same forefathers who wrote the constitution.

(Replying here because it's topical.)

Not only that, but “our forefathers” did not “acknowledge our creator, God, …”.  The Declaration, insofar as it can be said to be a religious document, must be considered a Deist document.  It allows the religiously minded to interpret the presence of God in the text, but it goes to great lengths not to directly reference God or to claim that (should one interpret that the document claims the existence of a supreme being) any such supernatural being has an intercessory will.

There are exactly three references which could be interpreted as reference to God in the Declaration.  The first two are in the first two paragraphs, and the last is in the final paragraph.

First: “…it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the *Laws of Nature* and of *Nature's* God entitle them, …”  This statement foreshadows the next paragraph, implying that “all men are created equal.”  Both of these statements imply that humans come from nature.  One would *never* write “Man's God,” as it would be considered diminutive and limiting.  Nature's God is literally the God of Nature.  The term “Nature's God” implies a hierarchy if taken literally.  If God created Nature, then Nature created Humans indiscriminately, equally.  In the way it makes rocks and trees of the same station in life, so too does Nature make people.  God is disconnected and unconcerned.  This is the closest the Declaration gets to Christianity's God.

Second: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…”.  If we combine this with the Deist statement in the first paragraph, the Creator is Nature.  But, honestly, “their Creator” could be mom and dad, for all this paragraph claims.  And, indeed, everything in this paragraph derives from the rights and purposes of people, not Gods.  Indeed, the statement takes on a certain beauty if one reads “their Creator” to be a reference to the common parents everyone has if you follow their ancestry back far enough.  Nonetheless, the tone and intent of the rest of the document must be used to interpret the meaning of this phrase, and there is absolutely zero appeal to any supernatural authority to justify the opinions and facts presented in the Declaration.  In fact, that would have defeated the purpose of the document because the *strongest* reason not to secede from the Crown was because God gave authority to the Crown, and therefore it was God's will that the Colonies live in submission to His will.  They made damned sure that any apparent appeals to God were derivations of philosophical principles which could stand on their own, quite apart from what any Church thought.  The declaration permitted only unreasonable and superstitious disagreement.

Finally, the last paragraph “appeal[s] to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intensions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies”.  Obviously, “in the Name” is a prepositional conjunction with “by Authority” for the noun “good People”.  It is explicitly not the verse “in the Name of” used in communion; chosen to contrast it with the lack of supernatural intent.  The “Supreme Judge of the world” is quite blatantly Posterity, the moral opinion of the peers and heirs of their age.  This is, after all, the primary audience the document was intended for.  At no point does this document take the tone of a prayer to God.  It's a “prayer” (more like a manifesto) to the people of the Colonies, the people of Europe, and their descendants.

That description doesn't cover Palestinian refugees at all. On the contrary, the Palestinian refugees fled the lands that became Israel precisely to avoid being ""in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals."" And even if the description did somehow cover them:

&gt; This provision shall in no way constitute an obstacle to the repatriation of protected persons, or to their return to their country of residence after the cessation of hostilities.

That clause wouldn't oblige Israel to accept anyone. It just says that the previously stated provisions wouldn't prohibit Israel from accepting them (assuming it was inclined to do so).

&gt; The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour, upon the close of hostilities or occupation, to ensure the return of all internees to their last place of residence, or to facilitate their repatriation.

Internees are people put in internment camps, like Dachau or the Gulags, for example. The Palestinians were never put in internment camps, so they're not covered under this provision.

&gt; You mean millions of Germans fled the Red Army knowing how they would be treated. 

Did you actually read that Wikipedia article on the mass expulsion of ethnic Germans? Many of them stayed through the war and were forcibly expelled afterward by the USSR, with express approval from the U.S. and UK. As for those that fled during the war in fear of the Red Army and were unable to return, isn't their case is even more comparable to that of the Palestinian refugees? After all, the latter fled mostly due to fear of the Israeli militias and were barred from returning. Therefore, my question still stands: why would the Palestinian refugees have a ""right of return"" but not the ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe?

&gt; As it stands Germany is united now and Germans, East or West, have a right to freedom of travel.

It's true that since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the eastward expansion of the European Union, the expellees and their descendants are free to visit their former homes. However, they have never been compensated for their confiscated property, and they have no right to citizenship in the countries from which they were expelled.

&gt;&gt; It's ridiculous to take international humanitarian law on refugee rights....

&gt; Laws protecting human rights are ridiculous?

I see, you took a sentence fragment out of context to make it look like I was denigrating human rights. Here, let me play the same stupid game with one of your sentences:

&gt; ...the Nazis were legitimate in what they did...

OMG, you think the Nazis acted legitimately!!!1!

In fact, what I said before was that it's ridiculous to take international refugee law as it exists today and apply it retroactively to situations that occurred before its creation. It's analogous to [ex post facto laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law), and it's just as problematic. If we agreed to do that, we'd have to accept the Cherokees' ""right of return"" and give Georgia back to them. 

My point is that Israel's obligations to the Palestinians who became refugees in 1947-49 are the same today as they were in the war's aftermath in 1949. And since the relevant precedent in 1949 was the treatment of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe, Israel doesn't have any such obligations.

&gt; Sorry my bad, you should have really noticed it was a typo on my part when I said that it was illegally annexed and called for '67 borders.

It's also a false argument to say you have to go with the EU because that's where the trade is.  There are many great things about the EU but there's some glaring irregularities and controversial aspects that rightly set the klaxons off.    If the plus side is trade then simply join the EEA like Norway.  The EU isn't just a trade agreement anymore.

To my mind, three major reasons why people are opposed to the EU: 

1.  They were promised a referendum on it and when it looked like the UK would pull an Ireland and vote 'no' the promise went away.  People in power decided not to represent but to dictate despite.  That'll always bring the draw bridge up with people.  If you want people on side then provide them with the choice in the first place.

2.  The rebate has all but gone but budget contributions are at £4 billion and rising, EU regulation costs £26 billion, the common fishery policy costs another $2.5 billion and the common agricultural policy costs another £16 billion.  The UK is a massive net contributor and yet the UK's trade deficit with the EU has grown.  Any funding from from the EU has to be met on a 1:1 basis but then, by that stage, where it is spent is already pretty much ear marked.  You can have the trade without all the waste.  Will Germany or Italy or France want to stop trading with the UK because they're only part of the EEA?  No, of course not.  It's the last thing they'd want in this climate but the UK would be in a much better place to redirect its resources and, at a time of such massive deficit, that's attractive.  

3.  There are 70 million people in the UK with 646 MPs.  There are 500 million people in the EU with 751 MPs.  That means the UK is 6x more representative than the EU is.  The EU is also far more costly per MP and much more difficult for respective countries to hold their MEPs accountable.  When one takes into account the complete diversity across Europe in nearly every regard, voting for anything either comes down to voting in blocs or strong arming.  They, the British people, might not understand the ins and outs of it but their instinct is right - it's far more aloof, less accountable and less representative of what is important to their locale. 

There are some good things about the EU; charters for fundamental and human rights springing to mind.

Leftist intellectualism, like the Frankfurter Schule, has been critical of communism (and capitalism) since the 60s. If anything leftist intellectuals have spread the idea that the capitalist system is inevitable and that communism will never work.

Europe stopped the spread of communism by making concessions to labour movements, thereby making them part of the capitalist system. This neutralized the threat and appeal of communist ideology entirely. It is the excesses of capitalism and the free market which were the greatest communist recruiter. Instead it's better to make everyone a shareholder, as it were.

The current crisis has been caused by the excesses of capitalism and right-wing deregulation. There's a reason that ford payed his workers a decent wage: it kept them happy, it kept them buying and it curbed the powers of unions. Nowadays companies have a short term view of things. A rational company looks at it's interests over 10 years. A rational executive wants to make money now, and move to a next better paying job. It would be good if the government protected companies and industry from their employees. The banks are a perfect example of employee greed harming company and industry interests.

In the words of the Spice Girls, 'stop right there'...

      ""The Convention shall also apply to all cases of
        partial or total occupation of the territory.""

Partial occupation of the Palestinian territory still buys it I'm afraid, for you.  Palestinians leaving is still an occupation. 

&gt;That clause wouldn't oblige Israel to accept anyone.

That there is a cessation of hostilities would mean that Israel would be obliged to not provide obstacle to their return.

&gt;Internees are people put in internment camps, like Dachau or the Gulags, for example. The Palestinians were never put in internment camps, so they're not covered under this provision.

Until that is Palestinians became part of an Israeli claimed East Jerusalem.  Now you have Palestinians blocked in.  If you think you don't want to call them Palestinian anymore then look to Israel's own Absentee Property Laws which actually defines Palestinian land and the Palestinian people.

&gt;Did you actually read that Wikipedia article on the mass expulsion of ethnic Germans? Many of them stayed through the war and were forcibly expelled afterward by the USSR, with express approval from the U.S. and UK.

You mean the US and the UK accepted them, although this moral equivalency argument doesn't wash and the Geneva conventions came into play afterwards.  Why you would want to dismiss the moral argument so readily as though what Germany or Russia did was 'okay because the law wasn't in place' is beyond me.  

You're actually in the process of defending Israeli hawks by arguing that the it's okay because it started before the lessons of World War 2 were put in place.  You're trying to defend Israel by washing the blood from the hands of Nazi attrocities.  Your granny would be rolling in her grave.

&gt;It's true that since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the eastward expansion of the European Union, the expellees and their descendants are free to visit their former homes. However, they have never been compensated for their confiscated property, and they have no right to citizenship in the countries from which they were expelled.

Ah compensation-schmonpensation, how do you go about compensating financially when it's fifty years on and little records exist, but as for right of return - I'm sorry they very much do have a freedom to travel and a right to settle down anywhere in the EU.  But I think you're getting away from yourself....

...are you now arguing that because you think they didn't get compensation and a plot of land back then because of a Cold War that somehow that means deed holding Palestinians shouldn't get one now?  Are you back to arguing that it was okay for Hitler and Stalin to do it and so Israel should be allowed now?

&gt;I see, you took a sentence fragment out of context to make it look like I was denigrating human rights. Here, let me play the same stupid game with one of your sentences:

Well feel free if you must but what I took was totally in context.  Here's what you said in its entirity:

             ""It's ridiculous to take international     
              humanitarian law on refugee rights
              that only developed in subsequent
              decades and then apply it to the
              Palestinians ex post facto."" 

Why is it ridiculous to hold a moral highground and to meet the highest standards of human rights as we see them today for people still alive at the time it first happened.  Don't forget we're dealing with Zionism here that claims some bizarro 2,000 year claim.  There's nothing controversial about 1967 borders and allowing those that still have the deeds to their properties, as were recognised by Israeli law, being allowed to return back to the communities in which they grew up.

I believe that today footballers have to play in different teams and different countries to truly be known as a great footballer. Clearly, there are exceptions with players like Rooney, Messi and Ronaldo, but football is a universal language with several dialects. If we take the Premier League as an example, many footballers (especially those outside of Europe) will not play in the Premier League because it is very demanding and fast-paced. In the same vein, English footballers rarely play outside of England because the game is very technical in places like Italy and Spain and most English players lack all but the basic technical skills. One of the few (debatable) great players, David Beckham achieved his status through playing in four different countries, with each country having nothing but praise for him. That has made his brand worldwide and his name known across the world, rather than just in the UK.

Lionel Messi is a great footballer, and could potentially be the best we've seen so far. However, he's tied to a team that is also the best in the world. As the first leg has shown there are those that will doubt him when he puts in a team effort, rather than an individual effort. Those doubters are often fuelled by the media, with the English media repeatedly comparing him to Rooney and Ronaldo and using some statistic that makes him out to be worse just to boost viewing figures for English football. The same is true for the Spanish media, wanting La Liga to be the biggest league in the world. 

There are those of us on here that will appreciate Messi for what he is, one of the most gifted footballers of his time.

as for things to do....

* get a lonelyplanet guide book. they're great. 

* take an overnight ferry from greece to italy. it's a nice change of pace from flights buses and trains. 

* spend at least 7 days in italy. its amazing. though the food is disappointing, with the exception of the gelato. mmmmm.

* book your hostels through hostelworld and really read the reviews before choosing. you can find great places to sleep in good locations, like this one called freestyle hostel in rome, that serves you a small breakfast (toast juice etc) AND a full dinner (pasta, salad and a glass of wine) all included in the 17 euro per night cost. this will save you a great deal of money. and eating at the dinner hour at the hostel is a bonding experience, you meet great people.

I have friends that were in an electronic dance band that was popular enough to tour north america and europe off and on for a few years, and they were using computers even back then, oh, early 90s. They used computer based MIDI sequencers and samplers in their live and studio work all the time. One of their computers was just a 286 running DOS on a green screen monitor used for recording, editing and tracking MIDI. The reason why is that most hardware based MIDI recorders were very limited as far as quantization, swing beats and step resolution. The program in question is called Voyetra Plus Gold, which was an excellent early computer based MIDI tracker/editor.

All that said, ""music on computers"" is kind of hard to define. Are you talking about purely software based computer music? Wave file editing only? MIDI? If you define it by MIDI and limited sampling/wave editing then it goes back to the Macintosh Classic and earlier. A lot of the MTV hits of the 80s used computers in the studio for the MIDI tracking.

It's even harder to define when you consider that a lot of the stand-alone hardware like samplers or MIDI controller/trackers were basically small, slow computers in a box.

And if you discount the whole ""popular music"" trope, people have been using computers for music for a long, long time. The THX sound was created on a special computer-synthesizer, for example, and then there was the ""demo scene"" of the 80s and 90s where they used MOD trackers long before MP3 encoding was even invented. People did some pretty impossible stuff with MOD trackers/players, more or less using audio ""sprites"" to compress audio files manually so they sounded like a lo-fi recording of an existing track, since MOD files were tiny compared to the MP3s that came later, so they could be shared over slow modems and BBS connections.

If you define ""using computers in music"" as ""using off-the-shelf software packages to synthesize, sequence, edit and create music on desktop computers running a standardized operating system"", then yeah, desktop computers didn't really start getting fast enough for that until the mid-90s, and even then it was pretty limited.",True,t1_c0nmvlb,False,,t5_2qxzy,,c0nmvlb

The point -- oh uber-educated one -- is that sometimes people will ""game"" the system, and very often people who make poor choices get rewarded, while those who work hard and make smart choices... tend to get handed the shaft. (And if you reward bad behavior and punish good behavior -- guess what you will get as a result?)

&gt;note I didn't say ALL of them were highly educated. But clearly MOST were. I was ALIVE for most of it. I also know quite a bit of history. 

I was referring quite specifically to the history of the personal computer industry.  And not only you, but countless billions of other people were ""alive"" during it -- the fact that you were walking and breathing doesn't serve as a basis of knowledge concerning that industry. (And from what you stated... you really *don't* have a clue.)

&gt;I also do quite a bit of work in the political arena. However, you go tell all those incumbents that lost to democrats in the last election about that 90% number, you betcha.

And what would you tell the Democrats that lost to Republicans in 2008?

Do you even really *know* how many incumbents ""lost"" their seats? Do you know how many didn't ""lose"" but simply retired and left the seat open for contention?

I think your spewing a tremendous amount of BS.

&gt;however, I do agree with what I think your assertion is there, that the system is weighted far to heavily towards the incumbent. Personally I am for a constitutional amendment for term limits, since that is the only way to do it across the board.

Highly doubtful that term limits would accomplish much more than chair-swapping -- and probably lead to an increase in the revolving doors from Congress to Lobbyist to Federal Appointees. (I'm not against term limits, I just don't think they would achieve the results people think they will.)

IMO the only way to eliminate the problems is twofold:

First to restore the Senate to being a chamber beholden to the states (repealing the 17th amendment); 

Second would be to dramatically INCREASE the number of congressmen to where it ought to be according to the design and provisions of the Constitution -- the number of representatives was originally intended to grow along with the population, and to maintain a relatively low population to representative ratio -- but as the population grew substantially in the late 19th century, Congress was reluctant to increase its size, delaying and limiting the increase repeatedly, culminating in a final ""power enhancing"" decision made back in 1929 to ""cap"" the number at 435, the same number that had been present back in 1911, a time when the population was well under 100 million (less than 1/3 of the current population).  At a *minimum* the number of representatives should be doubled or tripled, and ideally it should be many multiples of that. (The original ratio was on the order of 1 representative for every 30,000 people -- the current ratio is now at an average of over 700,000 people per representative. This has led it to become an ""elite"" club of professional career politicians rather than being the ""house of the people"" with a cross-section of short-term representative citizens that was intended to be.)

And the US is *atypical* and LESS democratic than many other western nations -- the major western European nations, while each having a fraction of the American population, ALL of them have LARGER numbers of representatives in their lower houses -- England (646 = 1:100,000), France (577 = 1:110,000) and Germany (622 = 1:130,000); and while Canada has fewer representatives (308) there population is 1/10th that of the US, which gives them a ratio of 1:~100,000 -- similar to the major European democracies.

And while the second part of that may *sound* as if it would be extremely expensive and unwieldy -- one has to realize that while Congress has limited the number of representatives, that does NOT mean they have limited the ""growth"" or expense of Congress. Not by a long shot, instead, the typical congressman now has a far larger ""staff"" of people than ever existed previously (claimed to be needed in part because they all have so many more constituents... well DUH) -- and in addition Congress has created multiple additional ""offices"" with attendant civil servants, and bureaucratic appointees, etc. who now do the vast majority of work that was previously expected of the representatives and their staffs.

Now let's go back to our sweet and balanced debate. FYI, I have been working for two years in Paris for a French/Egyptian company which had an office in Dubai. You speculated right about my not having talked much with women from Dubai. But as a man, I believe I got an even better source of information since I learnt a lot from my French/North-African Muslim female colleagues who talked numerous times woman-to-woman with Dubai women during missions over there or visits in Europe. Needless to say that I heard many very, very sad stories. But you know that.

Don't get me wrong. I am not here to make myself happy by pointing my finger at other cultures just for the sake of concealing the shortcomings of my own cultures. God knows that my two countries of origins are riddled with abominations, antisocial behaviors, atrocities, corruption, criminality, delinquency, depravity, illegality, immorality, malfeasance, misconducts, misdeed, villainies,...

The first time, you need to sit down in a quiet place when you have some time and concentrate on your emotions. there won't be anything at first, but relax and ask yourself how do you feel. REALLY feel. For me, I wasn't feeling anything because I couldn't handle how I really felt and I was protecting myself so i could just get through every day without breaking down. The first time I did this I was overwhelmed by how I felt inside.  I couldn't face it at first. I felt like I was just dipping my toe into this massive ocean of hurt and pain and fear and confusion and even just that glimpse of it was too much for me. I never knew it was there inside me and it was OVERWHELMING in the extreme. You have to start understanding these emotions and where they come from and why they are there and then you have to start dealing with that shit.  It's like the kid who sees dead people in the 6th Sense. At the beginning that shit is fucked up and scary, but then you learn that you just have to face it and figure out why they are there, identify the issues and then fix them.

This is the first step to getting you motivated to going back to school, but it's a long road.  The reason you are probably suppressing your feelings about school, is because in reality your experience at school is one that is painful and full of fear.  I suspect you're going to tell me that this isn't true and your just don't care, but take some time to think about it like I said and ask yourself honestly.  I don't care if you lie to me or not, but don't lie to yourself.  Then start asking yourself what is it about shool that hurts you. is it that you're not a good student? you don't have many friends? WHY? what is underlying that? In most cases it's a fear of failure, or a feeling that you aren't good enough and you never will be.  You have to realise that this feeling isn't true. Only a professional can really help you to untangle the mess of things in your past that have lead you to your false belief. Otherwise it will hold you back your entire life. 

I am telling you that YOU have the power to change things. This false belief is like a brick wall that you have been building for a long time and that is cutting you off from your life. No one else put it there, this isn't anyone else's fault. YOU ARE HOLDING YOURSELF BACK, but, you also have the power to tear it down. The thing is, on the other side of this wall is all the things in the world you have ever wanted. ANYTHING is possible when you tear down that wall.  You get to be 'THAT' guy. The one who isn't scared of failure. The one who realises when they apply themselves and put in effort good things really do happen. The guy who knows he has the power to make his life what he wants it to be, not the guy who just lets life happen to him, or even worse in your case, just gives up on life completely and doesn't even bother.  

I'm not telling you you can have your dreams, I'm telling your they aren't dreams, they can be your reality. You just have to lift up your mother fucking chin, face the scary, fucked up, seemingly impossible hurdles that appear in front of you, keep your goals in mind at all times, and tear into life like a wild dog tears into the carcass of an animal. I mean it. Get bloodied up. Nash your teeth. Howl and growl. Tear into that mother fucker. I promise you, what life can be is even better than you can imagine.  You'll stumble along the way and get scrapes and bruises and there will be times when you will want to give up, but don't you fucken dare. You can rest, take some time out from ripping into the carcass, but don't you ever give up on that shit. 

There was a time when I was in my late teens when i had dropped out of uni, i smoked an ounce of weed a week. I lived with some guys in their hallway. I didn't have didn't have enough money for food so I bought flour and cos we didn't pay our electricity bill on time we had to make do with cooking dough on the fireplace.  Most nights I would sit in the corner of the room, high as a kite, schizophrenic thoughts going through my head, burning myself with a lighter and crying.  My body now is covered with big burn marks. probably about 50 of them across my arms and legs. 
You know what I'm doing at the moment? I'm 26, I work in aerospace for Boeing and travel around the world in luxury and on their dime. I just started my own business too which looks like its going to be a huge success. I'm studying my masters on Boeing's dime as well, at the most prestigious university in the country and am at the top of my class. I also play in three bands, two of which have just released albums and one which I have just started. One of my bands in booked into play summer festivals across Europe for six weeks! Most importantly, I am surrounded by people I LOVE. Friends who take time to show me they care about me, and who i make sure to show them i care about them too.  Sometimes I feel down, but mostly because I never get a chance to unwind, 99% of the time I look at my life and cry because I can't believe how lucky I am.  I AM SO GRATEFUL that I have the life that I do. When i look back and think about the times I had tried to kill myself, I cringe and can not even fathom that I would do such a thing.  I AM THE LUCKIEST MOTHER FUCKING GUY ON THE PLANET!

I'm telling you this because I want you to know that it's possible. Everything you've ever wanted is there for the taking. It takes effort, but you have all the power you'll ever need. Get professional help, it helps. Also, lean on your friends for support. I dont' mean go and sulk to them about how shit your life is, but when you're feeling down give them a call and ask if you can come round and just hang out. Help them cook dinner, do their dishes, just ask if you can be around. It will make you feel normal and that's the first step. 99% of the success that I enjoy is due to the good graces of my friends. The friend who first asked me to play in her band because they needed someone to play keys. The friend who suggested we do our final university project together which resulted in me getting spotted and picked up by Boeing. The friend who said yes when i asked him if he wanted to start a business with me. When you're a good person, you attract other good people, and they are the biggest blessing you can imagine. 

Brick post. I've basically regurgitated everything I can think of that has helped me to get where I am now.  I hope it helps. PM me if you have any other questions or just want to chat. 

Best of luck!

In 2006, the courts decided that one woman's topless stroll on a hot day was not an ""indecent act"", which made it legal for women to go topless in public.  We had a very brief flurry of women giving it a try.  This including one particularly awesome Canada Day... it was crazy hot, sitting in a courtyard patio at a bar, drinking a beer, when the skies opened up and everyone stayed out to enjoy the rain.  Including a women's rugby team who decided to take their shirts off.  But that was kind of a perfect storm - the biggest party of the year, lots of beer, hot weather, sudden intense rain, immodest rugby players.  

Anyway, after that one summer, toplessness in Ontario went pretty much back to the way it was...  Occasionally a European tourist takes her top off at a public beach.  Only now she isn't asked to put her top back on.

I think it goes with the typical Canadian attitude - permissive, but generally modest.

In contrast with our European partners, hung parliaments are rare and so there is uncertainty with how the political parties would react and how effective they would be. We should note that Scotland has coped with this situation since their last election but there is no recent track record for how the Westminster parliament will manage.  The last few hung parliaments, the 70's between Labour and the Liberals, the 'Lib-Lab Pact' and John Major's deals with the Unionists in the 90's were difficult periods for govts on their last legs. 

The defining question for the next govt is the national deficit. It is discussed at length in a special edition of Moneybox, which can be found here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/moneybox/. It appears that Labour has consistently spent more during its period of office (1997 onwards) than it gained in tax revenue. This could have been tolerated by the markets for a long time but global moods and tastes have changed. Lenders to govts i.e. the Bond market, now wish to see govts start to pay off their debts before they get out of control. 

Lenders to a govt wish to know that it will be stable and that it is determined to repay back its borrowing. If a previously stable borrower becomes unstable, due to infighting, then the rates charged for lending the money will go up and that govt 's interest bills will grow higher and higher. 

The politics of the situation will depend on the personalities and how well they can work together. Clegg, Cameron, Osborne and Darling may seem reasonable and sensible. Unfortunately Mandelson and Brown's careers are strewn with feuds, fighting and a determination to rule. A Con-LibDem alliance may work well within Westminster but not so well with its national membership whereas a Lab-LibDem may suffer in Westminster but perhaps be more palatable to the membership of both parties.

So clearly the catholics have shifted incrementally and ever so slowly over many years closer to a protestant position on more minor issues. I don't think you would find many modern day catholics supporting the popes ability to declare holy war.

I think it is more dangerous to have a church with the only correct authoritative reading of the bible than have many groups with different readings of the bible, but hopefully willing to dialogue. Catholic unity comes at the expense of change being slow and the great authority being repeatedly abused. While the initial freeing of the bible into the vernacular lead to many excesses and incorrect readings of scripture it also made the world a far richer place theologically. Common people were able to discuss and dispute major issues of the Christian life and salvation, and how to work these things practically. Before all they could do was honor relics and hope the priest had things sorted, an eminently unbiblical approach.

NO universal health care
-yeah we are working on it buddy. Cowards like you were no help in pulling it off.

I’ve been to hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Singapore, and Thailand, and every one was better than the “good” hospital I used to go to back home. The waits were shorter, the facilities more comfortable, and the doctors just as good.
-Impressive data set. 1 american hospital. Very nice, we will make you a news pundit in no time.

Next we get a little rant about the meat industry

-Here is a little hint Go NORTH! Guess what I work in the dairy industry we aint doing anything here the Canadians arent doing. Or in fact the europeans arent doing. Except maybe stronger pastoralization laws and DA (trust me you dont want too know what that is if you are an animal lover) doesnt seem to be known in europe...yet.

GMO foods! Oh the horror the horror! Man was not meant to temper with such things it is the will of GOD that DNA not be changed.

Diabetes you say? Oh yes a major problem in this country. Of course when over 10% of your population is from ethnic groups that are more prone to it you should adjust your stats appropriately. Well, you dont have too you have a point to make so blame it on HFC.

Yeah we get a low vacation time. Sobbing....and crying. Go check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29

You dont get to be the Highest *country* on that list by vacationing. 

&gt;any real labor movement was brutally suppressed
Which is why there are no unions? Right?

It's important to remember that, whilst France is a western country, it is quite unique, and different in many ways to the UK or the USA. France has a very long history of cultural ""xenophobia"" - they reject imported English words ([particularly for new ideas and concepts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7540588/French-government-picks-new-words-to-replace-English.html)) in favour of creating their own, for instance. I believe there may even be a government department dedicated to pushing this agenda.

Since the Revolution France has had very strong employment laws, which would probably be incredible to an American. There is no such thing as ""at will"" employment, and it's practically impossible to fire someone from a job. Even if an employee in a fast food restaurant is caught red-handed with his fingers in the till, it will take a year of tribunals and appeals to finally dismiss him fully, and the employer is responsible for paying his wages throughout this process.

This has a massive follow-on effect on industry and the economy as a whole. Employers are just *very* cautious about taking on new staff - that becomes a very slow and protracted process. You are expected to pursue a career in the same field for life, and change jobs no more frequently than every 5 or 6 years. Here in the UK I can easily walk out on a job I hate and find something else (when the economy is ok) tomorrow, but that doesn't work in France - someone with spells of 6 months of employment at different jobs would be viewed very suspiciously.

Employers in France are very cautious, and even for a bar or waiting job, they would *much* rather employ Philippe who has worked at the same restaurant across town for the last 5 years than any unknown quantity. When you consider that a mistake could cost you - as the employer - a year's wages, this caution is quite understandable, but it also means that a white caucasian with a French name has much better job prospects than an immigrant.

*(Incidentally, this informs many other workplace practices, and the national culture of workplace lassitude. Why do you get shitty service in France? Because the employee can't be sacked. Why does the employer tolerate this? Because it's better than the hassle of finding  someone else for the job, and the risk of employing someone worse. The French have short working hours mandated by law, anyway, but you will* not *see office workers performing unpaid overtime.)*

The French have had some immigration (I'm not sure the figures) over the last half century from their North African colonies (which they pulled out of, with some obligation to locals) and from elsewhere. Their unemployment rate has been at around the 10% mark *for the last 5 years*, but further it is about 50% higher among arabs, muslims and other immigrants. These ""undesirables"" end up in ghetto tower-block housing complexes (""the projects"" in American terms?), and there are obviously problems associated with this concentration of no-hopers. In the north of Paris there were riots a couple of years ago, which were quite serious and reported internationally.

Your dismissive statement of ""threats to national security"" is quite uninformed.

My point was only that given the same wind condition it would always be preferable _not_ to build them in a colder climate because making the things work properly in a cold climate actually adds to both initial costs and maintenance costs in effect increasing energy costs. In the very north of Europe where icing is a problem it can significantly reduce the output of the turbines. Of cause there is not always icing, but if there is you can be 100% sure the reduced output comes right when you need increased output.

http://www.fmi.fi/research_meteorology/meteorology_9.html

This research paper from Finland illuminates the problem. As ice builds the effectiveness of the blades and thus the power output can be reduced from 20-50%. You can add heaters, use chemicals etc to hinder ice building but all of this adds costs. Depending on what type of system you use to neutralize the icing problem it will reduce your power output / revenues by 3-5%. The infrastructure to transport the electricity effectively is already in place with a lot lower costs to do the transportation than 3-5%.

In a competitive market a 3-5% difference in margin is the difference between being profitable or going broke.

Thus for any company who's considering building a wind farm it should always _try_ to find good spots without any potential icing problems. This would increase their profit margin and it would enable them to produce power when other competing companies may have reduced output because if icing.

Most U.S. states do not associate owners with vehicles, unlike most European countries.  Nonetheless, I believe that a vehicle's recorded presence in an area could potentially be used as evidence in a court case against its owner, however circumstantial.  I would, however, like to hear from a lawyer about this before either you or I comment further on it.

&gt; Its only use is to alert police if a vehicle owned by some person is where that person shouldn't be, giving the police the opportunity to investigate why that car is where the owner shouldn't be.

See below.

&gt; which already sometimes does happen with traffic light cameras does it not?

Incidentally, and purely for the purpose of issuing red light (and sometimes speeding) tickets.  Red light cameras do not record all cars passing an intersection (unless I am missing something).  This is something done in, for example, Switzerland, during police sweeps for stolen cars -- and something I object to enormously, even though it is not contrary to the Swiss constitution.  Unfortunately.

&gt; Plus, it's not like these are going to be hidden cameras secretly filming people. They will be on clearly marked law enforcement vehicles, much like the surveillance cameras in NYC are on marked little containers.

Yup, and I take very serious issue with this.  Law enforcement != blanket surveillance, marked or not.  To take this to its nonsensical extreme, it is analogous to equipping every citizen with GPS transponders.  Knowing who is doing what, outside of a specific, limited-scope investigation (e.g. looking for a suspect -- which is why numerous U.S. court cases tightly regulate traffic stops), is not in the purview of government.

While yes, a camera should be marked (I believe in the E.U. there is a specific directive that requires this), surveillance only has a place in specific, as-needed situations (e.g. to safeguard a critical piece of property, or to protect individuals subject by the nature of their work from violence, that kind of thing.)",True,t1_c0nnhnq,False,,t5_2qh61,,c0nnhnq

Many of the birth defects described by the media seem to fit the description of a neural tube defect (NTD). A mountain of peer-reviewed, non-DOD-sponsored, scientific studies has found a pretty solid contributing factor to NTDs -- folic acid/vitamin B12 deficiency.

Hum Genet. 1984;68(2):97-103. Epidemiology of neural tube defects in Germany.

Koch M, Fuhrmann W.

A survey is made of the epidemiologic studies of neural tube defects (NTD) in Germany. A temporary increase is noted in the prevalence of NTD at birth for the time during and shortly after the Second World War, followed by a downward trend thereafter. Thus an earlier observation of Lenz (1965) could be confirmed. Falling rates of NTD were also reported from various other countries in recent years. No convincing etiological explanation is available so far. The current prevalence of NTD at birth can be estimated for Germany to be about 1.0-1.5 per thousand newborns with about an even distribution to anencephalus and spina bifida. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wynn A, Wynn M.

PIP: The first dramatic effect of food shortage is upon fertility. The authors attribute the marked decline in fertility in Dresden following the second world war to a sudden reduction in food supplies from the formerly occupied territories following the fall of the German armies. There were also epidemics of low birth weight, miscarriage, and congenital malformations. The epidemic of low birth weight in Leipzig immediately after the war is illustrated, with note made of the existence of similar epidemics in all European cities affected by food shortages. Epidemics of miscarriage contributed to the decline of fertility wherever there was a food shortage. The effects of food shortage upon hormone status, how food shortage increases the risk of neural tube defects and other congenital malformations, and the long-term consequences of poor maternal nutrition are considered.

Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the sex distribution of deaths from spina bifida in birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to severe periconceptional famine. For this purpose, we compared the risk of deaths from spina bifida between birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1946. In males, the relative risk of death from spina bifida was 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-6.01]. In females, the relative risk for spina bifida was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.14-2.37). The sex ratio (male:female) for deaths from spina bifida in the exposed birth cohort was 2.74; a female predominance was not seen in any other birth cohort. Deaths from anencephaly and other central nervous system disorders did not exhibit this male predominance in the exposed birth cohort. These findings indicate that severe periconceptional nutrient deficiency may have a greater effect on the occurrence of spina bifida in males vs females. Other potential explanations include sex-specific effects of prenatal famine on prenatal or postnatal survival rates of cases.

METHODS: All preterm and full term live and stillborn babies delivered at Al-Ramadi Maternity and Children's Hospital, Al-Anbar Governorate, Iraq, from the 1st of November 2007 to the 1st of November 2008 were examined for gender, gestational age, NTDs, and associated congenital malformations. Mother's data included age, parity, consanguinity, education, antenatal care, previous medical illnesses, other NTDs history, folic acid supplementation, and diagnostic ultrasound. Incidence was calculated per 1000 births. RESULTS: During the study, 33 infants were delivered with NTDs, giving an incidence of 3.3/1000 births. Most were of myelomeningocele and anencephaly types, and thoracolumbar and lumbosacral sites. Two-thirds of the cases found were from consanguineous marriage, 12 NTD's mothers took folic acid during their pregnancy, while none of them received the drug during the periconceptional period. Three mothers had another NTD affected babies before, and mothers 25-34 years old produced most of the NTD deliveries than any other age groups. CONCLUSION: The NTDs incidence is still high compared with developed, and some developing countries. High consanguinity marriage and 100% lack of periconceptional folic acid intake needs further study considerations to reduce such morbid and mortal anomalies.

It was that moment which led the leadership of the country to decide to try to become a world power, which led to the horrible invasions of the 1800s, their role in WWI(which really just turned out to be a convenient excuse for Japan to conquer a bunch of new land), eventually leading to their role in WWII as pressure was growing for the new world power to stop its growth.

A quick read on [the surrender of Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_japan) is a damn good start.

First off, without the bombs, Japan would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER have even considered surrendering. They had NEVER lost a war or even been invaded in the past 2000 YEARS and their culture absolutely forbid it. They were absolutely prepared to kill every citizen necessary to delay the end of the war. On top of that, they were planning suicide and balloon attacks on west coast cities loaded with various plagues to infect the general US population. Without bombing actual cities, the people of Japan would never have allowed their country to surrender. Even after the bombings, top military leaders tried to take control to continue the war. Bombing cities gave the emperor the only possible excuse to surrender in order to prevent further Japanese death.

From the US side, they were also trying to end the war before the USSR got involved and ""earned rights"" to Japanese territory, à la half of Germany and all of Eastern Europe (and trust me, Soviet control killed literally MILLIONS more than the two bombs did). They had just weeks to do this and even after the first bomb in Hiroshima Japan did not consider surrender.

Also remember that both nations had imposed a national draft, so even battles between ""soldiers"" really meant citizens (young boys, in the case of japan) forced to hold guns.

The 2 bombs together killed an estimated 150 - 250,000 people. The holocaust killed 11-17 million. Biggest war crimes, my ass.",True,t1_c0nnt1d,False,,t5_2cneq,,c0nnt1d

And mainly U.S. and Western Europe. 1) I imagine the movie piracy issue mirrors music piracy. There are plenty of studies that show music pirates are the biggest spenders on music. I think this is probably similar with the movie industry, the only difference being that the movie industry has rental/streaming services as an alternative to purchasing a copy.

2) Also, anecdotally, I think people here forget that they a relatively small minority of tech savvy early adopters. My gf is 20 and couldn't figure out how to pirate a movie if her life depended on it. Neither can any of her friends. My parents aren't going around downloading movies. No one I work with downloads movies ... one very unsavvy woman buys pirated hardcopies on occasion, but she also sees tons of movies in the theatre.

Also, look at the big box stores like Walmart and Target, which I happen to know are the major sources of sales for DVDs. They lowered their DVD prices to be a loss leader to get people in the store because they had studies that showed those that bought DVDs ended up with a larger purchase in the store overall. Now new releases are $9.99 - $14.99. These stores in turn put pressure on the studios to lower their wholesale price, so there's some lost margin there. So the studios tried to come out with Blu-ray and sell it for $30. People just don't see the value.

As far as Asia, yes piracy seems to be having a real impact, but I don't really know enough about it in that part of the world.

Edit: Also, look at what the studios are really saying and doing, instead of the MPAA.

1.  I don't deny that Native Americans have a culture.
2.  I don't deny that African Americans have a culture.

But here is the rub, whereas African American culture has become part of the mix and can be recognised as such by outsiders, (I am English by the way). Native American culture has not been adopted by mainstream US.  Sure it exists, but how many non-Native Americans would regard it as their own ?

To try and put another perspective on it.  Consider Gypsies in the UK.
They have a culture, they live in the UK.  But their culture is not adopted by the rest of the UK, we just don't practice it, it is not relevant to us.
Contrast that with say West Indian, Indian or Chinese culture, all of them have parts that have been adopted by the mainstream culture in the UK.  In other words, we British have chosen (because we liked them) to add elements of these cultures to our own to make the the culture of the UK what it is today.

In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that about 1.0 percent of the U.S. population was of American Indian or Alaska Native descent.
Maybe you call 1% a large percentage of a population, I don't think many would.

It is not only Europeans who have difficulties with indigenous people.
Take a look at China to see how the dominant Han Chinese deal with them, or the way India deals with the Hill tribes or those on the Andaman islands, or the way the Zulus dealt with the bushmen. 

Finally, not everything is to be taken deadly seriously.  America's ""lack of culture"" is a common enough comment, it probably derives from the crassness that even non-Native-Americans accept about elements of non-Native-American US culture.
And some times a funny comment provokes an even funnier response.

First, at the end of Clinton's term, only about 9 years ago, the US was running a surplus fast enough that the bond market was afraid that too soon there would be no more T-bills to buy.  Yes, W blew it, wiped out the surplus, and ran a deficit.  But he ran a deficit of about 3% of GDP which is at the upper end of what is considered *sustainable*.  It was dumb, and I hated it, but it didn't ruin, or threaten to ruin, the country.

Second, look at the national debt as a fraction of GDP at the end of WWII.  We paid it off quickly.  The national debt is comparatively much smaller now.  We can pay it off, also.

For the $60 trillion and related numbers, the people who scream this are just lying with nonsense accounting.  They imagine that the US is like a company that is obligated to pay out $60 trillion over the next so many decades.  So, by standard accounting, would have to show the $60 trillion as a long term *liability* on the balance sheet.   Then the company would see if it had a way to *fund* that liability.  If not, then the company would say that they had a $60 trillion *unfunded liability*, and that would be **bad**.  We would say that the company was essentially worthless.

Actually the $60 trillion might be just the net present value calculated with some assumed interest rate.  Whatever.  

But this use of accounting is just lying with accounting.  The reason is, the US has an *asset*, a way to *fund* the *liability*,
an *asset* no company could count on their balance sheet.

Exercise:  Guess what that *asset* is!

Hint:  Think babies.  While making them is fun, having them is just **crucial** to your Social Security and Medicare.

Solution:  Right:  Your retirement will be paid for by earnings of people working while you are retired, people who are babies, or not yet born, or in foreign countries and not yet in the US.  That's the *asset* that *funds* the $60 trillion *liability*.  

Uh, don't hold your breath waiting for the US to go broke due to either the current national debt, the current deficit, or the $60 trillion unfunded Social Security and Medicare liability.

That said, very much the US needs to get back to what Clinton did.  We shouldn't go back yet because that would cause more unemployment.  Really, what's just **crucial** is just what the law says that the Fed should do:  Maximize economic growth with only very low inflation.  Well, can't maximize economic growth with a huge fraction of the labor force standing around looking for work.  So, for economic growth, have to **get people back to work**.  

How to do that?  Have the Fed loan money to the banks.  Then the banks can loan money to businesses.  

Does this work?  Will vodka make a party come alive?  

As the party comes alive, and it very much **will** with so much money from the Fed, the Fed will just pull the money back to let the economy continue to grow **with** low inflation.  And if it works as intended, and we have no more wars, etc., and no other country does anything as destructive as the Congressional Boyz Club, etc., then we should be back to where Clinton was.

Yes, this nice future there is a **huge** threat:  The Chosen One, Blessed of Oprah, Praise to Allah, God Willing, It Is Written, who hates the US, especially hates business, who **really** hates people successful in business, who hates white people, who hates the US Supreme Court, who hates the US Constitution, who is a closet Muslim who bows to the King of Saudi Arabia, who wants to disarm the US, who wants to ""bankrupt"" the US coal fired electric utility indusry, who wants to protect and release Muslim terrorists who have attacked the US, who wants to take over the US health care system, the US electric utility industry, the Internet, and the US education system, from birth thourgh college through mid-career education, who wants to raise taxes to European levels and punish rich people and business by taxing to confiscate money, who wants to accumulate money and power in DC and use it to bring Chicago style machine politics to all the US, e.g., by getting power by buying votes, who wants to turn the US into something like Denmark and run it like Daly ran Chicago.

Pay attention to the real threats.

I don't know what country you're in, I'm talking about America here, but the fact is that the bacon you buy in grocery stores DOES get shipped to a distributor where it is cured for days, sometimes even weeks or months. I've worked around this stuff for many years, I'd hope I know what I'm talking about.

I also disagree, bacon from pig to frying pan with no preparation is utterly shitty if you're getting it from the part that America does. I know Europe gets it from the sides where we get our loins and that bacon is alright with less preparation.

If you're referring to American bacon, you're an idiot. Bacon off the flank tastes like nothing raw.

In the 80's the US had need of a surveillance overflight of Syria and no time to retask a satellite.  An SR-71 was dispatched from Mildenhall, England, flying south along the  coast of Portugal and up the Med. The long route was due to the refusal of the French government to overfly their airspace. The overflight went well, and they began the return leg.  Around Sicily, at ~ 87,000(?) flying supersonic, a warning light went off.  They dropped speed and altitude to 12,000 and made the decision to overfly France because the of the emergency. Within minutes of being in French airspace, a Mirage III was a few feet off their wing, demanding a clearance number. They tried to explain their emergency to no avail. The warning light cleared and they went full throttle.

They crossed the English Channel minutes later. The SR-71 pilot said he'd love to have seen the look on the Mirage's pilot.

African slaves weren't beat to death and raped on a whim, they had rights and especially if they were war captives were eventually allowed to become citizens of what ever nation they were enslaved to, they could hold property as well.

I'm having trouble conceiving of your gap in imagination.  ...It would look, to some similarity in form, like it has looked like all the times the state has been abolished before.  It's not a difficult image to conjure -- the moment where, for example, the President of Spain tried to place a call outside his office and no one picked up.

The city halls, factories and schools are occupied.  The police stations burnt down.  People meet in assemblies to talk and libertarian attitudes come to the fore.

That's like what I would consider one of the LEAST likely to succeed of the many approaches possible.  And yet with a little effort it came so damn close to fruition that the EU practically shat itself.

What would abolishing the state look like?  Well any of the multitude of goddamn ways we can make it impossible for the state to conduct business.  The zapatistas also took a stupid approach and yet they managed to carve out a pretty damn big stateless zone.

Good lord.  Toyota is a brand and particular structure of social organization.  The people and material goods are irrelevant.  If the workers walk into work one day and set up assemblies in their own factories to collaborate/sell/exchange with other factories that's not Toyota by any stretch of the imagination.


&gt; But really, what's the difference between changing and abolishing? At some point, you will have changed it so much that it won't be the same thing anymore.

Chomsky is so beholden to his bourgeois liberal audience that he constantly sucks up to their notions of social ""action.""  'If only we could rally the populace to vote for some particularly *extreme* social dem shit.'

How do you suppose the world will establish and enforce global limits on CO2 emission?  

Who will make sure that China and Brazil and keeping to their committments?  Will the system rely on a self-policed approach?  Ya  think that'll work?  Where is the IAEA of CO2?  It will need to be created, if the a reduction in CO2 globally is to be achieved.  And who will pay for all of that? 

If you suggest to me that national CO2 emission limits will be based on voluntary compliance, then you and I are truly not operating on the same rational plane. 

This is what I mean - scientists can sit in their labs and imagine a global CO2 limit, but what they fail to point out is the policy implications, the tax and government implications of that seemingly simple idea.

&gt; Somewhere along the way you've been convinced that it's all a big sham to compromise ""personal and national liberty.""

Yes, I think the science is flimsy.  But I wouldn't say it is a conspiracy to limit liberty.  I know that the proposals would limit liberty. Sometimes limiting individual liberty is warranted for the greater good.  Often not.  But I don't think sloppy science was pursued *primarily* in order to limit liberty.  I think sloppy science happens. I think the bureaucrats have found willing allies in sky-is-falling climate scientists.  And together they are urging what is nothing less than a revolutionary approach to international relationships. 

The theory of AGW is not well founded, in my estimation, and the rush to solution is rash, and not based in reality.  The threat to liberty is broad and deeply seated.   It is moving too quickly, a sky-is-falling, we-must-act-now, damn-the-consequences attitude.  That will get us running straight into walls.  No one has thought this through. 

regarding CO2 as pollution - you describe it as *toxic*.  But the current levels of CO2, or even the worst-case projected levels of doomsday CO2 - are toxic to no organisms.  **None.** It is not DDT.  It is not PCBs.  It is not toxic.  But you didn't assert that CO2 was toxic to a particular organism, did you?  You used the phrase ""toxic to the ecosystem"".  And that is a complete fabrication.  An invented phrase with no real meaning.  The ecosystem changes.  It doesn't ""die"".  With  more CO2, some organisms thrive, some do not.  Change happens.  Are we going to assert that all change is death?  Or all change is evidence of toxicity?   As CO2 levels change over time, are we going to outlaw *change* itself?  It's preposterous.   It's ridiculous thinking. 

The regulations proposed go *further*.  After classifying CO2 as a ""toxin"", an action that has no basis in science, the proposed regulations will establish limits on atmospheric CO2.  But more! They also have, as their goal, establishment of legal limits of atmospheric *temperatures*.   This is explicitly stated in the IPCC AR4, and that ridiculous [goal was adopted by the climate change panel in the UN](http://europa-eu-un.org/articles/en/article_6666_en.htm).  Do you understand that?  They want to make a law, *about what temperature it can be*.  As we know there is no lever accessible to humanity that provides a direct control over temperature.  The variables are immense.   The feedback in the system is not understood.  But scientists and bureaucrats want to make a law.  

And .. if the temperature doesn't meet that legal limit, then... what?  What will be possible under the law?  I don't know, but it seems like a blank check.  Trade sanctions?  War over CO2 emission?   National governments outlawing cars?  Who knows?   No one is saying.   Either the proposed global law is a license to do *anything* or it has no teeth at all and is complete UN baloney; in either case it is bad policy.

Therefore, the features available for testing will be somewhat limited, and the game itself will be available for only abbreviated periods of play. Bearing that in mind, the Alpha Test will be conducted in line with the following:

- Test periods will take place three days per week.
- Each test day, the game server will be available during three 4-hour windows corresponding to core playing times in Japan, North America, and Europe
- Testing under the above two conditions will be conducted for a period of several weeks.
- To adjust and observe various setting and balance issues, all character data may be deleted at times to allow for testing with newly created characters.

While we apologize for the relatively short amount of gameplay this permits, we feel that such scheduling is in the best interest of effective testing. We also plan to issue weekly announcements containing such information as areas or features of the game about which we would particularly like to receive tester feedback. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Next, we would like to specifyenumerate some of the ways in which the FINAL FANTASY XIV Alpha Version will differ from the commercial release.

- Physical Levels and Skill Ranks
During the Alpha Test, both physical levels and skill ranks will be capped at a maximum of 20. Presently, these limits are planned to be raised to at least 50 for the commercial release of FINAL FANTASY XIV.

- Areas
Only one of the three starting cities, Limsa Lominsa, and its immediate surroundings will be available to testers. This is roughly equivalent to 20% of the total game area planned for the initial commercial release.

- Enemies and Guildleves
Only a small number of low-level enemies will be used in the alpha version. Likewise, only select levequests with relatively simple objectives and conditions will be included as well.

In addition, quests available will come from the first three portions of the Limsa Lominsa storyline only. These comprise a mere fraction of the epic series of quests which are still in being readied for release.

Throughout the Alpha Test phase, there will no doubt be several aspects of gameplay which seem unclear or perhaps unfinished. We will notify all testers in the near future concerning features of the game which are still under development or absent from the alpha version.

I asked you where in any of my post did i say anything remotely resembling this:

&gt;and make wild accusations about how all the white pricks here hate the darkies.

Nowhere, I also find it interesting/funny that you'd use a term like darky.  Again I've already said the numbers were inflated, I'd miss read and I was using hyperbole, badly.  Why do you keep asking about that number.  finally I never said said I'd read ""so many book and links"" as you sarcastically stated here:

&gt;since you read so many links and books on this subject.

However I can give you some historical texts if you like to look them up read Ibn Battuta's  ( the renowned, traveler, scholar  geographer and historian ) Travels in Asia and Africa; See Daniel Chu and Elliott Skinner's A Glorious Age in Africa

You might find this interesting it's an excerpt from an essay written by Thomas Paine ( do you know who that is?) entitled African Slavery in America
&gt;To Americans:
That some desperate wretches should be willing to steal and enslave men by violence and murder for gain, is rather lamentable than strange. But that many civilized, nay, Christianized people should approve, and be concerned in the savage practice, is surprising; and still persist, though it has been so often proved contrary to the light of nature, to every
principle of Justice and Humanity, and even good policy, by a succession of eminent men, and several late publications...
The Managers the Trade themselves, and others testify, that **many of these African nations inhabit fertile countries, are industrious farmers, enjoy plenty, and lived quietly, averse to war, before the Europeans debauched them with liquors, and bribing them against one another; and that these inoffensive people are brought into slavery, by stealing them, tempting Kings to sell subjects, which they can have no right to do, and hiring one tribe to war against another, in order to catch prisoners.** By such wicked and inhuman ways the English are said to enslave towards one hundred thousand yearly; of which thirty thousand are supposed to die by barbarous treatment in the first year; besides all that are slain in the
unnatural ways excited to take them. So much innocent blood have the managers and supporters of this inhuman trade to answer for to the common Lord of all!
Many of these were not prisoners of war, and redeemed from savage conquerors, as some plead; and they who were such prisoners, the English, who promote the war for that very end, are the guilty authors of their being so; and if they were redeemed, as is alleged, they would owe nothing to the redeemer but what he paid for them.

A few more historical references then I've gotta dash, August 8th 1444 one of the first cargoes of Africans was displayed in an open field in the Algrave region of Portugal; it's funny because the chronicler Duarte Barbossa wrote (of the African city-state of Kilwa in approx 1500) ""it has many handsome houses of stone and mortar, with many windows such as our own houses have, and very well arranged streets...with a good harbor and many great ships""  interesting that all of this had to be wiped out to justify the slave trade. also read by Gomes Eannes de Zurara the Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.  In the 13th and 14th centuries it was gold from the Empire of Mali  that under girded the world's economic system after the collapse of the western roman Empire.

In this instance, the pilots reasonably believe the people are hostiles and they've properly engaged in a conflict. It looks like an RPG, they look like guns. It is unfortunate these were innocent people, but a reasonable person in their position, with their knowledge, and with their expertise and experience can make the same conclusions.

It wasn't here, wasn't my hometown, and not my loved ones. I can't empathize because I don't know what it is like. I can sympathize with a soldier and the position he is put in. I can also sympathize with the families when a mistake like this happens. 

You example isn't relevant. The defense for superior orders was used almost carte blanche on the crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace charges. Nazi war officials were more likely to accept culpability for their failures in their treatment of POWs because even the Nazi German Field Manual had the standards governing war. The crimes against humanity were entirely created at the time of the trial, and everyone pointed their fingers up because those found liable were likely to be found guilty and executed for their heinous acts.

Simply pointing out ""oh yeah, they used defense of superior orders"" doesn't work when you drag it out of context. No one in the SS wanted to accept responsibility for the Nazi Death Camps. Even then, the Nazis tended to treat Western European POWs significantly different than the Soviet POWs that were deemed racially inferior and an obstacle to lebensraum, and treated them the same as the Jews in Ghettos and Concentration Camps.

Again, what I'm stating is that situations are significantly different. You've done nothing but draw false parallels for the sake of argument due to a legal argument to be made at ""trial."" Your unreasonableness to look at the difference of events is just as problematic.

What is probably a BETTER parallel to be making is what happened in Vietnam. A massacre at Mi Lai versus something like this. What did the soliders/pilots know, when did they know it, what could they have been reasonably expected to know, etc. Look at the situation from the pilots view, don't read the words coming out of their mouth and discount the source, and then come back and tell me it is a war crime. I don't think it is. It's sad. It is a mistake. It is a grave mistake. 

I'm honestly shocked at the number of people and the anger about this video when you compare it to known instances when American soldiers walked into a home, raped the daughters, and then killed the parents. I think the anger is more about the DoD and the USFG trying to prevent this video from coming to light, and they have added the anger to the event and unfairly color the situation as something that it not was.

The majority culture could not change or persuade them. They were a permanent thorn in the side of the prevailing religion.

And those who were successful, those who tried to assimilate, were hated even more, as outsiders pretending to belong, or as compromisers who were betraying their own customs.

But all of this wasn't ""during WW2"". It was before, and long before, for hundreds of years before WW2. This was the ""Jewish problem"" of which Hitler spoke. Those who tried to belong threatened the purity of the ayran race, whatever that was. Those who refused to belong polluted the nation. 

The Nazis began their anti-Jewish campaign well before WW2 started--in the 1930s, with the Nuremburg laws that prohibited Jews from being German citizens (or marrying German citizens), from holding professional jobs, from sitting in public parks, even from owning pets.

In places where matters of health security seem uncertain and unreliable, people are more vulnerable to costly health-related scams, plus will often experiment with even the riskiest of remedies (and so possibly worsen their conditions, or even die).

If you look at minutes of use, the average American uses their cell phone four times as much—four times as much—as the average European.

What I've heard about Europe is people tend to text more than talk. They also have predefined protocols for communicating without talking. Like you call and let it ring once then immediately hang up. That means you're outside waiting.

The American market is a chatterbox. Older folks tend to prefer to ""call"" than to text and Verizon and friends decided to jack up the rates on texting to encourage voice calls instead. I mean, you can't get a cell phone plan in the States without paying for some amount of minutes. Only recently, ""pay as you go"" plans have started to hit the market. Before that you were stuck with a monthly voice plan where the bare minimum number of minutes seemed to actually target the average. 

But of course you prepaid for those minutes up front, and next month they basically disappear so you might as well use them anyway... In early 2000 this was common practice. Towards the end of the month you'd have random people calling each other because they were trying to expend their monthly minutes.

These days though, the younger generation will prefer texts to voice. I seem to have much better conversations with younger people (early twenties and younger) over text than I do on the phone or even in person. And it is starting to creep into the older folks. I can reasonably expect anyone in the mid-thirties and younger to have texting turned on and accept unlimited texts.


Personally, if I could get a phone *without* a voice plan, I'd do so. I'd then use VOIP to handle those pesky voice mails and phone conversations.

I'm torn as to whether Fergie was bluffing about Rooney's injury or whether he took a massive risk by playing an injured player. Still, his mere presence seemed to be a lift.

Despite the red card Rafael was brilliant, consistently stopping Ribery and occasionally making some decent runs himself, although I really wish he would've passed to Rooney instead of try a shot himself. The red card was disappointing, but thoroughly deserved as he got too carried away and his inexperience showed.

Michael Carrick had an absolutely terrible game today. Despite what the commentators said he didn't need to stop and more than likely could have cleared the ball more authoritatively. He consistently gave the ball away and failed to stop the Bayern players. I've always been a supporter of Carrick but he's really starting to show that he might not be cut out for the Champions League.

Robben's performance was a joy to behold and his goal was unstoppable, and more often than not Ribery was able to get the better of the United back three/four. As someone who likes Man Utd it's a shame to see them and the rest of the English squads leave the tournament at this stage, but I'm happy to see two match-up's that could be extremely interesting for the game in Europe.

These all used to be actually much closer to the actual pronunciation. 'Ough' was pronounced ookh, where kh is that throaty Scottish loch sound. Thus ""cough"" was actually onomatopoeic.

Same with silent e. All the weird spellings of words from Old English actually were pronounced that way at the time the spellings were invented. They were never updated, which is something every other European language did during the last hundred years.

Caesar is weird. However, the way it is transformed is **totally in step** with how latin words are brought into english. Hence circumference, which should have a hard c at the beginning, and plenty more. If you know those rules, and you know latin spelling, and you know a word's from Latin, you can spell it correctly.

&gt;A common property of vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing, such as the addition of flavourants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterwards, where the distilled vodka is filtered through charcoal and other media. This is because under U.S. and European law vodka must not have any distinctive aroma, character, colour or flavour. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavours and characteristics of their products.

&gt;The ""stillmaster"" is the person in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration. When done correctly, much of the ""fore-shots"" and ""heads"" and the ""tails"" separated in distillation process are discarded. These portions of the distillate contain flavour compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that alter the clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste of the vodka is improved and its clarity is enhanced. In some distilled liquors such as rum and baijiu, some of the heads and tails are not removed in order to give the liquor its unique flavour and mouth-feel.

&gt;Repeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95-96% ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling. This level of distillation is what truly separates a rye-based vodka (for example) from a rye whisky; while the whisky is generally only distilled down to its final alcohol content, vodka is distilled until it is almost totally pure alcohol and then cut with water to give it its final alcohol content and unique flavour, depending on the source of the water.

Objects are morally neutral. Firearms are only as dangerous as the person wielding it. You can talk about acquisition and ""how easy"" it is to acquire a firearm, but in the end, all the laws and regulations won't do shit if there is a motivated-enough individual willing to commit murder upon another individual.

I have also worked extensively with European ISPs both as connected to our backbones and where we had picked up assets in areas outside the US.

Long haul costs in the US tend to be around the same cost and lower then most of Asia and Europe (~$10-$12 per Megabit per month when bought in chunks of 100Mbit or larger. Note this is what your ISP pays). 

This is where the bulk of that 1,300 to 80 comparison goes away.

Yes the US has a LOT more open land then most of Asia and Europe. But it is meaningless. Our long haul costs are a trivial part of the cost of providing service to a home consumer.

For home consumers the costs are almost all within the last mile. And that is where you need to compare population densities for similar sized cities rather then the average of the countries.

Once you do that you see the density drop from 16.25 to 1 (Your 1,300 to 80 example) to something closer to 1.5 to 1.

Sure they are still more dense, but not at such a level that it should be creating the massively different prices and speeds.",True,t1_c0noomq,False,,t5_2qh16,,c0noomq
