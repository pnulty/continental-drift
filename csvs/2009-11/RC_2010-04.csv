What does the Tea Party stand for? Primarily Tea Party members want a better economy and more jobs, but they also want all kinds of other things that may or may not have special interests behind them. Some may contradict each other and some may be impossible to implement without starting the country over.

My idea for starting the country over is to try to split it into hundreds of smaller countries or something... This way each small country could better tend to the people in it and people could know each other and trust each other and better prioritize policies... This would also make people more reliant on people from other ""countries"" so there was a greater sense of working with people from different cultures and stuff... :-)

Europe is a template for that, but Europe has got some big countries that could be split into smaller ones for instance. :-)

\[Citation needed\]. The Amish don't use any government services; are you claiming they're an illegal group? (Interestingly enough, they *do* pay taxes - though this doesn't discount the existence of groups who don't).

&gt;Nope. They still tax you there. Not like you can actually own land anymore.

Legally, yes. Realistically, no. There are groups which live in compounds, communes or remote communities who don't actually pay any tax; the government knows it's too much fuss to collect from them.

&gt;Comforts of civilization have nothing to do with taxes. Or rather, taxes don't provide them. If they did, then we wouldn't have had clean water or cars before feds decided to start taxing us.

...cars? How old do you think taxes are? Taxes [predate the fucking WHEEL](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#Government), let alone the automobile. As for clean water; if by that you mean ""municipally treated water"", then it should be obvious to anyone with even half a brain that taxes HAS to predate them - tax is how the government gets money, and you can't build a water system without lots of money. Of course, given that tax predates the wheel, and the wheel predates municipally treated water, then it's pretty fucking obvious that tax predates municipally treated water.

&gt;COUNTY TAX AUTHORITIES don't let you pay that way! 

Move to a different county, you daft fuck! This is the third time I've suggested moving elsewhere, and you still keep talking about your fucking county! The world extends beyond your local area. I'm beginning to suspect you haven't yet moved out of your parents' basement, which would explain the profoundly sheltered viewpoint you have where mountain people don't exist and the way your county does things is the way every county does things. 

Also, [nomads](http://www.digitalnomads.com/) exist too, so obviously USPS isn't as mandatory as you think.

&gt;Not every single billing company does this yet. Not like I can even tell the water company to let me pay them electronically. 

Then hire a private company to handle your bills. Capitalism to the rescue!

Similarly: banning burkas isn't just an attack on the symptoms. Multiculturalism is about sampling different points of view and finding your own path between it all. How easy can you do that when you're dressed in a burka everytime you're outside? Even if you disregard the obvious physical issues, how do you then cope with the other side of the issue? Do I have the right to be offended by what, to me, is a symbol of women's oppression? Is that a cultural sensibility that I should just ignore? And even if I don't give a shit, how easy is it possible to integrate into a society in which alot of people think burkas are horrid (both due to racist reasons, and women's rights issues) when you're wearing a burka? Aren't you effectively shutting women out of society by allowing them to wear burkas? What is sensible policy here? 

Right now, it looks as though we're slowly moving to a segregated society. If anything, that should be avoided.
 
I'll agree that Europe has alot to learn about multiculturalism. There is alot of racism here, and it's an absolute disgrace. It's one of the biggest hurdles we as a society need to take atm and I do hope we do it sooner then later. But until we get there, imperfect measures are going to be needed.

Europeans are clearly not retarded rednecks and on some issues (homophobia, drugs) they are more liberal than your average American.

It will affect only 0.01% of the population but it is enacted because of a rampant and irrational fear of Islam. More than any practical effect, what is scary about this law is the message it sends and the motive behind it.

1) Ask hostels if you can work out some kind of work-to-stay arrangement. Some places, especially bigger hostels, are more willing to work with you on this. Maybe you can call ahead and find out if they do this. 

2) Look into WWOOFing. The deal is that you do a day's worth of farmwork and you get meals, a place to stay, etc. If you've got the energy but not the money, it's a great way to go. 

3) If you're certified for it, you can make money in almost any part of the world by teaching English. The certification is not hard to get and you can sometimes find shorter jobs that pay under the table if you're good at seeking out that sort of thing. 

4) Camp. If you don't mind getting a little dirty, it's often very cheap to camp near a city. On the other hand, if you plan on seeing things, it might be worth your time just to pay up for a hostel and spend less time and money transporting yourself into cities.

Even if the world as we know it collapses, western society falls into decline, what will stop us from recreating a society that will eventually grow to be even more complex than we are now? The Roman empire collapsed and eventually Europe fell to the dark ages, but after many centuries, it became undeniably more powerful and more complex than ever before. The British Empire was able to span half the globe, though its collapse did not shatter the world at the time because others took the up the mantle. 

Even if WWIII broke out and a nuclear winter destroyed the world as we know it today, within a millenium, human civilization would no doubt be infinitely more complex than today. The only way to move forward is through increased complexity. There is a always point where a system no longer facilitates the optimal rate of growth. The only way humanity would step into a more simplistic society is if it becomes the cultural norm for ALL humans, across the globe, to shun technology and development. Otherwise, there will always be individuals who strive towards complexity, towards increased development. Does this seem probable?

And you speak of materials necessary for an industrial/technological revolution. First and foremost, we will always find a way to make ever more efficient technology from existing materials, or less materials than we use now. A single breakthrough could mean growth at rates that we could not possibly imagine today. Then consider, two millennium from now, will we not be obtain materials from other planets? Humanity went from first flight (as defined by the recognized hot air balloon flight in 1783) to space flight in less than 200 years. Do you honestly think our resources are limited to what we have here on the top layer of the Earth's crust forever?

I will not deny that in the short term, there may be a collapse of this complex civilization we see around us today. But when thinking in terms of hundreds, thousands of years, unless the human race eradicates itself entirely, it will move, eventually, towards more complexity. The same applies for business models, except on a less extreme scale. After all, businesses are human organizations, and are subject to similar forces on smaller scales.

You can certainly argue that there'd be even more firearms without gun control, but I don't see how anyone can look at that and still credibly claim that gun control stops the problem. As the old saying goes, if you outlaw guns, only the outlaws will have guns. At least with some sort of restricted, registered civilian access to firearms, potential crime victims have a fighting chance against criminals who might very well be armed regardless.

Second, Germany had the manpower to take over Europe, not the whole world. Several countries now have many times the standing army of Germany at the beginning of WW2 and 70 years of technological advancements to make them an even greater power.

Third, several articles point out the drastic effects of nuclear winter and radiation fallout in even small scale regional conflicts. Even just 50 nuclear weapons detonating in any part of the world will kill millions in China, Europe, the US and many other regions.

Fourth, this is the scenario that scares the US the most. This ""someone"" could be any terrorist organization with very unclear ties back to a nuclear state. This uncertainty would make the US unable to clearly pinpoint their attacker and cause retaliation to be seen as an act of aggression, as Iraq was. A nuclear retaliation would be a threat to the world and thus be treated as such by other nuclear weapon states.

There are a great many scenarios that could bring about full worldwide conflict. The US and Russia are not the only players despite their size and the incredible effects of nuclear weapons make any nuclear weapon state a potential fire starter for such a conflict.

The same sort of startup-heavy software environment generally does *not* exist in Europe; I know a great many people who have moved to the US because such an environment is more startup-friendly.  The US restrictions on Microsoft were pretty laughable and promptly dropped -- harm that Microsoft sees is because another company (Apple) or a collection of technology enthusiasts and companies (Linux) is moving in, not because of any sort of effective limitations placed by the government.  I can't speak as to the restrictions placed by *every* European government, but generally I have a hard time seeing how those did much to encourage Microsoft to open up the application space; the most extreme example is probably the Media Player/MSIE restrictions, and just what is the real-world impact of that?

Clearly the solution is the elimination of elites. 

There are few things better for a nation or a group of nations than the elimination of an entrenched plutocracy. The plagues of the middle ages with their equal opportunity death opened up social and economic opportunities all across Europe and there was a surge in innovation, invention and scholarship by those able to move up from the lower classes. This produced the Renaissance.

After the French Revolution they attempted to bring to justice those who had exploited and abused those weaker than themselves. This wiped out most of the hereditary classes and the result energized the entire nation. Within a dozen years France had conquered most of Europe.

Russia did much the same and became powerful despite having an incompetent and brutal leader and despite suffering terrible losses during WWII. Before that Russia had only been an unimportant backwater nation. After that it was one of the two most powerful nations on earth.

The American Revolution and the huge amount of land left vacant after the plagues that devastated the native American population made it possible for people (usually white men, it is true, since women and blacks were still subjugated) of ability to achieve their potential and to enrich the nation and make better the lives of most people.

After the civil war the entrenched plutocracy of the north grew in power until the depression. In the 1930’s when progressive income and estate taxes were enacted (instead of the guillotine), the power of this plutocracy was brought under control, leading to a surge of innovation and inventions that continued till recently. Sadly, this movement has ended as such taxes have all but been eliminated. Innovations are now likely to come from outside the US as the plutocracy tightens its grip on the American population and makes it harder to get a good education or to profit from your own training or inventions. The plutocracy understands that change frequently displaces them and they meant to stop change by limiting education and innovation. Progressive income and estate taxes can reduce their wealth and therefore their power and energize the rest of the American public. But it will take a fight to accomplish that.

All Iranian citizens are not Persian, and all Persians are not Iranians by nationality.

As far as the persecution of Shi'ites, it has little to do with the ""odd things"" that they do. There are other political and sociological reasons at the root of these conflicts. Superficial reasons like, ""they act weird"" are retrospective justifications for the actions of their antagonists.

What do you mean they look different from Arabs? They aren't a racial group. Arabs and Persians are both classified as Caucasians. The difference is linguistic/ethnic, not racial. There might be differences in traits in the same way that tall, blond people are more common in Scandinavia, but that doesn't mean that there are not tall, blond people throughout the rest of Europe.

How does someone ""look Indian?"" How can you say what a Pakistani ""looks like"" any more accurately than you can say what an American looks like? Pakistan is multi-cultural. 

A portion of Pakistan's population actually immigrated from India in 1947 during Partition (more that 7.2 million people). Additionally, more than ~20% of the population is Iranian, including ~15% Pashtun and ~3% Balochi. The majority of the Pakistani population (~75%) is Indo-Aryan, a subset of the Indo-Iranian ethno-linguistic group. There are several subgroups within this category.

Among Indians you'll find: Indo-Iranians, Dravidians, Austro-Asiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Afro-Asians, Europeans, Tai, and many other groups.

Additionally, Hinduism is an extremely diverse religion and is not cohesive in the way that religions like Christianity and Islam are. Also, most Muslims in India received Islam from Persian rulers, not Arabs. But either way, religion and ethnicity are not the same. There are light-skinned, Punjabi-speaking Pakistani Hindus and dark-skinned, Malayalam-speaking Muslim Indians (Malayalam is a language spoken in south India and India has more Muslims than Pakistan; the largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia).

2. Urban fantasy where vampires (themselves a product of European folklore) are real but somehow manage to keep it a secret.

There's a lot of folklore from Native American, African, and Asian cultures which could be adapted for a fantasy story that wouldn't read like a Tolkien knock off, but that simply never happens, or at least it's not common to do so. Let alone seeing anything that's actually original.

(For an example of something more original, ReBoot was a kids show, but it used a computer as the basis of its fantasy setting. That's a million times more interesting than yet another novel with Kings and swords and wizards and orcs. But we never, ever see anything as creative as ReBoot in fantasy literature, why?)

The term ""conservative"" is relative.

Because it's relative, you cannot say that one person is a ""true"" conservative while another is not.

""Conservative"" is proprietary political terminology, so it's meaningless for the sake of definition, since the ideas behind our political system are global. You can call Ron Paul a classical liberal or a 19th century libertarian if you want to be academic about it.

Number of foreign born in the US:

In California, non-Hispanic whites slipped from 80% of the state's population in 1970 to 43% in 2006.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Origin)

The population of the US is around [**307 million**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/publicdata%3Fds%3Duspopulation%26met%3Dpopulation%26tdim%3Dtrue%26dl%3Den%26hl%3Den%26q%3Dpopulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bunited%2Bstates&amp;ei=5nG2S-HTJobGlQedldh9&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=prbx_publicdata&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=002662436500654163341&amp;ved=0CAYQ4wEwAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo3QfJVPqNcdqDqC1bc5yev01BCw). That means about **13.2%** of the population are foreign born.

No let's look at europe:

&gt;[At the end of 2006, according to official national statistics and Eurostat estimates, the total number of non-nationals living in the EU Member States was **29 million**, representing **5.8 %** of the total EU population......according to Eurostat estimates, the proportion of non-nationals is 10 % or higher in Latvia (19 %), Estonia (18 %),......The figures for Latvia and Estonia include people who have been resident in the country since before the Soviet Unions' break-up, but they have not yet acquired citizenship of Latvia or Estonia. ](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Migration_statistics)

&gt;[The combined population of all 27 member states has been forecast at **501,259,840** as of January 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Demographics)

Nope. 

As for the Playstation store selling FF games more than others, the reason why they sell more is for this reason, their stories and gameplay are proven, and they're already completed. Now obviously graphics is important and really that's the main reason why we pay so much for games, and why someone would think it's crazy to pay full price for a game full of sprites, especially on the PS3. 

BUT! oddly enough the 5.49 million people that have bought Pokemon since December of last year ( Japan since december selling 3.72 million copies, North Americans buying 1.29 million since the 14th of march, and europeans buying 480,000 copies since the 26th of March disagree with you that people don't buy Pokemon games, or sprite based games despite their system (the DS) being much more capable than it's graphics show. Same with Dragon Quest 9 on the DS, selling 4.27 million copies in Japan alone. Even though they don't have flashy visuals, they are some of the top selling games in their markets and they're paying 40 dollars in NA, and even more everywhere else.

As for the industry being inundated with crap games that look pretty, that's debatable, most games that are truly crap are built for the Wii to get mothers to grab it for their kids when they're out at the grocery store, but then again you can't mar a medium for the worst that comes out especially video games because there isn't as much of a filtering process to getting a game published as we do in lets say movies. If a movie is total crap it won't get shown in theaters and will get put out on DVD, because the distributor needs to keep an image, and it cost a lot to promote a film. Games on the other hand can be released straight away, and the market will dictate what's worthwhile. Saying that the games market is bad because you have games that are crap but look great is like saying the movie industry is crap for having blockbuster films that look good but suck. (which a LOT of them do). 

Oh well, we'll have to agree to disagree, because gaming certainly is an interesting medium, I'm hoping that it will continue to grow artistically, and people will be interested in the old classics so they can get some perspective. Maybe gamers of yesteryear will show their kids games from their childhood just like our parents showed us movies, and then their ""literacy"" will increase, who knows!

The Spanish language is a Romance language which began its evolution from Latin in the 3rd century BC.

Spanish is now spoken by over 400 million people from many parts of Western Europe to South, Central and North America. There are even a number of Spanish speakers in West Africa and Australasia. There is also a lot of history in Spanish culture.

As a result there is a great demand for non-Spanish speakers to learn the Spanish Language.

I have been introduced to many languages in my life but none are as passionate or expressive as the Spanish language. If you can remember the exploits of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek in Desperado or Gomez from the Adam’s Family you may have an idea what I am talking about.

There are many Spanish language training courses being offered on the internet they range from fairly poor quality where the trainer seems to think that beginners have some sort of grounding in Spanish, to high quality courses with voice and text, some even video, that contain loads of phrases and vocabulary. Some courses offer the opportunity to start to learn at a beginner level and some courses take you from the beginner to the advanced level in one course.

The prices of these courses range from low cost (under $10) to over $300. In most cases you get what you pay for in terms of quality. But there are some courses available for under $100 that rival the expensive courses and those are the ones that we will be seeking out and reviewing.

I hope that the information that we provide will not only help you to save money but also make your Spanish language learning experience a pleasant one.

If you're really into lyrics, then you're not going to enjoy the vast majority of pop music. To take two canonical examples, take Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" or pretty much any early Beatles song: the lyrics are not exactly Shakespeare (Beatles: ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, ... with a love like that, you know it can't be bad"" -- then they rhyme that with ""sad"" -- not breaking new territory I think!). The point about pop music is that you try to make an utterly compelling combination of melody, harmony, and rhythm -- and you stick to that combination, keeping things nice and tight and simple and easy to follow. Lyrics really are secondary and are important insofar as they help to set the mood, and they give non-expert listeners something to latch on to (their brains, without realizing it, are *actually* latching on to the underlying harmony, rhythm, etc. but people, when they don't know harmony theory, intervals, etc. latch on to the lyrics instead -- there was an article posted recently on how Japanese always hear things 'instrumentally' and I think it made a lot of valid points). Countless pop songs have pretty ordinary lyrics (coupled with great or compelling music), but it's rather hard to find a hit pop song with great lyrics but crap music. (There are exceptions: try as I might, I can't find anything remotely enjoyable in Gwen Stefani's ""Hollaback Girl"" -- terrible lyrics, and basically atonal [and fucking awful] music. It's an attitude song, I guess... and also the exception on the album -- see the awesome ""Whatcha Waiting For"" [produced by another surefire hit producer, Great White Duke]) Music is distinct from poetry!

A lot of our appreciation of pop music really falls in the realm of cognitive science IMHO. There's a pretty good book on the topic called ""This Is Your Brain On Music"" -- in it, he relates studies that show how the major scale is literally hard-wired into your brain. Ditto certain (e.g. 4/4 which is used almost universally in pop music) rhythms. Finally, the tempo is usually set between 110 and 130bpm which is quite close to our heart beat especially when active, e.g. dancing.

Anyway, as to why I think the song's a hit. I'm doing this all just by recall -- I don't have the music in front of me now. 

Key to almost all big hits is that:

- They use diatonic harmony. Diatonic harmony means that the chords that you use for the song are derived from the major scale (note, the song can be in a minor key, because the natural minor [or aeolian] scale is is the sixth mode of the major [or ionic] scale). Using major harmony, it's actually pretty hard to make a chord change sound unpleasant. Sometimes songs use a few more tricks, like secondary dominants to spice things up (this is an old jazz [and, actually, jazz stole it from classical and european popular music] trick) which is used e.g. in Michael Buble's ""I Just Haven't Met You Yet"" (another song, incidentally, with pretty atrocious lyrics and yet to my mind a rather pleasant song to listen to and another surefire hit). In the specific case of Tik Tok, you've got an extremely simple IV -&gt; V -&gt; vi (assuming you're in B, for example, you'd play G -&gt; A -&gt; Bmin). What other songs share the same chord change? Well, if you turn the sequence around you get the chord change for ""All Along The Watchtower"" (I'm guessing you don't think Bob Dylan is shit -- but I bet you would if he had put the lyrics of ""All Along..."" to the music in ""Hollaback Girl""). There are literally countless more examples, but that's just off the top of my head. 

- That chord change is played right at the intro of the song by a synth. The chords are roughly spelled out. Normally you need three notes to make a standard chord -- the root, the third, and the fifth. The fifth, however, is not really that informative because both major and minor chords share the same fifth, so in practice you can elide it, keeping only the root note and the third, and still retain the overall color (jazz guys do this all the time). In this case, we have the root note panned hard left, and the third panned hard right (or vice-versa, can't remember, and it doesn't really matter as you can just switch the headphones :) I for one think that intro sounds really cool! The synth sounds bright and definitely catches your attention. And of course, as mentioned, the chord change is diatonic so it's harmonious. A little more on the chord change: there is something in harmony theory called diatonic substitutions. The vi (minor) chord is a diatonic substitute of the I (major, root) chord. In other words, you can roughly exchange one for the other. Why? Quite simple: out of the three notes to build a chord, they share two of the notes -- only one note is different. So you'd expect them to sound similar, and indeed they do. So what have you got now? IV -&gt; V -&gt; iv &lt;=&gt; I  i.e. IV -&gt; V -&gt; I. Now, a little more theory, the IV chord is called the sub-dominant. The V chord is called the dominant, and it is characterized by a strong pull towards the tonal center -- the I chord. If you listen to almost ANY piece by Mozart, a significant component will be Tonic -&gt; Sub-Dominant -&gt; Dominant. It simply sounds good! By the way, ""Not Fade Away""? Same principle. Most Beatles songs too. Also, ""Wild Thing"" and even the blues follows the same principle! We musicians really are extremely lazy ;)

As far as harmony and melody goes, that's pretty much it! You'll note that the chorus follows the same progression as the verse. And actually, it's pretty hard to make that not sound boring: Dr. Luke did a great job making it sound distinct, using...

- Different rhythms. If you look at the first verse and chorus, you start with basically no beat -- the beat is implied by the rhythm in the synth line (once again, that synth line is really clever!). Then she goes something like ""boys try to touch my junk"" (or something... who cares what the hell she says? it's about dancing and having fun!) and the beat comes: BOOM cha BOOM ... cha. BOOM cha BOOM ... cha. The first cha on an off-beat, for interest, the second one cha on the standard 2 beat which is par for the course for almost all pop (another example: The Strokes, ""Last Nite"" pom cha pom cha pom cha-pom-pom cha -- again all the cha's are on the 2 or 4 -- it's almost like mini call and response twice within a bar). Going back to the song, we're now at the verse-pre-chorus, right before the chorus we drop out (giving strong anticipation) and BOOM we hit the chorus with a massive four on the floor bass drum which is sure to get butts moving on the dancefloor. Now for the second verse: same thing as in the first, but now everything is under-girded by that four-on-the-floor kick drum, giving the song a dance feel and moreover basically propelling it forward, kicking it into a higher gear. I find it hard to listen to that second verse without tapping my foot... it's almost automatic and uncontrollable, similar to how I can't stop myself from tapping in ""Last Nite"" -- exactly what you want in a pop song.

- We go into a second chorus, this time adding more of what the guy who produced my record (Mike Crossey -- he worked with Arctic Monkeys, Razorlight, and recently Blood Red Shoes [they rock! -- and so young it makes me jealous :) ] ) calls ""ear candy"". I call it flair: basically extra shakers and rhythmic sounds and whistles and stuff to keep stuff interesting.

However... by this point the same chord change over and over is starting to get a little boring. And no sooner does that happen than Dr. Luke expertly moves you into...

- the breakdown: ""you build me up, you break me down, you've got that sound"". Now we have some new harmonic material! But what is it exactly? IIRC, it's ii -&gt; iii -&gt; vi -&gt; v (repeat). And guess what? ii is a diatonic substitue of IV! iii is a substitute of I (although think in this case it almost acts like a V to the vi). vi as mentioned, is a substitutes of I, and then the v. So we've got diatonic substitutions of IV -&gt; I -&gt; V, which is just a simple permutation of the original sequence -- i.e. the wet dream of the record label: ""The same, but different"" :)

And finally..

- we end it all with another couple of banging choruses.

I'd like to add that the lyrics are incredibly cheap and schlock -- I don't deny that at all. But, again, I don't think that's the point. Her semi-rapping delivery is undeniably credible -- she sounds like she's not really trying; just having fun. And that's the point. In an interview, they asked her if she's a bad influence on girls. She took the example line: ""brush my teeth with a bottle of jack"" and said something to the effect of: ""do people *really* think I do that? of course not!... it's just a song, a fun song"". 

I really understand where you're coming from, by the way -- I don't want to sound judgmental. I spent 6 years playing only jazz -- if it wasn't Charlie Parker, if it didn't go outside harmony, etc., I just wasn't interested. Similarly, if I thought the lyrics were puerile or mundane, I just wrote the music off. I really had to force myself to open my mind to music that, simply said, serves a different purpose. Once I did that, I found that I was more happy, because I could still listen to all the ""headier"" stuff, but I didn't beat myself up anymore when I caught myself tapping my foot to supposedly crap, ephemeral music.

As George Martin said of pop: it may be ephemeral, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.

End of diatribe... please do listen to my tracks if you get the chance! I love hearing other peoples input, even if it's: dude, that sucks :)

That makes perfect fucking sense. I bet you didn't know that slavery was alive and kicking in Africa long before Europeans made contact and adopted the slave trade, and it even continues today in parts of Africa. So why isn't Chris Rock making racist songs about black people, since they have been oppressing themselves as a race for a much longer period of time? 

Mostly I agree. Slavery didn't exist purely out of racism, but rather it was a natural byproduct of the necessity for the 'developed' enslavement of people in undeveloped parts of the world for cheap labour. 

Fully understood. It existed not only amongst blacks, but among whites as well (hence the plural suffix for several whites to this day, e.g ""Saunders"", remnants of the name of their ancestral slavemaster).

&gt; I can't think of anyone less entitled to make racist comments than Chris Rock. That guy has been handed life on a silver platter and has not even remotely experienced oppression from what I can tell; if he can be racist and get away clean with it, anyone should be able to.

I'm not sure you can make this claim. I've not read any biography about him, but I don't think we can make the assumption he lived a poverty-free and priveleged upbringing.

Unfortunately for blacks today, remnants of slavery remain. Over three hundred years of unpaid labour and the large majority of whom were forced into a vicious cycle of poverty, the prison system or military to become martyrs to a state which racialized and oppressed them in the first place. 

Anyway, this is getting a bit overly ideological. Obviously he didn't mean it nearly as seriously as you and I are taking it. I happen to think it's a fun song .

Pakistan (and to a lesser extent) Burma, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are allied to China, while Iran,  Afghanistan and most of ASEAN side with India.

The Chinese will produce products and materials with the specifications demanded by the buyer, and do it consistently and reliably.   Their quality and safety on average is far better than that which we found in the US providers we formerly relied upon.  It is up to the importer to properly test and evaluate the product he imports. There are plenty of dodgy characters in the construction trade, based upon my experiences with contractors working at our facilities.  These firms use price as their only consideration when sourcing materials, wherever they buy them.  We see companies in our industry who buy raw material and finished products via email from China.  They never visit the factory or meet the managers and technicians.  For all they know or care the products they import could be made in a farm shed or a filthy sweat shop.  Doing business in China requires regular personal meetings.  Mutual trust is very important.  Relationships will almost always take precedent over profit.  The Chinese will size you up on the basis of two email messages and if they feel that you are incompetent, lazy or unconcerned about quality they will react accordingly.  The average manager or technician in China is extraordinarily qualified and knowledgeable. They are also very aware of the reputation China has in the US and Europe for dodgy quality and safety and know that it is extremely important to avoid these problems.  In the few instances we have had quality failures the Chinese manufacturer has been very responsive and cooperative in resolving the issue. Very often it is women who run the businesses although usually a man has the formal title of managing director or president.   Given the enormous quantity of goods imported into the US from China the number of serious quality issues is infinitesimal. The US media, not so much in Europe, and politicians exaggerate the extent of the problem, for whatever reason.  Racism probably inters into the equation as well, possibly, as the fear that China is, or already has, eclipsed the US in manufacturing and raw materials.

I strongly disagree.  First, I assume you do not recognize a difference between libertarianism and anarchy, even though they are very different.  A de-regulated market it not anarchy or lawlessness.  It is a market where rules exist, but the rules neither favor nor disadvantage anyone and regulation does not prevent competition.  Anyone who reads history can easily see that capitalistic societies (i.e. free markets) trounce every other type out there.  America has an economy larger than any in the world; larger than China's with only 1/4 the population.  Europe, japan - all capitalist economies even when they may lean towards socialism for government.  

Examples of deregulation - Airlines: Numerous airlines offer cheap flights (and yet they all still comply with FAA rules, amazing) and by allowing new methods of flight booking even greater savings are hard.  Phones - Cell phones exist.  This would likely  not happen under an AT&amp;T monopoly, cuz why would they bother when they already have 100% of the phone calls.

You first stated this:

&gt;Look, when Monsanto puts out a movie that explains their actions in a meaningful and justified way then you can declare Food Inc sensationalist. Until then, the statements and observations in this movie seem spot on and in direct accordance with the literature I have read and other documentaries I have seen on the topic.

You did not put out a photgraph of Monsanto. Where is that photo? How does this photo demonstrate Monsanto polluting the environment.

Let's also talk about pollution and cancer. Please show the link of the pollution being created by Monsanto. Please show that urban pollution is primarily caused by Monsanto rather than automobile traffic. The incidence of lung cancers in urban settings, as far as I know is primarily linked with particualtes, which is primarily from auto emissions.

So which is this a picture of a refinery? or something else? Based on the stacks, it is either a refinery or plastics production process. The steam you see rising is likely from a cooling process and not polluting at all.

The links you provided on Occidental are from Peru, and Columbia, not Niagra Falls.

You also seem to be confusing SO2 from Coal power plants with refineries. SO2 is dipersed temporaly and spatial by the use of tall stacks.

Steam is not a polluting source. Steam is not used to disperse SO2. 

CO2 is simply carbon dioxide. You breathe that out.

Dioxins:

The chemical industry is not an important source of PCDDs/PCDFs according to national emission inventories in European countries such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. Combustion processes are considered to be an important primary source of PCDDs/PCDFs (ref. Wormgoor, Björndal). Most thermal processes which involve burning organic and inorganic compounds containing chlorine atoms e.g. sodium chloride, result in the formation of PCDDs/PCDFs. Of special importance is the incineration of various types of municipal, hospital and hazardous wastes. Production of steel and non-ferrous metals (copper, magnesium, nickel…) are other notable sources.

It is commonly accepted today that formation of dioxin-like compounds in flue gases happens in a temperature range of 200 to 400°C, especially in poor combustion conditions leading to incomplete conversion and the formation of carbon in the fly ashes. Levels of dioxins in flue gases of incinerators depends on the well known 3 T rule:

    * Temperature above 850°C
    * Time (residence) typically 2 seconds
    * Turbulence optimised by furnace geometry and secondary air.

As PCDDs/PCDFs are mainly fixed onto fly ashes, the effectiveness of the dust separation is of paramount importance.

Recently the UK Authorities published a review of dioxin emissions into air (1995). The dominant source was the incineration of municipal solid waste representing 70% of the total industrial sources. Other major emissions, representing 23% of the total industrial emissions were:

. steel mills

. combustion of coal (energy, fuel)

. iron and steel plants

. non-ferrous metals operations

. hospital wastes

Each of these 5 sources as of approximately equal importance. Emissions from the chemical industry are very much smaller than the above sources.

So first explain the connection between Monsanto and your pic, and then explain the connection between the Niagra polutants and whatever chemical plant you photographed, and then explain your apparent lack of knowledge about polution control, sources and finally link the polutants you cite with whatever diseases you claim they cause.

--While you think you are all 'British', the Scots, Welsh and others are fully aware there are the 'English' and 'others'.
  You really should not listen to Gordon Brown.  There are the English, the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish and the Cornish. The rest call themselves British and Gordon Brown calls all
  of us British, apart from the Scots, who retain their distinctive name, unless they are politicians in London, in which case they are at all times British. Got it? 

--After 18 months I could not understand the actual dialect of your country, 'yob'.
  There is no dialect, there are many.  No wonder you were confused.

--You treated Di like shit until she was dead, then had a nationwide attack of amnesia.
  Aristocracy again.  Di was an aristocrat, arguably better bred than Her Majesty herself.  Every now and again the people become infatuated by some aristocrat,
  Di was such an example.  The people didn't treat her like shit, it was other aristo's.

--For a people so concerned with 'good breeding', you pointedly ignore the several hundred years you've been exporting your best DNA.
  You really don't get aristocracy do you ?  It has nothing to do with ""quality"" of DNA or quality of anything else for that matter. 
  It has everything to do with how long your family have owned their stately pile and how long they have been at court, in this case the royal court.
  But you are quite correct about exporting the best DNA, much of it has gone to your own country.  Even so, even the best DNA can't perform miracles against the rise of
  Chinese DNA.  The US is fucked, just like the rest of the west.

--1066 was actually a defeat.
  Jesus Christ ! Aristocracy again, FFS stop passing comments on something you clearly have not got a clue about.
  1066 was regime change.  The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was replaced by the Norman aristocracy.  Again, to keep it brief, William, Duke of Normandy got a lucky win
  against the Anglo-Saxon king Harold, who had just seen off the Norwegian King Harald, so was feeling a little tired and not at his best.
   
  William declared himself king and owner of everything by right on conquest. Now, to be fair to William, he didn't just think one day that ""me and my posse"" are going to have
  a piece of England, he thought he had a valid claim to the English throne, but he was not the only one, Harald of Norway thought the same.
  This came about because of the way these people were all interrelated through marriages.
  Once again, keeping if brief, if king A wanted to conclude a treaty with king B he would send a daughter to be married to one of king B's sons.
  So if a king died without any obvious heir (ie a son or brother) then the throne could be legitably be taken by anyone with a valid claim.
  Now the previous Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the confessor, had indeed died without an heir, leaving the throne available to anyone who could show they were related.

  That is why the aristocrats have such a thing about producing an heir, and incidentally what Di was all about.  


--The Romans left due to problems elsewhere, not due to one posed by the locals.
  Quite so, except for the Scots.  Any Scot will tell you the Romans never conquered Scotland (even if it was inhabited by Picts rather than Scots at the time).

--BSE was your own fault (Cattle should not be forced to be cannibals)

  Well, actually the dome was even worse.

--You collectively sold your nations' soul for a BP's partial concession of oil revenues in Iraq?

Easy, read on. (Oh, and the image that started this debate was not about Monsanto, It was about factory farming, so you might want to keep this whole debate on target.)

&gt;You did not put out a photgraph of Monsanto. Where is that photo? How does this photo demonstrate Monsanto polluting the environment.

It is one of the Occidental Chemical plants that produce chemicals used in factory farming. I already explained this in detail. Check the thread. And this is not about Monsanto, it is about the environmental effect of factory farming and it's relationship to the original photo.  Not my photo.  Monsanto is just one example of factory farming, but is not related to either photo.  Please keep this on target. 

&gt;The links you provided on Occidental are from Peru, and Columbia, not Niagra Falls.

There are 2 links in there about the pollution effects directly addressing Niagara Falls. The other links are directly associated with the company producing said chemicals. The majority of the chemicals being dumped outside the US, originate here.


&gt;CO2 is simply carbon dioxide.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas. In fact, it is the #1 greenhouse gas. 

&gt;The chemical industry is not an important source of PCDDs/PCDFs according to national emission inventories in European countries such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Look up Love Canal. Tell me what the top pollutant in that nightmare is/was. All of it originated in Niagara Falls, from Hooker Chemical (a subsidiary of Oxy before the complete merge). It seems that you are doing some research, so research that. None of those chemicals came from the categories of Dioxin sources you listed. That said, Oxy does not fall into the categories that you posted but is an obvious source, especially from this particular plant.

Like I said, they are a manufacturer of chlorine products for use in meat treatment. Please take note of the the fact that CDDs are the primary byproduct of this type of manufacturing:

Everyone in favor of the healthcare shenanigans Congress forced upon us think it is a primrose path to everyone getting healthier.  Well, name one governmental program that has created efficiency or value add.  Have you been to your local DMV in awhile?  Have you had to deal with a faceless bureaucrat over taxes or deeds, or titles?  Now, you want those same people making decisions that affect the insurance market?  You want them dictating what medical protocols a doctor uses?  The market is a far fairer and more efficient method.  

It was government intervention forcing employers of certain companies to mandate coverage and mandates to insurance coverages which created this nightmare of system to begin with.  I'm only 9 years older than you.  You and I probably don't need to be covered for a number of things...most likely you and I, if you are a healthy and fit person, only need emergency coverage, yearly flu shot, exams.  Why can't we buy insurance that covers only that?  

My final point, the market was already gearing to take care of those who were ""underinsured"" and uncovered.  You have probably seen the small medical office in your local strip mall.  They do things like exams, bloodwork, see you when you have the flu, etc for an affordable rate.

Most right wing (and plenty of liberal) critics attack Islam for its misogynist excesses for two reasons.

* They're Muslim and thus ""foreign."" Unlike Christianity, which one is to suppose is the devil we know.
* They can point at that and say ""Look! Women here have it great! So stop complaining!""

Does anyone really believe that the armies of conservative critics, either in Europe or in North America, are feminist lovers of women's agency and freedom? Hardly. Their supposed concern for Muslim women, I find, is just a form of cultural colonialism and deeply insincere. One need only look to the Republican Party's repeated efforts to undermine women's right to choose, or the fact that they voted as a bloc (and, quite literally, to a man) to oppose the Franken anti-Rape Amendment.

I do not feel that Islam is beyond criticism, certainly. But the vituperative Western critics (the vast majority of whom are white and usually male, as well as practising or culturally Christian) are not a little hypocritical on the subject. Some ugly things happen in Muslim communities, but we only know about them because the connection to faith is spun into the report. How many instances of domestic violence do we hear about in the US that are tied to religious ideology? Precious few, not because it is not there, but because it would be 'politically incorrect' to link Christianity to such.

Despite the fact that I've seen many times, in my own family, how a real attitude of ""submission"" has been created by the Catholic faith, we do not get public campaigns against Christianity or referenda on church steeples (indeed, it's taken a shocking amount of rape and abuse by the Holy Church to gin up as much criticism as is now going around; the frocked elephant in the room none in the West can afford to ignore any longer).

Muslims are targeted because they are, by and large, not white and do not worship at an altar built by European culture. Thus the religion seems threatening.

But the solution to the problems that do exist in all monotheistic faiths, systemic as they are, is to integrate them into society- not to ghettoise them- and to give them the nurturing they need to evolve. I've already seen this happen at some Christian churches and it's a sight to behold. Many Muslims want their faith to evolve too, but instead of listening to them, we pay attention only to firebrand westerners who cast Islam as alien and other.

Ayan Hrisi Ali is in many ways an exception, and I respect her for experience that the vast majority of western cultural critics do not have. But she is not the only woman out there with a voice, she's just the one saying things certain white westerners like to hear. She has her reasons, and powerful, harrowing experiences to buttress them. But the claiming of her as the sole voice of dissent strikes me as still more cultural imperialism.

You have to remember who The Economist is written for. (Classically) Liberal as it can be at times, it has very mixed views on issues regarding women.

To be honest:

&gt;IF YOU are a youngish man who sits on a European corporate board, you should worry: the chances are that your chairman wants to give your seat to a woman.

This is precisely the sort of scaremongering that had me rolling my eyes from the word 'go' in this article.

There are also a few other matters to consider:

&gt;According to a study by the University of Michigan, Norwegian firms have lost lots of boardroom experience: the new, younger women directors have spent less time running companies on average, are less likely to sit on other boards and are more likely to come from middle management.

This will be part of the growth process. The suggestion that these women are *incompetent*, however, is one that is not borne out by the actual reported experience of many Norwegian businesspeople. Of course women en masse will be less likely to have umpteen decades of combined experience. That's part of the whole problem they're trying to address with this system. If you keep waiting (as the Economist suggests at the end) for it to happen ""naturally"", you'll be waiting forever.

Remember, the sexual revolution was in the 60s and early 70s. If it wasn't happening now, it was never going to happen, unless something came in and broke the resistance.

What the Economist is advocating at the end is what has been tried for the last 40 years: ""Let women [and ostensibly minorities] toil away in lower management and then appeal to the Old Boys Club for promotions they'll never get.""

The quotas represent an acknowledgement that the culture is not going to change on its own.

Towards the end:

&gt;Some do so by choice, but others fear they will not get ahead in more chauvinist parts of a business.

Precisely. How does one undo that chauvinism? Ensuring close to 50% of the bosses are women does do a rather good deal for that. At any rate, grooming a *large* new generation of female executives will pay off great dividends in the end, I feel. This process will provide a wealth of new role models who will, in time, have accrued a good deal of experience.

The Good:

1. One of the best economies in the world, innovation and technology in every sector. Jobs are plentiful, given the right credentials.

2. Great foods, there are bakeries and butchers at every corner, food is not as processed. Beer! Also the lowest grocery prices in Europe. 

3. A political discourse that allows all opinions to be heard, a lot of political diversity. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press is granted. 

4. Education still one of the world's best, health care for all, (almost) free university education, modern and clean cities, vast public transportation system, no speed limit on the Autobahn. 

5. Culturally and historically rich, great diversity of beautiful landscapes, the Alps, the North Sea, castles, historic town centers etc.


The Bad:

1. Heritage is a big factor for success, your roots are important. German is hard to learn, and it's hard to get integrated into society without speaking it. 

2. Big government, resulting in a lot of bureaucracy

3. Big division between the social classes, a consequence of pupils in 5th grade getting split into three different forms of high school, by intelligence and educational prognosis. This has its pros and cons, I tend to support it actually. 

4. Big sense of entitlement, unemployed workers demanding more social benefits paid for by high taxes on income and sales. Top earners pay up to 60% of their salary to the state. Germany is also the top net payer to the EU. The government is mostly running on empty, financing big programs by deficit spending.

If you're allergic to smoke (it's legal to smoke in the tents), then I think there's non-smoking sections you can possibly snag a seat in.  Or if you're a smoker, you're in luck.  

Oh, and try and wear ""neutral"" clothing, that doesn't really declare you to be an American without someone actually talking to you first.  There's still some ill-feelings towards Americans in Europe, and Oktoberfest brings in over 6 million people from all over the world.  When it gets later in the night, saying the wrong thing (i.e. America owns your punkass bitches) would probably put you in the hospital.  I say this because the last time I went, a guy who wore a shirt with an American flag on it that said ""Fuck yeah!"" on the front got the living shit beat out of him by a group of roudy Irish.  Wasn't really entertaining.  The guy was knocked out pretty fast.  But still.

""I just wanted to bring to your attention my disappointment that there has yet been no coverage of a video that was released today by whistleblowers (via the website wikileaks.org) showing the US military killing civilians and 2 Reuters journalists in an unprovoked attack.  Officially the story was that the reporters were killed as a result of crossfire in a conflict the military had with ""insurgents"".  The leaked video today shows a completely different story.

Here is the article on the incident from the New York Times in 2007:

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/world/middleeast/13iraq.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss

And here is the decrypted video of the attack as released by Wikileaks today (Apr 5, 2010).  They have registered this domain name specifically for this video, and have chosen the title to lessen the media's ability to spin this another way. 

http://collateralmurder.com/



Other news sites have already broken this story, but so far the North American news media has been silent.  So far Al Jazeera has reported the story and it is starting to break throughout Europe:

http://english.aljazeera.net/

It is a very disturbing video and the implications are very serious.  I hope that we still live in a world where this is considered bigger news than Tiger Woods playing in a golf tournament or the release of a new Apple device.  If we are to allow the official story to stand then we are complicit in allowing the military, of any country, to freely kill whoever they like and to lie to our faces about it.

Oh, probably. They've actually studied this, Stockholm Syndrome is a subset of it, or related to it somehow. And there's an average time after which people stop screaming, and then an average time after which they start identifying with their captors. Both periods are measured in hours and days, not weeks or months. There are outliers, no doubt... but those who try to poison their ""husbands"" generally didn't survive to pass on their genes to new daughters.

&gt; The character in Gor didn't. 

Plausible, but probably less common. There are some women who are too afraid to scream, and where that subset overlaps those who are receptive/submissive...

&gt; How long would it take before she was so broken that the man felt comfortable letting her out in public?

At a guess? I'd wager that this period was typically less than a year. In all cases, I'd think it was less than 2 years. Any woman who can last longer than that, probably would be unbreakable... but also probably either escaped, or killed the man and was then killed by his relatives.

This isn't all prehistory either, you can look back just 1000 years or so, and see evidence of this sort of thing in Europe. If you're truly curious, read some of those stories, see what happened. Some will just be tall tales, but other places it will be somewhat plausible, I'd think.

&gt; In Gor apparently a day or a few days is enough to break her will.

This has to be at the one end of the Bell curve, of course. But I wouldn't rule it out. And again, remember the source.

&gt; On top of that the character doesn't even question the fact that she was transported magically to another world outside of a few sentences...

That's hard to gauge. On the one hand, if such a thing truly happened, I'd imagine that a sizable fraction of the subjects would be vegetables out of sheer shock. Whether that reduces or heightens the submissive effect, I have no clue. (I speculate that it might actually reduce it though.)

My dad talks about living in Seattle in the late 60s, how the local economy was bad and people were leaving the city in the thousands, a local real estate company put up that famous sign 'Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.' My dad talks about this time and says ""the city felt more like a town, with a lot of stubborn locals, fishermen, loggers and regular Boeing folk, working through the hard times."" Then, with the tech industry boom came a lot of new jobs, and therefore, a ton of new transplants. Many of whom were working in newer industries, making a lot of money and raising property values, which then, inadvertently, caused many long time residents to move farther and farther from the city center. My dad also talks about all the burnt out hippies coming from all over, trying to ""escape"" greed and oppression and reconnect with nature. There were also the well to do yuppies migrating up from the southern coast, trying to implement their California culture and way of life.

Seattle used to be a working class city, with the majority of people being of a German/Scandinavian background. Culturally, Seattle is known for being polite and friendly on the surface, yet evasive if roused beyond that. If you look at most Germanic and Scandinavian cultures you usually find the same distinction. The climate is also very similar to the climate of Northern Europe, bleak and cloudy. I find that during the winter most Seattleites stay indoors with people they really know, family and close friends. However, in the summer everyone is out and about, celebrating culture and diversity and glorious sunshine, but in the winter you hole up and stick together to get through it. This might be where transplants have it the worst. I have a group of friends I've known since High School, and a lot of friends I've met since, but I have to admit that during the winter I mostly gather with my older friends. Why? I'm not sure, perhaps it's easier or more familiar, or maybe it has something do to with the ingrained culture of cold weather peoples. I don't really know.

The Murphy case is detailed in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html).

&gt;Top Vatican officials — including the future Pope Benedict XVI — did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys, even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church, according to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit. 

&gt;The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal. 

&gt;In 1996, Cardinal Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case from Rembert G. Weakland, Milwaukee’s archbishop at the time. After eight months, the second in command at the doctrinal office, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, now the Vatican’s secretary of state, instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to Father Murphy’s dismissal.

&gt;But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church’s own statute of limitations.

You'll just have to put up with my terrible powers of description. I'm not a geneticist either, so you'll have to put up with the possibility that I'm wrong.

When people first hear of evolutionary facts like:

&gt;everyone in this area of the world is descended from ancestor ""x"", or group of people ""p""

they often make the same mistake I made. That mistake is to forget that when ""x"" was alive, say 10,000 years ago, there were also lots of other people, ""y"" and ""z"" for instance. The simplistic view is to forget (or never realise) that the modern population is also descended from ""y"" and ""z"" (unless they died before breeding) despite having a gene that was only present in ""x"". Or that, even if you have solid evidence that every current member of society is descended from group ""p"", that groups ""r"", ""s"", and ""t"" also contributed genes to the gene pool.

Extreme example following: imagine an island in the Pacific. It has roughly 1000 inhabitants on it, and has had a similar population for many thousands of years. Normally there is no travel on or off the island. The inhabitants of the island have brown skin. Now imagine that a few hundred years ago a white, red-headed European man visited, had a few children by a local woman and then died. No-one else ever visited. It's possible that the gene for red hair could spread through the population until every single inhabitant had it. Now, in the present day, the islanders don't look any different (it's a recessive gene), but if you do an analysis of their genes, and look at one particular gene (in this case the gene for red hair, in the original article it was the gene for lactase) then you will come to the conclusion that every single inhabitant of the island is descended from our red headed sailor boy. However, they all still have brown skin and they still look identical to the population of the island to the north, and the island to the south (apart from a few redheaded individuals). They are all descended from a single individual, and simultaneously also from a whole bunch of other single individuals, but everyone forgets that.

It's entirely possible that I have some Neanderthal DNA in me (apart from the 90-something percent that we share with all other great apes, that is. *Obviously* I share that with the Neanderthals too). There could have been a gene which wasn't present in any other ape but evolved once and once only in a Neanderthal. That Neanderthal could have bred with an ancient Homo Sapiens (no one knows) and that gene could have entered the H Sapiens gene pool. It might be in my body right now, I might have passed it on to my children. However, and this is the bit that confuses the hell out of people, myself included, I'm not a Neanderthal. In fact, all the Neanderthals are extinct. But it's theoretically possible that, if you looked at that one gene, you would discover that an entire population is ""descended"" from an extinct species. If you introduced yourself ""Hi, I'm srshouse and I'm descended from Neanderthals"" then you would get some funny looks because everyone assumes that you can't be (what with the whole ""extinct"" thing going on).

Subsidies should be routed to other grains - there are so many other options, so there really is no need to subsidize wheat so heavily:  
  
1. Cereal Grains   Barley, corn, millet, oats, rice, rye, sorghum, tef and wild rice are all in the same cereal grain family as is wheat. All flours ground from cereal grains may be used as a wheat substitute. Commonly available are barley, buckwheat, corn, rice and rye flour. The less utilized flours may be purchased online or from natural food stores. Note: people with a gluten allergy must also avoid barley, oats and rye.  
  
2. Non-Cereal Grains   Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are three grain-like seeds unrelated to cereal grains. (Despite its name, buckwheat is not a wheat-relative.) It is rare for anyone to develop a sensitivity to these non-cereal grains. Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are gluten-free and therefore not suitable for making leavened bread; however, they make excellent quick breads and cookies.  
  
3. Nut Meal   Ground nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts make the richest flour substitute for cookies and cakes. Because their fragile fatty acid content gives them a brief shelf life, it’s preferable to grind your own nuts in a food processor just prior to use. Nut meal requires a binding agent such as eggs. Because chestnuts are lower in fat than other nuts, chestnut flour has a longer shelf life. It is available online.  
  
4. Bean Flour   Dried beans, such as navy, pinto, soy and chickpeas may be milled and used, in combination with other flours, as a wheat alternative.  Bean flour is, however, not one that I recommend. Bean flour tastes like beans and makes baked goods dense and hard to digest.  
  
5. Other Flour Substitutes   Potato starch, arrowroot powder, cornstarch and tapioca are thickening agents that substitute for wheat in sauces and gravy. In baked goods these starchy ingredients serve as a binding agent.

I think the difference between ""insurance mandate"" and ""two-tier"" is that in the two-tier system, *everyone* has basic coverage from the government which is payed for through taxes.  With an insurance mandate, there may be a public option that is government run where a large majority may participate in, however there are individuals who can choose to not pay into and be covered by the public option, and receive completely private insurance.  With the example of Germany, it becomes a bit gray because

&gt; All salaried employees must have a public health insurance. Only public officers, self-employed people and employees with a gross income above ca. 50000 EU (adjusted yearly) may join the private system.

So, there are some people who must be in the public health insurance program, however there is a portion that can completely opt out, which is why I think they would still be classified as ""insurance mandate"".

Indeed there are -- many of which will cause a dramatic shift in the governmental systems (either one way or another) -- but those are mainly financial in nature, as the chickens of massive debt come home to roost.

Yes, but they are not ""grouped"" or segregated into particular areas of the country -- rather they are intermixed throughout the country.

Despite all of the media BS about ""Red States"" and ""Blue States"" modern America actually consists of a bunch of purple states -- some with an ever so slight ""red tint"" and others with a slight ""blue tint"" (and the exact ""color tint"" of many of the states can easily change from one election cycle to another.)

Which means a ""Civil War"" on the style of the 19th century is impossible (you ought to read the linked article, rather than just the Reddit title).

How many times must we debunk the bullshit of alleged ""evolutionary psychologists?""  Every time they make a claim, usually based on a monkey study, another monkey study or something else comes alogn 5 months later and blows it out of the water.

These are professional projectionists, people. Beyond our patterns in developing language, math, our instinctive need to survive when our lives are threatened and to look for food, there's nothing much else that's ""hard wired"" for us.

You can't just look at a trend on some subject and make up an evolutionary imperative that describes it after the fact.  This is called post-diction.  Not prediction.  A scientist should be able to come up with a hypothesis or theory that predicts future behavior or unknown patterns in the future before we become aware of them.  What evolutionary psychologists do is the opposite.

But this isn't even _about_ biology so far.  This is another, ""you girls complaining about sexism here are just spoiled bitches. They have it worse in other countries, you know!  If they have it worse, it means we don't have it at all!""

&gt;There is even a retail and entertainment industry based on “girl power” that rakes in billions a year.

No, there's a retail and entertainment industry that enforces gender stereotypes and concern trolls women under the guise of ""girl power"" to enforce both old and newer stereotypes of women being evaluated by the things they buy to adorn their bodies, and their sexuality.

But I guess Burch thinks no companies ever lie and distort.

&gt;Whether this is encouragement or exploitation is also a matter of debate

No, it's not.  It's almost exclusively exploitation.  That's the nature of an amoral business in capitalism, and we need to get real about it.  Get as much money out of customers as you can, as quick as you can. And you do it through exploitation.

&gt;but the message of “a girl’s freedom to do anything” is clear.

Yeah.  Anything that fits certain pre-defined parameters. Which means, **not** _anything_.

&gt;These are the conclusions a reader may jump to within the first few pages, but worry not.   Thankfully, Pinker has other plans.

So what, all that was sarcasm?  You don't make it clear.  You're a horrible writer.

&gt;By page four, Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard?   Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard?   This in itself denigrates females.

Now for the thousandth time I have to explain that women's liberation, feminism, equality, is not about trying to turn women into men!!  goddamnit, what the fuck is wrong with you assholes who get printed?

&gt;So many books discuss how females are discouraged, disenfranchised, and disenchanted, citing numbers of women leaving traditionally “male” careers.   Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don’t have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually  choose different paths, not be forced into them by the patriarchy.

She _dares_? That's not daring.  _Or_ original.  ""They just don't want those jobs"" has _always_ been a spoken excuse for discrimination against women in the work place.  Discrimination is neglecting to hire based on their sex _even when they are choosing that career_.  No statistics on how much one sex wants one career or another will change the fact that what that employer is doing is discrimination.

You don't have to examine biology to find discrimination or rule it out.  All you need to look for is this: You have 100 positions to fill.  There are just as many qualified female applicants as there are male applicants. Yet they hire 95 males and 5 females.  Ask why.  If you rule out race and class and disability, and the only thing left is sex, you have found yourself a probable case of discrimination.  Then when you find the interviewers and company owners express patently misogynist views, you've clinched it.

&gt;Now we’re talking!   Let’s throw out the seemingly societal mandates and all that socialization and delve into actual differences, not perceptions or relative status, but the biology of the matter.   Pinker “…began to wonder what would happen if all the ‘shoulds’—the policy and political agendas—were shifted to the side for a moment to examine the science” (p. 5). 

Let the bullshit commence.

&gt;He read a line about gender differences out loud, and immediately launched into the SSSM explanation; “because that’s what girls are  told to do.”   Then he read farther.   He became quiet.

What a great way to disregard somebody's observation that people often only believe things because they were raised to as children, such as religion and gender stereotypes, than to say ""It's just PC"" or as this author puts it, ""SSSM.""

Her brother, you may note, does not have a doctorate in any of the fields that apply. So his ""oh..."" doesn't really mean much.

&gt;Pinker does more than dryly discuss the biology; she provides example after example of women who have succeeded in this “man’s world” and found it wanting.

Newsflash: rising to the top ranks among assholes doesn't eliminate what sucks about sexism.  Can we have a ""duh?""  This happens to people in all kinds of careers.

&gt;As Pinker explains, let’s move on past the idea that a woman can’t do the same work as a man, and discuss why she  may not want to.   Any woman who has wondered if her preferences run counter to the feminist cause should pay close attention here; believing that a woman should have every right to pursue the same goals as men is different from believing that every woman should want to.

Strawfeminist alert!  It is not feminist theory that women should automatically want to make the choices that they are now more free to make.  The point is that women that _do_ make the choice should not be punished for it.

There are no feminists out there saying, ""You should want to make it in a largely misogynist chauvinist company _and like it, damnit!_  It's a strawman to say that feminists are telling women to ignore misogyny, to make themselves not feel hurt by it, just because they can make it to the board of directors.

If you don't think that all the emotional, psychological, verbal, and physical abuse that tends to come with success in business, or the sheer emptiness of a
company life, is worth it, then more power to you for choosing integrity and self-worth over 'success'.  _That_ is the feminist message.

&gt;Time and again, Pinker points out how women have sought those goals, attained them, and then shifted their eyes to a different prize.   These “opt out” women can be found, as Pinker states, “in every major university, law, engineering, and accounting firm in North America and Europe” (p. 64).  

Again, people do this in every career in existence.  People go from, say, haliburton, to vice president. Or congressperson to CEO. Or chairman of one company to another company.  Maybe Burch means the women she's talking about go from finding success in a career, to settling down as a stay at home parent or a hourly wage job.  But she doesn't.  She leaves it vague, so you fill in the gap with whatever you think she's getting at.

Of course feminists are working on communicating with people on how we can change the way corporations, companies and other businesses do things and treat their workers so that women, non-whites, and other disparaged classes can find success without trading in their dignity.  But you won't find Burch or Pinker mentioning that.  The strawfeminist who's supposed to have invented the Fabio-advertised romance novel is more important.

&gt;However, it is just as important and just as outrageous an idea in today’s society that men are at a biological disadvantage, or for that matter, that males can top the charts in achievement for a reason other than an oppressive patriarchy. 

There's also religious, classicist, and racial discrimination, too.  Thanks for making yet another strawman argument that we think it's all just patriarchy turtles all the way down.  Turd.

&gt;Speaking of outrageous ideas, another common belief that is torpedoed is the concept of female solidarity or sisterhood.   Pinker “blows the lid off female aggression” (p. 220).   Girls are often taught that females bond together while males are cutthroat.

How many movies, tv-shows, radio programs, and blogs has Burch had to skip over, that say over and over that women are distrustful, traitorous bitches, to make this statement?  It is _not_ popularly believed that women stick together.

&gt;Pinker hypothesizes that it is linked to gender differences in depression, but admits that no study on this link has been published.

So Pinker is more than willing to make a grossly generalized statement about gender differences on a subject, but also admits that there's no study supporting it.  Know what we call that?  Bullshitting.  Bias.

And we're just supposed to be OK with it.

False,1426266257,0,0,t3_bmxas,LWRellim,1,t1_c0nlvht,,1,1270592242,economy,0,"&gt;I agree, but I must also add that the world prior to the industrial, medical and technological revolutions was a far different one than today (consumer driven economy, highly efficient farming and food surplus, average age into the 80's, communication technology, overwhelmingly powerful weapons, etc.). To say that the same level of taxation and government today would unequivocally be acceptable at the levels present prior to these things is not possible.

Actually, what has happened is that a lot of taxation has been *shifted*.

Whereas in previous era taxes were mainly on exports and imports (which were vastly lower in unit quantity) today taxes are mainly raised on domestic things.

And ridiculously, the vast majority of taxes are ""there and back"" in nature -- the local population is taxed by the Federal Government which then ""grants"" the money back to the States, which then ""distribute"" the money back down to the local county, and municipal levels.  

Meanwhile local *control* over the expenditures is also gone -- instead along with the stream of monies (which is really LOCAL money) comes a full laundry list of mandates and regulations.

**And some of this is highly relevant (for example) to your anger &amp; concerns over churches.**

What I mean is that for a lot of communities, their local public school was once a truly LOCAL thing -- it was not only created by, supported, controlled but responsive to local people; it was often a true ""community center"" around which a lot of activities focused (even those without children were often made to feel a part of the effort).

But, as local control has been reduced stage by stage -- and the schooling system has been used for a host of ""other"" purposes (many political in nature) -- it has also LOST it's ability to be a true community center (about the only remnant being the local ""sports"" teams, namely the football games and ""homecoming"" activities).

So where have people turned instead but the churches which have once again become much more than merely churches and instead (especially the trendy ""fundy-mega-churches"") are fulfilling a LOT of the roles of ""community centers"", integrating schools, day care, women's groups, men's groups, ""Book clubs"" and a host of other things (I know people who spend 4, 5, or even 6 out of 7 days/evenings engaged in one ""church"" activity or another -- most of them really *not* that religious in nature, although there is nearly always some ""purported"" religious aspect.)

Thing is that human beings have an inherent need and desire to be sociable -- and they prefer to CHOOSE who they are sociable with.

So when they had ""control"" over their local schools (and we are not merely taking about electing a slate of people to a board -- we're talking about a true community involvement here -- when schools were much smaller and more closely related to the neighborhood, rather than the massive consolidated mega-building major employers of the town); anyway back then people did not feel like a ""number"" they were INVOLVED and felt that there was much more of a give-and-take aspect.

But stage by stage, all of that has been taken away -- a combination of unions (which were at first merely local) and governments -- have bit by bit taken over the schooling system.  

So, instead of a local community center for the people to gather around, it has become a means of imposing federal and state ""political views"" down onto the population, indoctrinating the children (AND their families) into whatever the current governing regime believes is the most important ""fad"" of the day -- whether it is racial integration (let's buss the kids all over), environmental concerns (think Earth Day, ""Save the Forests"" etc), or national pride and GDP concerns (keeping up with the Soviets, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Europeans, ""No Child Left Behind"", etc.) -- or worst and most offensive of all, imposing the particular ""moral/ethical"" views of a subset of society onto everyone else (Planned Parenthood, AIDS, ""all sexual lifestyles are equal"" etc.)

Point is that the local community feels it has lost control of its center in its children and families -- that it has indeed been ""infiltrated"" with the equivalent of a Leninist/Stalinist ""five year plan"" mentality.

Hence the divisiveness of those things -- they do not spring up FROM the community (the local parents did not get together and by majority referendum decide that: ""Hey, we WANT our schools to focus on teaching our kids about sexuality."") -- but rather such things are ""imposed from above"" as if they were orders from a king with delusions of divine grandeur.

Is it really surprising then that there is a backlash?  Or that the backlash should become passionate, outraged or vociferous?

You yourself are testimony that the same is true from the opposite view -- you'll be DAMNED if you want to let Preacher X (from State A) dictate what your children should or should not learn in your local school in State Z.

Does that make sense?

I think that it does, and that the issue here is really NOT one of any particular issue/agenda, but rather -- at its root -- it is really about power and control; it is about the population feeling (validly so IMHO) it is being made increasingly *powerLESS* in the face of an ever-more-intrusive, and ever-less-accountable distant governing ""elite"" who have a threateningly unknown (unknowable, and therefore ""fear"" engendering) agenda.

Egads... I think the only people who WOULDN'T fear such a thing would be those who are in direct alignment with the (current) views being ""imposed"" -- and who are also foolish enough to think that they always WILL be in alignment with such things (if the Federal government has the ability to dictate the teaching that 2+2=5, what's to say that tomorrow an entirely different administration might not dictate something *else* that is even more inane or offensive).

That description doesn't cover Palestinian refugees at all. On the contrary, the Palestinian refugees fled the lands that became Israel precisely to avoid being ""in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals."" And even if the description did somehow cover them:

&gt; This provision shall in no way constitute an obstacle to the repatriation of protected persons, or to their return to their country of residence after the cessation of hostilities.

That clause wouldn't oblige Israel to accept anyone. It just says that the previously stated provisions wouldn't prohibit Israel from accepting them (assuming it was inclined to do so).

&gt; The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour, upon the close of hostilities or occupation, to ensure the return of all internees to their last place of residence, or to facilitate their repatriation.

Internees are people put in internment camps, like Dachau or the Gulags, for example. The Palestinians were never put in internment camps, so they're not covered under this provision.

&gt; You mean millions of Germans fled the Red Army knowing how they would be treated. 

Did you actually read that Wikipedia article on the mass expulsion of ethnic Germans? Many of them stayed through the war and were forcibly expelled afterward by the USSR, with express approval from the U.S. and UK. As for those that fled during the war in fear of the Red Army and were unable to return, isn't their case is even more comparable to that of the Palestinian refugees? After all, the latter fled mostly due to fear of the Israeli militias and were barred from returning. Therefore, my question still stands: why would the Palestinian refugees have a ""right of return"" but not the ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe?

&gt; As it stands Germany is united now and Germans, East or West, have a right to freedom of travel.

It's true that since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the eastward expansion of the European Union, the expellees and their descendants are free to visit their former homes. However, they have never been compensated for their confiscated property, and they have no right to citizenship in the countries from which they were expelled.

&gt;&gt; It's ridiculous to take international humanitarian law on refugee rights....

&gt; Laws protecting human rights are ridiculous?

I see, you took a sentence fragment out of context to make it look like I was denigrating human rights. Here, let me play the same stupid game with one of your sentences:

&gt; ...the Nazis were legitimate in what they did...

OMG, you think the Nazis acted legitimately!!!1!

In fact, what I said before was that it's ridiculous to take international refugee law as it exists today and apply it retroactively to situations that occurred before its creation. It's analogous to [ex post facto laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law), and it's just as problematic. If we agreed to do that, we'd have to accept the Cherokees' ""right of return"" and give Georgia back to them. 

My point is that Israel's obligations to the Palestinians who became refugees in 1947-49 are the same today as they were in the war's aftermath in 1949. And since the relevant precedent in 1949 was the treatment of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe, Israel doesn't have any such obligations.

The UK is a massive net contributor and yet the UK's trade deficit with the EU has grown.  Any funding from from the EU has to be met on a 1:1 basis but then, by that stage, where it is spent is already pretty much ear marked.  You can have the trade without all the waste.  Will Germany or Italy or France want to stop trading with the UK because they're only part of the EEA?  No, of course not.  It's the last thing they'd want in this climate but the UK would be in a much better place to redirect its resources and, at a time of such massive deficit, that's attractive.  

3.  There are 70 million people in the UK with 646 MPs.  There are 500 million people in the EU with 751 MPs.  That means the UK is 6x more representative than the EU is.  The EU is also far more costly per MP and much more difficult for respective countries to hold their MEPs accountable.  When one takes into account the complete diversity across Europe in nearly every regard, voting for anything either comes down to voting in blocs or strong arming.  They, the British people, might not understand the ins and outs of it but their instinct is right - it's far more aloof, less accountable and less representative of what is important to their locale. 

There are some good things about the EU; charters for fundamental and human rights springing to mind.   There's no reason why the UK needs the EU for that though, they could have not only done it on their own but gone charter+ too, setting the bar for their bigger cousins over the channel.",True,t1_c0nmgi7,True,,t5_2cneq,,c0nmgi7

So clearly the catholics have shifted incrementally and ever so slowly over many years closer to a protestant position on more minor issues. I don't think you would find many modern day catholics supporting the popes ability to declare holy war.

I think it is more dangerous to have a church with the only correct authoritative reading of the bible than have many groups with different readings of the bible, but hopefully willing to dialogue. Catholic unity comes at the expense of change being slow and the great authority being repeatedly abused. While the initial freeing of the bible into the vernacular lead to many excesses and incorrect readings of scripture it also made the world a far richer place theologically. Common people were able to discuss and dispute major issues of the Christian life and salvation, and how to work these things practically. Before all they could do was honor relics and hope the priest had things sorted, an eminently unbiblical approach.

The assertion that anybody educated could speak latin and so the bible wasn't as restricted as you might think is also a nonsense!

It's important to remember that, whilst France is a western country, it is quite unique, and different in many ways to the UK or the USA. France has a very long history of cultural ""xenophobia"" - they reject imported English words ([particularly for new ideas and concepts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7540588/French-government-picks-new-words-to-replace-English.html)) in favour of creating their own, for instance. I believe there may even be a government department dedicated to pushing this agenda.

Since the Revolution France has had very strong employment laws, which would probably be incredible to an American. There is no such thing as ""at will"" employment, and it's practically impossible to fire someone from a job. Even if an employee in a fast food restaurant is caught red-handed with his fingers in the till, it will take a year of tribunals and appeals to finally dismiss him fully, and the employer is responsible for paying his wages throughout this process.

This has a massive follow-on effect on industry and the economy as a whole. Employers are just *very* cautious about taking on new staff - that becomes a very slow and protracted process. You are expected to pursue a career in the same field for life, and change jobs no more frequently than every 5 or 6 years. Here in the UK I can easily walk out on a job I hate and find something else (when the economy is ok) tomorrow, but that doesn't work in France - someone with spells of 6 months of employment at different jobs would be viewed very suspiciously.

Employers in France are very cautious, and even for a bar or waiting job, they would *much* rather employ Philippe who has worked at the same restaurant across town for the last 5 years than any unknown quantity. When you consider that a mistake could cost you - as the employer - a year's wages, this caution is quite understandable, but it also means that a white caucasian with a French name has much better job prospects than an immigrant.

*(Incidentally, this informs many other workplace practices, and the national culture of workplace lassitude. Why do you get shitty service in France? Because the employee can't be sacked. Why does the employer tolerate this? Because it's better than the hassle of finding  someone else for the job, and the risk of employing someone worse. The French have short working hours mandated by law, anyway, but you will* not *see office workers performing unpaid overtime.)*

The French have had some immigration (I'm not sure the figures) over the last half century from their North African colonies (which they pulled out of, with some obligation to locals) and from elsewhere. Their unemployment rate has been at around the 10% mark *for the last 5 years*, but further it is about 50% higher among arabs, muslims and other immigrants. These ""undesirables"" end up in ghetto tower-block housing complexes (""the projects"" in American terms?), and there are obviously problems associated with this concentration of no-hopers. In the north of Paris there were riots a couple of years ago, which were quite serious and reported internationally.

Your dismissive statement of ""threats to national security"" is quite uninformed.

My point was only that given the same wind condition it would always be preferable _not_ to build them in a colder climate because making the things work properly in a cold climate actually adds to both initial costs and maintenance costs in effect increasing energy costs. In the very north of Europe where icing is a problem it can significantly reduce the output of the turbines. Of cause there is not always icing, but if there is you can be 100% sure the reduced output comes right when you need increased output.

http://www.fmi.fi/research_meteorology/meteorology_9.html

This research paper from Finland illuminates the problem. As ice builds the effectiveness of the blades and thus the power output can be reduced from 20-50%. You can add heaters, use chemicals etc to hinder ice building but all of this adds costs. Depending on what type of system you use to neutralize the icing problem it will reduce your power output / revenues by 3-5%. The infrastructure to transport the electricity effectively is already in place with a lot lower costs to do the transportation than 3-5%.

In a competitive market a 3-5% difference in margin is the difference between being profitable or going broke.

Thus for any company who's considering building a wind farm it should always _try_ to find good spots without any potential icing problems. This would increase their profit margin and it would enable them to produce power when other competing companies may have reduced output because if icing.

And mainly U.S. and Western Europe. 1) I imagine the movie piracy issue mirrors music piracy. There are plenty of studies that show music pirates are the biggest spenders on music. I think this is probably similar with the movie industry, the only difference being that the movie industry has rental/streaming services as an alternative to purchasing a copy.

2) Also, anecdotally, I think people here forget that they a relatively small minority of tech savvy early adopters. My gf is 20 and couldn't figure out how to pirate a movie if her life depended on it. Neither can any of her friends. My parents aren't going around downloading movies. No one I work with downloads movies ... one very unsavvy woman buys pirated hardcopies on occasion, but she also sees tons of movies in the theatre.

Also, look at the big box stores like Walmart and Target, which I happen to know are the major sources of sales for DVDs. They lowered their DVD prices to be a loss leader to get people in the store because they had studies that showed those that bought DVDs ended up with a larger purchase in the store overall. Now new releases are $9.99 - $14.99. These stores in turn put pressure on the studios to lower their wholesale price, so there's some lost margin there. So the studios tried to come out with Blu-ray and sell it for $30. People just don't see the value.

As far as Asia, yes piracy seems to be having a real impact, but I don't really know enough about it in that part of the world.

Edit: Also, look at what the studios are really saying and doing, instead of the MPAA. Disney's Bob Iger has stated many times recently that they need to offer movies in ways that the consumer wants it. He restructured his entire studio team recently because of this.

1.  I don't deny that Native Americans have a culture.
2.  I don't deny that African Americans have a culture.

But here is the rub, whereas African American culture has become part of the mix and can be recognised as such by outsiders, (I am English by the way). Native American culture has not been adopted by mainstream US.  Sure it exists, but how many non-Native Americans would regard it as their own ?

To try and put another perspective on it.  Consider Gypsies in the UK.
They have a culture, they live in the UK.  But their culture is not adopted by the rest of the UK, we just don't practice it, it is not relevant to us.
Contrast that with say West Indian, Indian or Chinese culture, all of them have parts that have been adopted by the mainstream culture in the UK.  In other words, we British have chosen (because we liked them) to add elements of these cultures to our own to make the the culture of the UK what it is today.

In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that about 1.0 percent of the U.S. population was of American Indian or Alaska Native descent.
Maybe you call 1% a large percentage of a population, I don't think many would.

It is not only Europeans who have difficulties with indigenous people.
Take a look at China to see how the dominant Han Chinese deal with them, or the way India deals with the Hill tribes or those on the Andaman islands, or the way the Zulus dealt with the bushmen. 

Finally, not everything is to be taken deadly seriously.  America's ""lack of culture"" is a common enough comment, it probably derives from the crassness that even non-Native-Americans accept about elements of non-Native-American US culture.

First, at the end of Clinton's term, only about 9 years ago, the US was running a surplus fast enough that the bond market was afraid that too soon there would be no more T-bills to buy.  Yes, W blew it, wiped out the surplus, and ran a deficit.  But he ran a deficit of about 3% of GDP which is at the upper end of what is considered *sustainable*.  It was dumb, and I hated it, but it didn't ruin, or threaten to ruin, the country.

Second, look at the national debt as a fraction of GDP at the end of WWII.  We paid it off quickly.  The national debt is comparatively much smaller now.  We can pay it off, also.

For the $60 trillion and related numbers, the people who scream this are just lying with nonsense accounting.  They imagine that the US is like a company that is obligated to pay out $60 trillion over the next so many decades.  So, by standard accounting, would have to show the $60 trillion as a long term *liability* on the balance sheet.   Then the company would see if it had a way to *fund* that liability.  If not, then the company would say that they had a $60 trillion *unfunded liability*, and that would be **bad**.  We would say that the company was essentially worthless.

Actually the $60 trillion might be just the net present value calculated with some assumed interest rate.  Whatever.  

But this use of accounting is just lying with accounting.  The reason is, the US has an *asset*, a way to *fund* the *liability*,
an *asset* no company could count on their balance sheet.

Exercise:  Guess what that *asset* is!

Hint:  Think babies.  While making them is fun, having them is just **crucial** to your Social Security and Medicare.

Solution:  Right:  Your retirement will be paid for by earnings of people working while you are retired, people who are babies, or not yet born, or in foreign countries and not yet in the US.  That's the *asset* that *funds* the $60 trillion *liability*.  

Uh, don't hold your breath waiting for the US to go broke due to either the current national debt, the current deficit, or the $60 trillion unfunded Social Security and Medicare liability.

That said, very much the US needs to get back to what Clinton did.  We shouldn't go back yet because that would cause more unemployment.  Really, what's just **crucial** is just what the law says that the Fed should do:  Maximize economic growth with only very low inflation.  Well, can't maximize economic growth with a huge fraction of the labor force standing around looking for work.  So, for economic growth, have to **get people back to work**.  

How to do that?  Have the Fed loan money to the banks.  Then the banks can loan money to businesses.  

Does this work?  Will vodka make a party come alive?

Yes of course, many of the slaves were war captives and africans sold by other africans. But the african system of slavery (which was in place long before any contacts with europe) was not the same as the chattel bondage practiced in the new world.  African slaves weren't beat to death and raped on a whim, they had rights and especially if they were war captives were eventually allowed to become citizens of what ever nation they were enslaved to, they could hold property as well. But true enough the europeans could never have gotten a foothold and then overrun the place without the help of the people already there.  there's plenty of blame for everyone.  But let's be realistic and not not to sugarcoat history.  The vast majority of slavers were europeans.  they used african agents sometimes and made deals with warring states, but the trade was financed , run and fueled by europe and later america.  I suggest if you ever take a trip to africa go to some of the old european slave holding areas/forts on the west coast where the slaves were held in dungeons before being stacked on the ships.

 But please don't think  that a bunch of feeble weaklings could survive a trans-atlantic trip in the hold of a ship and then work under back breaking conditions and survive, it's not possible.

In this instance, the pilots reasonably believe the people are hostiles and they've properly engaged in a conflict. It looks like an RPG, they look like guns. It is unfortunate these were innocent people, but a reasonable person in their position, with their knowledge, and with their expertise and experience can make the same conclusions.

It wasn't here, wasn't my hometown, and not my loved ones. I can't empathize because I don't know what it is like. I can sympathize with a soldier and the position he is put in. I can also sympathize with the families when a mistake like this happens. 

You example isn't relevant. The defense for superior orders was used almost carte blanche on the crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace charges. Nazi war officials were more likely to accept culpability for their failures in their treatment of POWs because even the Nazi German Field Manual had the standards governing war. The crimes against humanity were entirely created at the time of the trial, and everyone pointed their fingers up because those found liable were likely to be found guilty and executed for their heinous acts.

Simply pointing out ""oh yeah, they used defense of superior orders"" doesn't work when you drag it out of context. No one in the SS wanted to accept responsibility for the Nazi Death Camps. Even then, the Nazis tended to treat Western European POWs significantly different than the Soviet POWs that were deemed racially inferior and an obstacle to lebensraum, and treated them the same as the Jews in Ghettos and Concentration Camps.

Again, what I'm stating is that situations are significantly different. You've done nothing but draw false parallels for the sake of argument due to a legal argument to be made at ""trial."" Your unreasonableness to look at the difference of events is just as problematic.

What is probably a BETTER parallel to be making is what happened in Vietnam. A massacre at Mi Lai versus something like this. What did the soliders/pilots know, when did they know it, what could they have been reasonably expected to know, etc. Look at the situation from the pilots view, don't read the words coming out of their mouth and discount the source, and then come back and tell me it is a war crime. I don't think it is. It's sad. It is a mistake. It is a grave mistake. 

I'm honestly shocked at the number of people and the anger about this video when you compare it to known instances when American soldiers walked into a home, raped the daughters, and then killed the parents.

If you look at minutes of use, the average American uses their cell phone four times as much—four times as much—as the average European.

What I've heard about Europe is people tend to text more than talk. They also have predefined protocols for communicating without talking. Like you call and let it ring once then immediately hang up. That means you're outside waiting.

The American market is a chatterbox. Older folks tend to prefer to ""call"" than to text and Verizon and friends decided to jack up the rates on texting to encourage voice calls instead. I mean, you can't get a cell phone plan in the States without paying for some amount of minutes. Only recently, ""pay as you go"" plans have started to hit the market. Before that you were stuck with a monthly voice plan where the bare minimum number of minutes seemed to actually target the average. 

But of course you prepaid for those minutes up front, and next month they basically disappear so you might as well use them anyway... In early 2000 this was common practice. Towards the end of the month you'd have random people calling each other because they were trying to expend their monthly minutes.

These days though, the younger generation will prefer texts to voice. I seem to have much better conversations with younger people (early twenties and younger) over text than I do on the phone or even in person. And it is starting to creep into the older folks. I can reasonably expect anyone in the mid-thirties and younger to have texting turned on and accept unlimited texts.


Personally, if I could get a phone *without* a voice plan, I'd do so. I'd then use VOIP to handle those pesky voice mails and phone conversations.

Why is Christianity getting lots of coverage in recent weeks eh?  Probably because of the breaking news of the Pope's links to systematic pedophilia in the Catholic church?  A few weeks and the focus will change.  

&gt;I don't think Islam has been copping it harder since 9/11 on /r/atheism.

Your opinion is sharply divergent from reality in this matter.  For instance every Islamic honour killing and each Islamic terrorism story gets heavily covered in /r/atheism as do attempts to implement Sharia law in the EU.  Your assertion that Christianity is the most heavily criticised religion in /r/atheism is completely and utterly wrong.

&gt;&gt; *(edit)*  It could be that /r/atheism postdated 9/11 in which case your claim ""I don't think Islam has been copping it harder since 9/11 on /r/atheism."" would be technically accurate since nothing would have been getting posted to the non-existant /r/atheism before 9/11.  


As for your cherrypick search, nothing about that is accurate.  Many submissions don't list those keywords.  for example you could have added shiite, sharia, koran, quran, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sharia and so on to the Islam side and bible, Catholocism, Mormon, prop-8 and so on to the Christian side.

&gt; Unfortunately even Jackson failed to grasp the entire picture and true cause.
Although Jackson had killed the central bank, the most insidious weapon of The Money Changers, fractional reserve banking, remained in use by the numerous state charted bank. This fuelled economic instability in the years before the civil war. Still the central bankers were out and as a result America thrived as an expanded west worth. During this time, the principal Money Changers struggled to regain their lost centralized power but to no avail.Then finally they referred to the old central bankers formula: war to create debt and dependency.
If they couldn't get their central bank any other way, America could be brought to its knees by plunging it into a civil war just as if they had done in 1812 after The First Bank of The United States was not recharted.

&gt; One month after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, the first shots of the American Civil War were fired here at Fort Sumter South Carolina on April 12 1861. Certainly slavery was ""a"" cause for the civil war but not the primary cause.Lincoln knew that the economy of the south depended upon slavery and so before the civil war he had no intention of eliminating it. Lincoln had put it this way in his inaugural address only one month earlier:
&gt;* ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.""*

&gt;Even after the first shots were fired here at fort Sumter, Lincoln insists that the civil war was not about the slavery:
&gt;*""My paramount objective is to save the Union, and it is 'not' either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.""*

&gt; So what was the civil war all about?
There were many factors at play. Northern industrialist had used protective tariffs to prevent the southern states from buying cheaper European goods. Europe retaliated by stopping cotton imports from the south.
The southern states were in a double financial bind. They were forced to pay more for most of the necessities of life while their income from cotton export plummeted. The south was angry.

&gt; But there were other factors at work. The Money Changers were still stunned, by Americans withdrawal from their control, 25 years earlier. Since then America's wildcat economy had made the nation rich, a bad example for the rest of the world. The central bankers now saw an opportunity to split the rich new nation, to divide and conquer by war. Was this just some sort of wild conspiracy theory at the time?

&gt; Well, let's take a look at what a well places observer of the scene had to say at the time.
His name was Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Germany, the man who united the German states a few years later. 

&gt;*""The division of the United States into federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the high financial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained as one block, and as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world.""* - Otto von Bismarck

&gt; Within months after the first shots here at Fort Sumter, the central bankers loaned Napoleon III of France, the nephew of the Waterloo Napoleon, 210 million francs to seize Mexico and station troops along the southern border of the U.S., taking advantage of their war, to violate the Monroe doctrine and return Mexico to colonial rule. No matter what the outcome of the civil war, a weakened America, heavily indebted to The Money Changers would open up central and south America again to European colonisation and domination.
The very thing, America's Monroe doctrine had forbade in 1823.

&gt; At the same time, Great Britain moved 11.000 troops into Canada and positioned them menacingly along America's northern border. The British fleet went to war alert, should a quick intervention be called for.
Lincoln knew he was in a double bind. That's why he agonised over the faith of the Union. There was a lot more to it than just differences between the north and the south. That's why his emphasis was always on 'union', and not merely the defeat of the south.

&gt; But Lincoln needed money to win. In 1961, Lincoln and his secretary of the treasury, Salmon T. Chase, went to New York to apply for the necessary loans. The Money Changers anxious to see the Union fail, **offered loans at 24 to 36% interest.** Lincoln said, thanks, but no thanks and returned to Washington. Lincoln sent for an old friend colonel Dick Tailor of Chicago, and put him on the problem of financing the war. During one meeting Lincoln asked Tailor, what discovered.

&gt; Tailor put it this way:
*""Why, Lincoln, that is easy: just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes ... and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also.""*

&gt; When Lincoln asked if the people of United States would accept the notes Tailor said:
*""The people or anyone else will not have any choice in the matter, if you make them full legal tender. They will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money; as Congress is given that express right by the Constitution.""*

&gt; So that's exactly what Lincoln did. In 1862-63 he printed up $450 million worth of the new bills.

It sounds like I'm reading from a Marx textbook, but I hope you get the point. They simply did not have time to grow the social institutions like in the West, wherein people would be able to get their message across without necessarily killing each other.

Please keep in mind that these are my personal experiences and I could easily be wrong in many of those cases. Long story short: it's not easier elsewhere in the world.

It varies tremendously by country. Canada/UK (and maybe Australia/NZ?) are closest to the US system. Because of the various exchange rates, salaries (converted to US$) in Canada are competitive, while they're a bit low in the UK. Finding a job in these countries is maybe slightly easier than in the USA, but not by much. I heard one Canadian university had 300 applications for one position last year, on par with US universities.

Switzerland has amazingly good salaries and working conditions. It's probably the best academic environment on the planet. Of course, that means that it's really hard to get a job there. I don't know the German and Austrian markets well. I think it's pretty civilized, but also very competitive. The Scandinavian systems appear to be reasonable. In most of those cases, you basically have to speak whatever language they speak in order to get a job.

A lot of the other EU countries (France, Italy, maybe Spain and Portugal) have lots of problems. The salaries are around 30K$ per year or less for an assistant professor-type position. Furthermore, the application process is often really hairy, and they tend to only hire their own citizens. In France, the invitation to an interview is a time and a date (something like ""Tuesday from 2pm to 3pm""). You get to pay for your own travel. I'll bet they don't get too many transcontinental applicants.

So all of the countries outlined above have more or less the same problem with the job market and it's very hard to get a TT or permanent job, for various reasons. In all cases, the selection process is difficult. In addition, some countries clearly favor their own citizens and then you're just out of luck.

Then there's the weird countries.

I don't know much about Latin America, other than the salaries are low.

I have very little understanding of the Japanese market. It seems to me like they have good salaries. On the other hand, I think the way to become a prof there is to do your Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo. Then, your Ph.D. advisor calls someone somewhere and you get a job. I'm not even sure that they know how to write a letter of recommendation.

There's some weird stuff going on in some third world countries. I think it's ""easier"" to get a TT or permanent job there, in the sense that you don't have to be super qualified, but again it may be very difficult unless you are very well connected inside that country. I know of some people who weren't able to cut cheese in the USA who then went to some North African countries and they were fine.

China... I think they also prefer Chinese citizens, unless you're a real star. I'm told that the salaries are real low, and it's best to be buddies with someone in the communist party. However, if you're a real international star, they can suddenly offer you a salary that's way higher than what you'd get in the USA. You end up making ten times more than the other people in the department.

Those are all the countries I heard about.

Africa has had some really fucked up social problems, particularly in regard to mass internal violence against civilians.  We can't pretend that western culture hasn't been very good at preventing that kind of thing.

What western culture *has* done though is to kill the shit out of other white countries, and to a far greater degree to rob, kill and destroy non-white people with less advanced technology.

So again it's a subjective thing.  I didn't meant to say that Africans are bad because they don't always fit into western culture as easily as whites, for reasons that are (I believe) at least in part due to genetics.

I can't really say whether whites have it worse with their families or not, but I've certainly met my fair share of white people with family problems.

It is notable that black people have notoriously had a problem with absentee fathers, so I think that family strife may be a common element for all races to some degree.

You're mistaking me for someone else, and my point for something else.  I didn't mean ""look at those silly black people"".  Of course I recognize that white people have status symbols and fancy clothing and the rest. 

But there is a definite flair to young black culture and dress that I believe has its roots in Africa and in their genetics.  I think a big shiny gold necklace sets of the same pleasurable senses in their brains that a headdress of brightly colored feathers would have a few hundred years ago.

Anyway... people on reddit hate it when someone says that they believe there are genetic differences between the races other than skin color and a few other superficial traits.

My story begins on a quiet night a few months after my wife and I had moved into our house. It had been a lovely evening. We had dinner followed by a candle-lit bath and were now lying in bed talking. All of a sudden I saw a glowing ball of light floating 6 feet off the ground at the end of the bed. It was about 8 inches in diameter and seemed to be swirling with colors. Before I could pinch myself to see if I had fallen asleep the orb suddenly dropped straight through the floor and was gone.

There was a long silence before I looked over at my wife and hesitantly asked ""Did you see...?""
""I saw it too."" she replied before I could finish. ""Oh, thank god."" I said. ""I thought for a moment I was losing my mind."" We puzzled over what it could have been and my wife concluded that our new house was haunted. As I said before I am very skeptical of the ""supernatural"", but I was stymied this time. Two sane and sober eyewitnesses with no ulterior motives is fairly convincing evidence.

It had occurred to me that what we had seen was very similar to what I have heard described as will-o-the-wisps. These are seen in peat bogs in Europe and are caused by methane gas that is released from the decomposing peat. Since my bedroom is quite bereft of peat bogs I puzzled over the strange event off and on for the next six months until I happened upon an interesting (although circuitous) connection.

When I'm bored, I like to get on Wikipedia and link from article to article... you know... for fun. (stop snickering. Where else can you learn all about the Zoot Suit Riots?) In any case I was reading about the band The Foo Fighters. The band takes their name from a slang term coined during WWII by US pilots. Occasionally glowing lights would be seen on the tips of the wings while flying or floating balls of light around cloud formations. Pilots called these phenomenon ""foo fighters"".

That article led me to one about St. Elmo's Fire (not the 80's brat pack movie of the same name), which comes from the 16-1700's. Sailors on old wooden sailing ships would sometimes report seeing ""fire"" at the tips of the mast. The St. Elmo bit was, I suppose, because St. Elmo is the patron saint of sailors.

It turns out that there is a common connection between St. Elmo's Fire, Foo Fighters, Will-o-the-wisps, and my experience. Something very similar to all of these can be created using ozone, fire, and an agitator. Ozone is heated and then exposed to very cold air and the oxygen molecules in the ozone disassociate quickly releasing a glow.

Interestingly I had an air purifier in my office at the time of this event. I was too poor to buy the nice Ionic Breeze, so I bought the cheaper knockoff Ionic Pro. The downside to the Ionic Pro is that it creates a lot of ozone. Mine was running on high in my office which is directly across the hall from my bedroom (the door to the bedroom being at the foot of the bed). My wife had a scented candle burning on a table at the foot of the bed leftover from the bath. Coincidentally, the air conditioner vent is also at the foot of the bed.

Ozone from the cheap air purifier being heated by the candle and drifting up into the cold air from the AC vent is a pretty good way to get a glowing ball of light. So I still don't believe in ghosts, but I do enjoy a good mystery. If I had forgone the investigation and jumped to the conclusion that I had witnessed a supernatural event I would have missed out on learning some very interesting things about the world we live in. I hope that if you are witness to an amazing event (or hear of one) you will remember that there is a distinction between ""unexplained"" and ""inexplicable"" and if you take a skeptical look at it maybe you will make a great discovery too.

It also discourages spending in China for the average worker. Thus you have a distorted system where Chinese low skilled semi-slave labor makes cheap products and the US consumer buys them on credit (because their job went to China). 

A truly free global market of the economists isn't one we are anywhere close to. Like perfect competition or a communist Utopia it is something that is likely not possible given the state of global affairs. It would require political and economic revolutions which societies are so very much opposed to from every country. 

It's worth noting that the extreme economic growth that North America saw in the 20th century is more of an anomaly than any sort of super-power endowed to capitalism. The US's industrial base after WWII remained relatively intact. Meanwhile Europe was split between a semi-industrialized Russia and a war footing America to buy products. The US had a capital advantage and countless European consumers looking to rebuild infrastructure after the desolation of WWII.

Now it's not impossible for renewed growth to occur for North American manufacturing. But it requires selling stuff to countries that need industrial products. And unfortunately our current economic system favors a form of mercantalism where finished goods are produced in developed countries and sold to developing ones at high mark-ups. If the poor people are going to buy American goods they'll need to have strong economies to purchase our goods.

That's the principle of trade. That trade be mutually beneficial. Unfortunately, powerful interests have co-opted trade towards concentrating wealth in a select few individuals. The idea that wealth is created by accellerating it to the top has been proven false and I think we can all agree is certainly not free.

One of the biggest mistakes I think that progressives have made is conceding the concept of 'free' markets to the neocons. What is free about a market controlled by business people who were put in place by a foreign army? What is free about a market where some farmers in a wealthy country get countless subsidies and thus flood poorer nations with cheap grain surplus destroying domestic food production? What is free about a health care system where insurers are protected from anti-trust legislation?

The problem isn't free markets. It's not even global markets. It's not even greed. It's spite pure and simple. It's people who'd rather themselves be worse off if it means that they can be better than others. ",True,t1_c0npkvq,False,,t5_2qh3v,,c0npkvq

No it's not. English is absolutely easy, maybe learning to write and be fluent it's hard. But to get to a conversational level. Think about it, verbs and nouns don't change independent of tense and gender . There are a few irregular verbs (Go - went) and you need to learn a few suffixes (ing, ed, s) but they apply to all words, both genders in that tense (Again, only a few irregulars) In fact, the endings are an advantage because you can completely make up verbs just by adding them to convey and exclusive meaning which makes sense in that context. English is extremely flexible. In other latin languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and French (possibly Italian and Romanian too) the verb changes depending on tense, gender and pronoun. Just as example take the verb walk.

**In English:** I walk, you walk, he walks, she walks, they walk, we walk.

**In Portuguese:** Eu caminho, Tu caminhas, Ele caminha, Ela caminha, Eles caminham, Nos caminhamos, Vos caminha (Actually, I don't know how to conjugate the verb here).

Now take when you are referring to something. You say a table, the table or a stove, the stove. Easy. In other languages you need to consider whether the noun is feminine or not. Table (Mesa) is feminine because it ends with an 'a' so you say '*a* mesa'. A stove is masculine (Fogão) so you say '*o* fogão'. Same with adjectives, you change the ending depending on gender. I'd say portuguese is simple enough generally speaking if a word ends with anything but 'a' it's masculine. French though, god, French is a bitch for this.

Then you have loads of rules of pronounciation, spelling (ch, nh, lh, rr, ss, ç) and accents  (ão, â, à, á). Another funzie? The 'H' in portuguese is completely mute, you hardly ever pronounce it, normally only when paired with another letter like above. But we still use it for spelling. AWESOME We have more than 5 different tenses and in general the language is very complicated. To give you an idea, the Brazilian government actually simplified the language about 2 years ago, trying to get rid of a few accents and weird spelling. I don't think it went down very well though, seems most people still use the old style. 

My biggest struggles with english are pronouncing words like 'two' because I pronounce the 'w', words with 'on' and 'om' like monkey (Pronounced manky) and 'donkey' (danky) and prepositions. Prepositions I find quite difficult to get used to. Are you on a bus or in a bus? That sorta thing I get mixed up constantly still.

Even if the spelling in English is hard, now that I'm learning French I can bitch about their spelling which is the most bizarre non-sense I've ever encoutered. Sounds beautiful but fuck,  a word with one phoneme normally has about 3 or 4 syllables. If I had to criticise english for anything it would be that because it's simple, the writing is not as light and as descriptive as other languages. French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc all have words for all sorts of colours, nuances, feelings and sentiments whether with English I find quite hard to be as descriptive. In my english class we had to write a short story once and my teacher said that he'd be able to say I'm South American by my writing style alone which was light, full of emotions and very descriptive according to him.

If you want another example, portuguese has one of the hardest words to translate to any other language, the word (saudade) describes the feeling and the particular sadness of missing someone or something. 'I miss you' is not the same, but the closest translation in English.

This is something that Interlingue wouldn't have.

That's an important point. Actually Tolkien made the same point before too, saying that Esperanto/Ido/etc. are effectively dead languages because they don't have legends, or a kind of atmosphere of their own. It's also the point that this group makes:

http://dnghu.org/Indo-European-Language-Europe/

They intend to revive Proto-Indo-European, not constructed to be easy to learn but just reconstructed as accurately as possible. Due to that they've already gotten a fair amount of attention from the academic world even though the language is almost impossible to use at the moment. It's possible if you're a PIE scholar (I have a friend that can do it) but otherwise, not yet.

But!

All is not lost for constructed languages, because after Avatar came out a tens of thousands of people gathered to try to learn the Na'vi language in spite of the fact that its creator wasn't (and still isn't) permitted to publish a grammar and dictionary. The amount of attention Na'vi has gotten is something a language like Occidental (and even Esperanto) would kill for. Na'vi speaking Occidental wouldn't have cut it of course, since it wouldn't be the least bit believable, but a language like Occidental could take place in a movie more along the lines of Pirates of the Caribbean or something else like that. Just appearing in a movie isn't enough though (Esperanto appears in movies from time to time, but that doesn't seem to do much for it); people would have to associate the language with some sort of escapism that nothing else can provide. Elvish = imagining being an elf, Na'vi = imagining living on Pandora, etc.

What that is though is hard to say. A lot of people even thought Avatar was going to be a flop before it came out, so it's tough to judge what is going to inspire people and what isn't. In the meantime Occidental just needs some more real basic things like a more comprehensive course for beginners, and we can think about Occidental legends later on.

Ah, one other approach that I find works from time to time: [selling Occidental as the successor to Latin.](http://www.pagef30.com/2010/02/sneaky-roundabout-way-to-reintroduce.html) I'm considering a really heavy emphasis on that.

The best way to choose between opposing views is by referring to your fundamental principles. As I see it, in the case of the B&amp;B owners v. the gay couple there are two opposing principles:

* What goes on in your own home is nobody's business
* Discrimination is wrong

To decide between these rules, you have to decide which is more fundamental. The first one is breached by fire regulations and other healthy and safety rules which apply as soon as you use your home as a business. So it is obviously not a primary rule. 

If you do not feel comfortable applying the fire regulations (which are really quite onerous) to your home, you don't use your home as business premises. The anti discrimination legislation applies in the same way, if you don't feel comfortable conforming to this legislation in your home, don't use your home as business premises.

Moreover, they claimed France until much later - early nineteenth century, if I remember correctly.  This was not just ""parts of France"", which is why I said ""at the very least"".  Obviously the were not the de facto rulers, but if the map is going to allow the silly Antarctic claim, why not their other silly claims, too.

And claims on things like the Oregon Territory were significantly less silly than claims on France.

To be clear, it's fine with me if you want to say that these things are not part of the ""British Empire""; my main point is that both that term and the contents of this map are somewhat arbitrary, not that these things were definitively parts of them.

As a side note, I don't think you're correct when you say that ""the French lands were part of the same kingdom as Britain"".  There are two different points here, neither of which back this contention:

First, in the early period, the French lands ruled by the King of England were, in a legal sense, ruled by him under his title of Duke of Normandy (and certain other French titles), *not* under his separate title of King of England.  As Duke of Normandy, he was theoretically a vassal of the King of France.  As King of England, he was not.

In fact, two *different* sons of William the Conqueror inherited the two titles, and the two lands.  These two titles were later reunited into a single person, but they were (and remain to this day) separate titles.  

This is actually a fairly common occurrence in European royalty; a single person holds lots and lots of titles that are, legally, completely separate, and could theoretically devolve to separate people.  In fact, this was the case with what is now the UK, and continues to be the case with the British Commonwealth:

Scotland and England were two *entirely separate* kingdoms until 1707.  They happened to have the same monarch.  They then became a single kingdom - ""the Kingdom of Great Britain"" - by a law that was passed in both of their legislatures.

Same with Ireland until 1800 - the ""Kingdom of Great Britain"" and the ""Kingdom of Ireland"" were separate kingdoms, which happened to be ruled by the same person.  Then they became a single kingdom, by a law that was passed in both their legislatures.

Similarly, the current Commonwealth countries share the same monarch, but they are entirely different kingdoms, and the monarchies thereof could theoretically, legally devolve to separate individuals.

Anyway, back to my ""side note"", here's point two of it:

That was the case early on - the lands actually ruled in France were ruled as ""Duke of Normandy"".  But later, the English kings actually claimed kingship of France (again, as a separate kingdom), through their interpretation of the legal succession to that throne.

And, in fact, one French king (Charles VI) willed the French crown to the then-king of England (Henry V) and his descendants; to be clear, this was *after* the English kings had claimed the crown in the first place (Henry then changed his title from ""King of France"" to ""Heir of France"" while waiting for Charles to pass away).  Henry VI (son of V) eventually did actually inherit the French throne, was actually crowned King of France (in Paris), and did actually rule much of France de facto.

Charles VII (the son of Charles VI) and his backers claimed that it wasn't within Charles' authority to will away the kingdom, and so continued to claim the throne, and eventually drove the English out.  But no one disputes that Charles VI *did* will away the kingdom, and from the point of view of the English, they were the legal kings of France, and continued to be even after they were driven out by (what they saw as) a pretender to the throne.  But in any case, as relates to your claim which I am disputing, ""King of England"" and ""King of France"" were most definitely considered to be, by everyone, two entirely separate things, with two entirely separate sets of perks and authorities, and with, in theory, two entirely separate means of inheritance.  In the view of the English, these two entirely separate things happened to be held by the same individual, but no one, not even the English, disputed that they were two entirely separate things.",True,t1_c0npxqb,False,,t5_2qh0u,,c0npxqb

Interesting the Vatican is TWELVE!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America
n Mexico, the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18, while the minimum age of consent varies between 12 and 18, according to state laws. In Mexico, criminal legislation is shared between the federal and state governments. The Federal law establishes the age of 12 as the minimum age at which states can legislate upon; however there may be local state laws that override the federal law. In practice though, the decision as to whether or not to prosecute is left to state authorities regardless of the younger person's age.
Federal Law

The age of consent in Mexico is complex. Typically, Mexican states have a ""primary"" age of consent (which may be as low as 12), and sexual conduct with children below that age is always illegal. Sexual relations between adults and teenagers are left in a legal gray area: laws against adults ""corrupting"" minors may be used sometimes to punish such sexual encounters, as well as laws against engaging in sexual relations with ""chaste and honest"" teenage girls by means of ""seduction"". These laws are situational and are subject to interpretation.

Canada

The Tackling Violent Crime Act took effect on 1 May 2008, raising the age of consent to 16 from 14.[3]

There exist two close in age exemptions, depending on the age of the younger partner. A youth of twelve or thirteen can consent to sexual activity with an individual no more than two years older than them. A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old can consent to sexual activity with a partner who is no more than five years older than them

Anal intercourse

Section 159 of the Criminal Code sets the age of consent for anal intercourse at 18 years, with an exception if the two partners are married. However, courts in Ontario (1995) and Quebec (1998) have independently declared Section 159 of the Criminal Code of Canada (Anal Intercourse) unconstitutional.
History

During the 19th century, the age of consent for heterosexual vaginal sex was 12, in 1890, the Parliament raised the age of consent to 14.[4] The punishment for anyone who had sexual intercourse with a child younger than 14 was life imprisonment and whipping, while the punishment for anyone who only attempted to seduce an underage girl was two years' imprisonment and whipping.[5] Canada had also laws against ""seducing"" minor girls who were over the age of consent. In 1886, a law was enacted which made the ""seduction"" of a girl over 12 and under 16 ""of previously chaste character"" a criminal offence; the ""seduction"" of a female under 18 ""under promise of marriage"" was also made illegal in 1886, and amended in 1887 to apply to females under 21.[6] After the raising of the age of consent to 14, the laws against ""seducing"" minor girls were amended to apply to those older than 14, and various laws of this kind have remained in force through the 20th century.[6] The age of consent was raised from 14 to 16 in the spring of 2008, when the Tackling Violent Crime Act became effective. The age of consent for anal sex still remains 18 under section 159, and the new measures still allow for close in age exceptions between 12 and 16: if there is no more than a two year gap for those 12 and 13, or a five year gap for those 14 and 15.

Female homosexuality was never illegal in the former British colonies; oral sex was legalized in 1969 with the same age of consent as vaginal sex and anal sex was also legalized in 1969, but with a higher age of consent being set at 21, under section 159; then in 1988 the age of consent for anal sex was lowered to 18. As of 2008 there are no plans to repeal section 159, even though it has been ruled unconstitutional in some places of Canada.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe

The ages of consent for sexual activity vary by jurisdiction across Europe. Spain sets its age of consent at 13 years, the Vatican State at 12 years, and the rest of the countries have an age of consent ranging from 14 to 17, except Turkey and Malta, which have the highest age limit, 18.

The age of consent in South Korea is 13 according to section 305 of the criminal law of South Korea

As I get older I'm starting to think that it isn't really the length of your life that matters so much as what you do with it. I naturally gravitate to healthy eating habits and enjoy them. I have extended family members who are from The South and love comfort food. My Aunt is becoming ill from it at 60, in a lot of debt, but for some reason I feel like she has done a lot of ""living"". Nice vacations/ seeing the world, eating fatty but good food, etc.

I'm more or less the opposite of my aunt. I eat well, I'm very disciplined financially, etc. However when I became unemployed almost two years ago for an extended period of time my perceptions changed dramatically. It made me look at myself up until that point and question what I had to show for my efforts. A peice of paper from the University of California and a resume with a little professional work experience. I sacraficed a lot of my life doing things I thought would make me accepted by society so I could get a leg up and start enjoying life. Including missing out on partying to study in school and get that ""A"" grade when others settled for B's and C's because they prioritized things differently than I did. Or declining to study abroad so that I would graduate in 4 years and avoid student loan debt. Ultimately I determined that none of those actions added much value to my life.

However, I realized you have to enjoy life NOW. You can't wait for things to happen or always worry about micromanaging your future. That doesn't mean being completely irresponsible with your money, and health. But I think it means that in a lot of cases people can be way too uptight. I know I was.

Honestly I don't want to be 80 years old or living with regrets over why I didn't do something when I had the chance to do it when I was younger. I want to go sky diving, own a motorcycle, have hot sex with interesting people, travel through Europe (and have hot sex with interesting people), eat interesting foods and spirits, see breath-taking sights.

Life is so unpredictable. You could be diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer tomorrow with 6 months to live. What do you have to show for your life? Are you happy with it? I realized I wasn't. It may sound selfish but I wasn't happy and my goal now is to do things for me, despite how others may feel about it. This worry treadmill that society has most of us in is tiring.

While that gap is expected to be fleeting, the program, the largest single item in the federal budget, is projected to require sustained support within the next 10 years. 

Let's be clear here. Social Security is not ""draining"" resources from general revenues, as if it is unsustainable. General revenues are being appropriated for SS benefits in lieu of paying back the portion of the national debt that the SS trust fund holds (about $2.4 trillion, IIRC).

So the lack of actual cash in the SS fund is due to investments in U.S. debt. To suggest that SS is unsustainable is to suggest that U.S. debt is a high risk investment. Yet later in the article you will find this passage:

&gt; **Investors still view U.S. government debt as among the safest investments in the world.** But the perceived creditworthiness of nations depends on fickle market forces -- which can change quickly, as Greece and other several other European countries have learned in recent months.

Mentioning U.S. debt and Greece debt in the same sentence destroys your credibility. Greece has a history of repeated bankruptcies going back to 1893.

The one point that the article and Bernanke are right about is that we do need to raise taxes to sustain our spending (or, obviously, cut spending). However, to suggest that we need to raise taxes to sustain SS is just plain wrong.

The terms and language of the treaty were finalized and signed by United States representatives *in Tripoli* in November, 1796, before George Washington left office. Treaties must be ratified by Congress, however, and Congress did not ratify the treaty until June 7, 1797. Since Washington was no longer in office, the signature of the President of the United States was now that of John Adams, who signed 3 days later. Every jot and tittle of that treaty was the work of Washington and his administration (which John Adams was scarcely involved in, though he was Vice President). Adams' signature was primarily ceremonial, although he did agree with the treaty as negotiated by Washington's administration.

2) The government of the United States *is* the United States. The Constitution of the United States marks the first modern incorporation of a system of government that governs not by such notions as the Divine Right of Kings, but by the Consent of the Governed. In that the United States is a government whose inception came from *We the People* and not in any sense from the will or direction of the Christian or any other god, the government was at that time the truest example of a government that actually was composed of its own people.

This is a *very* un-Christian method of government. For centuries in Europe, nations were formed under the notion of the Divine Right of Kinds, by which the monarchs of Europe were ordained by the Christian God as the rightful rulers of their lands. Though all of Europe had been trending away from this idea for centuries, the United States beat them all to the declaration that there was no *right* to be a monarch, and the people of a nation should determine their own government.

Furthermore, the culture of the United States was clearly one of freedom of religion. The very fabric of American culture was forged by multivariate peoples who moved to the United States with all manner of heritage and religious beliefs. Not an insignificant portion moved precisely because of religious persecution faced at home. Although ignorance and historical revisionism have entrenched the idea in modern society that the United States is a nation with religious freedom as long as that religion is a form of Christianity, the Constitution was clearly written to protect the religious rights of *all*, not *the majority that was pretty close to the same religion anyway.* The debates in the Senate during ratification of the Bill of Rights make even clearer the purpose of Congress, as the form of the First Amendment was the most broadly-worded, most-inclusive form of religious freedom that was suggested. Multiple other versions of that amendment were proposed that would have given preferential treatment to some kinds of religions, but all were rejected handily. Only the most-inclusive version was acceptable to the first legislative representatives of the people of the United States.

The United States was and remains to this day a *secular* nation in which most citizens and residents are Christians; a secular nation based on personal liberty and rule of law *in which* you can have any religion you like for yourself and those you choose to congregate with, but which is not Christian itself. States were not made English or German or Irish or Dutch based on the number of people of a particular origin that lived there; neither was the United States made Christian because most of the people who lived within it were so.",True,t1_c0nqx40,False,,t5_2qh2p,,c0nqx40

This is not at all known. It's the exact opposite. Per capita income is seen as one of the best indicators of standard of living.

&gt;For example, it doesn't account for wealth inequality or quality of social services.

Wealth inequality is irrelevant. If the median income is high, people's lives are better. There being wealthier people in that nation doesn't reduce the middle class's standard of living. Having billionaires in America doesn't hurt average Americans.

Social services meanwhile are taken into account in per capita income. Any goods/services provided by the government are included in the GDP figures, so having a vast amount of social services will be accounted for by the per capita GDP figures.

Your comments just make no sense at all.

&gt;Cuba doesn't have the best per capita income but most of its people are better off than the hundreds of millions of people who live in poverty in China.

Cuba is absolutely. The government  

*tells people what job they can have, 
*decides if they're allowed to leave the country
*doesn't let them start their own business
*gives this crappy rations every month

It's like a giant prison, where people are guaranteed low quality food and medical services, and don't have the freedom to do much else.

&gt;Yes, under Mao.

Mao came to power after China finished going through World War 2 and a brutal civil war, so life expectancy rose rapidly as the country rebuilt. After the reforms of 1980, China's life expectancy continued to rise rapidly, even though it had already been rebuilt. 

Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and eastern Bloc countries, which did not reform their economies, saw their life expectancy rises stagnate, and even reverse:

[Economy and mortality in Eastern and Western Europe between 1945 and 1990: the largest medical trial of history ](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/3/796)

&gt;China has seen the greatest reduction in poverty of any country in the world, much more so than India.

&gt;Under orthodox measurements of poverty, yes, but this is misleading. For example, huge swathes of the Chinese population before the Dengist reforms were considered to be in ""poverty"" simply because they made very little money, since so much of the country's economic system was based on rationing, government provided social services, and communal living. When this was switched to a capitalist mode of production, many people who lived comfortably under Mao were now suddenly not impoverished, because they began to earn a wage in the capitalist fashion, 

You're so full of shit. People in China 40 years ago were unbelievably poor. The government rations were extremely scarce and crude. You really have no idea how pathetic the standard of living for the average Chinese was then.

People in China today are WAY better off today. There were basically no cars in China 30 years ago. People had to work very strenuous labor-intensive jobs, and had very few material goods. Their medical services consisted of barefoot doctors that visited villages. 

You hold pre-reform China and today's Cuba, both tyrannical societies that controlled their people and gave them measly rations as countries that gave their people good standard of living. 

How pathetic.

&gt;1911 fanboys are in a lot of places. I think you'll find that a lot more officers carry sensible firearms than carry 1911s.

Of course, because most officers don't have a choice - they're stuck with what's issued.  But 'special' units don't have to take the standard - so they get the 1911.  [FBI Hostage Rescue](http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/history/fbi_1911.htm), [LAPD swat](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_161_27/ai_95120539/), 


&gt;In fact, the whole ""power factor"" thing really gives the 1911/.45 ACP a huge edge over other pistols because of the fact that it's a cutoff, rather than a sliding scale.

You're either being disingenuous or incorrectly regurgitating crap you've heard - because you have the facts wrong.  There are .45s in a lot of non-1911 designs and you can ""make major"" with a .40 or 9mm.  And power factor has nothing to do with NRA Bullseye.
The 1911 is the hands-down winner.  In USPSA for example 1911 .45's dominate the single stack class.  1911's in .40 dominate the limited and limited 10 classes and 1911's in 9mm and .38 dominate the open class.  The only classes not dominated by 1911's are production (where 1911's are not allowed) and revolver (where 1911's are not allowed).  To be fair in the European countries the CZ designs (which are still 1911 inspired) give the 1911 a run for its money, but still fall behind.

Addendum:

The CIA would be the most likely $5M funder. Soros is suspected
of being a conduit for black money to dissident groups racketeering
for such payola. 

Now it may be that that is the intention of WL because its behavior 
so far fits the pattern.

If fleecing the CIA is the purpose, I urge setting a much higher
funding goal, in the $100M range and up. The US intel agencies
are awash in funds they cannot spend fast enough to keep the
Congressional spigot wide open. Academics, dissidents, companies,
spy contractors, other nation's spy agencies, whole countries, are 
falling over themselves to tap into this bountiful flood. But competition
is fierce, and accusations of deception are raging even as the
fleecers work in concert.

Chinese dissidents -- a brand name among many -- are already 
reaping huge benefits from covert funding from the US and from 
the PRC, along with others in the former Soviets, in Africa and 
South America, inside the US, UK and Europe, in the Middle East 
and the Koreas, who know how to double-cross ditzy-rich Dads

For one, England is very much a society based on class.  You will advance with hard word of course, but it's who you know more often than not.  Of course this rule also applies here, however the cliché is true: America *is* the land of opportunity.  Your class won't interfere with your ability to be successful as much as it will in the U.K.  (An American won't get the 'land of opportunity' thing until they live elsewhere).  

The cost of living:  I lived in London for 24 years  and it is *ridiculously* expensive. Your salary is in no way in line with the cost of living.  When I first moved to NYC, I felt quite wealthy.  When I go back to London to visit my family I wince when I need to buy anything.  I remember when the cost of gas in the USA was climbing steadily and it was a point of great concern.  In 2007 gasoline hit approx. $9/gallon.  Currently I am willing to bet the price isn't far below $6.00/gallon.

The stores/shopping.  Shopping in America is incredibly convenient.   It's such a pleasure being able to shop in a store that carries everything you need.  I can pop into Target and in one trip I can develop photos, pick up a prescription, buy some groceries and even shop for clothes/shoes/home decor if I want to.  In England, you need to visit each type of store.  It takes a lot more effort to find the items you need.  Oh and grocery home delivery in the USA - bliss!

Overall, Americans are far friendlier than the majority of Europeans.  Before anyone balks at this comment and accuses me of generalizing, bear in mind I speak with 38 years of *my own* experience.  There are rude and pleasant people worldwide, but as a whole, Americans are much friendlier. They will speak to strangers in a store and they will help their neighbors without hesitation.   Europeans tend to keep to themselves and can come across as aloof.

The weather:  that's a big one for me.  I love living in a place with different seasons.  All I remember in London is it being mostly grey and dreary.  Of course I have not lived in the UK since 1996, but I don't remember too many hot summers. (Incidentally, if does get very hot, air conditioners are not the norm in the UK).  I can’t live without my AC these days.

Now bear in mind there are elements of Europe I consider to be better too, but overall I’ll take America any day.  Again, these are my personal observations.

Other (Dutch speaking, where more people speak at least some English) towns you could opt for are Zaventem (right on the edge of Brussels - our Brussels airport is located there), or if you don't mind a bit longer commute, try Leuven. Leuven's a university town of 90K people. Direct trains to Mons takes 1 hour from Leuven. You could get there by car in far less I guess.

Belgium is quite expat friendly. People generally don't mind you asking them questions in English, and will probably go out of their way to help you if you are polite.

First thing you ought to do when you arrive in Belgium is get a student/expat health insurance. Using the Christelijke Mutualiteit as an example, that'll cost you about 5 euro a month. This means that when you visit a doctor you get paid back 16 euro of the 20ish euro that costs. If you can't pay, any doctor or hospital will help you anyway.

You have to register at the town hall if you stay for a longer period of time. 

Pretend you're Canadian :)

You might not want to move to a small town, because that could be boring. Living in a city will ease your life. More chance of English speakers in the more densely populated parts of Belgium.

Learning French won't do you that much good, since people will speak a dialect of French, and you'll have a hard time understanding it.

Dutch isn't easy to learn either, but people do throw in more English words in their vocabulary.

If you need any specific information, please let me know. I can help you with finding information, but my French isn't that great either.

Price ranges on a basic studio go from 300 euro/month to 600 euro. You'll probably cover your power and heating and water bills with that too.

Recycling is mandatory - plastic, paper and metal is collected separately. 

Public transportation is punctual (reasonably), frequent and cheap. You might have to get an 'abbonement' (subscription) for better rates. A whole year of bus-driving costs around 200 euro (For one part of Belgium only!). A fixed trajectory for say Mons to Brussels by train will cost around the same amount. Employers are mandated to pay back at least 60% of commuting costs.

Are you sure that's a reason to unleash nuclear weapons on a nation? With that rationale you're saying it's ok to have nuked:

* The Soviet Union
* China
* North Korea
* Cambodia
* Laos
* Vietnam
* Burma/Myanmar
* Yugoslavia
* Albania
* Turkey
* Greece
* Spain
* Iraq
* Afghanistan
* Pakistan
* The USA (Patriot Act onwards)
* The UK (Iraq and Anti-terror laws)
* Zimbabwe
* Venezuela
* Cuba
* Chile
* Argentina

Do you have any idea how many countries fit your description at some point since the bomb was first dropped?

The real reason the bomb was dropped had nothing to do with the Japanese people and everything to do with the Soviet Union. The Japanese government began negotiations for peace in January 1945. They had four specific terms for their surrender which the allies refused to accept (as the allies had then demanded an unconditional surrender). 

The Soviets were interested in unrestricted access to the pacific without the ability for the Japanese or anyone else to blockade them. The Soviets approached both the Japanese and the allies and played them off against each other while offering a mediation route through them. The Soviet plan was to take as much land in Europe as possible then declare war on Japan and take the strategic points they were after in Asia, repeating the success of the invasion of Germany.

By the summer of 1945 the allies had undergone considerable changes in strategy, particularly in respect to the bombing of civilian targets. The allies made a new declaration of terms for peace which the Japanese government viewed as a rehash of an earlier declaration but by early 1945 the Japanese were looking at an invasion of their home islands. The Japanese military planned to move almost all of their units to defend the first of their home islands. If the attack by the allies was successful there the Japanese would've had very few troops, planes and ships with which to mount any further defence and would've likely have been forced to surrender within weeks. The political position was in favour of a settlement from the get go. The original pre-invasion plans were to invade territory, expand then agree a settlement to retain some of the lands that they had taken.

After the potsdam declaration was made the Japanese opened diplomatic channels through the Soviet Union to negotiate a surrender. Shortly afterwards the Soviet Union invaded Japanese Manchuria. At this point Japan was fighting a war on two fronts against enemies far more powerful than them. Elements of the government wanted to surrender but in a manner that would save face (as Japan had never been invaded or lost a war). When the bombs were dropped the Japanese government began to try to negotiate a surrender with one to three less terms (again thinking they could save face). After the bombs were dropped an unconnected B29 pilot that the Japanese had captured some time ago revealed under torture that the allies had over 100 atomic bombs and were prepared to use all of them. The pilot lied to get the Japanese to stop the torture but the Japanese fell for it (in fact the allies wouldn't have another bomb for a few weeks). Faced with almost certain annihilation the Japanese agreed to surrender with the only condition being the preservation of the royal family's position within Japan.

I'm always upset when people talk about the justification for the use of the bomb because there wasn't any. There wouldn't have been a long protracted war with Japan after the first two islands would've been taken and they knew that if the Soviets invaded Japan they'd have to surrender to the allies or face the same fate as Germany. The Japanese were even negotiating surrender from before the time where the bombs were ready.

Perhaps before talking about justifying the use of nukes through failure to overthow a government because of tyrannical acts and fighting in an unjust war you should consider the actions of the only country ever to use nuclear weapons in war and it's allies.",True,t1_c0ntdfy,False,,t5_6,,c0ntdfy

* If you do decide to leave, do a trial move to the place you're considering for 30-90 days.  Put your stuff in storage, go there, get a month-to-month on a furnished place.  Give it a shot for a while and see how it goes.  Worst case, you can always go back.
* If you then still want to do it, go whole-hog.  Find a company to ship your stuff over.  Don't leave most of your stuff behind in storage like I did.  I'd advise against taking furniture unless you have heirlooms.
* Starting today, in America, make sure that every single piece of electronics you buy going forward will accept 110 _and_ 220V power.  Having to re-buy power supplies (or, in some cases, whole pieces of equipment) is a huge pain.  If your stuff is dual-voltage, you can just get plug adaptors.
* I don't think I could've moved somewhere that was much farther than where I did, as I get home-sick and culture-sick a lot.  Fortunately, it only costs about $500 roundtrip to fly back to the east coast a few times a year so that I can go to Taco Bell, eat real pizza, and visit my friends.  I have an ex-girlfriend that lived in Korea for a few years, and the $1200+ roundtrip back to the USA to visit, combined with the vastly different culture means that she sure as hell got 100% of the immersive experience she signed up for.
* If you're like me (small government liberal type) and you pick Europe, expect to rage a lot.  The taxes are much higher than the US and there are tons of freeloaders everywhere, and most people who aren't old and cranky think it's just grand and can't seem to find anything wrong.  If you're highly paid, strongly consider the tax implications of living in your new home on your long-term personal finance goals.  While the quality of life may be higher over here, you will almost certainly be able to afford way less consumer goods than you're used to.
* If you're single, investigate the stereotypes about women in the places you're looking at.  A reasonably good-looking male friend of mine who had no trouble whatsoever in the 'states had several long dry spells during his few-year stint here due to the general appearance and attitudes of most German women.  Know what you're getting into.
* If you move somewhere that has a native language that you don't speak and you intend to stay there more than a year or two, then buckle down, bite the bullet, and get yourself into full-time language school and stay there until you can at least speak like a highschooler.",True,t1_c0nu18r,False,,t5_2qh1i,,c0nu18r

Another one of your top commanders was fucking his mistress instead being ready for battle. Meanwhile, the British climbed a cliff in the dead of night, hauling cannons up as well. The French had over 13,000 troops available and the British only 5000. You really had no excuses. 

If everyone in Europe still was butt-hurt about what happened 250 years ago, the world would be plunged into anarchy. It's a ridiculous attitude and you should be ashamed of yourselves and grow up.

Some tips:

* Stay for a year if you can.  A lot of study-abroaders come for a semester and have a fantastic time, but the experience is totally different for those who stay for a year.  Obviously the mentality changes a bit when you know you're going home in 4 months versus 9-12.
* Do the orientation process if you can.  Some people skip it (I did) and regret it (I did).  You'll meet a lot of fellow students and also get some contact with some Dutch ones, who will take you around and show you the city.
* Get a bike immediately!  The UvA organizes auctions for used bikes and has a lottery for rental bikes (€50/semester or something).  Ask about it when you get here.
* Take the little, 5 week intro-to-Dutch language course, if you can afford it.  You'll get a pamphlet about it with all those forms.  Everyone speaks English here, so you don't *need* it, but it does help you 'integrate' a bit better (saying hello, ordering things, understanding the cashier, hearing announcements in the bus).  You get a little bit of different treatment when you order a coffee in Dutch vs. English, and it's a conversation topic with the natives (nobody expects you to learn Dutch, so they're amazed that you're even trying).  Again, it's optional, but I say take the first course if you can and decide if you want to continue later.
* Make as many Dutch friends as you can.  Obviously you'll have a lot in common with other international students (living in the same space, same courses, same new experiences) and the Dutch students have their own 4-year thing going on whilst you're only there for a small fraction of that.  Thus... it's easy to stay in the international bubble... so try to reach out!

You claimed that Christianity was 'special' because it had lasted a long time, yet Hinduism has lasted even longer, started out just as obscure and went through huge amounts of social upheavel and competition and still survives.

A religion simply 'surviving' doesn't make it true, it just means it was able by chance to stick around.

The Japanese thought that they could have an empire to rival the European nations and to unify Asia, that's what drove them. Their average Japanese person's fanatical loyalty to the royal family was bolstered by the advancement of the empire and it needed to be stopped. The views of both Germany and the Soviet Union (once it's territories started expanding) were similar, indeed as was Britain to some extent in the 19th century.

There was as much justification for Japan's imperialist expansion as there was for British imperalist expansion, Spanish imperialist expansion or indeed modern American imperialist expansion into Iraq. The difference between all of these is that America's expansion was not supported by the people and now the USA is trying to extricate itself from the mess caused by several rogue administrations (from Reagan onwards).

My paternal grandfather was in the war on the Japanese side as a mechanic in the Japanese navy. He told me years back (and I never fucking listened to him go on about it when he was alive and I should've) about how if the Japanese surrendered some would instigate an uprising but for most people the sheer shock of the concept of surrender would stop it from occuring.

My Great-grandmother was German and she moved to the UK after the first world war. She supported Hitler at first and agreed with the idea of Lebensraum (and the genocide in Namibia).

The bottom line is that while all these nations had their rationales at the time for expanding (including the US) it bit them in the arse shortly afterwards (as the US and it's allies are all finding out). Imperialism is wrong, full stop. I don't care if it's a military empire (like the Nazis), a commercial empire (like the second British Empire), or a political empire (like the Soviet Union), it's all wrong.

It's simply not the case.  As you point out, the world is littered with the carcasses of extremist Socialist states - however Americans conveniently seem to ignore the moderate ones where they have managed to develop a much higher quality of life than in the USA - most notably in Europe. 

And this is the point, I'm sure, where you start lecturing me with what a basketcase Europe has become under the influence of Socialism, and how America is anything _but_ a borderline Fascist state.  I can't purge your veins of the right wing kool aid that your corrupt media have spoonfed you for decades, but I can say I've seen many places on earth, and while no state is perfect, it saddens me to see the American one continue to descend into ruins because her people assume that it's the best, therefore in no need of improvement.

I can't change your mind. I'm just saying you're part of the problem - if you have already demonised all other political ideologies, and you have accepted somehow that the American system is the best, and you must persist with it - even in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is failing in many ways - then there's no saving you. 

By the way, your anecdote about extreme socialism is a tad simplistic. I could share an anecdote about extreme capitalism with you that would be equally simplistic. The fact is I'm not trying to champion one system over another, I'm trying to champion a system where nothing is ruled out, and everything is added / subtracted from the system to make a better one.

* I have a Master's in Software Engineering, and 3 years of experience.
* I work for a top American software company that has a large software lab in Dublin

Quality of life:

* I rent a room in a shared house, because the price of housing is too high. I refuse to pay more that 40% of my salary for renting (esp. in a ""provincial"" city like Dublin with very few to do except drinking - it's not as if it was London, Paris or New York). When I was a student, I got a 1 bed room apt in Germany for half the price I pay for a room in Dublin. 
Most single working people are ""forced"" to house share in Dublin, or get rip of by unacceptable rate, that's just outrageous in 2010!!!

* I do not own a car, too expensive and roads are of third-world quality.

* Public transportation is a joke. Just unreliable buses outside city center and buses route are very bad designed (making loops - no concept of hubs) , airport is not even deserved by a tram/train or metro. Just to show how absurd it is: there is a commuter train line passing just 3km away from the airport and deserving a small island town instead of the international airport! Also, no metro for a city of this size.

* I get my food in discount stores (Lidl). Normal stores in Dublin have just NO choice and are very expensive for extremely low quality. Better go to discount stores in that case.

I had a better standard of living when I was a student in Germany with no resources than as a Software Engineer in a top company in Dublin. I just stay for the top job for now while trying to actively relocate.

Would be curious to hear which parts of their ideology you'd say the Nazis took from *socialism,* rather than just from the statist, centralist traditions of the Bismarckian state.

And sure, there's anti-semitism on the left. Increasingly so.

People come in eclectic mixes of views. However, when organized in political parties and movements, those will distill an overall agenda, and where that agenda as a whole is pegged on a left-to-right scale is a lot about priorities. When racism, xenophobia etc makes up the main motivation and appeal of a party, it will be classified as far-right.

You make a good point about Islamism - after all, in Middle-Eastern countries Islamism is, obviously, considered a conservative, rightwing force. I'd say they are the equivalent there of populist rightwingers and extreme-right agitators in Europe, just the roles are reversed. 

The weird kind of confluence of leftists and conservative Muslims you've seen pop up in Europe here and there is a bit of an anomaly in that respect. Mostly a consequence of lefties sticking up for immigrants who are discriminated and marginalized, without going beyond that and finding out that philosophically, they don't actually have much in common. That and coming together in protests against the Iraq war of course. It's more of an alliance of convenience, and you do see actual leftwing immigrants from Arabic countries, Turkey and Iran reacting with some horror that European lefties would ally with their conservative counterparts. It's interesting to see that in Holland, in a local election where the numbers allowed for it, conservative Muslims and leftwing multiculturalists started to go their separate ways, with the former being elected on their own lists (eg Islam Democrats).

That's talking about conservative Muslims in general though - you seem to be conflating that with support for political Islamism as theocratic fascism. I think leftwing alliances with actual Islamists have been pretty marginal - you had George Galloway's Respect, of course, and arguably the short-lived Resist! alliance in Belgium - but you were talking, what, 0,2% and 0,8% of the vote respectively?

In any case, this all becomes very meandering; my original point is that you were wrong to say that the BNP can't possibly be radical right because their economic views are not libertarian-minded. The left-right axis is not just about economics, at least not as it is commonly or academically defined. Religious and cultural views, nationalism - those also determine where you are on the left-right axis.

for example, yesterday there were two big ticks - first, fitch downgraded greece, and the EU pledged aid - but that was an unexpected tick. then there was a counterreaction 45 mins later or so - we watch these events for opportunities. 

on a company level, we really just watch for divs and corp actions, nothing else is really relevant.

I'm a cop and I can't see anything wrong with this video either. Before getting into detail again let me tell you guys something which may calm the waves a little: We do understand that no one likes to be pulled over, likes to get written up or likes to get arrested. We do understand that we interfere with your freedom to do what you like. But I can say this (at least about the US or Europe): It's a necessity to have a policing force and they are not the enemy of the people. At the end of the day most of us do the job to help others an to catch the bad guys. And what everyone is trying to do is protect his own ass so that he or she gets home to his family in one piece at the end of the shift. 

I'm a bit saddened that a community like reddit jumps on these videos in this way and (in direct opposition to its otherwise well informed, open minded and thoughtful approach to conflicting matters) downvotes the poster above me. Not because he posted some thoughtless remark, but rather because he gave some professional insight on spmething most of you here have no knowledge of.

After some research I actually suspect that Either the values for some of these equasions must be wrong. (e.g. Adobe's profit ) or they have some other big revenue raiser that they class as COTS software, E.g. Server licences, Patent/Codec licencing.

But either way, if Adobe is pulling in 3 Bil a year thats 50c for every man woman or child on the whole planet.

According to Dr. Google the 5% is a global average, The breakdown is:

    * North America – 10.9% market share.
    * Oceania – 8.6% market share. (Oceania includes Australia and New Zealand)
    * Europe – 4.7% market share.
    * Asia – 2.5% market share. (China 1.9%, India 1.2%)
    * South America – negligible market share.
    * Africa – negligible market share.

Now some of these regions are quite notorious for not actually paying for software to the point where software companies are selling software at unreasonable prices just to get people into the 'idea' of paying for software (see Cost of windows Vista pro in china, I believe its somewhere along the line of 1 USD.) So any software sales in said countries could be considered to be negligible.
