The Twentieth Amendment repealing prohibition passed Congress in February 1933. It was ratified by the requisite number of states in less than ten months.

The Twenty-first Amendment returned to individual states the power to retain statewide alcohol prohibition, and made it a federal offense to ship alcoholic beverages into a dry state. But the states, too, had learned how impossible it was to keep citizens from drinking. One by one, each repealed its local anti-alcohol legislation, with Mississippi the last state to surrender -- in 1966.""

&gt;**KDE**

&gt;A big room somewhere in Europe with lots of chrome and glass and a great big whiteboard in the front with lots of tiny, neat writing on it. There are about 50 desks, each with headphones and pristine workstations, also with a lot of chrome and glass. The faint sound of classical music permeates the room, accompanying the clicky-click of 50 programmers typing or quietly talking in one of the appropriately assigned meeting areas. (Which of course consist of elegant contemporary white pine coffee tables surrounded by contemporary white pine and fine leather meeting chairs.) Coffee, tea, mineral water and fruit juices are available in the break area.

&gt;At the end of the day, *everyone* checks in their code and the project leader does a ""make"" just to make sure it all compiles cleanly, but it's mostly only done from tradition anymore since it always compiles cleanly and works flawlessly. When all milestones have been met, and everything has been QA'd, (usually within a day or two of the roadmap that was written up 18 months previous) a new KDE release is packaged up and released to the mirror sites with the appropriate 24-hour delay for distribution before being announced.

&gt;KDE developers are generally between the ages of 16 and 25, like art made of lines and squares and the colors white and black. When/if they finally stop taking government subsidies and get around to getting ""real jobs,"" most of their salary will be taken in taxes so the socialist government can subsidize the care and feeding of the next generation of KDE developers, just like it did for them. A high percentage of KDE developers, during their mandatory 5 years of government military service, crack from their years of cultural dullness and flee Europe to become terrorists for the sheer joy to be found in killing random strangers for no discernible reason.

&gt;**GNOME**

&gt;An abandoned warehouse in San Francisco, kitted up as for a rave, electronica playing at 15db louder than ""my ears are bleeding and I'm developing an aneurism"" volumes and the windows all painted over black so that the strobe and spotlights and lasers can be seen better. Computers, mainly made of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs, are scattered around on whatever furniture is available, which also consists of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs. There's no break area, but you may be able to bum a beer (or more likely something harder) off of one of the developers hanging around, and they will probably be too jacked up on X, coke, acid, heroin, ether or all of the above to notice that you've taken anything.

&gt;Development strategies are generally determined by whatever light show happens to be going on at the moment, when one of the developers will leap up and scream ""I WANT IT TO LOOK JUST LIKE THAT"" and then straight-arm his laptop against the wall in an hallucinogenic frenzy before vomiting copiously, passing out and falling face-down in the middle of the dance floor. There's no whiteboard, so developers diagram things out in the puddles of spilt beer, urine and vomit on the floor.

&gt;At the end of the day - whenever that is since an equal number of programmers will be passed out at any given time - or really whenever someone happens to think of it (which is rarely), someone might type ""make"" on some machine somewhere, with mixed results. Generally nothing happens, so he/she shrugs his/her shoulders and wanders off to look for someone who might have more pink/black-striped pills. Once in a great while, generally in the unpleasant time between the come-down from the last thing they took and before whatever it was they took just now comes on fully, someone will tar up a bunch of random files and post it on a website someplace it as the next GNOME release, usually with a reference to some kind of monkey.

&gt;GNOME developers rarely live past 25 and prefer ""alternative"" art - generally stuff made of feces that's ""too edgy"" for most people to ""understand"" or ""like."" Core GNOME developers are heavy Ketamine users. The bodies of GNOME developers can often be found in dumpsters or floating face-down in any sufficiently large body of water.",1425946592

Regarding ""what people want"", I haven't lived in the US in &gt;10 years.  My impression was always that American cars were bulky, inelegant, inefficient and clumsy.  

I compare an ""average"" car like, say, my grandfather's Pontiac Freebird or Firebob or Four-Iron or whatever it's called, with my dad's 4-door Golf or a friend's Volvo, the interior is plasticky, the body has lots of blobby-looking overhangs, it handles like a handful of wet coleslaw, has no turn radius to speak of, gets middling-at-best gas mileage, has crappy quality paint, is underpowered, and looks plain ugly.  Even my mom's Toyota Corolla (a US-market car, I've never seen any in Europe) is half again as big as most cars here.  You just plain couldn't park them.

I compare this to a 1967 Mustang or even an old Dart or Fairlane and it's clear why GM &amp; co. are doing so badly.  While the first was a real automative revolution, admittedly, the latter two were pretty par for the course regarding engineering and design; they looked pretty good and were well-made.

As for the Crocs comparison -- they are ugly, but functional.  They fill a very clear market niche, are easy to clean, and a customer's price sensitivity-versus-ugliness of a, say, $25 pair of plastic sandals is a lot different from that towards a $15k car.",1425946686

&gt; For reactor design and construction, Israel sought the assistance of France. Nuclear cooperation between the two nations dates back as far as early 1950's, when construction began on France's 40MWt heavy water reactor and a chemical reprocessing plant at Marcoule. France was a natural partner for Israel and both governments saw an independent nuclear option as a means by which they could maintain a degree of autonomy in the bipolar environment of the cold war.

&gt; In the fall of 1956, France agreed to provide Israel with an 18 MWt research reactor. However, the onset of the Suez Crisis a few weeks later changed the situation dramatically. Following Egypt's closure of the Suez Canal in July, France and Britain had agreed with Israel that the latter should provoke a war with Egypt to provide the European nations with the pretext to send in their troops as peacekeepers to occupy and reopen the canal zone. In the wake of the Suez Crisis, the Soviet Union made a thinly veiled threat against the three nations. This episode not only enhanced the Israeli view that an independent nuclear capability was needed to prevent reliance on potentially unreliable allies, but also led to a sense of debt among French leaders that they had failed to fulfill commitments made to a partner. **French premier Guy Mollet is even quoted as saying privately that France ""owed"" the bomb to Israel.**

&gt; On 3 October 1957, France and Israel signed a revised agreement calling for France to build a 24 MWt reactor (although the cooling systems and waste facilities were designed to handle three times that power) and, in protocols that were not committed to paper, a chemical reprocessing plant. This complex was constructed in secret, and outside the IAEA inspection regime, by French and Israeli technicians at Dimona...

&gt; Both the scale of the project and the secrecy involved made the construction of Dimona a massive undertaking... At the height construction, some 1,500 Israelis and French workers were employed building Dimona. To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the reactor components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a desalinization plant bound for Latin America. In addition, after buying heavy water from Norway on the condition that it not be transferred to a third country, the French Air Force secretly flew as much as four tons of the substance to Israel.

&gt; Mossad was rumoured to be behind the death of Ardeshire Hassanpour, a top nuclear scientist at Iran's Isfahan uranium plant, who died in mysterious circumstances from reported ""gas poisoning"" in 2007.

&gt; Other recent deaths of important figures in the procurement and enrichment process in Iran and Europe have been the result of Israeli ""hits"", intended to deprive Tehran of key technical skills at the head of the programme, according to Western intelligence analysts. 

I'm sure Mossad has its sights set even higher. The director of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program (a.k.a. Project 111) is a Revolutionary Guard officer and physics professor named [Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3602739.ece). The U.N.

Dandelions in America and Canada(as well as the rest of the world) are not weeds in the sense that they just developed where they grew. In fact, dandelions are the result of nearly 2000 years of selective breeding to produce a plant that grows in nearly all climates, sprouts and produces seed at lower temperatures, concentrates vitamins and mineral at rates of up to 20x better than other edible plants, who's seeds last for many years without degrading and much more. There is no other plant that grows with so little care and offers so much for human food and comfort.

American pioneers brought dandelions to the Americas in the early 1700s and distributed the seed as an easy way to ensure a very early food crop--very important in a time where salted meat was the winter food. The plant itself was brought to Europe from the Far East, where it was used for centuries as a food and medicine.

Right now, while I am struggling to protect my lettuce from the cold, the dandelions are providing fresh, healthy greens everyday.

Yes, that was the plan.

And yeah, I did pick an extreme example of force and isolation.  I think that extreme gives definition to the subject.  I'm open to the possibility of other kinds.

For example, we could talk about the Inquisition.  There were actually several Inquisitions, the most notable being the Papal Inquisitions and the Spanish Inquisition.  In just about every way, the Spanish Inquisition was the more aggressive, so let's start with that one.  It started with the expulsion of the Moors from Spain.  One of the first acts of the new ruling order was to forcibly convert any Jews or Muslims who remained, and expel any that refused to be converted.  The force in this instance was mainly the threat to dispossess the subjects of their property and home, and to divide their families by taking from them any children too young to object to the imposition of Baptism.  All Christian under the Spanish Crown were (technically until the 19th century) subject to heresy laws that were investigated by the Holy Office, and those were were found guilty of heresy more than once were liable to public execution at the hands of the state.  I think we'd agree that's force.

For all that, Spain under the Inquisition wouldn't exactly qualify as a cult by Jacoby's criteria.  Why?  Because Spain was, at the time, the trade hub of Europe, particularly after Portugal was brought under the Spanish Crown.  In other words, even though a heavy application of force was continually applied to the Spanish in Spain and its territories, the Spanish were by no means isolated and had ongoing contact with contradictory information, both through their contact with the rest of Europe and their significant investment in foreign exploration, trade and conquest.  I'd say it was not a cult, but rather a theocracy.

The point being that we're talking about force exerted to a particular end.  There's an implicit theory behind the force exerted by a cult, namely that you can condition a person to believe *x* provided that you control the terms of their environment to the extent that nothing in their experience could effectively contradict it.  What the Spanish Inquisition did, though no less despicable, is different.  They demanded belief at the point of a blade.  How its subjects arrived at that belief was their prerogative, so long as they arrived at it.

Now consider the Branch Davidians at the Koresh Compound in Waco Texas.  They had literally closed themselves off from the outside world -- the adults voluntarily, the children not so much.  The effect was that outside criticism or even contact with people of different beliefs became impossible.  They protected and nurtured their beliefs by quarantining them from any outside influence.  The amount of force they used in doing so was small compared to the amount leveraged by the Inquisition, but the effect was probably more in line with their goals.

Note that I'm not defending either group by drawing a distinction that describes one as a cult and the other as a theocracy.  The practical point of the distinction is that each has to be handled in a different way.",1425946875

It's strange to see this sentiment in an US movie - usually that sort of elitism is European, where you have centuries of separation into nobility and peasants, and there is no land left for you to buy (you rent from them).  The American approach is usually Ben Franklin, Abe Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Waldo Emerson and stories like Horatio Alger - self-reliance and hard work.

The only reason we're not on the verge of riots is because the US dollar is the world fucking reserve currency, and we fucking print however much we need.  It is the US economic and monetary policies that have fucked everyone else, NOT flat taxes and limited government.

Vegetarians more likely to get bowel cancer?

20 March 2009

For colorectal cancer, our results are somewhat unexpected. They may be giving a clue that we don't fully understand the relationship of meat with this type of cancer.

Dr Tim Key, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford
Key facts

    * Colorectal cancer is cancer of your bowel (bowel cancer).
    * It can occur anywhere in your colon or rectum (back passage).
    * Bowel cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women, and the third most common type of cancer in men in the UK.
    * More than 36,500 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year.
    * Almost three-quarters of people with bowel cancer are diagnosed when they are 65 or over.

Eating a vegetarian diet may reduce your overall risk of cancer, but increase your risk of bowel cancer, new research suggests.

The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, included 52,706 people aged between 20 and 89. Participants were recruited between 1993 and 1999, as part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, and followed until 2005.

They were separated into four groups: meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians and vegans. All cancer diagnoses and deaths were recorded using the National Health Service Central Register.

The overall number of cancer cases was lower in vegetarians and fish eaters than in meat eaters, adding to previous evidence which has shown that vegetarians are less likely to get cancer.

But surprisingly, the number of bowel (colorectal) cancer cases was higher in vegetarians than meat eaters, contradicting previous research. Dr Tim Key, one of the study authors, told Bupa's health information team: ""For colorectal cancer, our results are somewhat unexpected.

""Other studies have shown that people who eat a lot of meat may have a higher risk of colorectal cancer than people who eat small amounts of meat. We don't know why our results are different. They may be giving a clue that we don't fully understand the relationship of meat with this type of cancer.

""We are conducting further studies to look into this,"" Dr Key added.

Heather Caswell, a nutrition scientist from the British Nutrition Foundation, thinks this is an interesting finding.

""When you look more closely at the detail of the study, it can be seen that the meat eaters were actually only eating moderate amounts of meat, which were well within what is recommended for a healthy diet. Further, both groups also had similar intakes of fruit and vegetables, with them both just about meeting the five-a-day target,"" she said.

""This study highlights the fact that cancer is a complex disease and many different lifestyle factors play a part in determining an individual's risk.""

The overall incidence of cancer in the study group was lower than the national average. ""This is likely to be down to the fact that all the subjects in this study were fairly healthy - for example they were a healthy weight and the majority were non-smokers,"" explained Heather Caswell.

""This suggests that an overall healthy diet, which may include moderate amounts of meat, and lifestyle help to reduce cancer risk,"" she added.",1425947027

I'm sure that's how most of the Jewish people in Israel hear the statement, and it's one of the reason that Israel is so nuts over Iran's potential nuclear program.

If on the other hand, Ahmadinejad is talking about the Israeli *regime* and wanting to get rid of *that*, it's a very different thing. That's still good reason for the Israelis not to like or trust the Iranians, but what can they expect, given their own treatment of the Palestinians who were in the way when they wanted to create the state of Israel. One translation makes it sound like the Iranians are crazed and genocidal, the other sounds like your everyday, ordinary rhetoric of dispute between warring countries. Not good, but not threatening genocide either.

And, in reply to a comment you made to malcontent below, people judge Zionism differently because Zionists have *behaved* differently than many of the regimes in the neighborhood. How long has that brutal occupation of the Palestinians gone on now? 

The tragedy of the I-P situation is that from the point of view of the Jews, the creation of Israel as a haven for Jews from the genocidal Europeans was entirely justified, and I agree with them on that. Similarly, the creation of Israel from the point of view of the Palestinians, who lost land and hopes for the future as a result, was extremely unjust, and I agree with them too.

Palestinians have always opposed violence to resolve the conflict with Israel, they recognized Israels right to exist in the 90s, tried to create a basis for a two state solution (Israel spat in their face by continuing to build settlements in the west bank and failing at trying to put settlements in Gaza). In the end support for a non-violent end to the situation has dropped by close to 25%

Israel is slowly sowing the seeds of its own demise, if they don't eventually become friends with the Palestinians Israel will be destroyed.

They don't have the military capacity to win a war against them, the US spent $250 million on war simulations to see what would happen and found that a guerilla army is if anything far more effective and destroying a technologically advanced army, especially one which is over reliant on it.

Palestinians are not people who are used to being pushed around, Palestine was not founded by people escaping persecution. The Palestinians are by their very nature braver and more willing to sacrifice for their rights. That is definitely more dangerous than any military might Israel can come up with and that scares the IDF to death. They've tried and failed so many times at effectively ending palestinian resistance but keep failing.

Israelis simply don't have a concept of self worth, they're confused and often ask the naive question 'why don't the arabs just leave and find homes elsewhre in the Arab world?', they don't understand why these 'Arabs' stand up for themselves.

Actually it's not the authorities that have found ways to forgive such practices at all. The 'authorities' have been non-existent for the last century or two. Especially during the colonial period, European influence undermined Islam as a political system and social order that was organized (with jurists, lawyers, etc) into just the Western idea of a religion. It was no longer even a world view. And as we know, religion is pretty much whatever you want it to be in actuality.

So Islam is whatever anyone wants it to be, but the original spirit of it remains strong and appealing and plenty of Muslims choose to implement it in light of its original spirit. This is increasingly the case with new Muslim couples after Islam's resurgence of sorts in the last decade. *Educated* Muslim couples. It's the new in thing, people get married and now know all about the original ideals of Islamic marriage and bring those values back into vogue again. For one thing, they're usually practical, for another, they get the whole spiritual satisfaction deal too.

But this whole thing comes with education on history, Islam, social sciences, etc. Things that the Muslim world took for granted a few hundred years ago. What I'm describing as the new in thing amongst new Muslim couples was the way things were for nearly all of them about 500 years ago.

Westerners came to the Muslim world to share their values but they never did that, they only brought upheaval and left chaos in their wake. They were obviously only there to economically exploit the place, so they weren't too concerned about sharing values. A similar situation is going on in Afghanistan. Instead of the Islam from 500 years ago, you have Afghan values from 10 years ago versus Western values, and the Afghan values are winning out. 

There's *another* submission going around about how Karzai's government is resurrecting arcane anti-women laws:

http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/03/31/afghan-family-law-women.html 

All the submissions to Reddit are reading like ""Afghanistan legalizes rape"", etc. Actually, quite a few are jumping on Islam for this, but that varies by submission. This CBC article is careful to not mention Islam at all. Obviously not all news outlets, especially those from the US and UK, are going to be so kind.

Granted the implementation of this law is kind of deviant from real Islamic law (because they're trying to take what Islam says about the personal sphere or life and turn it into some kind of law... the original caliphates and empires never had this written into law, it was instead a part of the culture), but they're also appealing to a minority sect (so it's not representing the Taliban either... any idiot who says a Shi'a Hazara law is Taliban doesn't know what they're talking about).

Anyone else interested in reading what the actual text of the law is like now? After seeing this entire submission and all the comments here? Anyone else surprised we won't ever see that anywhere? This is what I was referring to by the 'rape in marriage' comment. It was ironic seeing those submissions about how Islam is about legalizing rape then seeing this submission.

BTW, as far as Islamic law is really concerned. The very idea that spouses can't say 'no' to each other is one that will also obviously become something to think about when cases of marital rape occur. And there's no conflict there either. A woman can be granted an immediate separation and eventually a divorce if she's harmed physically by her husband and there's evidence for it. But we all know that rape doesn't necessarily have to leave a whole lot of physical evidence. That's also addressed by the fact that the Islamic injunction that physically harming your wife is forbidden also includes *psychologically* harming her. So all she'd need to do, were we under an actual Sunni Islamic law system (which does not exist anywhere, so people who take these Salafi, Shi'a, or other systems as representative of Islamic law are making the first mistake right there), is just say that she's being harmed and she'll at least be granted the separation right then and there (of course even in optimal conditions now, it's rare for a court to ever act so quickly, which means there's the issue of the wife facing the dilemma of having to return to an abusive husband after having provoked him further... but getting into domestic abuse in general is a different discussion).

&gt;The report says the nuclear industry, under current policies and financing, won't be able to build enough new reactors to make a difference in climate in the next 20 years.

Almost all French reactors came online within a  [20 year period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_production_in_France.PNG).  Now nuclear is ~80% of their electric generation. This is *scalable*. Individual [reactors](http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/db.page.pl/pris.prdeta.htm?country=KR&amp;site=ULCHIN&amp;units=&amp;refno=20&amp;link=HOT&amp;sort=&amp;sortlong=Alphabetic) are now built in under 5 years.

&gt;The earliest the first new U.S. reactor could be finished is 2015, but the report notes that it takes about 10 years to put a new plant in service, from licensing to connection to the grid.

That's because licensing takes half a decade, which is a political and bureaucratic failure, not a technical one.

&gt;In two dozen countries that are interested in obtaining civil nuclear energy but have not previously built a reactor, it will take even longer, the report says.

Bull. The vast majority of energy demand is/will be in countries which already are operating reactors - USA, EU, China, India. There is no delay because new nuclear countries do not usually develop their own reactors - they buy reactors, and training, from other countries. [Canadian reactors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited) were crucial in the nuclear programs of China and India. China is buying Canadian, [Russian](http://www.power-technology.com/projects/tianwan/), and mostly recently [French](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/business/worldbusiness/27nuke.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all) reactors.

&gt;It will take at least two decades to convert the world's car fleet from oil to electricity. Transportation is the only sector where nuclear energy can significantly replace oil.

??? That's because it's the only sector were oil is significantly *used*...

&gt;In addition, uranium and nuclear fuel come from only a few countries – Canada, Australia, Russia, the United States and France – making nations without resources or technologies as dependent on foreign sources of energy as before, the report notes.

It seems the [31 countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power#Use) using nuclear power don't seem to mind relying on each other. Why should they? Very silly FUD.

For instance, one French [chemical plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COGEMA_La_Hague_site) does all the fuel reprocessing for mainland Europe - half a dozen countries. Sure they could easily build their own - but that would be massively redundant waste. ",1425947118

http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PSNoteNewPilgrimPuritan.htm

&gt; In America, we've added specific references to those two terms. We apply the name Pilgrim  (with a capital ""P"") to the small band of English people who came here in 1620 on a vessel called the Mayflower and settled in Plymouth. 

&gt; We use the name Puritan  to refer to a much larger group of English immigrants, led by John Winthrop, who came here ten years later and started Massachusetts Bay Colony. Both groups were motivated by their religious convictions. Both groups wished to purify their church by applying the principles of the Protestant Reformation. 

[...]

&gt; Most simply stated, there were people who had given up on any possibility of real reform within the Anglican Church and sought to separate from it and start their own churches

&gt; The Pilgrims at Plymouth were Separatists; the Puritans at Massachusetts Bay were not. As a matter of fact, one of the deepest concerns for Governor Winthrop was the fear that, in New England, his followers would be drawn to the Separatism that was already here because of the presence of Plymouth Colony. And that, in effect, is what ultimately happened. 

[...]

&gt; An obvious difference between the two groups is their size. When the Mayflower arrived at Plymouth in December of 1620, it brought 102 passengers, half of whom were to die in that first terrible winter. 

&gt; Ten years later, no fewer than 17 ships, headed by the Arbella, made port at Salem, bringing with them a thousand settlers for Massachusetts Bay. After another decade had gone by, the population of Plymouth Colony was a mere 2,500, while that of Massachusetts Bay had risen to 20,000. 

And Yes, the English Civil war was quite bloody, as were many of the religious wars in Europe at that time.

Being in America was a little bit of a blessing",1425947187

First off, the compound in wormwood of which you are thinking is thujone, which is illegal in absinthe bought and sold in the US. Countries in Europe have different regulations for how much can be in their absinthes. Thujone isn't good for you, but its psychoactive properties are debatable at best. More importantly, it shouldn't be in absinthe at all; when people started making it again, they found out that just because it's in wormwood doesn't mean it's in absinthe; it doesn't absorb into liquor from wormwood very easily. As a result, modern distillers add it artificially, and if you look at any vintage absinthe, you'll find essentially zero thujone.

Absinthe is strong, and its strength and mystique accounts for all the wacky stuff people blame on it. It is an herbal drink, and I will say firsthand that the inebriation felt is much different than beer or vodka or whatever. But you don't trip. In my experience, an absinthe intoxication hits quicker, wears off really fast, and is more clear-headed than other spirits. But you won't hallucinate, unless you drink enough that the type of liquor becomes irrelevant compared to the amount. ",1425947236

It's simple we are not immortal, we will ALL die from something someday, and there will always be a cost associated with the illness that brings us down, even if it's just old age.

My 65 year old mother who doesn't smoke or drink spends $300 a month on high bloodpressure meds and heart meds. The doctors say it is all stress related.

So the whole ""cost"" issue is a smoke screen. (excuse the pun)
Most if not all of that money will still be spent, it will just be spent treating different illnesses.

Disgraced Ex-Chief Judge Wachtler Regains Law License...(CLICK HERE FOR FULL STORY)
	The New York Law Journal reports that New York's former top judge got his law license back. 
	How fitting that he received it one day before the United States Supreme Court would hear oral arguments on New York's fraudulent elections.   And perhaps even more fitting is Sol Wachtler's license reinstatement the day following the official birth of Tammy Two (Tammany Hall II)...MORE...

Which, of course, makes the U.S. an undesirable place to perform activities that emit CO2, so much of that activity migrates to China and...

&gt; As the world's largest consumer, we can implement this tax on imports.

Not without triggering all sorts of WTO sanctions we can't.

Severe restrictions on our carbon output (also known as our ability to cheaply acquire energy) without corresponding reductions from the other major economies will almost certainly just migrate money and capital from the U.S. and Europe to China and other developing nations. If we were talking about some localized pollutant like smog, that would be a good thing, and would happen naturally: China values the extra economic growth over clear skies, and we're the reverse, so we trade. But greenhouse gasses aren't like that.

Rather than introducing these market distortions, I'd much rather we spent our money coming up with ways to ameliorate emissions more cheaply, either through technology that can be applied at the source, or simply dealing with a warmer climate.

EDIT: To stretch the analogy: How should we have acted in the Cold War if we were certain the Soviets would never give up their nuclear weapons? They still have them, of course, but the threat of full scale nuclear war has largely receded. How should we act if we are certain the Chinese and the other developing nations will never sacrifice economic growth for the sake of lower emissions? ",1425947313

The existence of some ship manufacturers does little to make your case that corporate personhood did not aid in the growth of industry. In fact, history shows a strong correlation between the creation of such legal ideas as limited liability and the subsequent explosion of industry through capitalist investment. Corporations are tools that allowed capital to safely consolidate and invest. One can not deny that we have far more large private enterprises than we did before these tools existed. (BTW, most large private enterprises like your ship company in the days before these tools existed were likely joint government projects/charter corporations.) Now, they also allowed for terrific abuse (see: East India Company), but these must be dealt with through law if we are to continue benefitting from the economic growth made possible by this movement of capital. Hey, corporate personhood has been around for a while now, and yet civilization still stands.

Do away with certain elements of corporate personhood and you will retard economic development. I for one thing it has helped make the world a more democratic place through the dispersal of wealth. Would you rather have one or two families manufacturing the ships of which you spoke, or a collection of individuals pooling their resources to maximize efficiency and to share in the profit? Would you rather have the Walton family, or the vast shareholding body of Coca Cola?

I do not deny, for instance, that the consolidated power of corporate interests threatens representative governance. But if corporate bodies allow for greater dispersal of wealth, then I'll take my chances with them over consolidated power of a few ultra-wealthy individuals.",1425947348

She was taking a class on Middle Eastern History, which sounded pretty interesting, so I snuck in to class with her.  Kind of adds a whole new meaning to ""Crash Course.""

They would pass around an attendance sheet and I'd just pass it along when it came to me.  I bought the books and took notes on my laptop, like a good student, and fit right in!  (I had graduated from college a year before)  Neither the prof nor his assistant ever caught on, but I stopped coming because I was nervous about not attending the study group sessions with the assistant, plus I'm not the type of person who blends in easily, and just started to feel self-conscious in general.  

Might have kept it going a little longer if the professor gave better lectures and didn't seem like a condescending jerk.  He was from Germany and mocked how ignorant we Americans were about geography etc., which I get but it wasn't exactly a nice thing to say to your students, so of course my friend and I cracked up when he and the assistant couldn't find something on the map later in the same class.  Also, one time he wouldn't answer a question about what the whole Palestine/Israel issue was about.  He said it was too complicated to sum up in any way, so go look it up if you're curious.  He was probably just frustrated with his job or something, but after the first class, my friend and I spent most of the time giggling about what a jerk he was, and it didn't seem worth the effort.  At least I got to learn a little about things like the consequences of Ottoman and pre-Ottoman trade practices with Europe.

Usually, when an infant is born, their baby teeth are soon to emerge, but even then, their adult teeth are starting to form beneath their baby teeth.  But there doesn't seem to be any possible way for replacement adult teeth to form underneath adult teeth.

The ability to regrow adult teeth is found in some animals, however, so we shouldn't be to quick to assert that it is impossible.  More likely, there is an obscure genetic trigger that for some reason activates at very rare intervals, causing the phenomenon in those extraordinary individuals.

I can't support organizations that are DIRECTLY responsible for this.

The Church isn't directly responsible for the actions of a single Priest, and these days they're not usually directing their followers to kill for their beliefs.  Again, it's just people being people, and there are plenty of molestations and murders that aren't tied to religion at all -- that this happens within that umbrella shouldn't necessarily discredit the institution itself.

&gt; You don't see people killing in the name of science, do you?

Sort of.  I see science much the same way as religion -- it's an exploration of truth that can create both good and bad.  Without science, we wouldn't have many wondrous things.  On the other hand, we wouldn't have assault weapons or atomic bombs.  Economics is a scientific approach to society, and I see people being killed for that all the time.

&gt; Anyway, my original point was that people have never needed a book of fables to tell them how to act. People are able to be kind, charitable, and compassionate without being forced to through the word of some invisible man-made creation.

You don't, but it doesn't matter if you do use a book to draw morals and lessons from.  No one is forced to do the work through God, they choose to do so, and it doesn't bother me if that's where they draw their strength from.

&gt; Why, then, must these people dress in elaborate costumes, house themselves in multi-million dollar mansions, and parade around like rock stars? Isn't this pretty damn hypocritical?

&gt; Do you not support truth? Why do you support an organization that spreads lies? Why do you support an organization that doesn't want Africans to use condoms? I'm baffled!

Yes, it's hypocritical, but now we're getting into the territory of specific religions rather than the idea of religion as a whole.  There's a lot of nuance here -- I would argue that the Catholic Church, and the institution of the Papacy, is a perversion in itself.  It was a consolidation of territorial power in Europe and as much the formation of a nation-state as it was a religion.  

As far as the costumes go, that doesn't bother me.  Religion is about community and ritual, about getting together with those in your neighborhood weekly for a common purpose.  It's more about tradition than anything else, and from the Catholic Church to a gay rights parade, I won't blame people for unusual fashion choices.

On the condom thing, yeah, I can't support every statement or decision any religion ever made, nor should I.  Even the Priests and Bishop missionaries on the ground in Africa were appalled by the Pope making that statement.  Even within the Catholic Church there's dissent on the matter -- and it's a great example of exactly the conflict I described above: between those doing good on the local level and drawing on the Bible for inspiration, and those at the top using the Church as a vehicle for their own power.  It happens within states and companies, too.

Just because there's bad coming from religion doesn't mean we should overlook the good that comes from it as well, and as long as there is good, I can't call it all bad.  And all of your examples here are from the very specific example of Roman Catholicism, but religion is such a large and diverse world,  proclaiming religion as a bad thing dismisses the beliefs of all those who follow and work through their religion to bring greater peace and justice to the world.

Religion is as complicated and nuanced as humanity, and therefore cannot be dismissed entirely as useless.",1425947406

If, as many here on Reddit do on a daily basis, I can say ""Christianity is a load of bullshit,""  I should also be able to say the same thing about Islam, should I so choose.  According to this resolution, that would constitute ""defamation.""  I also think that your threshold for what kind of speech would incite you to violence is probably higher than a lot of Muslims who live in Muslim dominated countries. If, again, I said ""Islam is a load of bull,"" that can be (and often has been) interpreted by muslims as inciting violence, whereas your average Westerner would merely consider that free speech, so it's no surprise that the US, Canada, and the entirety of the EU voted against it.",1425947458

Which countries?

[Here's a table of various countries](http://dornfeld.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/broadband-penetration-tops-50-in-united-states/) with their pricing.  It's not perfect, but it's the best I could find on short order with Google; if you want better, you're going to need to identify a country and pull up some statistics.

[Here's a table of population densities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density).

Sweden is very cheap; broadband there is heavily subsidized, and you're still paying for it, but through taxes instead of on your bill.  That's good for heavy users, because it forces, by law, lighter users to subsidize them, but the dollars are still coming from somewhere.

Korea and Japan are high-density countries where I suspect that most content is transferred locally due to language limitations; good comparisons to the US (transfers anywhere in the English-speaking world) would be Canada, the UK, Australia, Ireland, etc.

ISPs have no reason to not want to sell you product, if they can make money on it.  It's just that that bandwidth does cost money, and pricing schemes haven't necessarily reflected that in the past.

BitTorrent and friends are artifacts of that pricing model.  This is nothing new; back in the day when local phone calls were cheap or free and long-distance ones weren't, people built [Fidonet](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fidonet) to allow data interchange to take advantage of this quirk.

My guess is that, if it's the upstream costs that are dominant, at some point, ISPs will offer reduced prices for purely-local transfers (probably it will count less towards your quota or something), and P2P software will start trying to optionally keep transfers local, which will ultimately be more efficient.

Except, of course, for the minor detail that the claim is either a lie, or a deliberate misrepresentation of facts.

Uganda is a perfect counterexample to the absurd claim that condoms lead to higher HIV/AIDS rates.  Prior to Rick Warren's evil minded support of anti-condom forces Uganda had a very low AIDS rate thanks to a program called ABC (""Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condoms"").  Warren threw millions to people who fought hard against the ""condoms"" part and they were successful in virtually ending the use of condoms in Uganda.  Result?  The AIDS rate there skyrocketed, and is continuing to skyrocket.

So the central claim (""increased use/availability of condoms leads to higher AIDS rates"") is demonstorably false.

A sudden upsurge in condom use in areas that have a high AIDS rate also makes sense.  People say to themselves ""hmm, lots of people here have AIDS, I'd better use condoms"".  Since the advent of the newer retroviral drugs it can take decades before we see a significant decrease in AIDS infection because the victims aren't dying as quickly as they used to.

The real question is not so much AIDS per capita, as it is AIDS transmission rates.  As in: do we see an increase, or decrease, in AIDS transmission with the introduction of condoms?  And the answer, completely to the surprise of no one except the Anti Sex League is that condoms reduce the transmission rate of AIDS significantly.

The problem is that some groups, especially the Roman Catholic Church, are being disingenuous, at best.  The RCC may care about preventing AIDS, but it is not the central concern of the Church.  The much more important and pressing goal, from the POV of the Church, is to make people stop fucking for fun.  The idea of sex for pleasure is anathema to the Church, and preventing people from having sex for fun is their primary goal.  The prevention of AIDS is a distant second from their standpoint.

Obviously many individual Catholics disagree with the RCC, I'm friends with a Catholic OB/GYN who not only uses birth control herself, but prescribes it, and performs hysterectomies.  But the Church, as an organization, is completely opposed to such things.

Remember that the Church, in the person of Archbishop Chimoio recently claimed that condoms actually **CAUSED** AIDS because the evil Europeans had deliberately infected condoms with AIDS out of a pathological hatred of Africans.

Quite simply the Church is perfectly willing to lie in pursuit of its primary agenda of ending sex for fun.   Worse, the Church is not only unconcerned about AIDS rates, it is willing to actively promote the spread of AIDS in furtherance of its goal of ending sex for fun.",1425947689

This is true.  Nonetheless, in addition to the bit about ""cajoling"" (I hadn't even thought of that, thank you), I find it intensely disturbing to see how cavalierly even ""anonymized"" footage is broadcast.

I do a lot of data protection / IT security compliance work, and am by necessity exposed to a lot of the legal and practical bits and bobs behind different data protection regimes.  In over ten years of experience, the only countries that come close to having any consistent and enforced respect for personal privacy and data-related liberties are small ones with _very_ strong republican traditions of suspecting pretty much everything and anything governments do.  

I am no slavering anarchist, but as a rule, _any_ time a government wants _any_ insight into _any_ personal or even public data via _any_ kind of surveillance for _any_ reason (including seemingly legitimate ones such as ""child protection"" or ""counter-terrorism""), a citizen has a very strong reason to be insanely suspicious, even if laws authorizing such surveillance are accompanied by mollifying supposed safeguards and assurances of ""trust us, we mean well.""  I'm sure you do, but trust you I won't.

&gt; Most of our CCTV/police footage comes from the states. You always know it's gonna be a bit more interesting than our crap when it's a US highway that the show cuts to. It means guns and stuff. ;-)

I've actually never seen US footage outside of _Cops_; the stuff we (used to?) see on the continent was really mainly from the four countries I mentioned (you could tell by the police car plates, which weren't blanked out, or from the badly dubbed-over languages.)

There are a lot of false and misleading claims for various herbal medicines, but there are also very effective therapies there too.

For example,
&gt; Most of NCCAM's results have been negative or inconclusive, not positive and encouraging.

So isn't that what we'd hope for?  That they'd expose the quackery?

I certainly don't think it is *all* quackery. I can give one concrete example from my own life.  I got an ulcer.  My doctor did the tests to see if it was caused by H. Pylori (if so, antibiotics can clear it up).  It wasn't.  So he wrote me a prescription for Prilosec.  While he was writing, I said ""how long do I have to take it?""  He just looked at me like, what do you mean 'how long'?  Indefinitely.  Prilosec does strange things to your digestive chemistry; among other things, it inhibits vitamin absorption.  So I went looking for alternatives.  I took licorice root, and Calcium/Magnesium supplements.  As I understand it, the licorice serves as sort of a band-aid to protect the stomach lining in the short term, and the Cal/Mag restores the correct acid balance in the stomach.  Within a week, my ulcer pain was almost gone, and in a month, I didn't need to take the licorice any more.  I only take the Cal/Mag once every few weeks.  

Could this ""speaking out"" possibly be astroturfing by scientists in the pay of the pharmaceutical companies?

&gt; It is estimated that the Jericho III entered service by 2008.

&gt; The Jericho III is believed to have a three-stage solid propellant and a payload of 1,000 to 1,300 kg. It is possible for the missile to be equipped with a single 750 kg nuclear warhead or two or three low yield MIRV warheads...**It is estimated that it will have a range of 4,800 [3] to 7,000 km [4][5] (2,982 to 4,350 miles), and probably significantly greater with a payload of 350kg (one Israeli nuclear warhead)**. It is believed that the Jericho 3 is inertial guided with a radar guided warhead and silo-based with mobile vehicle and railcar capabilities.

&gt; **The Jericho 3 will give Israel nuclear strike capabilities within the entire Middle East and Europe.** The range of the Jericho 3 also provides an extremely high impact speed for nearby targets, enabling it to avoid any ballistic missile defenses that may develop in the immediate region[6].

&gt; On 17 January 2008 Israel test fired a multi-stage ballistic missile believed to be of the Jericho III type reportedly capable of carrying ""Special warheads"".[2]

Israel also has three [Dolphin-class submarines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_class_submarine) that [may be capable of firing cruise missiles with small nuclear warheads](http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/missile/popeye-t.htm): 

&gt; In May 2000 Israel is reported to have secretly carried out its first test launches from two German-built Dolphin-class submarines of cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The missiles launched from vessels off Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean are said to have hit a target at a range of about 1,500 kilometers [about 930 statute miles].

What seems to be working there is not necessarily universally true. One large possible reason that regions in southern Africa have responded well to abstinence- or monogomy-based efforts is cultural. There seems to be a nasty but persistent rumor down there that condoms were invented by white people to *give* black people AIDS. And since the sex-ed and condom distribution programs are carried out largely by US/European organizations through westernized or postcolonial institutions like schools, the average joe or jane in these situations is very unlikely to actually use the condoms they've been given. 

On top of that, many of the abstinence-only programs put in place after the start of the AIDS epidemic were the first of their kind, not replacing sex-positive or harm-reductive programs. And, I'd bet, any sex-ed is better than no sex-ed, even if it's the abstinence-only kind.

You seem to be referring more to Herbert Spencer's idea, where he believed that society, and in fact all things (physics, art, music, biology, geology) all behaved in an evolutionary manner.

He mistakenly believed that this increase in social complexity led to fairer conditions and greater happiness for those involved, when increased complexity does not necessarily require a corresponding increase in quality of life.

We're experiencing the worst downturn since the Great Depression, and we haven't reached the bottom yet. I'm very pessimistic. Governments are indeed reacting better today than during the global economic crisis. They're lowering interest rates and boosting the economy with economic stimulus plans. This is the right direction, but it's not enough.

It's obvious Stiglitz has no idea what he is talking about.  He actually thinks that *lower* interest rates and *more* consumption can cure the problem that too low interest rates and too much consumption has caused

&gt;I do. More than $700 billion sounds like a lot, but it's not. On the one hand, a large part of the money will first be given out next year, which is too late. On the other, a third of it is drained away by tax cuts. They don't really stimulate consumption, because people will save the majority of that money. I fear that the effect of the American economic stimulus plan won't be even half as big as expected.

You see what he said here?  He said that tax cuts won't help because people will *save the majority of that money*.  I guess someone should tell Stiglitz that savings are what finances such things as wages, durable consumer goods, materials, electricity and energy, capital goods, inventory, stocks, bonds, that is, *everything except consumer goods*.

Ya, who needs savings huh Stiglitz?  We should not save any money to pay back debt, we should borrow and spend more money on everything that doesn't require savings, that means we should fire every last employee, close all factories that manufacture durable consumer goods, use dirt and rocks as materials, and make basic trinkets.  Whatever we do, we should not save and lower our outstanding debt.  We have to spend more money on consumption and less on everything else.

Fucking Keynesian idiot.

&gt;That's right. That's why I'm confident we'll get off lighter than during the Great Depression. On the other hand, there's a series of developments that make me very anxious. The state of our financial system, for example, is worse than it was 80 years ago.

Well, the only way we could pay for all those government deficits that you moron Keynesians believe actually help the economy was to abandon the gold standard and allow the government to spend like a drunken sailor.  The more they tax those evil savings and the more they consume the better off we should have become, isn't that right you fucking idiot?

&gt;The banks that survived 80 years ago continued to lend money. Today many banks aren't lending money anymore, above all the large investment banks. This will deepen the crisis.

Ya, that's right.  The reason the economy is in trouble is because it can't function without more debt.  Shouldn't that make you think there is something terribly wrong with the economy that it got to a point where it cannot ""function"" without increasing debt?

Christ this guy is stupid.

&gt;That's the idea, but it doesn't work. We're just throwing money at them and they pay billions of it out in bonuses and dividends.  We taxpayers are being robbed for all intents and purposes in order to reduce the losses that some wealthy people bear. This has to be changed.

In other words, Stiglitz is upset because the world is not operating in the way his models say it should operate.  After Stiglitz called for massive waves of theft from the taxpayer to bail out these companies, and he still wants more(!), he doesn't call that theft.  It is only when the banks refuse to lend in an *unprofitable* market that it becomes theft.

The purpose of banks is not to lend.  That would be their purpose in a planned economy like in the USSR, where I am sure Stiglitz would want to be the economic czar.  No, in a free economy, the purpose of lending, indeed the purpose of doing any action in the division of labor, is to make money.  You can't expect banks to lend money if they are going to make losses on it.  The reason they are going to make losses on it is because the market is trying desperately to eliminate the malinvestment cancer that Keynesian programs have created, and are still now trying to keep in the body.

&gt;We have to reorganize our bailout system for the financial sector. For one thing, any bank that actually lends should get money from the government; more money to small and medium-size banks in smaller towns and less to Wall Street institutions. The government must also accept the consequences when banks become insolvent ...

That's like thinking we can take money out of the deep end of the pool, drop it in the shallow end, and then expect the water level rise.

&gt;No, they have to be saved, because the consequences to the monetary system would be incalculable. But as a countermeasure, these institutions have to be nationalized, which even Alan Greenspan is now demanding. Then the government can close those business segments that have nothing to do with lending and make sure that the banks no longer organize esoteric stock deals that they themselves do not understand.

Got that everyone?  IT'S GOING TO BE HELL ON EARTH IF THESE BANKS FAIL! AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  And just so that I don't sound like a total dictator, even *Alan Greenspan*, alleged free marketeer, is calling for nationalization!  

You got that fellow Redditors?  A former *Fed Chief*, a former head of the international counterfeiting government created cartel, is a free marketeer, and we are all supposed to be ""SHOCKED"" that he calls for nationalization!

Ahahaha, not even the allegedly most free market supporter in the world thinks the free market works!  Bring on world socialism you douches!

&gt;On the contrary, it's going to be more difficult. When a country introduces an economic stimulus plan, a large part of the stimulus goes abroad. For instance, a U.S. company receiving a road construction order from the state buys equipment from Germany, concrete from Mexico and engineering services from Great Britain. The incentive to profit from the economic situation of one's neighbor is correspondingly great, while doing as little as you yourself can do. There is only one solution for this: Economic stabilization policy has to be coordinated internationally in order to diminish the already dangerous global imbalances.

Stiglitz is so blind, so biased, that the *only* solution to the problem of, what is it again?  Profiting from what your neighbor's government has done and imposed by force, while doing ""nothing"" yourself, as if working to produce all the factors that the stimulated sector requires is ""nothing"", that since stimulus programs create bad effects, it means we need a world government?

Wow, talk about the biggest non-sequitor I have ever seen.

&gt;For years the U.S. was the economic powerhouse of the world. It imported more goods from abroad than it exported, to the joy of manufacturers in Asia or Europe. But this model no longer works. The Americans are completely over-indebted. They can't increase their consumption, instead they have to save. This is why other global growth has to be increased.

What the hell?  At first you said that the problem of tax subsidies is that people will save the majority of it, now you say that they have to save?  Hello!!!!!

&gt;Absolutely. Export surpluses are counterproductive in times of economic crisis. They have to be reduced through economic stimulus programs, for example. Economist John Maynard Keynes was even of the opinion that surplus countries should be taxed during times of economic crisis.

Economist John Maynard Keynes also thought that pyramid building, earthquakes, even wars can increase prosperity.  

&gt;That's why we wouldn't go that far. I propose that countries with a positive trade balance should stream part of their surplus to the International Monetary Fund. This can then stimulate the economy in developing countries or prevent the economy from collapsing in Eastern Europe.

One million condoms against the fear

By Karl-Ludwig Günsche, Cape Town

The Pope rejects condoms - for the relief organizations in Cape Town's slums, they are the best AIDS prevention. The free distribution of the infection rate has dramatically decreased. A lesson for the church.

It is a wretched wooden hut on the outskirts of Khayelitsha, the largest township on the doorstep of Cape Town. Under a gray blanket Mary is barely visible on a poor mattress. Emaciated, powerless. Much more than 30 or 40 kilograms weighs the young woman no more. Mary has end-stage AIDS. She is 19 years old. Three years ago she was infected, the famous ""first time"". Mary is too late to the doctor gone. She was afraid of the ""stigma"", the Ausgestoßenwerden by family and friends.

Kwezi Rasmeni from the aid organization Treatment Action Campaign leads in Khayelitsha township near Cape Town, such as a condom is unrolled

So she went to a Sangoma, a traditional healer, with which they dealt with herbs and incantations. Only when she was always sick, she went into one of the urban health centers in their township. There they learned the deadly truth: HIV-positive. The disease was no longer to stop.

Mary's voice is so quiet that it is hard to hear: ""I was young and stupid. I did not knew that they were using condoms can protect. But as long as I can, I am preaching to my brothers and sisters, that they use condoms to their lives if they wish. "" But Khayelitsha is also a success story in the fight against AIDS: At the turn of the year 2004/2005 started the Cape Town city administration together with private relief organizations such as the Treatment Action Campaign, a gigantic condom education and distribution campaign. Indeed, although in Khayelitsha only eleven percent of the Cape Town population, there were 34 percent of all cases of sexually transmitted diseases registered - with AIDS at the top.

South Africa Cape Town AIDS pope condoms Treatment Action Organization Stefan Hippler HIV to SPIEGEL WISSEN Virginia de Azevedo, Virginia de Azevedo, director of the project, says in retrospect: ""Hardly anyone has a successful effect. African American men would reject the rubber things. The condoms were mass unused lying on the streets, people warned me. The opposite occurred: the increased demand. When you launch distributed Azevedo and her colleagues statistically to each about 15-year-old male residents of Khayelitsha condoms per year 23. They had the ""unattainable"" goal of one million condoms per month free of charge ""to the man"" to bring - in the public toilets in pubs, taxis, public libraries, at filling stations.

The infection rate dropped by 50 percent

The million target is now not only reached but surpassed. Statistically, each male provides township residents now with 104 free condoms a year. The rate of infection with sexually transmitted diseases declined in only three years by a dramatic 50 percent.

""I can all prove that the use of condoms the spread of HIV can dramatically reduce, even the pope,"" said Virginia de Azevedo combative. ""In the fight against AIDS condoms play a very important role. The pope does not seem to know what he's talking about."" Benedikt XVI. had on the way to travel Africa expressed the use of condoms exacerbate the AIDS problem - and this was heavily criticized.

Not only is the daily practice in the townships in South Africa, including scientific studies show that condoms play a key role in controlling the disease play. Long-term studies of the Universities of Lausanne, Washington and Oxford showed that condoms neither promiscuity nor encourage sexual activity, but the infection rate of sexually transmitted diseases can be drastically reduced.

John Santelli of Columbia University New York, summarized the results of the studies: ""Chastity is a very healthy choice for teens. But sex education for young people means above all that they have any medical information is correct, they need to themselves to protect. "" Krankheiten geführt."" Mary Rotheram-Borus of the University of California at Los Angeles says it is even clearer: ""Programs for the promotion of condom use in the European countries to a substantial reduction of teenage pregnancies and births and sexually transmitted diseases.""

Not only in Europe, including in Africa, where most HIV-positive people live, the major use of condoms, the infection rates dramatically lower. The flagship project, Uganda: President Yoweri Museveni Kaguta engaged very heavily in 1986 for an AIDS prevention program. The plague raged at the time, especially in the rural areas of the country. 1987 launched the government and aid organizations, the ABC program ""(abstain, be faithful, use condoms - is chaste, be faithful, use Condoms). The success was overwhelming: from 18 percent (1992) decreased the HIV infection rate to 6.4 percent (2005).

""Abstinence where they can not preach""

Sister Christine in the Ivan-Tom Mfuleni clinic in need of scientific investigation is not statistics. Sie erlebt tagtäglich, wie der Verzicht auf Schutzmaßnahmen Leben zerstören kann. They experienced every day, as the renunciation of protection can destroy life. ""Sex without a condom means for those who are HIV-positive that she's immune system each time a new killing them,"" says the 53-year-old nurse. ""I have seen many dying miserably sehn who still live, if they had used condoms.""

""Abstinence where they can not preach. We also say to women: If your partner does not protect you, you need to just use condoms for women."" In Tom Ivan Clinic are on every corner condom dispenser hanged. The increased distribution of female condoms is the new goal in Mfuleni and Khayelitsha. There Dr. de Azevedo reported initial success: From 2006 to 2007, the number of votes in Khayelitsha free condoms for women of 23,000 to 125,515.

Also for Babalwa Lumko the past four years by the German Catholic priest Stefan Hippler, Cape Town, founded AIDS HOPE program works, there is no doubt about the usefulness of condoms. ""Of course, chastity is the best protection. But prevention is better than dying. Condoms are not entirely help, but 99-percent,"" she says. ""Above all, the promotion of condoms in our Township to a change in consciousness contributed. For most young people it is quite obvious to the rubber to bite.""

The experienced health worker and convinced Methodistin the pope can only shake their heads: it is in the township on a daily basis, talking to the people who advise them and clarify them. She has also seen the dying, for which - as for Mary in Khayelitsha - any help came too late. Only recently, she had to return to watch helplessly as a young woman painfully died.

She was only 36 years old, a simple woman. She knew, however, that her partner was HIV-positive. But when he wanted unprotected sex, it was for them: I must do what the man wants. ""When they came to us, it was too late. She was from fear of the 'stigma' too long hesitated. A small rubber thing would have been able to save their lives.""

This bailout fails any test I can think of for defining is as a Socialist policy. 

In a Strict sense, socialism refers to the common ownership of the means of production with a fair method of distributing the 'wealth' that is created.

In a wider sense socialism can be seen as a broad set of measures that provide social stability and protection for all members of a society.  Usually this is done by the state providing services (directly or indirectly) and regulating private industry.  (This is the European model, things like the minimum wage, nationalised health-care and education, welfare payments and state provided housing would fall into this).

The Bailout in the US fails to meet either criteria, it neither transfers ownership of formerly private assets to common ownership, nor does it support society, in fact the bailout does the opposite, it provides public money to organisations that benefit a very few, in the hope that their survival might ensure that the US economy survives, even if the working class fare badly.

""From the early Christian era (30 to 325 CE), marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter, with no religious or other ceremony being required. Until 1545, Christian marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties.[18][19] The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required.[20] This promise was known as the ""verbum."" If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., ""I marry you""), it was unquestionably binding;[18] if made in the future tense (""I will marry you""), it would constitute a betrothal. One of the functions of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages, which was not obligatory.

&gt; ''The divergence of those genetic lineages is among the oldest on earth,'' Dr. Knight said. ''So one could certainly make the inference that clicks were present in the mother tongue.''

That's one explanation, but others are quite possible.  Languages and genetic groupings are only loosely correlated.  For example, it's entirely possible that the distant ancestors of the Hadza adopted a language related to the San languages or vice versa.  Language replacement isn't unusual in human history.  

Clicks could also have spread through borrowing.  Sandawe and Hadza are isolated from other click languages today, but that's because over the last couple thousand years Bantu speakers have spread throughout the region, drowning out whatever languages were there before.  (In this respect, the click languages are like Basque, the last remnant of Europe's pre-IE linguistic diversity.)  Before the Bantu expansion, clicks were probably a widespread areal feature of central and southern African languages.  Maybe all these languages were descended from a common ancestor that had clicks.  However, it's just as possible that clicks arose in one language family and then spread to neighboring languages through borrowing.  After all, Southern Bantu languages like Xhosa and Zulu acquired clicks through contact.  If clicks spread through borrowing, they could have a much more recent origin than Knight claims.

It's not unusual for linguistic feature to spread across language family boundaries within a geographical region.  Two well-known examples are retroflex consonants in India and the [Balkan sprachbund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund).

(I wrote the above before looking closely at your Wikipedia link.  I basically just restated the first two ""unsupported assumptions"" listed there.  Oh, well.)

One interesting part of the Times article is Traill's point that we've never found evidence of a non-click consonant developing into a click.  This is a genuine mystery.  The initial development of clicks may have been ""special"" in some way and not a result of normal everyday phonological processes.  I'm resisting the urge to speculate wildly here.

Anyway, this is basically genetic evidence with possible linguistic implications rather than linguistic evidence per se, so my earlier point stands. ☺",1425948016

But in truth this is not the case.  Throughout the country it is difficult to find fields that are not sowed.  Only sand dunes and stony mountains... are not cultivated."" (p. 42, ""The New Settler's Attitude Toward the Arabs."")

The book repeatedly makes clear that the Zionists knew from the start that they would be displacing the Arabs from their homeland.  At the time the Zionist enterprise began, massive economic disparity made things much easier, because most of the land ownership was concentrated in the hands of a few who had little to lose by selling it.  But the tenants of that land, many of whom had formerly owned it, before being beggared by Ottoman empire taxation, were driven off it by the new owners and dispossessed.",1425948149

So Hitler was the most evil man in history. After his defeat, the theme for Europe was 'Never again'. The Americans? They had switched the titles and begun focus on the new evil. 

Gradually, Nazism became common arsenal in political attacks. Ideas are pools of effect, and the more you borrow from them, the less their impact will be. 

The American far right are going down the path. Historically speaking, collective bruised egos spawn elements in society that leave generations of descendants shuddering in confusion. Factually speaking, nothing could bruise egos more than losing control to a black man. 

Hitler was not a god, demon or whatever equivalent the atheists can identify with. What the world has done has reduced the very harsh lesson he taught us to a joke. 

""Of course Neoconservatives can't be compared to Nazis. That's just ridiculous."" ""Are you trying to say that he's like Hitler?? Argument dismissed"".

Once again society's desperation to protect by blanket stifling all references to a country of very real people doing very real things in very real circumstances has opened the doors to the reruns. 

All we can do is angrily watch, till our grandchildren emphatically insist 'Never again'.

The conflict started when Zionist European Jews started immigrating to Palestine with the stated goal of establishing a Jewish homeland. That happened right about the beginning of the 20th century and exacerbated during the 20's and 30's.

Let's see what I got:

When it comes to overall population relative to winners, the UK comes in first with a mighty 0.189913046 per 100,000. Germany is second with 0.123861679, US third with 0.112238745, France fourth with 0.096545185 and Poland fifth with 0.018116724.

Then, upon noticing a very large ratio of male:female winners of the prize, I decided to break it down further by total population by gender in relation to number of wins by gender.

**Male**

* UK - 0.372027962 (Per 100,000)
* GR - 0.251146284
* US - 0.220729224
* FR - 0.184813002
* PL - 0.031971224

**Female**

* UK - 0.013244138 (Per 100,000)
* FR - 0.013174329
* US - 0.008525634
* PL - 0.005032344
* GR - 0.002373362

So then, what conclusions can be based off of that? Nothing really. I mean the UK leads in every category, but the amount by which each country is separated is really not a huge difference. I think it would lend itself to say that we are all relatively intelligent (even Poland, which is skewed because eastern Europe appears to have been largely snubbed). Be wary of French women though, because apparently they are smart as hell.

Also, excluding these 5, there are only 201 other nobel winners which is divided among over 5,000,000 people. Without doing the calculation, I think it is fair to say that despite our little nitpicking over each other, we are all far into the top percentiles for intelligence (on this bizarre scale anyway).

So what did I wish I could have done differently? Well, first I have a hunch that the majority of winners come from urban populations. Noticing the residences of some winners I found that an unusually large percentage came from or did research in NYC, for example. I think it would be more fair to break up each country by the populations of its urban residents, but that data is pretty difficult to find and I don't have time for that. Also nobel prize is a pretty poor gauge for intelligence of a nation. Excluding peace and literature, they depend on advancement, something hard to do when you're not one of the top industrialized countries and don't have the money for research of this kind.

TL;DR There are some discrepancies when it comes to winner / population of a country but we're all extremely smart and nobel prize winners is a pretty poor gauge of intelligence anyway.",1425948305

Most of the Arab leadership is propped up by the US but even they can't force themselves to like Israel. That must really mean something.

&gt;I assume that there is a large number of Arabs who don't hate the Jews, but unfortunately, their voices aren't heard.

Oh come now, I don't hate black people but I don't feel the need to broadcast it. Why should Arabs have to prove to you that they aren't racist. That's just fucking ridiculous.

&gt;That much is conjecture.

No, I'm afraid it is fact. It is not my fault that you are ignorant.

&gt;I believe that their woes can be directly traced to petroleum. All that oil money meant that they didn't need to invest in their own societies to prosper. This much is fact.

I believe your conjecture here has merit. But most of the failed Arab governments are propped up by Zionist America. So ultimately the ball falls in zionism's court.

&gt;How is Zionism a threat to the Arabs? If the Arabs lay down their arms, they'll find that Israel will do the same.

There is no reason or evidence to believe this is true, at all. What planet are you from? All the Arab Israeli wars were *started*, without any substantive provocation from the arab side, by Israel. From its inception Israel was a hostile and aggressive entity with a hunger to expand its territory. The idea that Israel would give up the occupation, settlements and accept back all the Palestinian refugees if the Arabs put down their weapons is patently farcical. Are you a comedian? What would most likely happen is that Israeli tanks would be rolling across the border the next day.


&gt;That only proves that they lost. They are imagining that they lost because of anything other than that the Jews fought better in 1948.

I like how you focussed on the first sentence yet ignored the rest of the paragraph. Let me paste it here again. Please don't make this discussion tedious: 

That in of itself demonstrates that the Arabs are not imagining it all. But let me clear up the picture a bit. The Zionazis illegally planted a European colony in Palestine, engaged in premeditated campaigns of ethnic cleansing to remove the natives, launched several wars against its neighbours to gain territory, still illegally occupies those territories they stole and oppresses and tortures the inhabitants. Zionazism, is by all accounts, the biggest threat to the Arabs.

&gt;Both the Ottomans and the British did their best to keep Jews from settling in Palestine when they were in charge. How did they plant a European colony in Palestine??? The modern Jewish settlement began in the 1880s when the Turks were in power here. Why would they want a European colony here? You're not making any sense.

I am specifically referring to the illegal creation of Israel - a hostile European colony by all accounts. ",1425948302

A couple of years ago my mother spent 3 weeks on an NHS ward, and although there were no alcoholics (or notable deaths, that I recall) during her stay, in many ways it was just as bad as this one. I guess my mother's ward may have been a non-critical one, although that doesn't quite jibe with how concerned we were at the time over her health. She has abdominal pain &amp; swelling and was ambulanced in from the surgery of her general practitioning doctor; in the initial days she was warned that he might be taken into surgery without notice, if her condition (and discharges) didn't improve.

Yet for a ward of, I think, 26 patients, there were only 3 or 4 nurses on duty. One old lady was unable to feed herself, and was lucky that she had relatives who visited, as she got little assistance - none of them did - from the staff. Each bed had pay-per-view internet access, but the basics of care seemed very much lacking. Some of the nurses just exuded an uncaring attitude, others were clearly just overworked. 

After three weeks the swelling went down, and my mother was released. She was glad to be able to spend Christmas at home, then a few days later visited the local private clinic at her own expense. She was quickly diagnosed by the consultant, and it was clear that the cause of her symptoms had not been identified during her stay in hospital. This is despite the fact that the same guy worked at the hospital - in fact, the private clinic is just around the corner from the main hospital in my town, presumably for the convenience of the doctors (who invariably worked in both) and so that they could rent surgical facilities if necessary. The whole problem is that the NHS doesn't have enough surgeons, and you effectively get to jump the queue to see the consultant if you have the means to pay his private fees. A few days later he removed one of her ovaries - its fallopian tube had been twisted - and she went home the same day. She would have been waiting 3 months to see this same consultant on the NHS, at the risk of another hospital admission.

I could go on much longer illustrating with a couple of other cases I'm aware of, but at the end of the day universal healthcare is expensive, and we're not giving it either the money or the attention it deserves.

I believe that the problematic bureaucracy which undermines the NHS is due to the service being answerable to short-sighted vote-chasing politicians. Our electoral system ensures that one lot of cretins can only be replaced by another lot with an identical agenda, and at the end of the day the public don't want to pay increased taxes when the results won't really materialise for a decade or two. 

If we want good socialised medicine - and I believe that Europeans generally do, I'm not sure about the Brits ;) - we have to say *""fuck it, I'm prepared to forgo that 42"" flatscreen TV this year so that these unfortunate alcoholics can receive better care""* (although by the sounds of it, they're receiving more attention than the NHS average). We need to release doctors, nurses, teachers and even the police from income tax and make it up by increasing the load upon everybody else, and we have to look at *all* our socialised services to see how we can do them better.

If you look at nothing but [statistical rankings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Europe) then there's little to choose between the healthcare systems of France, Sweden, Germany &amp; the UK. I can't imagine, however, visits to a hospital anywhere else in Europe being quite as unpleasant as some of those I've made under the NHS, and I mention Sweden because they have amongst the highest taxes in Europe and are also [amongst the happiest people in Europe](http://www.thelocal.se/12796/20080702/).

Don't get me wrong I'm not just promoting higher taxes in isolation - it's due to our political system that that would be ineffective, and which gives everyone, cpeter9 included, grounds for a lack of faith in social care. Most European countries have had proportional representation for decades.

&gt;The FEMA Camps DO exist

I never said that they don't.  I just don't believe that their purpose is to exterminate the American population. A common theme in NWO theory.

&gt;Civilian Inmate Labor Camps

Yes, if you're incarcerated there is a possibility that you could be sweeping floors/cleaning garbage on a military base.  This document, and inmate labour program has been around for 10 plus years.  Prisons are a business, the military is a business, this is a logical extension of that ideology.  I don't support it, but that does not mean the government is conspiring to incarcerate the population and have them weed military bases.

&gt;The Bilderberg group really does exist

I know of no one that disputes that claim.

&gt;Oh, and if you really believe the 9/11 official story, here's an awesome documentary that just came out that blows that story out of the water

Core of Corruption.  Another conspiracy documentary aka collection of news clips, trip hop, bad editing, and worse narration.  The way I feel about these types of films is, if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  There are no new arguments, no new evidence, no cogent counter theory, no new life to the corpse of the 9/11 truth movement.  Its simply a re-packaging of the same tired arguments of the past 8 years.

&gt;I know you frequent the conspiracy boards, so chances are the evidence I just provided won't make a dent in your position, either because you're a troll, a shill, or just a smart person who happens to stick very rigidly to a world view that simply isn't supported by the historical evidence.

The evidence you've provided, I've seen many times, and had subsequent discussions on it.  Its not a matter of denting my amour, or a rigid world view.  I would contend my world view is much more dynamic than most here.  I've seen the 'best' evidence of an evil NWO and yet I still dismiss it.  I do not however dismiss individual pieces of it.  I've seen the same puzzle as you, I just put the pieces together in a different manner. 

&gt;Do you really think that men don't conspire to ever greater power, and use any means to achieve that? Are you ignoring the thousands of years of empire building that has gone on in this world, and the millions upon millions of people enslaved, killed and maimed because of it?

No, people conspire all the time.  There are thousands of documented instances of it through out history.  It happening today..look at wall street.  The difference is the conspiracies I believe don't require and inordinate amount of co operation between elites, and span hundreds of years.  I also recognize that the NWO conspiracy theories are ethnocentric and don't address the other 5.5 billion people on the earth, or the elites beyond north america and westren europe.

&gt;Oh and for good measure- if you really want to know why we're so suspicious of a world banking system with a one world currency, maybe, just maybe, you ought to familiarize yourself with the history of the Federal Reserve and how the banking system really works (along with the economy in general).

&gt;The Suez Crisis, also referred to as the Tripartite Aggression,[4] (Arabic: أزمة السويس - العدوان الثلاثي‎ ʾAzmat al-Sūwais/Al-ʿIdwān al-Thalāthī; French: Crise du canal de Suez; Hebrew: מבצע קדש‎ Kadesh Campaign, or מלחמת סיני Sinai War) was a military attack on Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel beginning on 29 October 1956.[5][6]

Go figure.

&gt;1967 - Nasser closes the straits of Tiran to Israeli ships, which is an act of war. 

Nope, embargoes and blockades aren't considered acts of war and are in fact commonly seen as a way to enact peaceful political and economic pressure without resorting to outright hostilities. Israel was itching for any excuse to launch an invasion. Israel started this one and grabbed huge chunks of land which it still sits on today. It was a premeditated imperial war of expansion by Israel.

&gt;1973 - Israel is invaded on all sides during Yom Kippur 1982

You may have an argument here but most knowledgeable people recognise that it was a just war to regain territories Israel had grabbed in its war of expansion of 67 and still hadn't returned. 

&gt;Israel invades Lebanon to attack the PLO, which had tried to assassinate Israel's ambassador to the UK

So you justify this barbaric invasion because a single diplomat was targeted by a group located there?  Fucking ridiculous. You know how many people died because of this ridiculous invasion?

&gt;and had also fired katyusha rockets at Israel and carried out various other terror attacks. 

Not surprising as Israel was engaged in an illegal occupation and had expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were living in squalid refugee camps. I would be surprised if they didn't launch attacks against Israel. 

&gt;2006 - Israel invades Lebanon to try to get back two soldiers who were captured by Hezbollah which crossed the border into Israel.

Israel was illegally sitting on the Golan Heights and Sheba farms. Israel was also holding Lebanese prisoners at the time which Hezbollah and the Lebanese gov wanted back. So Israel is ultimately responsible for this one as well.

&gt;2008 - Israel attacks the Hamas in Gaza after 8 years of having rockets fired into its cities.

Actually, this round of hostilities was started by Israel after it broke the ceasefire in November by targeting several Hamas members. 

You really need to get your information from more balanced and reliable sources.

&gt;I never said Israel would accept all the refugees back. That would be suicide for Israel. 

Then Israel doesn't genuinely seek an equitable resolution to this long conflict. ""A bad peace is worse than war"" Tacitus said. Real peace here would require all main grievances which drive this conflict to be rectified. The huge number of Palestinian refugees created by Israel is a major one. 

&gt;The Palestinian refugees should be settled in the host countries the same as Jewish refugees from Arab countries were settled in Israel, and don't make claims to have their houses returned.

The expulsion of Jews from Arab countries does not morally justify the ethnic cleansing of the native Pals. Nobody with a brain is going to take this argument seriously. 

&gt;Israel has as many Jews of European descent as it has Jews of Arab descent. Not quite a European colony.

It doesn't matter. It is still a foreign colony.",1425948345

If you look at it from the Jewish perspective, then the whole Christian religion would have been a violation of human rights.

If you look at the Muslims, then their denominations are all an insult to the others. Existing is a violation to human rights of others.  You had the Sunni first, then the Shia did not believe that the succession of the Caliphate. They reject the first three Caliphates. Then you have the Wahhabi sect.

People will assimilate as much as they have to, but no more. They will almost always try to follow the rules they were brought up to believe in, as opposed to the 'local' rules.

As someone who has lived in a number of different countries in my life, I have first hand experience of this happening with Brits abroad, just as I have seen it happening with 'foreign' communities here. It's just human nature.

Over time, both communities kinda merge into one, depending on the relevant sizes, consuming parts from both, and dropping other parts, as seems fit. It has happened numerous times in the UK (Norman, Saxon, Roman, etc), and will continue to happen. It's kind of a 'community evolution'.

As for the Sharia law thing, sure, there are a number of hardliners wanting things their way. They should have no voice, but they do. We need to deal with that. However, it shuold be noted that Sharia law already *has* a place in civil law here in the UK. So does Jewish law. Even the old Romany Gypsy laws have a standing in civil law. As long as both parties agree, any purely *civil* law matter can be resolved by Sharia law. I have no problem with this, because it still has to comply with our laws. This ensured some of the more 'extreme' elements of Sharia law are banned, such as whipping, etc.

&gt;Results of a DNA study by geneticist Ariella Oppenheim appears to match historical accounts that Arab Israelis and Palestinians,[92][93] together as the one same population, represent modern ""descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times"", albeit religiously first Christianized then largely Islamized, and all eventually culturally Arabized.[94] Referring to those of the Muslim faith more specifically, it reaffirmed that Palestinian ""Muslim Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel, Sinai and part of Jordan."" Geneticist Michael Hammer praised ""the study for 'focusing in detail on the Jewish and Palestinian populations.'"" [95]

&gt;While both the Palestinians and the world's distinct Jewish populations have mixed with invading and host populations respectively, Oppenheim's team found ""that Jews have mixed more with other populations, which makes sense because they were more likely to leave the Levant."".[96]

(This BTW, was America's fault not the fault of the carmakers). This meant that Ford and GM and Chrysler had higher fixed costs than the Asians or Europeans. 

Policies like the Jobs Bank meant that employee wages became a fixed rather than a variable cost so even when a car isn't selling it makes economic sense to keep the line running and building up on finished inventories and then selling the cars at rock bottom fleet prices to corporate customers hurting the image of their brands. That was 100% the fault of the Big Three for not standing up to the UAW in the 1960s and 1970s when they had the power and leverage to do so. 

Having higher fixed costs meant that it wasn't as profitable for US carmakers to build small economy cars as it was for the Japanese or the Koreans.

First of all they will no doubt be attracted to those of their physical age, or similar, because what's the alternative? There usually aren't many immortal women around, and if there were, the conflict between loving a mortal you may see grow old and die wouldn't be there. 

Looking at it scientifically, if you stop aging as a teen, your brain stays the way it is, even if you gain knowledge with time. So that whole thing where you're told that you don't get full grasp of how activities are dangerous until you're 20 something, so teens do stupid things? Yeah.

But presuming that these immortals are mature for their physical age [some teens are after all mature], and presuming a fantasy setting [often coupled with a historical time period that is vaguely Ye Olde Englandy-Europe where teens were more mature than today] it's not unreasonable at all in terms of attraction.

But what is unreasonable is the Twilight scenario where old vamp or similar falls in love with girl of the 21st century. Girls today for the most part are petty and fickle at 16. There are exceptions, and theoretically Bella was one of them, but I don't see it. Haven't read the books, skimmed a page once or twice, but it's so... badly written that I just can't. 

But a similar thing happened to me and my work. A friend and I were RPing a story. My character was an old traditional mostly patriarchal vampire. Hers was a teenage feminist. They were love interests, but... it wouldn't work. My character refused to stay with her because the mannerisms of a girl her age, influenced by feminism and the modern world, simply did not work with the olde style he was used to.

A brief history on Presidential actions in *emergencies*

During the Civil War, Lincoln, Constitutionally, suspended the writ of habeas corpus.  That meant, the Union could arrest anyone, and hold them indefinitely, without telling them what they have been accused of, or trial.  

Washington summoned troops to Pennsylvania when revenue laws were openly disobeyed

President John Adams issued a warrant for the arrest of Jonathan Robbins in order to execute the extradition provisions of a treaty.

Without declaration of war, President Lincoln took energetic action with the outbreak of the War Between the States. He summoned troops and paid them out of the Treasury without appropriation therefore….

President Hayes authorized the wide-spread use of federal troops during the Railroad Strike of 1877. 

President Cleveland also used the troops in the Pullman Strike of 1895 and his action is of special significance. No statute authorized this action.

Beginning with the Bank Holiday Proclamation and continuing through World War II, executive leadership and initiative were characteristic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. In 1939, upon the outbreak of war in Europe, the President proclaimed a limited national emergency for the purpose of strengthening our national defense. In May of 1941, the danger from the Axis belligerents having become clear, the President proclaimed ""an unlimited national emergency"" calling for mobilization of the Nation's defenses to repel aggression. The President took the initiative in strengthening our defenses by acquiring rights from the British Government to establish air bases in exchange for overage destroyers. 

During wartime, using his constitutional powers the President can do all most anything, as long as it relates to prosecuting the war.  ",1425948594

The expats are obviously less inclined to be critical than the refugees, as the former group intends to return and the latter group escaped.  Still, patterns emerge when you discuss the DPRK with them.

The general feeling I got was that Kim Il Sung was greatly respected and loved by the North Korean people in a genuine way.  Not feared -- loved.  Even the North Koreans that fled the country seemed to have a soft place in their heart for him.

He is so revered in North Korea that, despite being dead, he is still officially head of state.

His son has failed in a general way to endear himself to the populace in the same way, but as the son of Kim Il Sung he gets a lot of respect automatically.

People like to throw around ""communist"" and ""stalinist"" when describing North Korea, but really the key to understanding the situation there is to realize that it's really a monarchy.  If you look at European history there are a lot of examples of a strong and well-loved king being followed by someone less well-liked -- but that doesn't immediately signal the end of a dynasty.

The other thing that's important to realize is that the North Koreans, on a whole, feel constantly threatened by their neighbors.  The border with South Korea is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world and the Korean war never officially ended -- legally North and South are still in a state of war.

North Koreans learn from a young age that the only reason that North Korea and South Korea are divided is because of US imperialist interests in the region.  They are taught that we are there, oppressing the workers against their will.

This propaganda is obviously entirely false today, but that wasn't always the case.  Communist sympathizers in South Korea in the years following the unofficial ""end"" of the Korean war were brutally suppressed, and South Korea only recently became a democratic nation.  Before 1987, it was a despotic military dictatorship that happened to be capitalist.  Park Chung-hee brutalized his people, but presided over very high economic growth.  General Chun Doo-Hwan, who followed him, was just as bad.

The situation in North Korea at that time was probably worse -- the stories of Statist brutality in the region are legion -- but it's important to understand that as recently as 25 years ago, what seems like ridiculous propaganda about the South wasn't in fact as ridiculous as it seems now.  Look up the story of Park Jong Chul, for example, a student who was tortured to death by the South Korean military government.  There are lots of stories like his, unfortunately.

The fact that the US maintains a massive military presence in South Korea does little to convince North Koreans that we *don't* have imperialist ambitions on the peninsula.  Put yourself in their shoes for a moment -- they grow up hearing that South Korea is a capitalist dictatorship that brutalizes its people at the behest of the United States.  Given that backdrop of propaganda, how do you think they're likely to interpret our military presence there?

North Korea's self-imposed isolation (it is the cornerstone of Kim Il Sung's Juche ideal of self-reliance) means that most of them aren't up on current affairs.  They see the Japan of today as little different from the Japan of 1945.  They see South Korea as little different from the South Korea of 1953.

Even China, their only real ally historically, has been distancing itself from them as it becomes more capitalist and emerges as a global political player.

North Koreans feel like they have enemies on all sides, which the rulers use to their advantage to keep the population under control.

A choice quote by Hermann Göring really sums it all up quite well:

&gt;Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ...voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

$1,928 per capita is very low figure if we are talking about total spending. Based on NationMaster statistics, it's [below average](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_hea_car_fun_tot_per_cap-care-funding-total-per-capita). Now, if we are looking at [*private* spending](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_hea_car_fun_pri_per_cap-care-funding-private-per-capita), then the $1,928 looks slightly more in line. Of course, referring to private spending when most industrialized countries have publicly funded health care is incredibly misleading.

Furthermore, most medical research in the world happens in the US. And in some calculations, this has been slipped in partially or as a whole, which naturally inflates the total. I don't if that is the case here, but since the number is low when compared to others, it may not be the case.

And we can't ignore the fact that US health care is more or less a half private, half public arrangement in terms of funding. **It is not a private industry**. And having government pay for private anything usually leads to price hikes as government isn't or can't be a discerning consumer. Nor is it an unregulated industry; the cost of following regulations tends to be very great.

Now, the most important point is one that is rarely mentioned: socialized health care tends to be *undercapitalized*. Which means that, instead of having as many X-ray machines as there is demand for, hospitals only acquire as many X-ray machines as the budget allows. So a direct supply and demand connection is severed, with politicians and bureaucrats directing supply. Which leads to delays and a downgrade in health care. Futhermore, socialized health care allows the government to act as a monopsony, which means that as the government is the only employer in town, they can also set the wages. Thus driving down total costs of health care at the expense of doctors and nurses. Which is huge component in making European health care so cheap (of course at the cost of having an acute deficiency of skilled doctors and nurses).

Now, all this is not meant to claim that the US system doesn't need reforming. I'm simply trying to highlight that the situation isn't a false dichotomy between socialized health care or the US system; that other alternatives exist. And that one should truly look at the reasons that cause the problem in the first place, instead of relying on simplified correlations that looking at expenses tends to give.",1425948638

True. There is no panic since the government doesn't allow people to opt out of the system.

As for claiming that it isn't a Ponzi scheme on account that the government can force people to pay more isn't a very convincing argument. If a Ponzi scheme operator had similar authority as the government, he could just as well order people to pay in more and/or decrease out-going payments.

No, they see an egalitarian society a product of the common ownership of the means of production, that is as opposed to an unfair society in which the means of production are held in private and people are unable to fairly benefit from their labour.  It's less of an issue now, but a significant issue when we first started to see real benefits and problems with industrialisation, in short, people worked for very little and produced much for someone else.  

&gt;The true definition of Socialism is the abolition of private property, and you should find this in any serious text.

There is a lot of discussion about this, usually from a left/right perspective, however it is nonsensical to presume that socialism is defined by the abolition of private property (indeed it seems more like right wind propaganda than anything else).  Under a socialist system your private property remains your own, unless that private property happens to be a factory, farm or shop etc.. In which case it is collectively held.  Your iPod, your shoes, your clothes and your bike don't suddenly become everyones, people can't just come into your house and take what they wish.

&gt;The reason socialism does not produce wealth is because wealth is a subjective concept of property. When property is collectively owned, there is no exchange of property between entities making subjective valuations.

This is false, unless you are in a position where the whole world is socialist and everything is abundant, then you will still have what amounts to market forces in play.  Some people will want certain items, other will want something else, at that point things have real and subjective value.  People seem to assume that in a socialist system the idea is that the system should only strive to fulfill needs but not attempt to provide anything else.  Now obviously if you look at the most notable attempts at all out socialism (and I am misusing the term here) such as the Soviet Union, it is clear that those systems failed to even provide for the needs of their citizenry, let alone their 'wants'/

However, this the above is an ideological discourse that is at a tangent to the point.

&gt;As for how this translates to the bail outs, the issue is that property is being appropriated by a collective entity - the government. In this case it is doing it primarily through debt (which will end up as tax) and through the destruction of the currency.

This is true, but not a product of the bailout on its own, inflation, the products of the fractional reserve system, taxation and a few other elements have continuously taken 'wealth' from one group and handed it to another (whether that is the government workers, welfare recipients, universities, road builders or the military).  It is rather clear however that the government have not taken control of the means of production, either directly or indirectly.  This bailout is a rather stark reminder of that, rather than taking over and winding down banks, they have been propped up and ownership has remained with the shareholders.  

The US bailout is not a socialist policy, it does nothing to take from the owners of companies and provide for the workers, it does nothing to promote an egalitarian society.  It does the opposite, it robs ordinary Americans and hands the proceeds to the select few.

&gt;This is why a good measure of how socialist a country is is its ratio of GDP to government spending (although both these statistics are routinely falsified by governments).

No, that is a good measure of government spending, no more and no less.

A measure of how socialist (using the strict definition) a country is would be to look at who owns what, specifically who owns the industry, the mines and the farms.

If you use the absolute definition of socialism then the bailout is clearly not socialist.  If you use the European model of socialism, whereby the state provides certain services, then it isn't that either.  Look at who is benefiting and who is suffering.  It isn't society generally that is seeing a benefit here, it is a select few. 

I assume you have a dim view of anything even akin to socialism, either in an ideological sense or a practical sense, you also seem to be strongly against this bailout.  Well I don't take a dim view of socialism, quite the opposite, although I wouldn't describe myself as either a communist or even a straightforward socialist, I also feel strongly that this bailout is a bad thing, it does nothing to forward my political aims (and frankly it isn't supposed to). 

I should also probably add that I don't think that the fractional reserve system, as it is structured now and in the recent past is viable, nor do I think that banks should be able to loan money in return for interest (direct investments into actual projects or assets is fine), but I do think governments should finance certain core services and provide them to society generally (and pay for them through taxation not deficit spending).

So in short, the bailout is a bad thing, it is not socialism, it is a misguided attempt to retain the status quo that gave rise to the situation.  The situation we find ourselves in is as a result (in my opinion) of mismanagement, over-regulation where it wasn't required and a lack of regulation where it was, a poor legislative agenda generally, greed on the part of banks and individuals and as a result of the kind of mess that occurs when you use mock capitalism to concentrate wealth massively.

There are two aspects that increase Medicaid and Medicare:

1. Increasing costs per beneficiary, and
2. increasing number of beneficiaries due to aging of the baby bloomers.

The increasing costs per beneficiary have multiple sources. One of the biggest is the rising obesity and related illnesses. I have still these number in my head, because they are easy to remember: Average cost of treating person with normal weight is ~$3000, for obese person ~$4000, and morbidly obese ~$5000. Every new fatty increases costs by 33%. Number of obese people doubled in ten years period 1990-2000. Now the problem is growing obesity in young (that increases per person costs even more).  Other source of increasing costs is technology costs, there is more and more treatments that treat patients that are more sick.

The first is whether the USA should intervene in nations in which unelected dictators abuse their populations.

The second is whether the focus on Iran's brutal regime is simply to build up support for a war waged for other purposes.

As a non-American whose government recently snubbed the Dalai Lama to appease China, I feel that democratic nations must support democracy and fight tyranny wherever it occurs.

At the same time, there's the harm principal.  Waging war against Russia or China would certainly cause more harm than it alleviates.

While the agenda for American aggression against Iran might be cynical, is it not possible that destroying the Iranian regime might not be an easy victory for democracy, compared with taking on China or Russia?

Probably not.  The recent military destruction of two brutal regimes, the Taliban and the Baathist regime by military intervention has clearly been a failure.

A better route, I feel as a South African whose country was democratised by the activities of a radical liberation movement forcing the dictatorship to come to terms or face destruction, is to support local movements for democracy - even radical ones.  But this should not be limited to Iran, but should include Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, China, etc..

Walt Whitman said that the job of America was to cheer up slaves and horrify foreign despots.  

In contrast, Monroe's cynical approach to controlling the Americas while keeping Europe off the USA's back by assuring them of the US's neutrality in their affairs was pursued even into the Reagan era - until it's eventual capitulation led to the wave of leftist (and sometimes anti-American) leaders in South America.

IMO, the USA would do better listening to Whitman than to Monroe.  But that's not to say that a military approach would yield the desired results in the most oppressive nations.",1425948878

Government financed, anthropomorphic global warming scientists, using *correlation models that take weather patterns as a given*, argue against the research results of solar cycle scientists, and Laura Shin, the author of the article, instead of presenting the counter case of solar cycle theory, and providing evidence of how the NAO is somehow not driven by the Sun, she instead sets up a straw man called ""climate change deniers"", and then claims that her straw man is saying that solar cycle scientists think that the NAO is what is responsible for temperature.

See, it's easy to think you have refuted the solar cycle scientists by attributing to them a false reason for *why* they think climate change is not man-driven, and then, after finding a semi-perfect correlation which refutes what you think they are saying, then make the conclusion that global warming is man-made?  What?  What kind of logic is that?

With that kind of logic, I could make the claim that the anthropomorphic climate change scientists think that climate is driven by the Knicks winning percentage.  After doing a study that shows there is no connection, I then claim that I have refuted the anthropomorphic scientists, and hence refuted the anthropomorphic theory.

Solar-cycle scientists are not saying that the NAO causes temperature variation.  They are saying that the Sun drives climate variation.  Using astrophysical records, we know that during the medieval warm period, the Sun's activity was especially high, much higher than it is today.

Weather patterns like the NAO are not only not constant, as the scientists of this study even admit, which by itself fails to prove a connection between NAO and climate, but they use Europe as a proxy for the whole planet.  That is intellectually lazy.

The author should realize that the way these government paid scientists could have refuted the solar cycle scientists is by showing that the Sun doesn't drive the Earth's climate.  But she knows she can't do that, so she focuses on wind and precipitation patterns of this study, and then make the non-sequitor conclusion that man causes temperature variation.

No, it's not fine. Nicolas Sarkozy committed high treason. Our president won against the left because he convinced the far right to vote for him with anti-immigrant rhetoric, calling young delinquents scum, saying he'll use a kärcher to wash them away.

After winning the election, he did a U-Turn and said we should all fuck (literally) with each other because diversity is so great and being a mongrel is better than having our own culture.

The treason will have a high cost.. in blood. The medias is propping up the pro-Diversity (immigration) propaganda to eleven but the French people isn't dumb, they know it's not all peace and love.

Obama doesn't ""have an opinion"". He has the same thoughts, or lack of, as Bush had. Look, compare what Obama is doing with Turkey with what Bush did when the negotiations with Turkey began. The same thing.
Left, Right. Dems, Reps. The same thing. They are puppets with hidden masters pulling the strings.

Both President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao are at loggerheads with the Central Committee and the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China over issues of major geopolitical financial fraud.

First, a 25-page G20 privileged document detailing secret collusion between the Obama White House and China to precipitate the US national bankruptcy into a carefully staged USA-wide middle-class financial collapse has been exposed. Chinese attempts to recall the document have failed.

Second, Wen Jiabao with the support (he says) of Hu Jintao gave secret computer access codes to George Bush Jnr during the dying days of the Bush US administration. These codes gave the Bush White House wire-transfer access to the massive Farm Claims, Omega Fund and international prosperity fund accounts. The subsequent attempts at theft were traced in Europe using Inslaw/PROMIS (and other) security software and were blocked.

There is a real possibility, now, that both Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao will go the way of former Shanghai Communist party chief Chen Liangyu. In April 2008, Chen was removed from his post and sentenced to 18 years in prison after being linked to a social insurance fund scandal involving the attempted theft of 3.7 billion yuan.

And let's not forget the executed Madame Wu Yi. On Friday 16th May 2008, a $14 trillion sum of money belonging to China was moved into Citibank. It was then illegally moved offshore by Madame Wu Yi. Acting in personal Ming family interests, she put out the cover story that John Glover Roberts, Alan Greenspan and Dick Cheney had attempted to steal the funds, had failed and had been taken into custody. Her intention was to split the money between herself and George Bush Jnr, each party taking $7 trillion each. Upon discovery, Madame Wu Yi faced a long interrogation before she was allowed to die.

And then on Monday 11th August 2008, John Glover Roberts, the seventeenth Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, was caught by US security agents trying to gain unlawful access to the global prosperity funds. Roberts attempted to do this using out-of-date wire transfer codes obtained from the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors (Zhou Wenzhong and Ichiro Fujisaki). These ambassadors to the US had been relieved of their duties during the week beginning 21st July 2008. Both are now dead.

Though you may stereotype Texans and other Americans as redneck racists (and admittedly I just did in my previous post), you'd be surprised to find that Southerners are among the friendliest and most welcoming people in the country.  Likewise, the North was built on immigrant labor and has a mix of cultures that at the time was unlike anything in the world, and might still be. Even today, my parents are immigrants and were accepted and welcomed by other Americans when they arrived in this country.  Those Americans in turn came from their own cultures maybe 3-4 generations ago, which is practically nothing by European standards. Each generation is able to preserve their own cultural identity while simultaneously identifying as ""Americans"", which is something unique to this country.

Although there is racism and distrust in America, the country could have never become what it is if it weren't for the acceptance of immigrants and other cultures. Yes there has always been pushback against immigrants in America, but ultimately they won out and the country, especially the North, is accepted as a vast cultural ""melting pot"".

With Europeans like yourself, though, you discriminate because of centuries of pent-up distrust and hate. You refer to Turkey as a stinking country and oppose them not only because of who they actually are, but because you have a long-ingrained belief that they simply aren't suitable to be counted among the ranks of ""Europeans"".

Correct. 

&gt; The concept of paper ownership was a European concept introduced through colonial expansion.

Wrong. The concept of paper ownership was alive and well within the Ottoman empire (and Turkey still won't release the archives that show exactly who owned what). In fact, private land ownership was allowed by Ottoman empire, just that majority of the palestinian arabs wouldn't ever be able to qualify. After all, the father of Muhammad Amin al-Husseini used the Ottoman landcode to bar jewish emigration for a number of years at the peak of european antisemitism.

&gt; So it's only natural that the Jews that came to take over land would bring that concept and use that as the sole excuse for why they could have legitimate claim over the area.

Also wrong. Let's say two villages lay next to each other at the distance of fifty kilometers, and each takes five square kilometers around itself for farming. Does this mean that all the other space between, above and around, also belongs to these two villages collectively? That was the exact situation in late 19th century. Documentation exists today from which these conclusions are derived. 

If, let's say, jews came to Palestine and displaced both villages by force (""for ethnically pure state"" would say reddit antisemites) so as to occupy all land around them, that'd be wrong. But that is not what happened. Jews settled **next** to arabs and lived side by side for many years. Cooperation between jews and arabs was always mutually benefitial (and still is; guess *whose* money is used in Gaza and West Bank), until foreign forces (represented by the local Nazi I mentioned above and Syrian &amp; Egyptian media) started inciting hatred against jews, to instigate a conflict which would justify an arab invasion into post-mandate Palestine (for the purposes of its annexation, also well documented). That worked very well, so well, in fact, that a century later we can still see the fruits.

This is called the box problem. The land that the British called Palestine (a name which hasn't seen a whole lot of use otherwise) is not a box. You don't have to remove people A to put in people B. However, people A opened a bloody war on people B on people C's behalf, and now paying for it with refugee camps and universal contempt of people B *and* people C.

&gt; The Jews and Palestinians that lived there prior to the Ashkenazi invasion, were the stewards of the land living there for generations. 

Yes, some generations less than others - in fact, just how many generations do you personally think it goes? Nowhere in any modern literature you would find any mention of ""palestinian people"" much less ""palestinian country"" or ""palestinian government"" or ""palestinian language"" or ""palestinian culture"" that goes beyond 1850. Absent a sovereignty and any cultural or national bond or aspiration for the entire period of its claimed history, ""palestinian"" people were not entitled to the land they did not physically occupy, and many of them immigrated to it because of and during the industrialization and capital flow that was accelerated by the arrival of zionism. Either way, palestinian arabs were used and duped into trying to claim exclusive dominion over something that they neither owned nor had a right to own nor wanted to own anyway.

&gt; What your suggesting is the same reasoning we see when Zionist-Police force Palestinians from their homes, claiming they belong to scum Zionist Settlers.

What I suggest is the cold hard truth from recorded history: nazi sponsorship of certain palestinian arabs and greed of the same palestinian arabs, coupled with ignorance of the masses, has caused this conflict.

I have read some comments about your column. The extremists were always there in Islam. Ali Ibn Abi Talib Als the fourth Caliph of Islam had to openly fight with them in Nahrewan.

The Prophet had said ,""I am leaving behind two weighty things among you, one is the Book-Quran and the other is my progeny, as long as you will stick with them, you will not be lost."" But soon at his last moments in this world Umer Ibn Khettab - later the 2nd Caliph of Islam, declared beside his bed, 'The Book is sufficient for them' and greater number of the people of Islam  in the shape of Sunni Islam follow what Hazrat Umer had said.

You are right that what you're seeing in many cases is a continuation of the Bush administration policy, spun differently. You are also probably right to suggest that they are puppets with hidden masters pulling the string. I don't personally believe it's that cut and dry, but just as Bush was heavily supported by big Oil all his life and we had a big Oil administration, Obama's main support comes from Wall street and he's doing his job for them fairly well at the moment.

Obama communicated a policy that is remarkably different to that which Bush communicated and provides a clean break for US-Turkish relations. This is why it's gone down so well. Turkey has gone from being a massive supporter of the US in the Clinton administration to having a general hatred of the US Government machine. The Turks were particularly badly fucked by the Bush administration over Iraq, Syria and Iran policy. Even the US position on Israel started to be at odds with the official Turkish position.

What Obama has done is turn up to repair the PR damage caused by the Bush administration. Both Bush and Obama know that they have no influence over EU accession talks - it makes no difference if they support EU membership but by doing so it gives the Turkish media a nice soundbite (It may surprise you to know that the majority of Turks do not want to be part of the EU).

Sarkozy going in favour of the immigrants isn't treason, it's because he doesn't have the power to drive that policy forwards. Anyone who looked at his promises and EU law would've known he couldn't push that through because immigrants are protected by the EU convention on human rights as much as you are.

First, Bush may have fucked up the US relations with the Turks. But that's mostly incompetence, if you read what he used to say about Turkey is clear, he thought Turkey is a strategic ally to have a foot in the middle east with a moderately muslim country. The same position as Obama. The execution is different, but that's because of incompetence, not because he wasn't set on making Turkey an US ally. Both Bush and Obama positions with regards to the European Union were the same.
Today on the TV a political analyst even thought that Obama pushed the Turkey agenda publicly on the EU because he thought the americans wished to weaken further the EU by making a country that has absolutely nothing not even an inch in common with the rest of the EU, thus strengthening the USA as the most powerful superpower of the world. And that's on a TV channel that was full of people who initially thought Obama meant 100% change of the USA, people who bought into the ""nigger will do better"". Seriously, most of them focused on his skin color here in France as if being black made him more tolerant, more open to change and so on.

Sarkozy position on the immigrants IS treason precisely because he promised it. I didn't believe it, which is why I voted for the centrist candidate François Bayrou (YES I DIDNT VOTE FAR RIGHT. Even though I hate the muslims. Guess why ? because you don't fight fire with fire. The far right would get us rid of the muslims but we'd instead have to deal with their mindfucked view on religion, on morality and on work laws). François Bayrou, centrist candidate, was the only one who didn't make promises that couldn't be kept which explains why he didn't make it for the second turn of votes.

Yes the EU laws would make what I wish someone planned harder. But I think the EU is an artifact that needs to simply die anyway. It's the powers of the market, not the people. Banks makes the laws in the EU. People who live in the newest member countries are regretting their joining the EU because while it somewhat helps them economically on the short term, on the long term they lose sovereignty. 

Sarkozy is committing high treason because he promised more than the impossible. Not only did he promise us to get rid of them, he joined the NATO commandment and bound France to a chain and balls even more deeply. If he didn't do anything that made the immigration problem worse, I wouldn't be so angry but here he goes, making us full part of the same forces that invaded Serbia and let the muslims take power and declare independance of Kosovo. The same thing will happen to us if we don't do anything to solve this muslim problem here.

Yes we are losing our social rights. But I couldn't care less, facing an even deeper problems. 
I'm not a true racist in the sense of the word (someone who believes in their master race and things genes do everything). I know one thing, I hate muslims with passion, having to live with them. And they hate me, or rather, ""us"", in return, just as much.
The difference being, when one of them assault us, it's never ""racist"" even if the guy didn't do anything to provoke them. When we defend our pride when they insult us in public, we are the racists. Fucking nonsense.

The right to strike I don't care because most of the strikers are leftists, communists (seriously, there are a lot of young people here who thinks communist is IN), anarchists, redskins, people who work for the government (now that's irony).
If you wonder why, I'll tell you. It's because the law in France doesn't protect the private sector worker as much as the public servants and the VERY VERY big companies. If you are like most of the French, working for a small company, strike and your boss will find any way to replace you with someone more compliant. Often someone coming from an illegal immigrant background who won't complain because they *can't*. A laughable thing that no one dares to put their eyes on is that when one of those illegals manages to get their papers and get the rights of a citizen, they get replaced by another illegal, in jobs like hostel workers, restaurants and so on.

The common man can flourish in a free market or be taken advantage of in a free market. Hence the reason for a lack of free markets. Politicians see opportunities to stand by the common man and create regulatory laws on his behalf.
Some Jefferson quotes lend a historical perspective:

""It is our business to manufacture for ourselves whatever we can, to keep our markets open for what we can spare or want; and the less we have to do with the amities or enmities of Europe, the better."" --Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Leiper, 1815.  

""As long as we can build cheaper than other nations, we shall be employed in preference to others."" --Thomas Jefferson: Opinion on Granting Passports, 1793. ME 3:246 

""I have come to a resolution myself as I hope every good citizen will, never again to purchase any article of foreign manufacture which can be had of American make, be the difference of price what it may."" --Thomas Jefferson to B. S. Barton, 1815. 

Was Jefferson pro free trade?

""The system of the United States is to use neither prohibitions nor premiums. Commerce there regulates itself freely and asks nothing better. Where a government finds itself under the necessity of undertaking that regulation, it would seem that it should conduct it as an intelligent merchant would; that is to say, invite customers to purchase by facilitating their means of payment, and by adapting goods to their taste. If this idea be just, government here [in France] has two operations to attend to with respect to the commerce of the United States: 1, to do away, or to moderate, as much as possible the prohibitions and monopolies of their materials for payment; 2, to encourage the institution of the principal manufactures, which the necessities or the habits of their new customers call for."" --Thomas Jefferson to John Jay, 1788.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_delirium


Do NOT listen to the pot heads in this forum.  If you switch out Alcohol for Pot you can die from the withdrawals.

Secondly, lots of people on this forum (and other places) say that pot is NOT relaxing.  They say it'll make you freak out, can make you paranoid and increase social anxiety (not to mention delusions).  So it might not be the best if you are looking for a way to relax.

Third, pot can be extremely dangerous (regardless of what these guys say).  Almost ALL growers pump their plants full of fertilizers (specially nitro based ones).  [they do this to increase yield/potency].  This can [and almost always does] leave residue inside the plant (that doesn't come out by washing).  Smoking or heating (vaporizing) these chemicals can have very negative effects on your lungs and health.  

You are basically smoking Miracle Grow.  It doesn't take a genius to see what can go wrong with this.

Forth: Pot can and does have profound negative effects on basic cognitive functions (specially short term working memory, which effects fluid intelligence and most all other cognitive functions).  There has been tons of studies on this and there are also studies saying that Pot destroys tons more brain cells then Alcohol does.   All of these studies have been in the last 10 years and been peer-reviewed.  Tons of info on google if you are curious.  Most of the studies are from Europe.

OR, if you don't want to look those up, just ask any stoner ""What were we talking about?"" and obvious the results.  Highly impaired short term memory.

Five: Pot posses a ton of legal risks.  If you have enough pot to classify you as a ""dealer"" (which in some states isn't much at all) you could loose your house or car.  In some cases people have had their childern removed for getting asserted due to very small amounts of dope.  Also depending on the amount, you could be charged with a felony.  This sucks bad, you can't vote, will lose all scholarships and social welfare programs/support and can't own a firearm if you have a felony.  You have to disclose this to employers and schools (hint, most good jobs don't hire felons).  

Not to mention jail time.  You really want to be spending time in prison for what would amount to a ""case of beer""?

You can have your live ruined with just one small arrest.


Lastly, you have to deal with shady dealers.  You really want to get your face bashed in over a $20 deal?  You really want a slimy dealer touching you and expecting things while you are all stoned out?

Note:  I have learned to drive on manual transmissions;  actually spent half my (driving) life driving those,  I now drive automatics (crossed the pond sometimes along the way);  so I know the gospel,  heard it all before;  from first hand experience however,  driving similar kind of cars (I am a cheapskate,  I go for econoboxes,  not fancy stuff,  i.e.,  nothing above 2L displacement four bangers -- the kind of cars where auto transmissions are supposed to do their worst),  I didn't notice a 20% difference (and as a card carrying cheapskate,  I do pay attention to gas mileage);   I did however notice a greater difference in gas mileage between different styles of driving than I did between auto and manual  (I did mellow a bit with old age);  how much care I take in maintaining the thing properly has also a greater influence IMHO than the difference between auto and manual;  so I would guess that you would also notice a greater difference in gas mileage between two different drivers driving similar cars (not necessarily a difference in skills,  but in driving style) than again, between manual and auto.

EDIT:  if your argument is that driving manual transmissions is more fun,  there is no contest;  also it can (not anymore apparently) reduce the price tag a bit (in Europe,  automatic transmissions are mostly found on higher end cars,  so it is more often than not thought as an expensive luxury);  both are valid arguments.  Difference in gas mileage however is not as clear cut as it once was,  that's all that I am saying.",1425949497

In Sweden, [pastor Ake Green was sentenced (but eventually acquitted) to one month in prison](http://www.becketfund.org/index.php/case/93.html) for preaching that homosexuality was ""abnormal, a horrible cancerous tumor in the body of society.""  Now I don't agree with him, but I defend his right to say it. Other European countries protested the conviction.   You are effectively *hurting* a version Christianity to *protect* gays from verbal injury.  

How does one  justify stifling religious liberty (the right to oppose homosexuality) in order to prevent gays' feelings from being injured by some crazy pastor?   Would the law also be brought  against a Muslim preaching against gays?   

It is true that Green was eventually acquitted, but only after being dragged through the mud by a legal process that never should have had this tool at its disposal.

&gt; Also, you are separating muslims from the West, what makes you say that a muslim cannot also be a westerner?

No, I pointed out that ""Most of Europe's Muslims did have a thicker skin, and ignored these insults, just like **all other** good Western citizens.""   Did you have a hard time understanding this blindingly obvious sentence?

&gt; The west prides itself on the freedom and respect and equality for all, you cannot have that if you believe you have the right to single out someone based on their faith, that is not freedom of speech.

I'm not sure the West prides itself on 'respect'.   And 'equality' is a complicated concept, often at odds with freedom.  And 'freedom' and *mandatory* respect can conflict.

Given the choice between freedom and mandated respect, I'll take freedom.

Wrong, unless they last, at the very least, four times as long as a NPP, which would be about 200-300 years.  The installed capacity, AFIACS, is 750MW, which is larger than the installed capacity some of the smallest nuclear.  However, the utilization (how much MW do you actually produce at a given time) of NPP is roughly 90% (European number, but US should be in the ballpark), while the best utilization factors for PV I know of are 24%.  

That means NPP has much higher net energy production per year and MW than PV, and hence 750MW NPP installed capacity will produce almost 4 times the energy 750MW PV will.  Doesn't mean this project isn't impressive.

That is not such an accurate inference. There are still English speakers in England who speak in a manner that is incomprehensible to anyone outside their locale. Indeed, as long as you have a situation where people don't travel very far in their lives -- pretty much all of Europe before the 1850s -- incomprehensibility on the path from hill to hill is not abnormal.

This sums up my position.

Of course Israel wants peace. Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it ""peace"" on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect all reading this to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace. Without justice there will be no peace. Israels search for what they call a ""peace partner"" is the search for a compliant Palestinian admin.

Peace can be achieved with Justice, the UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now. The latest terror attack have led to the immediate arrests, the extremists do not have the support of the local community who have given them up.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problem is often claimed to be difficult but it isn't, it's obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements,

2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,

3.Create a viable Palestinian state,

4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.

5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.

6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel will not go along with these plans. They will always ask for concessions without giving enough for them. These concessions the Palestinian leadership simply cannot give without loosing the support of the majority of their population. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants Land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority. FATAH under Abbas does not yet quite fit this bil but it is looking more compliant as time passes, I noted that Israel armed FATAH against HAMAS in past months. They did this for a good reason

To end this ramble heres a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".",1425949618

1. An ethnocentric approach to the question 
2. An erroneous conclusion that etymological relationship indicates sociographical relationship

The rabbit, or in Europe the hare, are often associated with Easter. In America this relationship has taken overwhelming precedence in popular culture. In Christian practices and Christian churches in America, across all denominations, you will find very little (if at all) regarding an ""Easter bunny"" beyond something cute for the little kids. Outside America the rabbit/hare connection is only a tangential feature that has very little significance for any Christian practitioners. The claim centers around an extraordinarily narrow perspective. It fails to recognize that Easter is celebrated across the world, it fails to recognize the variety in traditions across the world (and assumes, a priori, that such traditions are pagan syncretism). It looks only at contemporary American/English practices and makes no attempt to engage in comparative or historical analysis.

Then you have the false etymological connection. The English word Easter is indeed etymologically related to the Old English Ostara. However, you falsely conclude a linear dependence. You ask what the word Easter comes from, but you don't ask what the word Ostara comes from. Let me ask you: if you and your cousin have the same last name, does it make any sense to conclude from that datum that one is the other's parent?

In short, the issue is not one of linear dependence but parallel dependence. Both ""Easter"" and ""Ostara"" originate from a root meaning to rise. Among other things this is related to ""east,"" the direction in which the sun rises; Ostrogoths, the eastern Gothic tribes; Austria, oder Oesterreich, the eastern kingdom, etc. What is particularly relevant here is that Easter is the celebration of the resurrection, when Christians believe Christ *rose* from the dead: hence the name.

But if that's not enough, there's the painfully obvious fact that Easter did not originate in the British Isles, nor in any other Germanic speaking land. Easter originated in the Middle East, and even a quick survey of early Christian literature will reveal a wealth of commentaries on the celebration from authors in Palestine, modern-day Turkey, and Syria as well as authors writing on the other side of the Mediterranean. For example:
Melito of Sardis, *[On the Passover](http://www.kerux.com/documents/KeruxV4N1A1.asp)* (2nd century), and see also the documentation surrounding the [Quartodeciman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartodecimanism) controvery, starting in the second century.

So how one can claim that Easter was a fusion of Celtic paganism with Christianity when the celebration originated centuries before Christianity arrived on the British Isles is beyond me.

Oh, let me add something about the eggs. Eggs feature prominently in Easter celebrations across the world. But it has nothing to do with fertility rites. The reason is that Easter is preceded by Lent, a time of fasting. While the Catholic Church has divested itself from such extensive fasting nowadays, in earlier days they were more rigorous. And such fasting is still practiced today in the Orthodox Churches. During the fasting periods, no meat, dairy, or eggs are consumed. Eating eggs celebrates the breaking of the fast, and it is natural enough to decorate them for what is the most important holiday in the Christian calendar.

And then there's other trivial little claims that fall apart just as easily under historical scrutiny.",1425949627

I was actually thinking about this on the way to work - it's a good counter argument, but there's a few reasons why it's not necessarily true. Let me explain:

1. Conditions/pay - I mentioned this in my first post. It's true that a person in the US isn't more technically able to sew an article of clothing than a person in Shanghai is, but when you're packed into a sweatshop and getting paid next to nothing vs. getting paid a decent wage in comfortable conditions that abide by US labor laws, I'd imagine one can focus more on the task at hand and produce a better quality garment.

2. Expertise. Let's use a new company this time - Vanson leathers. They produce motorcycle safety gear in the US and are based out of Boston. Vanson charges a pretty penny for their product vs. Alpinestars, an Italian company that produces their goods mostly in Eastern Europe and China. Now, It's not that the foreign workers can't be taught to assemble a leather jacket - they can. But, at the end of the day, they're essentially a general garment worker - I'm sure it makes no difference to them whether they're sewing leather jackets or shoes. Vanson employs motorcyclists - they know how to sew leather, they're passionate about their product and sport, and as a result their product is an heirloom quality good. Alpinestars are acceptable, but do not weather well, and tend to be irreperable after crashes. Chrome (from my previous example) is run by ex-bike messengers - their attention to detail in things like the seams around the waterproofing (the bags never leak) is impeccable, and very important to other messengers.

I guess my point is when culture/shared passion for a sport/activity/product pervades your entire company, it shows. If the people designing a product have these qualities, but then hand it off to some black-box manufacturing process in China, it shows as well. 

EDIT:
Also, it's not just the raw materials. Dainese is another Italian producer of motorcycle gear. Like Alpinestars, they produce their goods in Eastern Europe, but unlike Alpinestars they use high-quality materials like top-grade Italian leather. Their products border on Vanson in price, but still cannot match the build quality of Vanson leathers. 

Masi bike frames were once manufactured in Italy, now they are assembled in China. Build quality has plummeted. We're talking about the difference of a craftsman/woman vs. a laborer.


If you think that workers that have no attachment to the product theyre making other than a blueprint can produce a top-grade product, you're fooling yourself. ",1425949683

It seems you are one of the better educated, and more level-headed, libertarians on reddit (I don't know for sure that you are libertarian, but for the lack of a better word I think you will understand the label).

Thanks for the encouragement.  We are all human, and no matter what we learn or how much we advance, encouragement is always respected.

&gt;I've only just been getting into politics/government/economics for the past 6 months, but my intuition is strong when it comes to the power of free market capitalism.

If I can recommend anything, it is to *not* listen to central planners.  They are not interested in the human spirit, they are only concerned with squashing it.  They use other people's actions as an excuse for whatever dogma they want you to believe in, but every person's ideas and wants are a reflection of themselves.  If they want more control in society, what they really want is to have control over others, because they can't deal with people in a rational way, so they force it.  They want to control other people because their philosophy is based on collectivism, the most evil philosophy there is for mankind.  If you look at history, at all the evil dictators and declining civilizations, in every single case, with no exception, it was caused by institutions that are based on a collectivist philosophy.  Roman Empire, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and today in the US and Europe.  If you take the time to understand the philosophy that institutions are based on, you can then understand the destruction that is unleashed.

Never, and I mean NEVER, waver from wanting liberty and freedom.  This yearning and fight has been taking place for thousands of years, in many civilizations, and wherever that drive is lost, oppression and cruelty replace it.  

Many people, unfortunately, have this ameliorative philosophy, popularized by Karl Marx.  This philosophy is there is an (alleged) absolute, inescapable progressive social process, where no matter what form society takes from one generation to the next, it is considered progress and improvement.

If you consider this for a moment, you will be able to see how pernicious and influential that philosophy is among the majority of the public.

So they think that if we get rid of liberty, economic freedom, capitalism, etc, then it will be considered progress.  But what they don't understand is that freedom and liberty can only exist if people want it.  If nobody wants it, then it is not going to exist.  It is the responsibility we must assume because we have free will.  Our ideas are much more powerful than most people realize.  For the last couple hundred years this realization has quietly been lost, because of irrational philosophy, and that is why brute force has taken the place of reason.

The human race needs real intellectuals, and although I am not famous, I sure as hell know that the philosophy I have is the best that mankind has to offer.

&gt;However, I have had trouble articulating my position when discussions arise amongst friends and family. Thus, I am curious, what do you recommend as the best means to learn this material?

You have to start from the beginning.  Since none of us got the proper education in school, we have to teach ourselves.  It's a long process.  Be prepared to spend the next 5 to 10 years of serious self-study.  Remember, you are going to fix 16 years of brainwashing.  Some things cannot be done overnight.  We are a society now of quick fixes and quick solutions, but the steady mind is never shaken.

So, start with philosophy.  You have to start with philosophy because it is the bedrock upon which every other field of knowledge is based.  If you don't have a philosophy, you are like an airplane pilot with no radar and no windshield.  Sure you know if you are airborne or if you hit the ground, but you will never know why.

Some good philosophers are Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, David Hume, Wilhelm Von Humboldt, Herbert Spencer, Ayn Rand, Lisander Spooner.  In addition to reading what they had to say themselves, read what they said about their predecessors.  That is the best way to learn in depth the various ideas.

After, or during if you get bored of just philosophy, start reading the laissez faire economists.  The reason I recommend reading them first is because that is where the real economic *principles* are found.  In socialist economist writing, there is more of what they *want* to be true, rather than what *is* true.  For economists, I recommend starting at the beginning, with the French Physiocrats, like Quesnay, and Turgot.  There is not much surviving material, but you will be amazed at what 17th century level thinking produced.  These intellectuals are the world's first economists.  After that, read the British Classicals.  Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, John Stuart Mill (James' son, and better IMHO), John McCulloch, John Baptist-Say, Fredrick Bastiat, Charles Holt Carroll (he wrote a wicked series of essays in the mid 19th century showing how fractional reserve banking causes the business cycle).

After that, read the Austrians Carl Menger, Von Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, and George Reisman.  My favorite is Reisman.  His 1000 page book Capitalism is in my opinion the best economics book ever written, and I have read a lot.  If you master this book, you'll become untouchable.

After all this, you have to read history.  And I mean a lot of history.  The best part is that your interest in economics matches the need to know history.  Economists, surprisingly, always write the best history books.  If you read all the history books from Rothbard, such as his awesome books ""History of Economic Thought"", ""Conceived in Liberty"", and ""History of Money and Banking"".  Also read his writer idols, H. L. Mencken and S.J. Perelman.

Of course, if you want to sharpen your skills, you have to read not only the good people, but the bad.  After you have read all the good, go through all the books of the enemies of capitalism and liberty.  Read Karl Marx, Keynes, Galbraith, Stiglitz, Samuelson, Nordhaus, and Krugman.  Their miasmas of cerebral diarrhea are much easier on a mind that is prepared to withstand the contradictions, misinterpretations, and outright fallacies.

In terms of websites, the Mises Institute is the best for the amount of information and free books (many of which are in my list here).  Lew Rockwell is awesome too, although it is less academic.  Campaign for liberty is great as you say, it has lots of knowledge.

Well, that about does it.  That should keep you busy for the next few years.  ",1425949755

""The Council on Foreign Relations is 'the establishment'.

S. from a sovereign Constitutional Republic into a servile member state of a one-world dictatorship."" -- Congressman John Rarick

""Today the path of total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people.

-- Brock Chisolm, former Director of the World Health Organization

""The one aim of these financiers is world control by the creation of inextinguishable debts."" -- Henry Ford

""The real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self created screen. At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers.

""I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move on Washington; they would not wait for an election. It adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States."" -- George W. Malone, U.S. Senator (Nevada), speaking before Congress in 1957.

Already, the major unions across Europe with any say in politics are agitating against raising the retirement age. And guess what? The vast majority of union members are ""the old guard"". Younger folks are opting for more freelance work, fast-switching employers and see no value in membership of a union that has nothing in store for them, just the old traditional, one-way, 70's mentality of protest.

Not knowing what causes red shift does not make red shift go away.  That has nothing to do with dark energy which is an explanation for the motion that is inferred from the redshift.

Just curious, what is your understanding of how expanding space time moves a galaxy?  I mean, if space expanding moves a galaxy why doesn't a galaxy moving expand space?  If I pull on the edges of a balloon the air inside expands right?  

&gt;How do you expect to be able to put that to use in a machine on Earth? How else do you even propose to measure it, or the lack of it, other than through redshift?

I was using a machine based on the idea as an example of evidence for the the idea's truth.  There's no evidence that dark energy, whatever it's supposed to be, is real.

In the comment section of the article, there is one comment thread named ""Frankly.""  I was reading through that comment thread when I ran across this very insightful post. 
&gt;I think your year in Dubai must have been at least five years ago… before the property boom and influx of expats actually peaked.

&gt;I have lived here for going on five years and I can tell you quite honestly that most of the 'facts' written in this feature are entirely true, if not simply based on what is commonly known, but not discussed, in this concrete desert.

&gt;I am gay and since arriving here I have been privy to many a sweaty night out surrounded by Arab, European &amp; American gays. Muslim culture dictates UAE national men and women are forbidden to date prior to marriage. Therefore, there's thousands of young Emirati &amp; Arabic guys looking for some! I have never found easier in my life to pick up men as I found in my time here! A simple walk through a mall can mean anything up to 3 or 4 khandoora clad Emirati boys slipping mobile numbers into my hand, not to mention the ubiquitous 'are you married?' conversation with horny taxi drivers looking for a quick fix before the end of their shift. (however, I do avoid the latter)… Dubai is also such a superficial city that everyone who lives here &amp; is lucky enough to have a comfortable life (by this I mean the ones who aren’t slaves) are so self obsessed with their own appearance that it is often hard to distinguish who is gay and who is straight. 

&gt;Regarding the ‘facts’, yes there are thousands of ‘slaves’ here. Labourers, maids, office workers, waiters, sanitation workers, taxi drivers; all here getting paid a pittance for long hours, no breaks and the promise of a ‘better life’. These people might be working in less taxing professions but once here they find themselves living in a country that caters only to the super rich. Everything is overpriced and accommodation costs have risen to ridiculous levels. I think the better off in Dubai know full well how corrupt it is here but they just get on with their lives because going home to work in grey, wet &amp; cold cities, whilst paying tax, is actually worth the guilt.

&gt;With regards to other aspects left out of this article, this country is so hypocritical with its laws it borders on the laughable: Unmarried couples/friends being forbidden to share accommodation yet you would have to be on $10,000 per month to afford a 1 bedroom apartment. Women being asked to cover themselves out of respect for 'Muslim culture' yet tourist are shipped into 'Arabian Night’ events with belly dancers flashing their semi-naked torsos at the audience. Debt being forbidden yet every single bank offering loans and credit cards whether you bank with them or not. An 'Open doors' policy yet anything Christian or Buddhist being banned from the media. Alcohol licences being required by ex-pats in order to purchase alcohol yet you can freely drive 35minutes in order to buy it ‘illegally’ from Um Al Quwain where one is served by, or standing in a queue behind a line, of UAE nationals. 

&gt;The author also didn’t touch on the fact that many UAE nationals find themselves so completely above the law that hundreds of people die on the roads each year due to their lack of experience or respect for other drivers... and that they can get off with as little as a slap on the wrist or a fine for wiping out an entire family of five. In my time here, every single fatal accident I have read about or seen has involved a white 4x4 - the car of choice for young Emirati men. 

&gt;Frankly, Dubai is not a beacon of the modern Muslim world. It is a melting pot of money, parties, socialising, arrogance, greed, racism and hypocrisy... I’m not condoning this at all. It is simply a fact of life here. The treatment of the lower classes is downright disgusting but it DOES happen… people ARE leaving in floods because of bad debt… the picture painted of Dubai is NOT what it seems and the country we all came to IS, quite frankly, falling apart. It is ALL TRUE!

&gt;However, I will remain here as long as I keep getting paid a tax free salary, as long as I can afford my rent, as long as my Arabic boyfriend can get it up and as long as those hot Emirati guys keep slipping me their numbers...",1425949891

While it's popular to blame the Catholics for all sorts of crimes, the truth is that despite their superstitions they were the only entity in Europe that  had any respect for books and knowledge at all.

There's a reason why all the really old universities were originally run by the priests - or were even seminaries. In a world where ""the best and the brightest"" were expected to fritter away their lives in petty little battles, the cloistered monks were the only ones that even remembered that the world had once been different.

Hell, at the very beginning of the scientific age, it was the priests who were so keen on the idea of sharing knowledge with each other and other educated people - creating the most fundamental principle of the scientific method, which is that if you don't publish, it doesn't count. (If you don't believe me - check out the various *Connections* shows by James Burke and the BBC - he repeatedly made reference to how a few priests acted at a scientific clearinghouse during the renaissance, passing information back and forth between various ""natural philosophers"" who were working out the principles of things like air pressure and the beginnings of chemistry....)

Think about that for a second - history is full of geniuses who were centuries or millennia ahead of their time - but because those geniuses jealously guarded their knowledge, it died with them - which is why we don't really know how the sword smiths of Damascus made their amazing swords, or the chemical composition of greek fire or whether Archimedes really was capable of making a mechanical calculator for predicting eclipses.

You can blame the Catholics for being a bunch of superstitious reactionaries who held back the Enlightenment when it came - but without them, the Enlightenment probably would never have happened. Sure, they inadvertently destroyed valuable texts - but if the monasteries didn't exist, those texts would never have been preserved in the first place.",1425950015

The ""what ifs"" are much more fundamental than that.  Companies like Xerox weren't in the business of making personal computers.  To them, even the concept of a personal computer was a radical idea.  

HP could have had the first personal computer (Woz was an HP employee when he developed the Apple I), Xerox could have had many, many things.  But it didn't happen because these huge corporations of the 70s never believed the personal computer would amount to anything.  Their business was mainframes, and they were only interested in protecting their mainframe business.

Consequently, the Xerox Star was a $100,000 system designed only for the largest multinational corporations and the 5 richest kings of Europe.  Smarter people wanted to design computers for you and me.  

For example, take professor Jef Raskin, who was an early human-computer interface researcher from the 60s.  Many of his students went on to work at PARC, and he would lecture at PARC regularly throughout the 70s.  

Raskin could have left academia at any time to go work for Xerox, but he didn't.  Instead, he gravitated towards the nascent PC scene of the mid-70s; he was the one who convinced Steve Jobs to check out the work they were doing at PARC.  Raskin went on to join Apple in 1978 to begin development of the Mac, and many of his students from PARC followed him to Apple or joined other PC companies, or started their own PC companies.  For all the smart people who worked for Xerox at PARC, smarter people worked on developing the ""personal computer"" as we know it today, and the smarter people won.

Let me start off by saying that you can't quote Ilan Pappe one paragraph after you dismiss the article I referenced because the American Media has always been partial to Israel.  Ilan Pappe is an historian whose work has been discredited in his own department.  He views history as a set of ""narratives"" from which you can pick and choose, because they're all ""true"" in their own way.  He chose one to match his ideology.  There have been a number of students in his department who made similar claims in their theses, only to have claim later that they made some things up.  Saying that Israel had a master plan to cleanse Palestine of Arabs based on what Ilan Pappe says is like saying that Barack Obama is a communist Muslim anti-American who plans to destroy the US based on what Rush Limbaugh says.  It's like saying that God created life through Intelligent Design because there are some ""biologists"" who say so.  It's like saying that God created the earth in six days a bit less than 6000 years ago because there are some young earth ""geologists"" that say so.

Note that I'm not saying this to discredit *your* views (although I *do* disagree with them).  I'm saying this to discredit your *argument*.  If you have any other references other than Ilan Pappe and his students I'll be happy to discuss them.

So what are we left with?

* ""Who started"" the wars in 1956, 1967 and 1982.
* A solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees.


So, you have a point that the Sinai war in 1956 wasn't started by Israel.  I claim that the British and the French had impure motives here, and that there were impure parts in Israel's motives too.  However, Israel had a pure motive here too, which was to stop the attacks coming from Sinai and Gaza, which was still part of Egypt.

Israel started hostilities in 1967 after a 3 week period of waiting (the hamtana) in which tensions were rising and it was clear all over that there *was* going to be a war.  Israel chose to strike preemptively in a defensive move in a war that was itching to start.  I don't see how Egypt thought it would avoid hostilities by closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships.

Regarding 1982, if you ask that I take into account the context of the Palestinian situation, then I have to ask you to take into account the context of the Holocaust and 2000 years of persecution when you discuss the establishment of the state of Israel.  In my view the context of Jewish history trumps the plight of the Palestinians.  That doesn't mean I think they should be mistreated or their problems ignored, nor do I think it gives Israel the right to act immorally.  It does mean that Israel has as much right to defend itself against enemies in *any* context as any other state or entity.

Regarding the second point, of solving the Palestinian refugee problem, you say that comparing the Mizrahim to the Palestinians in this context is wrong, because the Mizrahim are no longer stateless refugees.  I claim that that's *exactly* why they should be compared.  The Mizrahim and the Palestinians started out the same.  The Mizrahim were refugees in refugee camps in Israel, while the Palestinians were refugees in the neighboring Arab countries.  Moreover, the Mizrahim didn't have UNWRA to help them out.  Israel took responsibility for the refugees in its territory and integrated them into the state.  The host countries of the Palestinian refugees didn't.  That's why the Palestinians are still refugees, and the Mizrahim aren't.  That's why the Jordanian option is the correct solution (along with the Lebanese option for the Palestinians in Lebanon, and the Egyptian option for the refugees in the Gaza strip (by which I imply returning Gaza to the Egyptians), and the Syrian option for refugees in Syria).  

I challenge you to find a major refugee situation in which the refugees returned home.  Think of the Jewish refugees in post-WWII Europe, of German refugees from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, of refugees from the war in Rwanda or any other conflict in Africa, of Vietnamese boat people.  Oh, you may find some exceptions to the rule, but in general refugees find a new life elsewhere.  That may be ""immoral"", and it most certainly is unpleasant, but that's the best solution all around.

I don't justify ethnic cleansing of any sort.  However, I don't think what went on here in 1948 was ethnic cleansing.

Let me add one more thing.  If you support the right of a people to return to their homeland, then you must support the return of the Jews to Palestine.  If you don't support that right for the Jews, you can't logically support it for the Palestinians.",1425950111

Let me put it to you this way:

Even if you ignore the animals' welfare and the fact that the slaughter process used for horses in the US was designed for cattle, which are extremely different physically and behaviorally, meaning it's often very cruel... even if nothing about the suffering of the horses themselves persuades you, it's downright unethical to pass horsemeat off as suitable for human consumption when it comes from the US.

I have a horse. If I go on any given day and look in my tack box, I'll find various creams, medicines, ointments, grooming sprays, etc, with the following warning: ""Not for use in animals intended for human consumption."" These range from the just-not-studied-in-humans to known carcinogens that are stored in muscle tissue for *years* after being administered to an animal. It's illegal to give most of these things to cattle, but there is no tracking or testing process to determine if these known toxins and carcinogens are present in horsemeat exported for human consumption.

The EU has a strict ""passport"" system that does a pretty good job of tracking animals and determining whether or not they are suitable for human consumption, but they don't apply the same strict standards to imported meat. In other words, there's a giant loophole that allows the shipping and sale of toxic, carcinogenic horsemeat.

Personally, I'd like to say anyone who'd eat a horse deserves what they get, since they're among my favorite animals. But I just can't really justify in any way feeding known carcinogens to children in other parts of the world so a meat producer can make a buck.

Hmm, I checked your link and this is what Obama said

“I will maintain the embargo,” [Obama] declared on the campaign trail last year in front of the ultra-right-wing Cuban American National Foundation. “It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: if you take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to begin normalizing relations. That’s the way to bring about real change in Cuba -- through strong, smart and principled diplomacy.”

You could imagine relaxing sanctions a bit in response to each of the following

1) Releasing political prisoners (status defined by some third party like Amnesty International)
2) Allowing opposition parties to register.
3) Holding an election which neutral observers certify free and fair.

I have been looking for a job for five months, applied for close to 60 positions, and yesterday I finally got a positive reply. I wanted a job that was vaguely related to my field of study, so I have been kind of foolishly picky.

However I applied for jobs I never would have considered a year ago, but I also read about jobs that seemed very interesting once I started to learn more about them.

I know it's a very painful situation, but you have to confront the pain. You have to ignore all negative feelings about yourself and the future. It's also very cathartic. I had to look into myself and ask myself what I wanted in life. To be honest I have been very disillusioned on and off.

This may sound obvious, but your lack of motivation is not going to disappear unless you start to do something. In the worst case, you'll get into a bad depression if this goes on.

I don't know why you lack motivation, but I think I have some kind of understanding of what you are going through. I know I never want to experience these last few months again.

Don't be scared of possible rejections. Don't be scared to look into new fields or new careers. You can't take the negative feelings personally, it's not your fault. This crisis is a giant screw-up by our society, but you have to take responsibility for own your life and your actions. Please don't give up.

Some general tips:

* Don't sit at home looking for jobs. Looking for jobs is your new job. Separate your new job from your personal life/leisure time. Bring your laptop to a coffee shop and work for some hours. Don't worry about jobs when you're at home.

* Make a template CV/resumé and cover letter. Make small changes depending on which position you are applying for, but don't put to much effort into individual applications. The rejection will feel much harder if you get all fired up about a potential job.

* Make direct calls to follow up in the application process. I can't stress this enough. Show interest.",1425950165

Seriously, by that logic if I lived in Europe in the 1400's I would have to believe cats were responsible for plague because I wouldn't know about pathogens.

Where the hell did all this come from? I'm also not seeing any alternative explanation for redshift. 

Just to indulge this rampant derail, though: 

1. Eternal cycle of Big Bang/Big Crunch/Big Bang. 

2. Multiverses. 

3. The beginning of time was also the beginning of causality (the two being inherently linked), negating a need for a ""first cause."" 

Use some imagination. 

&gt;Not knowing what causes red shift does not make red shift go away. That has nothing to do with dark energy which is an explanation for the motion that is inferred from the redshift.

We (well, some of us) *do* know what causes redshift though. It's the same principle as the Doppler effect, caused by receding objects emitting sound waves. You *can* measure it in a lab. It's been firmly established for the best part of a century at the very least. We also happen to see it consistently in galaxies across the Universe. 

These galaxies *are* receding. There is no other explanation. Light may be able to be redshifted in a lab with some specialised equipment (not that I've ever heard of it), but when coming from galaxies it has been travelling through vacuum. This is not an ""interpretation"" any more than anything else in science. 

&gt;Just curious, what is your understanding of how expanding space time moves a galaxy?

It doesn't, as such. Spacetime everywhere expands consistently. The gravity of galaxies, however, is sufficient to overcome this expansion, so they remain the same size while the spacetime around them expands. This creates the appearance of everything else receding. 

Why would a galaxy moving cause spacetime to expand? It doesn't even make sense. 

&gt;There's no evidence that dark energy, whatever it's supposed to be, is real.

There is though. We use redshift to measure something called the Hubble constant, which is used to determine the rate at which the Universe expands. This expansion was originally thought to have simply steadily kept going after the Big Bang. Then someone had the idea of comparing the gravity of the mass of the entire Universe against this original expansive force. 

There were 3 possible outcomes from this. The gravitational force could have been strong enough to overcome the expansion, pulling the Universe back in on itself in a Big Cruch. The gravitational and expansion forces could have exactly balanced out, leading to a Universe expanding at an ever-slower rate for ever, leading to heat-death. Or the gravitational force could have been less, leading to a more rapid expansion for ever, possibly leading to a ""Big Rip."" 

Then, not all that long ago actually, someone else measured the rate of expansion (by redshift) in comparison to the gravitational force. It was expected that the gravitational force and original expansion force would more or less balance each other out. But they didn't. They measured that the expansion was in fact accelerating rather than being gently reined in by gravity, meaning that some other force that they hadn't previously accounted for was acting on it.

Since they couldn't tell what type of energy was behind this observed expansive force, they simply gave it a catchy name and published their observations. ",1425950169

Take a look at real estate sq footage, prices, and look at pics of what most of them live in. You Americans take for granted what you do have here. It's not as great as you think in Europe.

The relative abundance of resources (yes, even oil) also explains why a progressive energy policy continues to face an uphill battle.

The technique which was used to incite the riots was the exact same as with the European antisemitism of the same period: spreading false rumors about jewish atrocities.  And al-Husseini is the same man who made a fortune from selling land to jews, relentlessly executing the small competitors in the land sales to drive the prices higher.

Better yet, as Khalidi and countless other scholars say, the campaign of incitement against jews was launched by the arab countries because they wanted the region called Palestine for themselves. Ottomans were beaten, British were about to leave, and the delicious fertile lands and trade routes were up for grabbing, but jews were a problem that had to be dealt with first. ",1425950258

The rest of the planet was not, in fact, sitting around with its thumb up its ass waiting for the glorious Europeans, the only people who have anything to do with science, to recover and shower the world with the blessings of understanding yet again.

During that period algebra was refined and named, by a Muslim scholar.   Pretty much all the surviving Greek philosophy and writings we have today were preserved, translated, and widely spread, by Muslim scholars.

In China and the middle east astronomy continued to advance steadily.

In India what we miscall ""Arabic"" numerals were invented, and positional notation (likely strongly influenced by traditional Chinese notation) was introduced.

The religious insistence upon a continual, unchanging order held China back from ever competing against Europe.

**Me:**

Hello Professor Chomsky, I'm a big fan of your work.  I was wondering if you can answer my question with regard to the current situation in Israel and Palestine.  Do you believe that Israel returning to its 1967 borders is feasible and would it be enough?  Thank you.

**Noam Chomsky**:

It would be feasible.  It came very close in January 2001, at the Taba negotiations in Egypt, the one time in over 30 years that the US executive tolerated a diplomatic settlement.  Unfortunately, the negotiations were called off prematurely by Israeli Prime Minister Barak.  Much has happened since, but not enough to make the outcome impossible, if the US will drop its rejectionist stance.

Is it enough?  Nothing is enough.  My own view, all my life, is that a better solution is a binational state, but a two-state settlement is the only means by which that outcome could be reached.  There is talk about ""one state,"" but it is pie in the sky.  It cannot be reached under current circumstances except in stages.

A still better outcome would be a no-state settlement, as a later stage.  That is not at all unrealistic.  Basically, it would be like the Ottoman system, without the brutality and corruption.  Much more rational than the nation-state system, a European invention imposed by violence in Europe and beyond.

I've written about these matters, if you are interested.

This is wrong, and wrong on a number of points.

a) Scientific advancement in the Roman empire was nowhere near as fast as it had been / would be under several other groups (earlier Greeks, later Muslims, etc); Romans as a culture had less interest in abstract learning. The great and important contributions of the Romans to later civilizations were largely organizational (increasingly effective concepts of how to organize workforces, armies, etc; as well as maintain these large groups at long distances and over long periods of time) and sociological / legal (Roman Law is one of the most important developments in Western history, and its basic structure and assumptions continue to shape legal systems to this day).
They also developed some engineering concepts (chiefly the so-called ""Roman Arch"") that they really put to use.

b) The Romans DID kill scientists, philosophers, nice folks, etc.; as has every other civilization on Earth. Every time the situation in Rome got to choatic, all of the Greek-philosphy-teaching intellectuals would get banished for a while, since they tended to stir up controversy and dissent. Citing other examples, the Romans murdered Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse (for which the soldier in question was executed by his commander, who knew better than to waste the inventor of combat engineering) and they crucified Jesus of Nazareth to calm political squabbling, who wasn't a scientist but could probably be called ""fairly important"" in the historical development of ethics and philosophy.

c) The Romans were the first to seriously damage and sack the Library of Alexandria, which they did more than once, especially under the Emperor Aurelian. Not that all of them were happy with this, any more than every Catholic endorsed being angry at Galileo; but saying ""Romans didn't do that sort of thing [put people to death, slow science, behave like those nasty folks in the 'dark ages']"" is simply incorrect.

""Gregor Mendel, a scientist, would have been killed had he been around three hundred years earlier, for suggesting that God didn't come down and craft each new living thing.""

Support this in some manner than claiming it is self-evident, please.

""Everyone else, do not defend the institution that put to death several fathers of modern astronomy/physics/science.""

Well, no, the 'institution' didn't do anything, people did things as part of the institution, but that's mostly irrelevent. The institution did (and still does) things which are morally reprehensible, composed as it is of people. The institution did (and still does) a number of things which are also very laudable and important. Of particular interest to this conversation would be the establishment of Universities and schools, beginning (depending on how one defines ""university"") with either the Moslem Madrassas founded in the 9th centuries, which would do most of the heavy lifting during the ""dark ages"" - which were only dark for white folks in Eurasia, I hasten to add, since the Madrassas' folks were busy inventing algebra, advancing medicine, formalizing chemistry, building flamethrowers, etc. Following that, the European Unversities (Bologna, Paris, Oxford, etc) began to emerge, generally as Church-sanctioned and supported outgrowths of the monastic and abbey schools and cathedral schools, many of which traced their lineage and establishment to the educational reformation under Charlegmagne, which was led (and influenced) by Charlegmagne's tutor, the abbot Alcuin.

Also, the graph seems a little over-liberal in the time period of the dark ages, which are generally restricted to 500 - 1000 AD, or even 500-800 AD. Of course, the whole concept of the Church dominated, superstition-plagued, demon-haunted Dungeons &amp; Dragons era of European history is effectively nonexistant in modern scholarship, given that it is (at best) a caricature based on ignorance of history, and propogated by earlier period historians who were so blinded by how totally rad Rome was - and so disinterested, or ignorant, about the world outside Europe - that the whole period until the Marco Polo or so seemed dark. Not that they are bad people for having thought so, but we really ought to move beyond the incomplete understandings of yesteryear.

This is outside my area of specialty (I focused on Meiji era Japan), but you can't study history without learning quite a bit of European history no matter what you specialize in.

The ""Dark Ages"" began with the collapse of the Roman empire and the long civil wars following that collapse.  Yes, the RCC was a bad influence in many ways, but it was hardly solely responsible for the whole thing.

Further, despite the fact that the Church did restrict thought, its monasteries produced several advances, and the Church sponsored others.  Clockwork, one of the foundations of machining, was largely developed with Church funds for the purpose of accurately counting time for prayers.  Obviously we found better uses for it later, but the fact remains that it was funded and developed by the Church for Church purposes.

The Muslim world had its own problems with surpressing rational thought.  Most of the history of Islamic science is cyclic: in the areas further from Mecca things would get liberal, science would blossom, and then the fundies would come in and burn the devil books, repeat twenty or thirty times.

Likewise, Asia had its share of intellectual repression.  China, especially, was an extremely culturally repressive place with high value placed on tradition at the expense of innovation, and often with innovation being deliberately repressed.  Worse, to say that China actively discouraged international trade and relations is an incredible understatement.  Many of the advances that were made in China never got out to the rest of the world until they were basically re-developed elsewhere, and (worse) Chinese scholars often had no access to outside materials.  Arabic numerals, for example, didn't get to China until quite recently, and Chinese mathematicians were thus forced to limp along with a positional notation that didn't really work very well and use of Chinese characters for writing all numbers [1].

So, yeah, the Church was repressive, but most other cultures had equally (or even worse) repressive aspects.

The Medieval period sucked mainly because it was the aftermath of a civil war that engulfed basically the entire continent for a few hundred years.  As far as book burners go, its hard to beat hordes of Germanic and Gaulish barbarians who thought that learning was for girly men and that the only thing books were good for was kindling.

Matthew, 

you are wrong, and, interestingly, you yourself proved yourself wrong. You said not only the American government, but many others, including the European ones, are responsible for this mess. I agree.

Should the left-wing government in Country A replaced by a right-wing one, and should the right-wing one in Country B replaced by a left-wing one? Is it really what you say? Do you really mean it would help? No, you cannot mean that, you are smarter than that.

Matthew, there are only two possible conclusions of this mess.

A) No government is responsible. Which we both agree is false.

B) It doesn't matter whether it's a centre-left or centre-right government, they have committed the same errors.

The key factor was the abrogation of the treaty with the Soviets. The Japanese thought they could negotiate a better deal, which is why they wouldn't surrender. In a non-atomic age, they knew that a protracted land war with guerilla resistance would not be in the allies' best interests particularly with Europe more or less destroyed. The problem for the Japanese was that the Soviets revoked a non-agression treaty. Whilst the Chinese weren't a serious threat, they knew that they couldn't fight the Russians, Allies and Chinese all at the same time, even without the bomb.

Also, if the Allies were to land on Japan (as planned in Operation Downfall), they would have to reconsider their proposed terms because the Japanese also didn't want a protracted land war against multiple sides. To put this into perspective, a Japanese invasion by the US would've probably resulted in immediate surrender so long as the Emperor maintained rule to avoid coming under Soviet dominion or the country being broken up like Germany. A Soviet invasion would result in an immediate unconditional offer of surrender in exchange for help from the Allied forces because of the worry that the Soviets and Chinese would try to make a land grab. The threat of a Soviet invasion was too great. There was also probably just cause to worry about the execution of the Japanese aristocracy if the Russians invaded and this should also be considered.",1425950366

So I know there are many people in the world who believe everyone else's god is also their god. 

Early Christianity, which is commonly now referred to as [Gnostic]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic_Gospels) Christianity, was more in line with these concepts. Their collections of gospels, which where rejected in the 3rd and 4th century by the emerging catholic church, are different in some key, and powerful, ways. They included the trinity, but give them different aspects. These are alternately;  the father the sun and the mother, or, the male, the female, and the neuter, Or, the mother, the father, and the snake. Alternatively, Celtic and other northern European traditions had; the maiden, the mother, and the crone, for a trinity within a verity of mythologies.  There is a reflection of this in many pagan mythologies, there are the three fates, the spinners, and the furies are also a three. Many religions believe in a multiplicity of gods, there are many interpretations of divinity. 

I believe in the divine as expressed in nature, the purity and power of the elements and cycles of the earth to teach, I  meditatively acknowledge the divine in the world, calling to universal love. God, for many, is a far broader concept than the ""church fathers"" teach. ",1425950396

stupid and reckless.  You guys will at least understand about online relationships though, unlike anybody I could 

discuss it with in the real world. 

I am a late 30s married man. My wife has been out of the country on business for a long time. We have a just-

satisfactory marriage in that she is trustworthy and fulfils her side of the deal, but we have little in common and 

now a vitually non-existent sex-life.  It is possible that we will split up in future as we are having trouble 

having children, and this is very important for her. It is one of the main reasons for her to be married. I 

generally have succeeded in adjusting to married life and think I make a good husband in practical ways.
 
For the past several weeks I have been conducting an online affair with with an 18-year old woman in another 

country. It began reasonably innocently. I answered some personal ads looking for instant-message buddies, to pass 

the time in my wife's absence. The woman lives in an area where she has nobody around her who shares her interests, 

and as it turns out we fit each-other very well. I noticed there was something quite special about her before I saw 

her photos, and was almost alarmed to find that she is physically very attractive to me. I sent her some of my 

photos, ready for her to lose interest, as this has happened in the past, but she didn't.

Our relationship has developed through instant messaging, to flirty chat, to Skype calls, to very long Skype calls, 

occupying nearly every opportunity we have. We even Skype in bed, and listen to one another sleeping. There is a 

significant time-difference between our countries so often one or other of us is awake surfing the net, and 

listening while the other sleeps. It has been very sweet and intense. We have fallen in love.

At her suggestion we turned to mutual masturbation while on Skype. This has now become a pretty regular event.  I 

am quite sexually experienced, but crazy as it sounds, these have been some of the greatest sexual experiences of 

my life, at least since I was around her age.  She says these have been the best she has experienced, and it 

certainly sounds like it.

The reason this set of circumstances is bothering me so much is twofold. Firstly, our relationship is completely 

unviable. She is much too young for me. I question the moral correctness of the effect I am having on her. She is 

fairly sexually precocious but she has no experience of long-term relationships and the emotional and practical 

complexities that they have.  She spoke of marriage, and the idea did not sound so outrageous to me in terms of 

what I want. However I really fear the backlash of setting up in a relationship with somebody so young and so much 

younger than I. This difference is big enough to bring accusations of...well.. cradle-snatching is the kinder word. In my defense, I have been pretty careful not to steer the relationship this way, but equally I have not avoided it as perhaps I should have.Even though she has been an adult from the beginning of this, I think such a relationship if known about would affect my professional reputation.  I also know that she has a life to lead, and it would not be fair for her to miss so much of her early adulthood as she would if she were with me, not to mention that I will become elderly while she is still in her prime. And, of course, I am married.  

We have of course discussed meeting but it is hard to arrange practically, and she is uncomfortable about her body image (she thinks she is fat, but I don't). We have loosely discussed meeting in a few years time, but I do not share her inexperienced idealism that things will not change dramatically for her in the next half-decade or so. Teenage women's feelings change like the weather.

The second reason this is bothering me, iS that I am experiencing intrusions of an old enemy - jealousy. Of course 

she goes to parties, and does teenage things. I have said she should fuck whoever she wants but just not to tell me 

about it, because I won't like it.  Despite her proclaimed love for me, she is hoping to meet somebody more 

suitable than I, and that is the right thing for her to hope.  

She is also quite active in various internet forums, and sent me a link to a discussion she was having recently. In 

clicking around I saw that she exchanged IM usernames with another forum-member recently, and on googling his 

username I found he is a mid-20's, quite good looking guy who lives in her area. I think they have been IMing 

today and unusually she has not been around on Skype for a few hours. For literally the first time in weeks she is not visble to me in any of the IM networks we use. Knowing what I do about jealousy, I really 

don't want to make the mistake of further googling/stalker type internetting. I also do not want to mention my 

fears to her as this is very unattractive.

Anyway, the whole stupid mess has me feeling so up and down. I feel disorientated and uncomfortably stressed. I 

feel unable to cope. To add another layer of doom, my wife is returning to this country shortly, and I will not be 

able to continue the Skype aspects of this affair once she is here, at least for a few weeks. My internet lover knows about this, but not the precise date.

&gt;The most powerful people on the Internet don't work for Microsoft, Google or the government. Rather, they're a bunch of antisocial, foul-mouthed, clever nerds who congregate at a largely unknown Web site called 4chan.org.

&gt;Ever get your MySpace page hacked into? Chances are it was 4chan's fault.

&gt;Surfing YouTube and suddenly find yourself watching an old Rick Astley music video? You were ""rickrolled"" by 4chan.

&gt;Enjoy reading Sarah Palin's personal e-mail? She's got 4chan to thank for that.

&gt;Hear someone shout out the ending of the latest Harry Potter book while you're in line at Barnes and Noble? 4chan strikes again.

&gt;4chan.org is the self-proclaimed Internet home for people who lack a social conscience, a Web site that's become a surreptitious cultural powerhouse.

&gt;It's responsible for launching several successful Web-based trends, from the wildly popular ""lolcat"" phenomenon to the surprise comeback of '80s one-hit wonder Rick Astley.

&gt;But what the heck IS 4chan?

&gt;Welcome to a new world, filled with terminology and conventions that the average person — or even the average nerd — may not know about.

&gt;4chan is a no-frills discussion Web site that features dozens of message boards and ""image boards"" within six broad categories, stemming from Japanese animation to travel, and given semi-random names ranging from ""/a/""' to ""/trv/.""

&gt;That sounds harmless enough, except that within 4chan lurks the ""/b/"" board, dedicated to ""random"" images and topics, and its 5.3 million users, known as the ""/b/tards.""

&gt;The /b/ board, or just /b/ to its loyal visitors, is by far the site's most popular. Users fill the board with vile material, from pornographic images to incredibly racist and misogynistic comments.

&gt;It thrives on competition and users write ""moar"" to challenge each other to post further loathsome material throughout the day and long into the night.

&gt;What makes 4chan unique among message boards is its reliance on anonymity, a vast difference from most sites, which make users sign up with at least a verifiable e-mail address.

&gt;On 4chan, one can post anonymously using a nickname or a ""tripcode,"" a system that uses an algorithm to give users unique coded nicknames.

&gt;Anonymously, /b/tards create alliances to plan their next big exploits.

&gt;In 2008, they bombarded MTV with votes to clinch Rick Astley the fan-picked ""Best Act Ever"" award at the MTV Europe Music Awards — which helped Astley get a slot performing in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

&gt;Recurring jokes on 4chan sometimes spread out into the wider Web to become Internet ""memes,"" a pseudo-sociological term for jokey phenomena passed from person to person.

&gt;Remember the Hamster Dance and the lonely heart Mahir ""I kiss you!"" Cagri? Those were two early pre-4chan memes.

&gt;Aside from Astley, 4chan's most successful meme has been the ""lolcats,"" photos of cats accompanied by goofy captions written in 4chan dialect, phonetically-spelled words using childlike grammar — for example, a hungry-looking feline with the words ""I Can Haz Cheezburger?""

&gt;And the 2007 YouTube stardom of Tay Zonday and his song ""Chocolate Rain"" was due to 4chan users who found his amateurism charming and decided to artificially boost his viewing numbers.

&gt;But the antics of the /b/tards also have a dark side far from cute cats. They've been suspected of replacing people's MySpace profile photos with pornographic images. /b/tards have even gathered together to drive past bookstores with megaphones, shouting the ending of new Harry Potter books.

&gt;One of the most serious allegations against the /b/tards concerns the invasion of hip-hop Web site SOHH.com in June 2008, where much of the site's content was replaced with racist photos and slurs.

&gt;Fellow hip-hop site AllHipHop.com shut down its own forums as the invasion spilled over into them, a stunt that AllHipHop's managers deemed an ""unprovoked racist attack"" by ""cyber terrorists.""

&gt;Since users are anonymous, it's never proven that /b/tards are the culprits, but online communities often point fingers to 4chan for causing much of the chaos in (and sometimes out) of cyberspace.

&gt;/b/tards retaliate by saying that all original Web content stems from something they once posted on 4chan.

&gt;As long as users play by 4chan's carefully listed rules, created by the site's founder ""moot,"" they don't get in trouble with the outside world and mainly stay unnoticed.

&gt;The rules are few and simple: Invasions of other sites are not tolerated, the SOHH incident notwithstanding, child pornography and illegal material are prohibited and no one under 18 is allowed.

&gt;Moot — he insists on the lowercase ""m"" — is reportedly Christopher Poole, a college dropout in his early 20s who lives in New York with his mother and is looking for more active employment.

&gt;Since 4chan is anonymous, it's unclear if Poole is truly his identity and whether it's true that he began 4chan in 2003 while in high school using his mother's credit cards or that he's still deeply in debt as the site continues to lose money.

&gt;4chan has been moot's main focus since he was 15 years old, which he began with one ""anime/random"" board.

&gt;Since those early days of 4chan, the boards have grown from something small and slightly elite to a site that moot says is now mainstream.

&gt;""4chan ceased to be a 'secret clubhouse' ages ago. We serve over 15 million users per quarter, and are larger than 99 percent of other sites on the Web,"" moot told FoxNews.com.

&gt;Moot says the growth of 4chan has kept things interesting. In just a few months, figures have increased to 450,000 posts a day.

&gt;Users tend to push the envelope as far as they can without breaking the site's rules — including a vague ""rule"" known on /b/ eloquently coined, ""Don't mess with football.""

&gt;That rule was made famous in 2005 when 23-year-old Jake Brahm posted bomb threats to major football stadiums across the country during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on 4chan.

&gt;What resulted was a media storm — and what may have began as a practical joke turned into Homeland Security's arrest of Brahm. He was sentenced in June to six months of prison and $26,750 in restitution.

&gt;""If you want to post illegal things to 4chan, I would highly discourage it, unless you want to end up in federal prison,"" moot said at a Web conference.

&gt;Another controversy to hit 4chan was the ""invasion"" of the teen-centric online social site Habbo Hotel. At this online ""hotel,"" users create avatars that walk into various virtual rooms and chat with other users.

&gt;In 2006, /b/tards swarmed the site, created avatars of men with Afros and Armani suits and blocked the hotel's swimming pool and shut it down, due to ""AIDS in the water."" After this incident, moot added ""no invasions"" to the rules.

&gt;The September 2008 hack of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin Yahoo e-mail was more muddled.

&gt;While some users applauded the /b/ newbie who claimed to have done it, others derided him as an idiot and amateur who would get the entire site in trouble — and quickly discovered his true identity long before the FBI figured it out.

&gt;Some see 4chan as a site filled with bored teenagers who like to push the limits on what they can do online. Others see users as part of an ""Internet hate machine"" filled with calls for domestic terrorists to bomb stadiums.

&gt;But it's hard to call someone a terrorist who posts photos of cats with captions in 4chan language every Saturday, or what /b/tards like to refer to as ""Caturday.""

&gt;The ""lolcats"" — Laugh Out Loud cats — became so popular that one user launched the images on his own blog, icanhazcheezburger.com, a site that has since been acquired for $2 million and spawned at least one book.

&gt;But why cats?

&gt;""At the end of the day, /b/tards are still human,"" says moot. ""Cute cat pictures appeal to most people.""

&gt;In an atmosphere where anything goes, the only thing that seems to truly rile a /b/tard is the abuse of a cat.

&gt;In February, a user documented abuse to his pet cat, Dusty, as a friend rolled tape. The video surfaced on YouTube and was viewed over 30,000 times.

&gt;In a rare 4chan moment, /b/tards created an alliance to do good and tracked down the cat abuser, Kenny Glenn, and alerted police.

&gt;Moot believes that 4chan has the ability to grow into something more powerful than a generator of memes.

&gt;During the past year, ""Project Chanology,"" created by an amorphous 4chan-associated group calling itself ""Anonymous,"" has become an organized effort against the legal and cultural power of the Church of Scientology.

&gt;Anonymous members, often wearing masks depicting the main character in the politically charged comic book and movie ""V for Vendetta,"" protest across the country, claiming the religion endorses Internet censorship.

&gt;It all began in January of 2008 after the Church of Scientology tried and failed to purge the Web of a leaked Tom Cruise promotional Scientology video.

&gt;What the /b/tards may do next is anyone's guess. As moot says, if he had an idea for the next idea, he certainly wouldn't tell the media.

&gt;""4chan, both the site and its memes, has touched the lives of tens of millions of people from around the world, in one way or another, for better or worse,' he says. ""I'd say that's culturally powerful.""",1425950545

It's not that it's too hard because people are ""lazy and stupid"", it's that people just aren't wired that way. Most people will make the occasional slip-up or mistake and reach for the easy, convenient junk food. After 30 years of this most people end up overweight.

There's a difference between junk food and soda. Sure you can scarf down half a box of donuts or candybars, but at least you will feel full afterward. It seems that for many people drinking a can of soda will not leave them feeling full in the same way. They scarf down the donuts *and* have the soda.

For me it's the opposite. Drinking soda fills me up, so I can easily substitute an entire meal for a can of Mountain Dew (not that I do that frequently, soda is Bad For You). But maybe it explains why I'm not overweight...

* Shopping you can walk to: Yes, of course.
* Abundance of bicycle lanes: There are some bicycle lanes and great tracks for sportsmen, but bicycles are not great here. Spain is the second most mountainous country in Europe (after Switzerland). You'd need to keep in very good shape if you want to move through most of our cities by bicycling; it's not worth it in most of Spain.

Other advantages include:

* Great quality food. Monsanto's GM bullshit is forbidden. Almost nobody uses non-olive oil at home. Strict, high standards.
* Social security. You don't have to be rich in order to get treated. Free access to some of the best hospitals and surgeons in the world, and experimental treatment. Unemployment insurance. Paid retirement.
* Free education, including university.
* Great views, monuments, castles, palaces, history, things to do. Spain is the first or second country with the most UNESCO World Heritage sites.
* Good to great public transport in most cities. I've never needed a car to move through the city of Madrid; you can move by underground train, tram or short-distance train to almost anywhere; there are buses too; and long-distance trains to every major city and some minor cities, as well as an expanding network of high-speed trains (250 to 350 Km/h), all of which are electric of course.
* No puritans. No creationists. Less church influence. Fairly comfortable for an atheist. Almost nobody will even give you a weird look if you go telling you're an atheist.

Disadvantages include:

* Motherfucking bullfights and animal cruelty; a minority of Spaniards need to be gased.
* Retarded government and politicians. The two major parties are stupid (the ruling party is also pro-terrorism, as the eta terrorist organization is alive thanks to them).
* Retarded independentists/terrorists.
* Retarded politically correct, islamofascist loving, SGAE (= RIAA) abiding fussboxes. And our movies blow big fat hairy oozy monkey balls; we have to have some of the worst movie producers in the world.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Second_voyage

&gt;During his second voyage, Columbus and his men instituted a policy in Hispaniola which has been referred to by numerous historians as genocide. The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved and murdered. Hundreds were rounded up and shipped to Europe to be sold; many died en route. For the rest of the population, Columbus demanded that all Taino under his control should bring the Spaniards gold. Those that didn't were to have their hands cut off. Since there was, in fact, little gold to be had, the Taino fled, and the Spaniards hunted them down and killed them. The Taino tried to mount a resistance, but the Spanish weaponry was superior, and European diseases ravaged their population. In despair, the Taino engaged in mass suicide, even killing their own children to save them from the Spaniards. Within two years, half of what may have been 250,000 Taino were dead. The remainder were taken as slaves and set to work on plantations, where the mortality rate was very high. By 1550, 60 years after Columbus landed, only a few hundred Taino were left on their island. In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained.

Why? I pretty honestly don't respect intellectuals much other than what they really produce in their own field of research, because I think their shielded life makes them voefully inadequate in the field of practical wisdom (common sense, phronesis).

&gt;""Ethical claims are prescriptive, and do not need to honour ontology.""

But it itself is a _prescriptive_ statement, it is your value judgement about value judgements. My value judgement is that ethics must _work_, it must be useful, practical, therefore it must be based on historical experience or empirical psychology or whatever, I think it's crazy for a zebra to want to become a lion, it should want to become a good zebra and nothing more, which MUST be based on a good understanding what a zebra _is_.

&gt;""a liberal rights based model, or a utilitarian goods based model""

Models. Theoretical speculations, based on almost nothing _real_, at least that's what I found when I've read the perhaps most important book on social justice, Rawls's A Theory Of Justice. How should we think if we were bodiless souls etc. Right. That sounds practical and based on real life? Er... not.

No insult meant, hope none is take but this is exactly why I disrespect intellectuals (except in their own fields). Any reasonably old and experienced blue-collar person has more common sense: they think more limited, more cautious, more practical-minded ways.

&gt;""Material causality is not relevant to political deliberation.""

Except that violating cause and effect leads to unexpected consequences. Tweaking one factor of the system, tweakers hope that nothing else will change, but of course it will if it's part of a causal chain.

&gt;""As it is, ethical and political reasoning argue toward their goal, and are not deduced from given conditions.""

Why? It's by no means the only possible way to think up practical programs. One can for example do it the other way around: see how things are and see how much and what kind of improvement do the conditions allow. 

Thankfully, teleology was almost completely eliminated from science f.e. from evolution, why keep it around in political philosophy?

""What is ideological typically misreads historical experience as a material given""

No, the definition of ideology is: the logos (or logic) of an idea. Idea + logos, pretty straightforward. Ideology is trying to explain history by a model, an idea, claiming history has an internal logic, such as class struggle or racial struggle or something like that. 

""Legitimacy lies in agreement."" That's democractic fundamentalism and easy to disprove. Would it be acceptable if 51% voted to kill 49%? If not, then the agreement of the majority is not enough. Perhaps the agreement of all? Nope: criminals don't agree to be sent to prison, yet they need to be. Thus the agreement of all is not needed, the agreement of the majority is not enough. Whose agreement is needed then?

Hint: I think legitimacy is not very important. The important thing is to have working, practical ideas, legitimacy can be seen as a mere tool to find them.

""We relate to it, but as reflexive beings, we are able to modify its effects and self-select better outcomes in democratic procedures.""

Democractic procedures. What a naive illusion... there is no such thing. Democratic procedures everywhere from Asia to Europe to America are choosing between 2-4 elite groups, usually based on who has the better haircut or the better slogan. Please. Let's get real. Whenever something got done, it was done by some intellectual or pressure group convincing/bribing the folks who won (by a haircut or a slogan) that it would be either a good thing for the people and/or in his own interests.

No seriously honest person is a harcore democrat - who would really want the dumbest people (those with the greatest number) to rule? Usually, to be a democrat is to say ""I have some very convincing ideas, so let the people rule because I think they will listen to my ideas, so through a proxy, basically, I will rule."" Not a very honest position. 

Democracy is nothing but the best idea we could come up with how to avoid brutal dictatorships, but nothing more, not an inherently good process, it's just a quarantine system for keeping the power of would-be tyrants limited.",1425950770

Actually, that impression goes back beyond Hollywood. The Old West is a rare example of a myth that was being formed in its own time.

With the Cobalt, Camaro, and Corvette, they could secure the Tuner, Muscleheads, and Racecar fans all within the same brand.  And Chevy trucks could continue to build on what they already have.  Cadillac is well.... Cadillac.  They should pour all of their money into quality.  There has been significant damage done to the Cadillac name in the past decade due to the loss of that quality that people were accustomed to seeing.  They need to bring their construction quality up to BMW and Mercedes if they want to really take off.

I don't think it's a matter of if, it's really when. More countries will fall under the EU, and it will steadily expand. An NAU, or some kind of equiv is no doubt a reality at some point.

The current system we have does not work. We are one people, and one race, yet there are so many differences between the quality of life we get to live. Just depending on where you are born you could either live to 100, or 18, and that is not right. Problems with food shortages, over population, space exploration (on a broad scale), war, etc, could all theoretically be addressed with a world government. Right now everyone is making their own rules, and we are trashing the planet. I honestly hope for a world government, but a benevolent one.

We ended one kind of slavery.  Someday hopefully we'll end it it all.

&gt;the virulent hatred of the northern occupation was taken out on blacks, resulting in hundreds of years of institutionalized racism.

Thank your beloved states for that.  They had to be dragged kicking and screaming from doing it too.  Don't try to foist their actions off onto others; they are responsible for their own actions.  Fuck ""states' rights"" bullshit; the only thing that matters are human rights, which the states didn't give shit about until they were forced to.

&gt;Portugal and other European slave trading countries did not have such a difficult time integrating freed slaves because they didn't resort to violence.

They also didn't have such massive slave populations.  Their colonies did, and the colonies did suffer much violence as a result.

&gt;This, of course, falsely assumes that freeing the slaves was the reason for the Civil War.

Who said that?  I just said that slavery wasn't ended by the states.  It doesn't matter why slavery was ended; it was ended.  But don't let that interrupt your little fantasies.

That's not true.  You are told that you are bombarded by images of sex, so you just believe it.  Open your yes.  Read history.  In prior times, nude statues lined the streets, there were penis doorknockers and windchimes, nudity was encountered on a near daily basis.  In our society we are deluged by people specifically NOT talking about sex, of hiding the human body at every single turn.  Most people reach 18 years of age having never seen more than a handful of people nude.  it is impossible to have a healthy body image or understanding of your own sexuality without experience of nudity and sexuality.

&gt;Kids from this age cannot escape this constantly emitting sex channel, in a normal world a 10 year old kid would have to guess what sex is, hear about it from older kids, but he will never try it, because it's taboo.

Tell me, in what childrens media do the characters have genitalia?  None.  Characters are presented as being human, but devoid of any sexual component whatsoever.  This was never true in any other part of history.  Why do you think that adolescents, when they ahve sex, don't know about contraceptives?  Is it because they've been bombarded with messages about sexuality?  No, it is the opposite.  They have been bombarded with ideas that sexuality is not meant for them, and only done by dirty people.  How are they supposed to have the knowledge and confidence to walk into a store and buy condoms?

&gt;I don't know if you remark, but all this crazy shit happens always in the open free world, where sexuality is the currency

Point out to me where is this ""sexuality is the currency"" bullshit pelase.  In the ""classical"" societies you point out, sex is much more open.  Incidental nudity is more common, people don't lose their minds at the idea of a child swimming naked and similar things.  In these ""open minded"" countries, you are not even to speak of the sexuality of children or adolescents.  They deny it exists.  They teach their kids that abstinence is the only form of birth control and all others are useless.  I'd really like to see some examples of where you think we're ""open"" about sexuality.  Do you not recall Clinton firing Jocelyn Elders because she had the gall to recommend we teach adolescents about masturbation?  Masturbation!  Something every single person does and is necessary to be healthy!  There was a societal uproar here when Elian Gonzalez' grandmother visited from Cuba and she put her hands down the boys pants to check the development of his penis.  To people in America, even seeing someone naked with no sexual context is severely taboo unless they are an airbrushed fictional non-person in a movie restricted only to people 18 and over.

&gt;And by the way, being physically able to have sex doesn't mean that you are mature enough to have sex.

Correct.  It means that you're SUPPOSED to be mature enough to have sex, and if you're not, then your parents and society are to blame.  Again I ask you, what evidence do you have that evolution fucked up by putting puberty where it did?

&gt;(you must admit, that never in the history did we have much of an over sexed society as today and never did wee see a catastrophic emergence of society diseases and degradation, I don't know about you but I see some correlation here)

No, I don't have to admit to any such absurd lie.  What do you even know about the history of sex sociologically?  Over-sexed society?  Why don't you drop by the islands of Papua New Guinea and hang out with the village where from age 6 to around 18, all boys and adolescents live in a common open hut in the center of the village servicing each other sexually?  And you want to know about disease, read up on the history of syphillis.  It goes back to the time of the black plague, and immediately spread to the 'new world' when the settlers arrived, then quickly spread right back into Europe.  it killed millions, and was rampant because then, unlike now, people had sex much, much more often.  Before 200 years ago, there was no concept of adolescence.  None.  At 13 you were an adult (witness the coming of age ceremonies in practically every culture ever except ours).  You left your family and you started your own.  We only invented the idea of adolescence and waiting until later to become sexually active because companies needed educated workers.  As for other diseases, have you noticed that we have many many more diseases now than ever before?  It's not because the diseases are new, they're not.  It's because we have names for them now.  A couple hundred years ago, people just died and no one knew why, or they didn't have a name for it, or they confused it for other causes, etc.  STDs are FAR less common now than before.  You really need to pick up a book and read some history sometime.  You say you don't watch talkshows, but you're spitting out their words verbatim without even thinking about them.  In ancient greece, men would teach adolescent boys about sex, women would teach young girls, in the culture of the native americans they had ""fire women"" who would teach boys about sex first hand.  In every other single culture in the history of mankind except ours, adolescents were understood to be fully human, and sexuality is part of that.

&gt;And please stop making it sound as your argument is scientific borrowing some ideas here and there, you're so radical about the subject that any sane person will see the lack of objectiveness in your arguments.

I have researched these issues for years.  You're just going based off of some gut hunches and stuff you just accumulated without thinking over the years.  I think it's pretty clear you're not even trying to be objective in the least.

&gt;WTF? you mean all this billion of people not having sexual experiences until later years are sexually and emotionally underdeveloped?! I want to know your sources..

How late?  The brain loses its plasticity in the early 20s.  Have you not noticed the 50+% divorce rate?  How about that 1 in 3 adults are on antidepressants?  Where is your evidence that millions of people AREN'T emotionally underdeveloped?

&gt;I think she's probably until today traumatized about your anal experimentation, but if you are the ""she"" and anal sex at 12 was your best experiment in your life then you've got a pretty miserable life :P

I was not traumatized at all, and there was no she involved.  Like many guys, I played around with another male friend of mine.  We played around a handful of times, of our own accord.  People don't repeatedly do things that are traumatizing to them.  If some asshole like you had been around to tell me, as an impressionable kid, that what I was doing was horrible and perverted and that I would like a life of misery, then yes, I would be damaged.  it is people like you that damage the young people who have early experimentation which, if you would have the balls to read ANYTHING, you will learn is very common.

edit:  Oh, and please notice that my ideas are not radical.  They are as old as the species itself.  I challenge you to find a single culture before the Victorian Age that was even remotely as fucked up about sexuality as we are.  You won't find one.  You'll find nothing but culture after culture that embraced the human body and sexuality.  And please, also, as I gave you facts and evidence, try to do the same.  A discussion can't go anywhere if I'm giving you evidence and you're giving me nothing but blind assertions.

The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was obviously one of the great turning points in
world history. It is an event over which misinformation abounds. The myth-makers and
re-writers of history have done their landscape painting jobs well. The establishing of
Communism in Russia is a classic example of the second ""big lie"" of Communism, i.e.,
that it is the movement of the downtrodden masses rising up against exploiting bosses.
This cunning deception has been fostered since before the first French Revolution in
1789.
Most people today believe the Communists were successful in Russia because they were
able to rally behind them the sympathy and frustration of the Russian people who were
sick of the tyranny of the Czars. This is to ignore the history of what actually happened.
While almost everybody is reminded that the Bolshevik Revolution took place in
November of 1917, few know that the Czar had abdicated seven months earlier in March.
When Czar Nicholas II abdicated, a provisional government was established by Prince
Lvov who wanted to pattern the new Russian government after our own. But,
unfortunately, the Lvov government gave way to the Kerensky regime. Kerensky, a socalled
democratic socialist, may have been running a caretaker government for the
Communists. He kept the war going against Germany and the other Central Powers, but
he issued a general amnesty for Communists and other revolutionaries, many of whom
had been exiled after the abortive Red Revolution of 1905. Back to mother Russia came
250,000 dedicated revolutionaries, and Kerensky's own government's doom was sealed.
In the Soviet Union, as in every Communist country (or as they call themselves-the
Socialist countries), the power has not come to the Communists' hands because the
downtrodden masses willed it so. The power has come from the top down in every
instance. Let us briefly reconstruct the sequences of the Communist takeover.
The year is 1917. The Allies are fighting the Central Powers. The Allies include Russia,
the British Commonwealth, France and by April 1917, the United States. in March of
1917, purposeful planners set in motion the forces to compel Czar Nicholas II to abdicate.
He did so under pressure from the Allies after severe riots in the Czarist capitol of
Petrograd, riots that were caused by the breakdowns in the transportation system which
cut the city off from food supplies and led to the closing of factories.
But where were Lenin and Trotsky when all this was taking place? Lenin was in
Switzerland and had been in Western Europe since 1905 when he was exiled for trying to
topple the Czar in the abortive Communist revolution of that year. Trotsky also was in
'exile, a reporter for a Communist newspaper on the lower east side of New York City.
The Bolsheviks were not a visible political force at the time the Czar abdicated. And they
came to power not because the downtrodden masses of Russia called them back, but
because very powerful men in Europe and the United States sent them in.
Lenin was sent across Europe-at-war on the famous ""sealed train."" With him Lenin took
some $5 to $6 million in gold. The whole thing was arranged by the German high
command and Max Warburg, through another very wealthy and lifelong socialist by the
name of Alexander Helphand alias ""Parvus."" When Trotsky left New York aboard the
S.S. Christiania, on March 27, 1917, with his entourage of 275 revolutionaries, the first
port of call was Halifax, Nova Scotia. There the Canadians grabbed Trotsky and his
money and impounded them both. This was a very logical thing for the Canadian
government to do for Trotsky had said many times that if he were successful in coming to
power in Russia he would immediately stop what he called the ""imperialist war"" and sue
for a separate peace with Germany. This would free millions of German troops for
transfer from the Eastern front to the Western front where they could kill Canadians. So
Trotsky cooled his heels in a Canadian prison-for five days. Then all of a sudden the
British (through future Kuhn, Loeb partner Sir William Wiseman) and the United States
(through none other than the ubiquitous ""Colonel"" House) pressured the Canadian
government. And, despite the fact we were now in the war, said, in so many words, ""Let
Trotsky go."" Thus, with an American passport, Trotsky went back to meet Lenin. They
joined up, and, by November, through bribery, cunning, brutality and deception, they
were able (not to bring the masses rallying to their cause but) to hire enough thugs and
make enough deals to impose out of the gun barrel what Lenin called ""all power to the
Soviets."" The Communists came to power by seizing a mere handful of key cities. In fact,
practically the whole Bolshevik Revolution took place in one city-Petrograd. It was as if
the whole United States became Communist because a Communist-led mob seized
Washington, D. C. It was years before the Soviets solidified power throughout Russia.
The Germans, on the face of it, had a plausible excuse for financing Lenin and Trotsky.
The two Germans most responsible for the financing of Lenin were Max Warburg and a
displaced Russian named Alexander Helphand. They could claim that they were serving
their country's cause by helping and financing Lenin. However, these two German
""patriots"" neglected to mention to the Kaiser their plan to foment a Communist revolution
in Russia. The picture takes on another dimension when you consider that the brother of
Max Warburg was Paul Warburg, prime mover in establishing the Federal Reserve
System and who from his position on the Federal Reserve Board of Directors, played a
key role in financing the American war effort. (When news leaked out in American
papers about brother Max running the German finances, Paul resigned from his Federal
Reserve post without a whimper.) From here on the plot sickens.
For the father-in-law of Max Warburg's brother, Felix, was Jacob Schiff, senior partner in
Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. (Paul and Felix Warburg, you will recall, were also partners in Kuhn,
Loeb &amp; Co. while Max ran the Rothschild-allied family bank of Frankfurt.) Jacob Schiff
also helped finance Leon Trotsky. According to the New York Journal-American of
February 3, 1949: ""Today it is estimated by Jacob's grandson, John Schiff, that the old
man sank about 20,000,000 dollars for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia."" (See
Chart 6.)
One of the best sources of information on the financing of the Bolshevik Revolution is
Czarism and the Revolution by an important White Russian General named Arsene de
Goulevitch who was founder in France of the Union of Oppressed Peoples. In this
volume, written in French and subsequently translated into English, de Goulevitch notes:
""The main purveyors of funds for the revolution, however, were neither the crackpot
Russian millionaires nor the armed bandits of Lenin. The 'real' money primarily came
from certain British and American circles which for a long time past had lent their
support to the Russian revolutionary cause…
De Goulevitch continues:
""The important part played by the wealthy American banker, Jacob Schiff, in the events
in Russia, though as yet only partially revealed, is no longer a secret.""
General Alexander Nechvolodov is quoted by de Goulevitch as stating in his book on the
Bolshevik Revolution:
""In April 1917, Jacob Schiff publicly declared that it was thanks to his financial support
that the revolution in Russia had succeeded.
In the Spring of the same year, Schiff commenced to subsidize Trotsky …
Simultaneously Trotsky and Co. were also being subsidized byMax Warburg and Olaf
Aschberg of the Nye Banken of Stockholm … The Rhine Westphalian Syndicate and
Jivotovsky,. whose daughter later married Trotsky.""",1425951099

Today, many executives would just leave to work in another country, and thus many corporations would not have their headquarters in the US. 

In the 1950s and before - they didn't leave the country because the US was by far the best economic option - Asia hadn't yet developed, nor the middle east, and Europe was still in recovery from the war. 

Additionally, at the time, transportation and communications were much worse, so relocating overseas was a *big* deal. Who knows when you'd see your family again.  Not like today, where an executive can jet back home several times a year, and in-between enjoy free Skype calls with webcam.

So yeah - in conclusion -back then, even with that high tax rate - executives didn't leave, as there weren't other nations as that were comparable to the US, and it was such a big loss of family/friends to move. 

Today, that's not the case, so a 92% tax rate would result in a large exodus of top earners, and the corporations that employ them.

The reason why US was so prosperous then was because of oil. USA before the WW2 was the largest oil producer in the world. After the WW2 the oil of other countries came to be available to US too. The prosperity of the 50s was a mix of increased oil imports and increased US domestic oil production. The happy times ended in the 70s when the US domestic oil production peaked and then went to sharp decline. Incidentally the growth of real wages stopped at this exact moment too.

The only thing that has kept US floating and prosperous without major reconstruction and reorganization of the country and how it does business is that the US dollar became in the 70s the reserve currency of the world and US could buy oil with just printing paper.

The only way US is going to come back from the oil and currency crisis is a major overhaul to the whole country. Trickle down economics don't work.

I agree with the second part of your comment. We have been living a life of luxury based on Chinese and east-asian workers hardships. The previous Independent article that was so critical of Dubai brought this up.

&gt;Perhaps Dubai disturbed me so much, I am thinking, because here, the entire global supply chain is condensed. Many of my goods are made by semi-enslaved populations desperate for a chance 2,000 miles away; is the only difference that here, they are merely two miles away, and you sometimes get to glimpse their faces? Dubai is Market Fundamentalist Globalisation in One City. 

We live off the backs of others, and that must change. However, Dubai and the rest of the UAE is an insult to the planet. They abuse workers, lure them with promises that are not kept. A person living in the UAE will produce twice the carbon dioxide of someone living in the US, and four times that of someone in western europe.

Usually it revolves around establishing a settlement beyond the frontier of (western) civilization (Gaul, Britain, Americas depending on time) with better socio-economic rules.

Some things I've found:

Navigation is a BIG deal, especially if you'd like to be able to live beyond the grasp of the established monarchies.  I'd like much more information on how to build a quartz clock from battery, wire, &amp; quartz.  Otherwise, find a clockmaker (1200 on) or watchmaker (1500 on) and explain to him Harrison's *remontoire*, frictionless bearings, bimetallic strips, and most importantly, his counterbalanced rotating pendulum.

Far easier, and ""close enough"" for the needs at hand, would be the [method of lunar distances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(navigation)), which would still need an accurate means of measuring azimuth to a celestial object - a sextant.

Most of my day-dreaming has been about travel to the middle ages or so, enough to beat the ""age of discovery"".  Longitude isn't so important - remember these, there's a weather gyre in the north Atlantic.  Winds blow ships west between the equator and 30n, and blow them east between 30n and 60n.  Avoid the dividing areas by +/- 5 degrees.

Departing:  English Channel: 49N, Gibraltar 36N.

In Transit (depending on when, some of these will be claimed by Portugal:  Azores 39N, Madieras 33N, Canaries 28N, Cape Verde Islands 15N.  Cape Verde to Barbados is the shortest overseas crossing, at about 30-40 days, depending on speed.  

Arriving:  Barbados 13N, Chesapeake 37N, Delaware Bay 39N, Massachusetts Bay 40N, Nova Scotia 44N.  Depending on time, Delaware Bay is probably the best place for European-stock people to establish a colony - Lenape indians were friendly, winter freezes killed parasites, but left a relatively long growing season.

There's bog iron on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, and Copper on the Connecticut river, which flows into the Long Island Sound.

Sail faster with longer, narrower boats.  Carry more sail with less crew using fore &amp; aft sails, or even better, Chinese-style Junk sails.  Make antifouling hull coating out of copper-based paint, or even better, copper sheathing.

Food Preservation:  learn to seal jars with rubber ""one-way"" seals, and boil the heck out of them, or hold them in very very hot water for an hour.  Learn aseptic technique for preserving water, and pasteurizing it for ocean voyages.  Sauerkraut contains vitamin C - layer cabbage with salt in a barrel.   Otherwise dry, salt, or pickle.

Earn money:  Sell technological items:  Cannon, Gunpowder, Steel.  With a trusted partner, practice arbitrage using a wireless telegraph.

Learn to make a radio.

Make steel:  take hot iron and stack it with coke (wood is to charcoal as coal is to coke) in a crucible with holes in the bottom.  Blow alot of air through the crucible.  Take note of color.  Get pure iron.   Add 1% by weight coke to molten iron.  Get steel.

Learn to use engineer's blue.

Learn how steam engines work.

Penicillin can be separated by rate of diffusion across paper, etc.

Refrigeration works on the principle of expanding gasses.  Expand gas on one side of insulation and compress it and cool it on the other.

The way it is now, I'm not even really sure you read my post. You don't see to have responded to a single point in it and the direction you seem to want to take this conversation is kind of besides the point.

by the way, I suspect you're much more naive about women than you realize. Given that you meet your female friends in the park, you are likely young and unmarried and live life as though it is just for fun, having never been responsible for the welfare of a daughter, wife, etc. you haven't worried about the numerous sexual predators on the loose in the streets. You don't accept accountability for the darker side of that uninhibited free society - that women are manipulated, objectifed, sexually used, date-raped, and discarded. That often, men don't want to marry women, just sample them. That what was once an option for women to be independent now results in them being forced to fend for themselves in many cases - I meet so many single moms with kids struggling to make ends meet. It's really sad and not at all what people like you think of when you think of freedom for women. How many women carry mace with them to the parking lot at night after work? That's your freedom buddy. There used to be ""families"" in america back when the morals were more like islamic ones, i.e. the image of a nuclear family. Now, there's 50%+ divorce rates, teen pregnancy, widespread abortion, rape. young men and women have their hearts broken dozens of times before they marry and we're still surprised when people divorce? as if they haven't practiced getting divorced all their lives. 

Not to mention, with the flagrant objectification of women's bodies in every grocery store checkout in america, women are increasingly insecure about their appearance and even go so far as to undergo elective surgery just in hopes of deriving self-satisfaction by appealing to the sexual whims of men. way to really LIVE. What's ironic is that this sexually-open society is incredibly patriarchal but insidiously so, hidden behind a rhetoric of ""freedom"" for women. freedom to what exactly, pretty themselves up for men?

One day, if you're ever lucky enough to meet a vibrant self-reliant and powerful ""Muslim"" woman, you'll see she is not really concerned with whether you think she's ""hot,"" (the way real gentlemen treat women right?) but the important things to her are her mind, her faith, her character. True practice of Islam liberates the woman by showing her the true purpose of life is closeness to God, that if only God is your master, that the affairs of this life are meaningless, including the wanton sexual lusts of men. 

Don't get me wrong - I'm not ragging on America. I love America. I am free to practice Islam in America and I don't have to worry about some tyrant locking me in jail or spying on me for going to the Mosque. That's what we have across the Muslim world - religious repression by western-backed tyrants and uneducated tribal leaders enforcing twisted interpretations in rural lawless areas. That is to say, you're much more likely to find a woman living by the true teachings of Islam in a free society where she is free to do so. The only problem with that is when people take all of the freedom but accept none of the responsibility - Islam strikes a balance.",1425951258

The problem is not the worker making $29 an hour. The problem is:
- shipping your economy abroad [not smart. Definitely not smart. This is a move that is -only- good for management that takes home big bonuses on cost-cutting exercises, while giving away tools and technologies to future competitors. That doesn't sound remotely stupid to you?]
- Simply: the US stopped making cars people wanted to buy. Have you seen them? They're as sexy as a soap box. Old technology [we've had electric engines in cars since about 1900 ish. Where is that modern electric car now? It's really more important to please the oil company than to have a drive that works on modern fuel? in a country where people need to drive thousands of miles to get anywhere, fuel efficiency sounds like one of the checkboxes that are checked by default on the 'must have' list. Apparently not. How's that gas price biting you in the ass by the way?]. 

Old designs, rehash, rehash, rehash, rehash. Somewhere someone ran out of ideas and it turned out to be a communicable disease.

Bad user experience. Driving an American car, with the standard automatic, is like pushing a fucking pram. Soccer mom ftw, baby!

HUGE cars, because if there is one thing we need more of, it's a tool for vehicular homicide while we're talking on the cell phone when we're supposed to be paying attention. But wait, no, that would be socialist, we're not going to do that.

Your fascination with service jobs is also totally unwarranted. First: what's wrong with a manufacturing job? Nothing at all. Second, your service industry is also shipping jobs abroad. Haven't you heard? They're having meetings about how to create job openings that no American can succeed in [at the very least, if the guy is -that good- that they'd be stupid to refuse him, he's going to have some character flaw that they can rub in his nose so that they don't have to take him. They can then buy an Indian coder to work for a third the price on an H1B visa. Your service job again?

Your educated society... dude, we're not leaving any child behind these days. Children 'graduate' high-school functionally illiterate. College students make professor's eyes water with their answers [and you can't hurt their feelings, that's going to be a problem when the professor is evalutated]. Home schooled kids [with the possible exception if their parents are professional educators] entering the real world, bearing the burden of their parents ignorance. We're an educated society alright. Just not a very well-educated one. European children beat American children [in their age group] hands down. Dumbing down the curriculum is -not- the way to go to get a well educated populace. Have you -seen- what a Chinese kid has to study? Have you seen the amount of books they need to chew through? And that's when they're kids. That's just so they can get into a good university.

The kids in those countries who don't make it to a good school, who have to work in the factories we give them, don't get your magic $12 to $14. They get as little as possible to work as hard as possible. If the manufacturer sees an opportunity in another country where they found people willing to work more for even less money, that factory closes down and the whole shop ships out.

The solution is -not- to debase labour. The solution is to upgrade labour and give people a decent pay check. One that will allow them to have a family and a house, on 1 [one] pay check. You know, like it used to be, before the owners got greedy.

You can't have millions of service jobs. What will they service? You can't have all these magically educated people. First of all they're not, and older people won't be easily trained to do a different job. You can't all have the potential to be a CEO. Have you ever wondered about that? ""Everybody's a CEO"". Have you thought about the reductio there? If everybody's a CEO, all companies are all the same size, right? You want to try and build a world class business on that premise?

You're saying that manufacturing is a bad career. I'm saying that anyone who looks down on an honest day's work is looking to disjoint society and make a whole lot of people live in poverty and misery. There has never been a time and a moment where everybody lived in a golden age. It will have been a golden age for the ruling class, it's never a golden age for the poor clod who has to get by.

In reality, minimum wage in the US has been the same for -a decade-. Not the CEO's pay. Noooooo, he took really good care of himself. But the guy living in the trailer park. Hey, tough cookies, sweetheart. People waiting tables get less than minimum wage so they have to ask for 15% to 20% tip so that maybe they can get home with something that will pay the bills. Cleaning ladies on cruise ships get $1 dollar -a day-. They can [but there's no certainty] great tips from people taking a trip. The $1 dollar is to give them an incentive to work harder. How do you like that as your prime motivator? The captain however, he doesn't work for $1 dollar a day. Somehow, that doesn't translate.

Fedex and UPS have been switching to Sprinter vans in the USA for like 5 years.  They are traditional (and in the USA, a 10 year old design up until recently) turbo diesel.

Much of the advantage comes from the design.  Very thin steel, long wheelbase.  Tiny but extremely high pressure tires, 8500 lb weight capacity on only 4 tires. Sophisticated suspension, they drive well even in high desert winds of Las Vegas.

I lived in a Sprinter motor-home full time for 2 years.  they are a beauty, you can drive and park ANYWHERE. No USA car manufacturer can seem to have enough sense to produce what has been consistently available in Europe for 50 years.  A cheap, tall, not fancy panel van.  We seem to cap all our vans at pickup truck height.  our automotive industry can't even copy what the rest of the world shows them.

From the sprinter owners mailing lists, it seems Fedex and UPS drivers tend to beat the crap out of the sophisticated 6 speed automatic transmissions that these rigs have.  But even with failure of transmissions at 180,000 miles - still the fuel savings of 22MPG is much better and I expect saves them tons of money.

The reason for falling prices in some parts of Europe, and a reduction in the rate of increases in prices in the States has little to do with ""economic progress"" as you put it. 

The proximate causes of the reduction that has been seen in the US CPI MoM are lower fuel costs, and a strengthening of the dollar (these two are at least partially related).

The major reason that fuel costs have dropped is not that any great technological breakthrough has occurred, but rather the unwinding of a huge speculative bubble, predicated on the capacity of the world's economy to absorb higher and higher fuel costs without reducing demand for oil.

&gt;Price deflation is generally a good thing and a sign of economic progress. Sometimes deflation is due to a drop of demand and it is usually a correction to a inflationary boom (at least in modern times), to reestructure the economy. Price deflation is the solution.

And the fuel price did not raise or drop due to speculation.

The conditions of current society: economic inequality, social inequality, poverty, shortages, crises, ""greed"" and so on, are all unique in their form to Capitalism. Along with those, the ideologies that justify them - including the ideology of what Greed is. Money itself is one of those ideologies. Especially under Capitalism. Pre-Capitalist society's currency had worth, it was often made of metals like silver and gold or copper, however with Capitalist society that isn't the case. Money is merely a representative note: ""You have this much wealth."" And cost ""You require this much wealth for this item."" Money itself, I see, as being naiive. Its an idea, a system, designed on restricting distribution. It is used only to prop up business men, Capitalists. It is used to replace wealth in the hands of working people. There was a time when we could trade our own works, bread bakers, smelters and so on. However, with wages turning to money under Capitalism, we found ourselves having none of that. Trade isn't for us anymore, it was for our bosses. They give us enough to meet our subsistence. They then take what we make and sell it back to us, retaking our subsistence wage. Money, to me, is an absurd concept and a highly unnecessary one. Without it we could easily say: ""These people need food, feed them. These people need homes, let's house them. These people need clothes, let's make them clothes."" And it'd be no different from us making them now. Except of course, for the lack of Boss, for the lack market economics.

People don't have to pay for anything. There is more than enough to go around. All anyone has to do is invest their productive labor into the things they and the rest of society want and need. Its a collective action, and with a Socialist organisation of society, the investment of labor would be substantially less compared to today's.

The point is that you don't need a price tag on everything. There is no natural scarcity. Productive capacity puts us well ahead - and that is still with cutting back for environmental reasons. The reason we don't produce like that now is because of the absurdity of ""overproduction"" which hinders ""profitability.""

I don't think human beings are greedy. Its not a matter all people being the same. Capitalism works very hard to make us act greedily, to compete and to take without a second thought. However, the working class, despite this attempt at conditioning, are a collective laboring class, a majority class, and they are far more inclined to cooperate and share resources than they are to try and rob and exploit each other individually. Afterall: For those who have nothing, what sense is there in stealing from others who have nothing? You're better of working with others for the benefit of all of you.

I think it'd be good for you to read some introductory pamphlets on Socialism, to give you an idea of what Socialist society actually is. Though right now I can tell you it isn't some ambiguous european style government. Its a society absent of market economics and the drive for profits. Its a society based on needs, on democratic organisation on all layers of society. A society of economic and social equality. You'd really have to read a little on that to understand why some of your questions don't really apply so well to Socialism.

Actually, if you read some introductories, you might find many answered for you.

www.sa.org.au - that site has a fair few intro pamphlets - if you can find it read how marxism works - its an introduction to marxist socialist theory - or the socialist alternative - which is an introduction to the general ideas of socialism.

I'm damn happy with socialist security (police and national defense), education, postal service and fire protection. I like our social safety nets and want to make them stronger. I wish we'd socialize healthcare and more of our national transportation infrastructure. At this point I'm even flirting with the idea of socialized banking.

Meanwhile, I'm quite happy with capitalist markets for consumer goods, entertainment, and luxury services, provided there's minimal product safety regulation.

I think that a properly incentivized free market is the way to solve our energy and climate change problem. I think that adopting socialist principles will cure much of what ails our healthcare system. I think economic sectors that lend themselves to natural or de facto monopolies (utilities, for example), that monopoly ought to be the government. Meanwhile I don't think the government should prohibit competition where private industry can compete: let UPS deliver first class mail to mailboxes.

Yes its impossible to compare america to any other country on earth. The stats speaks for it self and not just the economic ones. If your compare america to other western country, you are getting robbed more than others.

Well, I can't speak for people in militias as I've never actually spent any significant time with someone in one. But when the US Constitution uses the word militia, it does not refer to a specific group or club. It generally refers to any able bodied person who is an adult and can protect the community when needed (yes, with guns).

The militias you are referring to are a VERY tiny percentage of the gun owning population.

I don't think you can compare the US with Europe because there are too many variables. But if you want to, I can argue that the US, with all of our guns, has had significantly less government genocides in the last 100 years than Europe with all of its gun control.

I'll tell you why, but Kelca's comment had nothing to do with it, unless he was missing a significant number of words/sentences.

Somalia is, like many African countries, fucked up beyond repair firstly because their tribal culture is so deep-seeded that it will likely never go away in most areas, secondly because European empires tried to introduce western style infrastructure and government so that they could be better exploited and then pulled out before the job was done, and thirdly because of Christianity and Islam.

It's pretty hard to determine which had more impact on producing the current situation, but the European colonialism did plenty by roping together rival tribes with lines on a map. However, that is something that was done all over the world and many places were able to overcome it and make the best of their situation. 

Currently, Somalia has no government because it collapsed under their own corruption which is clearly attributable to tribalism and religion. Other African countries show that European colonialism was able to form coherent countries that exist today and are actually prosperous, so that diminishes the idea that it's *all* Europe's fault and nothing else.

There are many variables and I am aware of history, but the question is if a genocide really is possible or needed for your government?

1. You have excelled in the past. A lot of people did NOT get wealthy in the time period that you did; statistically, you gotta admit: you're probably not in the *bottom* 50% of humans in terms of economic ability; you will most likely make out better than average.
2. You live in a privileged country during a privileged time. Assuming you are a Canadian, American, European, Australian or New Zealander, the level of poverty you might experience at worst is likely a bit better than the life of a comfortable human in most historical times and places on this planet. Assuming you get into a shelter, or into some pitifully underfunded community service program, you'll eat once every day or two; you'll have access to toilet paper; you'll be able to bathe every few days; you can get a free library card and read; you can get second-hand clothing more convenient than a medieval king could obtain; you have access to plastic tarpage that is lighter and more waterproof than anything dreamt of 50 years ago. The level of poverty you are subject to is far above the level that many people, at this very moment, are thriving in. Failure to enjoy life is actually due to improper approach, clinical depression, or lack of imagination.
3. You are about to take those six months off to bum around with a backpack. You know, the ones you were dreaming of? All those museums, campgrounds, music festivals you never had time for.
4. You are living a story that will be great to tell around the dinner table some years hence.
5. Being human is pretty rare anyway. You were the lucky sperm out of a million. Bhuddism, and the concept of the rarity of human incarnation: the aphorism that it is as rare to be born a human as for a blind turtle in the western ocean to swim to the eastern ocean and surface with his head precisely in the middle of a floating hoop of straw.

 By Gil Villagrán, MSW
gvillagran@casa.sjsu.edu
April 10, 2009

	After a trillion tax-dollar bailout for Wall Street, our economy is still in the toilet, plugged up with toxic paper worth a fraction of what workers saved from earnings for a home, a child's college education, or a comfortable retirement. The joke about how everyone's 401(k) retirement fund is now a 201(k) is no joke as most investments have lost half their value since 2008. The home purchase will have to wait, the college student must settle for trade school and a lifetime of low wages, and the retirement plan becomes a ""work til you're dead and hope it happens before uninsured long-term care is required."" 
	But not to worry: Treasury Secretary Geithner is planning a second trillion dollar giveaway, but this time with a string attached:  a request the largess be lent out rather than used for buying other banks or paying off old debt to foreign banks. Yes, that is what Wall Street did with our first trillion, they went on bank shopping sprees, paid billions in bonus gifts to themselves, and reduced their corporate debt.  President Obama, Geithner, and Congress met the public outrage over the bonus payments with consternation. However, as the president's economists stated, ""The bonuses are binding contracts, we are a nation of laws, so we cannot tell Wall Street what to do (with our money)."" Yet days later, everyone in the Washington DC Beltway stated with equal consternation, ""Those autoworker union contracts must to be set aside if the industry is to be granted any multibillion dollar loan.""     
	Are these two statements spoken by the same individuals contradictory? Or is there a logic that escapes us outside the beltway? George Orwell stated it richly simple in his Animal Farm satire, ""All pigs are equal, but some pigs are more equal than others!"" Similarly, all contracts must be honored in a nation of laws, but some contracts can be shredded when they apply to wage workers rather than billionaires. Wall Street and the Washington Beltway are connected in an insidious manner, where they see eye-to-eye, feel each other's pain, think with the same mind:  ""Above all, we must protect our financial system!"" 
	But what is this ""great system"" that must be protected, sustained, if it has broken down so often and has thrown 10 million out of work, 2.5 million homes into foreclosure, fails to provide health insurance for 45 million? The system is called Free Market Capitalism, which means: barely regulated robber baron capitalism. The wealthy ruling class designed the economic system to benefit their ownership class, and now that the system has failed even them, they will determine how to fix the meltdown.   
	It is high time that American workers woke up to the reality many already suspect: Our so-called Democracy is in reality a Pluto-Oligarchy-defined as government by the few-where an elite class of families with great wealth are interconnected to control every aspect of the society. The children of the powerful are prepared, conditioned and mentored to inherit all the important levers of the nation to continue their ""rightful elite rule."" This explains why George Bush, Jr. became president.  
	But this time, the oligarchs at the casino called Wall Street drove the financial system into meltdown, and the Congress and President, in panic, bail out billionaires to whom they are beholden for their election. The claim that the financial system is so complicated that only Wall Street CEOs can fix the system is but an ever more sophisticated manipulation by the oligarchs.   
	How can we set our financial system in order without putting another trillion into the banks? Put that trillion into wages by employing everyone, including the 10 million who just lost their jobs. Workers pay taxes and consume goods; taxed once again this is economic stimulus! There is so much valuable work that must be done to rebuild America:  our cities are all in decay, we need flood control, road repair, high speed rail, schools for the 21st century, health care for everyone. No American family should be homeless, so home foreclosures must be transformed into housing opportunities for working families.    
	At the end of World War II President Roosevelt realized that a devastated Europe would once again be fertile ground for fascism, so he initiated the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, and it worked. Today our own nation needs an American Marshall Plan. There is so much work to be done that every man and woman who can work, who wants to work, who needs a job can join in the most worthy goal of our generation:  to rebuild America!  
	We must all shout:  NO MORE BAILOUTS for BILLIONAIRES!    Bail out the American worker with a job, a home, health care and education! ∆

A few gems:

&gt;In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell and Boris Johnson, then editor of The Spectator magazine, Berlusconi claimed that Mussolini ""had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them ""on holiday""


&gt;In mid-May 2005, while opening the European Food Safety Authority in Parma (preferred over a Finnish location, after Berlusconi made an assertion of Finns ""not knowing what prosciutto is""), Berlusconi claimed that he had to ""dust off my playboy skills"" with the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to convince her to locate the EFSA in Parma.


&gt;In March 2006, Berlusconi defended accusations he made that the ""Communists used to eat children"", by responding with claims that ""... read the Black Book of Communism and you will discover that in the communist China of Mao, they did not eat children, but had them boiled to fertilise the fields""


&gt;At a joint press-conference at Villa La Certosa (17 April 2008) in Sardinia with the Russian president Vladimir Putin, a Russian journalist, Natalia Melikova, put a question to Putin, asking him if he intended divorcing his wife and marrying Alina Kabaeva, an Olympic gold medalist and an MP in Russia. When his guest showed annoyance, Berlusconi intervened with a gesture toward the journalist that imitated a gunman shooting [90]. The journalist was reportedly reduced to tears. Putin denied rumours that he was to marry Kabaeva.


&gt;On 18 November 2008, Berlusconi played ""hide-and-seek"" with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He was set to receive Merkel but opted to hide behind a column while Merkel and her entourage walked by. According to reporters present, Berlusconi called out ""coo coo"", prompting Mrs Merkel to turn around, saying ""Oh, Silvio"".

They are all ""Fuckin' Rob"" stories because Fuckin' Rob exemplifies the Chinese curse: ""May you live in interesting times.""  As this is far and away the most epic Fuckin' Rob story, I will condense it.

I held a party with a friend I had no friends in common with.  I did this because I wanted him to invite a whole bunch of girls I didn't know as I had recently broken up from a 5 year relationship.  Total score - he knew a lot of *au pairs* and exchange students and at one point I had three French nannies all named *Julie* in my bedroom (all clothed - more's the loss).

Fuckin' Rob, of course, was breezing through town and wanted to know what I was doing.  There was kind of a party going on in the background so I had to tell him I was having a party that none of my friends were invited to.  But, you know, come over, I guess.  

He brought a vegetable tray.

Fuckin' Rob met a girl that night - Polish.  20.  Needed a green card.  It should be noted that Fuckin' Rob was 41.  And, of course, they fell madly in love.

...but not madly in love enough for the girl to marry Fuckin' Rob for a greencard.  So, lovelorn and lost, Fuckin' Rob took the girl to the airport.  But he just couldn't stay away.

Fuckin' Rob was spending enough money on airfare to Europe that he needed to take a roommate.  On the plus side, at least, the girl thinks that marrying Fuckin' Rob might not be a bad idea, so Fuckin' Rob goes through the rigamarole of getting a fiancee visa.

The roommate, of course, turns out to be... questionable.  Fuckin' Rob's ""mentor"" at his company, who happened to be 22 years old (yeah, Fuckin' Rob lost a couple decades of life experience to narcotics).  We'll call him Todd.  

Todd wrecked two cars driving drunk while living with Fuckin' Rob.  But the best part is he found himself a 16 year old girlfriend.  But the bester part is that the 16 year old girlfriend had a 14 year old sister that accused Todd of rape.

So now Todd is in jail.  Fuckin' Rob has to bail him out.  But the court rules Fuckin' Rob to be a bad influence on Todd - so Todd can't even go to the house and Fuckin' Rob is assed out of money.  But that's okay - the fiancee is here!  Only she stays with Fuckin' Rob for a day and a half, then bails for points unknown.  

Fuckin' Rob is beside himself.  Worst part is he's got to testify in court on Todd's behalf - you see, the 16-year-old's 14-year-old little sister is a known liar, yadda yadda.  42 year old guy gets on the stand and destroys this little girl.  

*(Believe it or not, this is the part where Fuckin' Rob calls me for a 2-hour phonecall)*

So Fuckin' Rob calls me up.  In tears.  He'd tried to off himself with no less than two eight-balls in one night; not bad for a guy who's been clean for ten years(other than waaaaaaaaaaaay too much weed... and a truly peculiar love of White Russians.  But I digress).  

So Todd got fired from his company.  Never gets to work there ever again.  Headed off to Europe.  Rob throws him a going away party.  And all is great, all is good... Fuckin' Rob asks Todd why Todd is wearing a ring.  And Todd doesn't say much, and they have some beers, and ""I love you brother"" and blah blah.

And Todd thanks Fuckin' Rob for, well, fronting for him.  See, not only does Fuckin' Rob know that Todd *really and truly did rape a 14-year old girl*, he knows that *Todd has done it before.*  Todd's an army brat.  They've had to move four times because Todd's real good at raping little girls.  In fact, Todd's 15 year old sister is currently 7 months pregnant with Todd's son.  Way to go, LDS.  But hey - what's a little serial rape among friends?

So Todd and Fuckin' Rob are walking out of the bar, drunk as hell, ""I love you like a brother, man"" and Todd says

""So you like the ring?""

""Yeah,"" Fuckin' Rob says.  ""It's cool!""

""It's an engagement ring,"" Todd says.

""Wow!  Congrats!  Why didn't you tell me sooner!  Who's the lucky lady?""

*""Your fiancee,""* Todd says.  *""See you later, jackass.""*

And Todd walked into the night, never to be seen again.

Know why he's fuckin' Rob?

...because what set him to bawling was the fact that Todd hacked his server on his way out and Fdisked Fuckin' Rob's porn.

Force is only required to make people do things they don't see as beneficial.

Actually, I would say that is the central problematic issue with all institutionalized forms of socialism in our world.  If socialism isn't run from the bottom up, from the people deciding to socialize together, and not asking a government to be an intermediary, you can have a socialism that *might* work (I ain't makin any bets.  I'm of the mind that *most* governments/economic ideals really work.  The most we can do is try to do our best.).

Anyway, to respond to the OP, the main difference between those is the implementation of the governance.  In europe its essentially democratic socialism, so, its still democratically elected governance/representation, just with more taxation and social programs.

Also, what's funny about the whole ""shouldn't we try free markets"" thing.  China, with its extreme form of communist government, actually has a very free economic market.",1425951760

There is no progress, it's imaginary and idealistic, the universe doesn't care about the tiny part of it that makes up our planet, and language fails to describe it.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. You mean there is no progress in morals? Are people still stoned to death in western societies?

The progress is obvious. Sometimes we do take setbacks, but there is a constant progress in some direction. You said it yourself that morals have changed since the ancient times.

And why tie universe to this? Of course it doesn't care about us, it's incapable of doing such things. Let's keep the metaphysics out of this discussion.

&gt; Religion and morality are intrinsically linked, religions have been made to impose morals and would not exist without morals.

I partly agree here. Religion is used as a vehicle to impose moral standards, but there are other things that religion offers to people than just the morals. It gives them false hope, for example. And this hope opens the door for moral injection. Then, when the need be, the morals imposed by those in power can easily be justified to kill heathens, who just by a 'sheer' stroke of luck are inhabiting the neighbouring village or country.

Luckily the more educated we become, the harder it becomes to inject these nasty morals through religion. Sadly, sometimes bad science will suffice. But let's not go into social Darwinism.

&gt; A pre-civilization man would not feel the bite of conscience that a modern ""moral"" person would when killing another human. Psychopathology is usually ascribed to someone who does not empathize and only thinks in terms of good and bad. The majority of the ancient Greeks during the Peloponesian war celebrated war, it was great, hurting people for glory was a most noble venture. It was not evil to kill people.

This is where you go seriously wrong. The more our living standards, distribution of wealth and education improve, the more our appreciation for human life increases. Just look back 70 years in Europe, and you'll see that when living conditions at the times of war were bad, so was the appreciation for human life. Religion did nothing to save the millions. Killing your enemy was a noble venture. This pattern has repeated through ages.

But I'm not denying the influence of religion. It just doesn't create the morals. It's a vehicle for moral injection. Sometimes it has even been used to deliver a good message. But at least nowadays that is possible and preferable to be done through other means. Most importantly through education.

&gt; You're dead wrong, and if you can't understand what I've said above then I recommend reading ""On the Genealogy of Morals"" by Nietzsche to its entirety.

I've read my fair share of Nietzsche. His views are obsolete in numerous ways. You should read Dawkin's God Delusion. That'll explain you what moral zeitgeist means. As I'm not sure you understand it.

It goes something like this...

Roll back time. Imagine another world. No TV, no internet, no music that is not live and here now. Electricity exists only as a possible dream, but is certainly not harnessed by my 10th century brethern. We have no need of your 20th century technology here us Vikings. We live differently you see.

We have warm wooden dwellings well defended against cold. We have fire. We have a defensive perimeter. We have farms where we grow food to significant surplus. We live in a dependent group, a few thousand of us, where we all know each other by sight if not exactly by name. We do not sit, isolated, alone, at computer terminals, but interact in the great hall where we feast and get drunk and bond. Everyone has a job in our group and we each contribute to the whole and can feel the value of our work. Each deer successfully hunted, each vegetable successfully grown, each piece of iron successfully fashioned, contributes to the well being of us all.

Every summer, 200 or so of the most ambitious young men volunteer as warriors, those who wish to man the longboats our carpenters built, and sail them far afield in search of plunder.

On these missions, the warriors amongst us are trained to direct their natural need for combat into something for the good of our tribe. I pity you in the 21st century, who have no outlet for your warrior need, and must channel it into sport, and football/soccer/baseball teams. This is but a paltry substitution for the taste of the real victory.

We sail precariously across hostile waters to foreign shores. We drift offshore insearch of settlement. The excitement builds! When we see distant dwellings, telltale smoke rising from the unsuspecting shore, we storm the beach and raid the land. We take, we kill those who resist, we rape your women and drink your wine. We steal your gold and retreat to the sea before an organized defence can be mustered. No restricting morality here. It is as such. My culture dictates the furtherance of my race. I conquer because I can. If I do not, I will one day be conquered myself. Such is the struggle of life, the terms of which, I did not dictate. Those are the affairs of the gods!

All I know is that night, after the raid, drifting on the boat, we laugh under the moonlight, drunk on success, we retell the highlights of the action we just lived. You see, for us, action is real and good, not a thing we see on a movie screen. I pity you that never taste real risk. For to overcome, to nearly die, is to experience true exhilaration, not the vicarious one you 21st century people experience on the movie screen.

We vikings, we mad Norsemen raided not just the shores of Ireland and England, but we sailed up the Seine and Danube and raided Europe's interior. Many made peace with us, giving us gold to sail away, fat and satiated back to our northern homeland, our campfires, our wives, our hearty forests and fyords.

Do you believe I pity you, in your 21st century, with all your technology, your TVs, computers, cellphones, antibiotics, and wondrous devices!

Do you believe, I wouldn't swap 40 years of my tenth century, iron age, significant life for 70 years of your safe, 50% of your population overweight, fat, dull, meaningless alone existence? No community except that through the pop culture of the TV screen.

I care about representative democracy and indivudual liberties. Economic freedom is the least important freedom. Modern socialism keeps the economic freedom, most of the individual liberties and most of the devices of representative democracy, but gives the government the right to arbitrarily define which rights you may or may not have and to what extent. A man whose freedom depends on the will of other is not free at all.

&gt; So why do the people who make the leap from socialism to Cuba never make the leap from capitalism to Chile?

Because the cuban form of socialism was the norm for socialism for 80 years while chilean form of capitalism was the exception. Chile today is a social-democracy (center-left). Cuba is still a military dictatorship. That is today, not 1900. That's why I picked it. 
&gt; They may have sounded plausible in AD 1900

Cuba is now, china is now, Kim Jong Il and Chavez and others are happening right now. They may be leftovers from another era, but are 100% orthodox socialism. Socialism doesn't need to be like this, I know, but you can't point to european high-income socialism and say that this is the ""real"" socialism and the others are not.

I have no problem in calling Chile a capitalist dictatorship, because I don't care about defending capitalism per se. I want democracy, I want human rights. Chile didn't have it and I hated Pinochet's guts when he was alive. I lived under the Brazilian dictatorship and it sucked. But the problem with it wasn't the capitalism. It was the lack of the other liberties (which in Brazil we still don't have). I don't want free market and nothing else. I want the whole package.

The new socialism strives because it relies on a somewhat free market but takes away other liberties and people just don't care about freedom as long as they have money.

I know I am far more utopian then any socialist will ever be, since even the ""capitalist"" countries are shifting towards eating away freedom at tiny bites.

This is only partially true. The reality is that most EU countries are not comfortable with the current situation. Remember the constitution failed 3 public votes. It is only because leaders have tried to undemocratically enforce major constitutional change without a mandate from the public that the Lisbon treaty is even viable.

It is quite sad because most EU nations see a place for the EU but this isn't it. It is just that the rest have finally woken up to the 'You are the only idiots complaining!' line the EU regularly pulls to isolate each nation that has a problem with the direction the union is moving. However if they continue to force it down a path nobody wants the end result will be dissolution of the union and that would be a tragedy IMO.

It is not unilateral renegotiation of the British position that is needed. It is a recognition that there is no confidence in the current direction of the EU.

The Native American populations were very small after about 1600, and the continents were very sparsely populated at the time that serious colonization began to take place. And the reason is diseases such as smallpox which the Native Americans had almost no immunities to, and the death rate among them was far larger than the Black Death for Europeans centuries before. It's hard to say for sure, but many estimates suggest that 80% of the New World population died of disease outbreaks within a century of Columbus' first voyage. And even after this, outbreaks of disease continued to kill natives in high numbers for the following centuries, far more than guns or swords ever did. 

For example, if you recall the story of the Pilgrims in 1620 and how they landed at Plymouth Rock... they found that they had settled near the former Patuxet village, where every single member of that tribe had died probably due to smallpox about five years before their arrival. The only survivor of the tribe, Squanto, was in England at the time... and he died within two years after the pilgrims landed... of smallpox. (also, these epidemics were not the result of any biological warfare, which the Europeans only discovered during the Seven Years War).

This is one of the main reasons why native peoples were conquered with little resistance. Whenever a war did begin, the Europeans far outnumbered the Indian tribes they fought.

This is not to say atrocities didn't happen; they did, and often. Hell, they probably would have been a lot worse if such large numbers hadn't succumbed to disease. But to suggest that natives were slaughtered on the same scale as Jews in the holocaust is totally inaccurate... at the time that Europeans began to heavily colonize the Americas, there simply weren't enough natives left to be slaughtered at such high levels.",1425951875

Herpes is downright common. I don't disagree AIDS is bad news if you get it. Herpes is a good reason for most people reading this ... hetro white males having sex with white women, to wear a rubber (not to be racist, I'm from a mixed family, just assuming most people are white reading reddit).

AIDS is going to be seen as a fearmongering thing, as despite seeing Pedro years ago, and Magic Johnson (both not white incidentally), most white kids in America couldn't even name someone who knows someone with HIV/AIDS. That's going to be in the back of most white kid's minds. Like a, ""weed is going to lead to smoking crack in a ghetto lab like in New Jack City"" argument.

You really shouldn't push AIDS as a dangerous issue to white hetro people. It just isn't, and no amount of P.C. MTV spots makes that true. Herpes OTOH, is rampant in suburbia, and gross enough to make kids wear rubbers is shown as a large risk to them. I wasn't ignoring the other STDs, I was saying that we should point out the danger of them before even bringing HIV into the discussion with white people who don't shoot up in the hood with other people.

Males catching HIV from a known infected female during unprotected sex in the United States is a .05% chance. Not .05, .05%, but no one seems to like the facts. The nation matters, because of something called viral load.

http://depts.washington.edu/hivaids/post/case5/fig1d.html

My link above also points out it is under 1/3 of a percent you even meet an infected person *period*. Never mind a hetro person. Which are outnumbered by infected gay people in the United States 39 to 1. ;)

Add to that it's nearly statistically impossible to *find* an HIV infected white female non-drug user ... well, I think you know where I am going here. I'm certain it is so rare no one reading will even be able to say they know someone who knows someone who is a hetro white non-drug user with HIV. While it isn't ""safe"" to have sex with an infected person you are looking at the stats. .031% chance of infection from an encounter. Obviously not cumulative. So .031% any time you have sex with an infected person no matter how many times you do.

In the USA, infected male to uninfected female (receptive vaginal transmission) is .1%, (10 in 10k according to the Dept. of Health and Human Services) Which would be stand alone percentage for each act. Each act is .1%, the next is .1% ... like a saving throw with a 99.9% chance to save each time, in a way. **IF** you meet that elusive infected female I mention above, and wear no condom.

The notion of progress is completely subjective, do you not understand?  You argue that since people are no longer stoned in the streets to death in western society, then that is a form of progress. But to someone in say Afghanistan, stoning someone might be necessary to them. I'm not for stoning people, but I'm also do not have the audacity to claim a universal conception of progress, hence my allusion to the Universe.

You're still looking at this through a modern western moral lens. Progress is completely subjective, and Dawkins concept of living through reason is also subjective, and in some ways, unreasanable, because it will never happen.

Religion is absolutely intrinsically related to a society or civilization maintaining a moral code through the imposition and imprinting of morals on people at a young age through the use of religion.  That religion can then become less relevant, and atheism can exist, but the past existence of that religion and the usage of it as a tool to impose morality has laid a moral foundation that remains. No, we did not arrive to our general moral ethic without religion, that proposition is laughable. 

There is the classic case of a child that was raised by a pack of wolves. The child was beastly and did not have anything close to the morals you have. The human being can be conditioned to do many things, so to argue that there is a certain morality that is progress over the other ones is superficial at best.

I've read the God Delusion. I disagree with Dawkins on his notion of ""progress."" It's subjective. I still like the book, as well as The Selfish Gene.

If you want to talk about a moral zeitgeist, then look no further than Nietzsche. That's what he wrote about, though he does not automatically assume that things have 'progressed.' Look up ""moral relativism"" or ""postmodernism"" and you will see his name.

How are Nietzsche's views obsolete? Explain that to me. I cannot think of a more relevant philosopher in the 21st century, the man that said there would be a battle for the dominion of the earth and the death of god over Europe in the 20th and 21st centurys. Do you think that Dawkins was not influenced by Nietzsche? The revelations of Freud, Jung, and modern psychology would not have happened if it were not for Nietzsche, for better or worse.

I recommend actually reading his works, and not skimming over them.

The big concept that should be understood is that human beings innately seek power because of our social nature. The human will must apply itself, just eating and sleeping and having sex is not enough.  Morals come out of this will to power.  If you see people as merely ""struggling for existence"" (Darwin) you're being very short sighted. Dawkins himself is working to acquire the power of influence by selling books about the delusion of God. His notions of progress and a moral zeitgeist are entirely subjective.

To me, progress is a useless word. And if you look at the world today and think that there is 'progress' even in terms of your own values and morals, well I have Wars in the Middle East to sell you.

&gt;Classic liberalism...

??? I said classical liberalism is compatible with conservatism. I'm not sure what your point is.

&gt; Mosely was a conservative originally 

In 1918, at the age of 21, he was elected a Conservative. 
In 1920 he became an independent
In 1924 he became a Labour MP
In 1929 he became a Labour minister
In 1930 he formed the New Party
In 1931 he formed the British Union of Fascists.

He was clearly a man 'of the left'

&gt;Fascism's roots are drawn on nationalism in the late 19th century

There is nothing 'fascist' about nationalism. Nation states predate fascism by several hundred years.

&gt;If British fascism was a product of the 1930's and opposed in the 1930's how can it be said there was no stigma prior or at all in the 1920's/30's?

Fascism/national socialism emerged in the 1920s. It was seen at that time as a variant of socialism. The British Union of Fascists could be seen as a split of the Labour Party. 

Later in the 1930s the BUF would have been seen through the context of the rise of Germany, and the anticipation of a European war, in which Britain and Germany would be on opposing sides.

&gt;1920's street battles between socialists and nazi's in Germany .

this was a power struggle. People frequently switched sides. Ideologically the distance was not great.

&gt;This applies too with the Spanish civil war

The Spanish Civil War is a complicated thing.

I have come a crossed websites that have entire email conversations that end  with something like getting them to hand write a harry potter book or something like that. Any ideas?

Dearest,
My dear I am writing this mail with tears and sadness and pains. I  know it will come to you as a suprise since we haven't known or come across each other before, but kindly bear with me at this moment. I have a special reason why I decided to contact you. My situation at hand is miserable but I trust in God and hope you will be of my help. My name is Amani Ibrahim Bare 25years old girl and I held from Republic of Niger the daughter of Late General Ibrahim Bare Ma?nassara the former President of the Republic of Niger who was ambushed and killed by dissident soldiers at the military airport in the capital, Niamey with his driver and a former Prefect. You can see more detail about my late father here http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/9/newsid_2463000/2463927.stm
I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father. Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hide away my international passport and other valuable documents. Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contained important documents. I am presently staying in the Mission camp in Burkina Faso.
 
I am seeking for longterm relationship and investment assistance. My father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$11.7 Million in one bank in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that being a refugee, my status according to the local law does not authorize me to carry out the operation. However, he advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted to inform my stepmother about this deposit but I am affraid that she will not offer me anything after the release of the money. Therefore, I decide to seek for your help in transferring the money into your bank account while I will relocate to your country and settle down with you. I have my fathers death certificate and the account number which I will give you as soon as you indicated your interest to help me.
 
It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your assitance and the balance shall be my investment in any profitable venture which you will recommend to me as have no any idea about foreign investment. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes.
 
Thanking you alot in anticipation of your quick response. I will send you my photos in my next email.
Yours Sincerely

The main reason that I disagree with you is because we all (and I mean globally) appear to be in for some very rough times economically - rough enough to make extensive preparation a reasonable course of action.  I personally find Mad Max type scenarios rather ludicrous.  

But the kind of experience that Eastern Europe and Argentina have gone through seems very likely.  

Here is a blog written by a guy who lived through the economic collapse in Argentina: http://ferfal.blogspot.com/

Perhaps you might find his experience helpful.  English is not his first language, but he really does a good job of helping people understand the reality of systemic collapse.  His is a low drama, high practicality view.  No armchair Rambo crap, nothing to sell other than a book he wrote as an afterthought.

it is an historical fact that increased efficiency had nothing to do with the reduction in the work week and the creation of the weekend. in fact, as efficiency increased, capitalists didn't shorten the work day or the work week at all, they kept it the same length and in some cases even lengthened it--because doing so allowed them to get more for the same rate of pay. they fought tooth and nail against every little thing that might give workers an ounce of dignity, even things a ""common sense"" as bathroom breaks...workers ""doing their duty"" has never been anything more than a red herring--studies have shown time and again that the better treated workers are the more productive, loyal, honest, and hard working they are...this probably has a lot to do with why the european workforce is more productive than the american one--hour for hour.

The latter a prerogative of any participating i.e., caring, member of society. If you think your counter is an imposition, why bother? Nevertheless, I'm happy to pick up the gauntlet.

Vis a vis the relatively new application of genetics in medicine and animal husbandry, I don't think a decade, even 2 is enough to make decisions that may impact adversely future generations. We do not know for sure what the long term effects are. I hope you're right and that the side effects are checked. But considering our growing resistance to drugs like antibiotics, the disastrous cross-pollination of Monsato crops which drives so many, not only Indian farmers, to suicide when their efforts fail to produce seeds that will produce next year's crop, I'm skeptical. Something does not add up re Monsanto which induced EU to ban their products in Europe.  

Actually human cloning has already happened. An Italian (I think) scientist made the news about a year or so ago. Like Dolly, his cloned human did not survive, but these are early days. World opinion may have come down on the scientist, but Mary Shelley did too good a job with ""Frankenstein"" for someone to resist the challenge. And a cloned human bred to wash dishes will alway be cheaper than a high tech machine that needs to be replaced every so often. A dumbed-down clone want event know the difference. And have you ever had any machine repaired!? Another reason why most simply buy a new one. One more lump to leach its contents thru the rubbish dumps into the soil.

You suggest that if something goes wrong, we can always ""unwrong"" (my inference) it. Really? Then why do we have a problem with the growing menace of plastic and leaking nuclear waste? Has anyone even tried to ""unwrong"" such mistakes? What about the africanised bees? Has anyone produced anything to fix that problem? What about the radioactive dumps full of discarded computers, cell phones, etc., leaching their poison into the soil?

I DO have high hopes for genetics and the promise of any science. I am, however, distrustful of Nobel-hungry scientists and patent-mad corporations. Humanity has an eternity ahead of it. Or until it's time to join the extinct creation. What the previous century started can be continued by the generations to come. They and their offspring will bear the consequences of our rush to get that patent or Nobel check.

Let's not forget that even Darwin, despite his guess about Wo/Man's descent from the apes, until his death he was not entirely convinced of his own theory. That's what it is, and still is - a theory. The same goes for the meat diet-large brain theory. And no I don't buy the 7-day world creation or Intelligent Design rubbish. We really don't know, and very few have the courage of Socrates to admit it. Modern science has barely started. Let's not forget: errare humanum est.

Finally, I hope you don't take this as an attempt to dis you. You're obviously an enthusiastic supporter of science. Without this enthusiasm we would not be having this ethereal chat, no? Inasmuch as I worry about the side-effects of my laptop, I'm not giving it up (snort :-)",1425952006

They are nothing more than locals trained by MOSSAD and CIA cadres, given access to satellite imagery and ship schedules, allowing them to disrupt shipping meant to traverse the Suez Canal. By threatening shipping they threaten the oil supply routes to the world. Germany, Japan, and many other countries have to respond militarily in order to protect the oil shipping route through the Suez. I suspect the recent attacks on American shipping is a merely diversion.

...and this is the kicker...these ""pirates"" are nothing more than part of plan to bottle up the resources in the middle east and central asia, diverting their flow to Israel away from Russia and China. A great defensive circle around the grand prize.

Other parts of the puzzle (circle): because we now have a ""missle shield"" threatenng Russia and Iran, strategically stationed in eastern Europe...NGO color-coded ""revolutions"" in Poland and the Ukraine, which can block NG flows to western Europe; the attack on south Ossetia, the so-called ""war on terror"" inflaming all of muslim, oil-rich middle east and central asia; Israel about to bomb Iran any second, closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz (Iranian oil); with Pakistan now being torn apart; with India, hoping to get water and oil from Kashmir and central asia, being subjected to a false-flag attack in Mumbai, and now facing nuclear war with the patsy Pakistan and its ally China...all of this basically threatens to cut the oil and NG pipelines off to the world, China and Russia, not to mention creating the potential for destroying the world (except for Israel).

Indeed, this is a miraculous chain of ""circumstances"". It is an amazing coincidence, because if things get real bad, if the oil and NG does get bottled up by these miraculous circumstances, we SURE are lucky Israel is just sitting there, waiting, to get all of that blocked oil and NG gas flowing to its terminal in Haifa, as it is the only viable route remaining:

I occasionally attended various churches with friends and family growing up but never took it seriously. Started exploring spirituality on my own terms in adolescence; Abrahamic, Buddhist, Vedic, even Krsna Consciousness. In my mid-teens I turned to European paganism, then general occultism, Hermetic esotericism and the like. My true break with deistic religion came as I settled into LeVeyan Satanism in my late teens. Eventually though, in my early 20s, my enjoyment of the pomp and novelty wore off and I found myself grounded in secular Humanism where I remain today.

Well, it is now, and I don't think conservatives would disagree with you except for the ""necessary"" qualifier. The conservatives goal is to go back to a time when institutions weren't publicly owned.

Take banks for example, American conservatives are frightened by the fact that some were nationalized, they don't realize that this has been done plenty by other nations to successfully save institutions during difficult recessions (like the Asian Financial Crisis). After doing so these economies quickly recovered. (this is not to say that letting the institutions fail would necessarily be a bad idea either). What I am concerned that American liberals don't realize is that once these institutions  become self sustainable again, they need to be sold off and reprivatized. Government bureaucrats just don't have the mindset or the incentives, or the risk taking instincts to compete in the private sector. In the long term nationally owned companies just become entrenched and inefficient. Again this is not to say that national organizations are bad, they have a need, another one of which is in the case of rapidly developing economies, such as those in Asia. But again here, once the national corporation fulfill their function and develop ones economy they need to be sold off or they become a drag on it.

Lastly both American conservatives and liberals need to take a better look at Europe. While many European countries provide services to its citizens that seem to be socialist in nature, its interaction with other businesses are much less so. I would even go so far to say the Europe is much less involved with its private sector than the US is. It is only due to the fact that the US does not have national health care that conservatives somehow thing their nation is not as socialist as it really is.",1425952077

http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Marcelo-Alonso/dp/0201565188

It's big, it's fat, but it has a lot. It's not the best book around, but you'll find everything you need from basic mechanics to statistical physics, thermodynamics and basic quantummechanics. It builds up to the equations of Maxwell quite nicely, however in general the structure is quite flawed. I wouldn't recommend it if you like them fancy books with shiney pages and purple boxes with ""Interesting note!"". It's black and white, bit outdated, very dry, and hard to follow. This book was rarely used in the US, but it was a huge hit in Europe. The first edition was written in the sixties, this is the 1992 (sixth? seventh?) edition.

On a sidenote though, if you DO like fancy pictures and easy math, AND want to learn astronomy, I can recommend the following book:

http://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Perspective-5th-Jeffrey-Bennett/dp/0321505670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239527234&amp;sr=1-1

It is very airy, intended for non-physicist use actually. It's quite embarassing sometimes to read it as a second bachelor in physics, but it is a breeze to read none the less. It goes over everything from basic earth rotation and it's consequences, up to black holes and quasars. It's not very mathmatical, it's just the storytelling behind the theory, with sometimes a bit of math in a small box, which is still sometimes even at highschool level. 

If you are looking to become a specialist in quantum mechanics, I used to following book:

http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-2nd-B-H-Bransden/dp/0582356911/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239527384&amp;sr=1-1

It's quite interesting, and it explains everything. It starts off with black body radiation, then starts with wave mechanics, and then you end up at matrix mechanics. It does require a lot of mathematical insight though, even though some basic principles such as dirac distrubtion, and fourier transformations are explain in the appendix.

If you want a bible to carry around with all the math help you need:

http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Physicists-George-Arfken/dp/0120598760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239527524&amp;sr=1-1

This is the book I own. It's a bible, I can guarantee you that. It's not meant to start by page 1 and read it through till the end. It's something you use to regularly look stuff up in. It has everything you need for an undergraduate course in physics. It also requires some first year calculus knowledge though. It starts off by assuming you know everything about integrals and derivatives. I think the rest is explained though. You even get a small introduction to physics-applied group theory. If you ever need a polynome, it has everything from Bessel, to Chebyshev.

Palestinian issues are largely ignored. The theme generated by Israeli PR is that Palestinians are terrorists and Israel seeks peace. There is some truth to that but it ignores the whole story.

*Bit of a repost but the following sums up my thoughts on Israel.*

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it ""peace"" on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect all reading this to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They place little value on Peace. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace. Without justice there will be no peace. Israels search for what they call a ""peace partner"" is the search for a compliant Palestinian admin.

Peace can be achieved with Justice, the UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now. The latest terror attack have led to the immediate arrests, the extremists do not have the support of the local community who have given them up.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problem is often claimed to be difficult but it isn't, it's obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements,

2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,

3.Create a viable Palestinian state,

4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.

5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.

6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel will not go along with these plans. They will always ask for concessions without giving enough for them. These concessions the Palestinian leadership simply cannot give without loosing the support of the majority of their population and thus the endless conflict. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants Land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority. FATAH under Abbas does not yet quite fit this bill but it is looking more compliant as time passes, I noted that Israel armed FATAH against HAMAS in past months. They did this for a good reason

To end this ramble heres a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

And

Winston Churchill on the formation of Israel

“The wealthy, crowded, progressive Jewish state will lie in the plains and on the seacoasts of Palestine. Around it, in the hills and the uplands, stretching far and wide into the illimitable deserts the war-like Arabs of Syria, of Transjordania, of Arabia, backed by the armed forces of Iraq, offer the ceaseless menace of war. To maintain itself the Jewish state will be armed to the teeth and must bring in every able-bodied man to strengthen its army. But how long will this process be allowed to continue by the great Arab populations in Iraq and Palestine? Can it be expected that the Arabs would stand by impassively and watch the building up with Jewish world capital and resources of a Jewish army equipped with the most deadly weapons of war until it was strong enough not to be afraid of them? And if ever the Jewish army reached that point, who can be sure that cramped within their narrow limits it would not plunge out into the new, undeveloped lands that lie around them.” Winston Churchill 1937",1425952105

Why would someone with a boat full of nuclear waste navigate all of the way to somalia to dump it's load on their shores (in relatively shallow waters, where it would be obvious that this would have an effect on the local marine and human life.)

Countries have been dumping nuclear waste out in the depths of the ocean for a very long time now.  Doing this out in international waters where there is no jurisdiction, and the hope that the area of the ocean where the dumping occurs is deep enough that we can forget about whatever it is that we put there.

The escapades of Somali pirates made headlines last week. But the media has ignored the injustice behind the phenomenon.

When the Asian tsunami of Christmas 2005 washed ashore on the east coast of Africa, it uncovered a great scandal.

Tons of radioactive waste and toxic chemicals drifted onto the beaches after the giant wave dislodged them from the sea bed off Somalia. Tens of thousands of Somalis fell ill after coming into contact with this cocktail. They complained to the United Nations (UN), which began an investigation. ""There are reports from villagers of a wide range of medical problems such as mouth bleeds, abdominal hemorrhages, unusual skin disorders and breathing difficulties,"" the UN noted.

Some 300 people are believed to have died from the poisonous chemicals. Many European, US and Asian shipping firms – notably Switzerland’s Achair Partners and Italy’s Progresso – signed dumping deals in the early 1990s with Somalia’s politicians and militia leaders.

This meant they could use the coast as a toxic dumping ground. This practice became widespread as the country descended into civil war. Nick Nuttall of the UN Environment Program said, ""European companies found it was very cheap to get rid of the waste.

""It cost as little as £1.70 a ton, whereas waste disposal costs in Europe was something like £670 a ton. ""And the waste is of many different kinds. There is uranium radioactive waste. There is lead, and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury. There is also industrial waste, hospital wastes, chemical wastes – you name it.""

But despite the evidence uncovered by the tsunami, an investigation into the practice of toxic dumping was dropped. There was no compensation and no clean up. In 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the UN that foreign fishing fleets were using the breakdown of the state to plunder their fish stocks. These foreign fleets often recruited Somali militias to intimidate local fishermen.

Despite repeated requests, the UN refused to act. Meanwhile the warships of global powers that patrol the strategically important Gulf of Aden did not sink or seize any vessels dumping toxic chemicals off the coast.

So angry Somalis, whose waters were being poisoned and whose livelihoods were threatened, took matters into their own hands. Fishermen began to arm themselves and attempted to act as unofficial coastguards. They began to seize ships in late 2005. These were released after a ransom was paid. Among them were cargo vessels, luxury cruise liners and tuna fishing boats.

Januna Ali Jama, a Somali pirate leader, explained that their actions were motivated by attempts to stop the toxic dumping. He said that the £5.4 million ransom they demanded for the return of a Ukrainian ship would go towards cleaning up the mess.

Ali Jama said the pirates were ""reacting to the toxic waste that has been continually dumped on the shores of our country for nearly 20 years. ""The Somali coastline has been destroyed. We believe this money is nothing compared to the devastation that we have seen on the seas.""",1425952137

&gt; Take this fact: Over $300 million worth of tuna, shrimp, and lobster are “being stolen every year by illegal trawlers” off Somalia’s coast, forcing the fishing industry there into a state of virtual non-existence.

&gt; But it isn’t just the theft of seafood. Nuclear dumping has polluted the environment. “In 1991, the government of Somalia collapsed,” wrote Johann Hari in The Independent. “Its nine million people have been teetering on starvation ever since – and the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen this as a great opportunity to steal the country’s food supply and dump our nuclear waste in their seas.”
According to Hari:

As soon as the [Somali] government was gone, mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia, dumping vast barrels into the ocean. The coastal population began to sicken. At first they suffered strange rashes, nausea and malformed babies. Then, after the 2005 tsunami, hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels washed up on shore.

[...] government provides a choice that other wise doesn't exist in a pure capitalistic system.

The state can give choices only at the expense of other ones.  e.g. Poor people are allowed to *choose* to breed as many children as they want and can *choose* to have them educated, directly because homeowners are denied a choice about property taxes (and ultimately sovereign ownership of their homes).

But this theft is necessary, you argue.  *For the children*, you claim, as you gladly hand over your wealth to the tax collector.

Would you choose NOT to donate to a private charity to educate poor children?  Or are you so pessimistic about the intentions of people in general, that you think voluntary action couldn't educate our nation's children?

It did, long ago.  Literacy rates in Massachusetts in the 1850s (before public schooling was instituted) were 98%.  In the 1980s the rate was only 91%.  Private schooling could have evolved along with our country without ""help"" from the state, meeting the needs of educating children without resorting to theft.  

One option that comes to mind is income-graduated tuition.  This system could be adopted by some private schools to effect a voluntary ""tax"" on higher-income parents, enabling poorer children to attend.  This is just one idea out of myriad possible within a framework of non-coercion.

It is simply not necessary to use violence and guns (or the threat of them) to educate children-- even the poor ones.  
  
And what is it about education, specifically, that makes *Charity by Theft* morally and ethically reasonable?  Would health-care, food, clothing, mentoring, or anything else that could be argued a child *needs*, also be rationalized under the umbrella of ""State-granted choice""?

If you are concerned about children, feel free to help and ask for mine, but please, remove your hand from my pocket.

The physical description and supposed abilities of the creature vary immensely according to the different cultures in which it appears. However, the unifying feature of almost all interpretations is it being a serpentine or otherwise reptilian monster (or at least possessing a serpentine/reptilian part or trait), and often possessing magical or spiritual qualities. The two most familiar interpretations of dragons are either European dragons, derived from various European folk traditions, or unrelated Oriental dragons, derived from the Chinese dragon (lóng,龍,龙). The word ""dragon"" derives from Greek δράκων (drakōn), ""a serpent of huge size, a python, a dragon"" and that from δρακεῖν (drakein) aorist infinitive active of the verb δέρκομαι (derkomai) ""I see clearly"". Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a big lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from its mouth. The European dragon has bat-type wings growing from its back. A dragon-like animal with no front legs and walking only on its back legs is a wyvern. Following discovery of how pterosaus walked on the ground, some dragons have been drawn using the wings as front legs pterosaur-fashion when on the ground. Dragons are often held to have major spiritual significance in various religions and cultures around the world. In many Asian cultures dragons were, and in some cultures still are, revered as representative of the primal forces of nature, religion and the universe. They are associated with wisdom—often said to be wiser than humans—and longevity. They are commonly said to possess some form of magic or other supernatural power, and are often associated with wells, rain, and rivers. In some cultures, they are also said to be capable of human speech. There is a widespread belief that earlier cartographers used the Latin phrase hic sunt dracones, i.e. ""Here be dragons"" to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the infrequent medieval practice of putting sea serpents and other mythological creatures in blank areas of maps. However the only known use of this phrase is in the Latin form ""HC SVNT DRACONES"" on the Lenox Globe (ca. 1503-07).",1425952171

There have been a lot of books published in the last few years that are basically lists of other books as introduced and recommended by various people, and some of them can be quite useful for the beginner.  Michael Dirda's *[Classics for Pleasure](http://www.amazon.com/Classics-Pleasure-Michael-Dirda/dp/0156033852)* would be a good place to start.  He has written a number of other books along the same sort of lines, too ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/Bound-Please-Extraordinary-One-Education/dp/0393329631/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b) might also be of interest), but *Classics for Pleasure* has been very well-received.

Paradoxically, I'd recommend *against* tackling the classics themselves from the very start.  One of the reasons they're classics in the first place is because they're advanced examples of the craft of writing, and for someone not used to reading for the pleasure of that craft rather than for other reasons (which I'll mention in a moment), they can be quite daunting.  Your whole project would probably collapse at the outset if you just picked up some Dostoevsky or Flaubert and hoped for the best.

That said, love of the craft isn't the only reason people read, and your understanding of that craft will mature and grow like any other faculty.  Some people read to pass the time or to escape from a more mundane life.  Some read for a love of incident; that is, they like to read about things happening, and favour books that have strong narratives (sometimes at the cost of description) and exciting things going on in them.  I guess the most reductive example of this would be something like a Dan Brown novel, of which type of book it is so often said that ""it really moves along.""  I use this as a familiar example, but you shouldn't take it to mean that enjoying incident in your books is a bad thing.  It's not the same as enjoying the craft, but it's not necessarily worse; it just means that people who love a Danielle Steele novel and people who love Tolstoy are loving these works in different ways.

Anyway, here's a list of ten enjoyable, non-threatening, small- to mid-length books that combine craft and incident under one cover:

1. George Orwell - *Animal Farm*: An interesting refiguration of totalitarian thinking in terms of farm animals.  Short and sweet, and certainly quite sad.

2. Alexander Solzhenitsyn - *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*: A short novel recounting a day in the life of a prisoner in a Soviet Gulag.  It's a brutal and intriguing work, but quite easy to get through. 

3. J.R.R. Tolkien - *The Hobbit*: A reasonably straightforward story of fantasy and adventure.  It's very good, and if you find you really like it you can then graduate to the much more elaborate endeavour that is the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.

4. Max Brooks - *World War Z*: A series of fictional interviews with survivors of the great zombie war.  If you don't like zombies it won't really be your thing, I'm afraid, but if you *do* like zombies there is pretty much literally no better book to read.  It is by turns hilarious and heartbreaking, and contains some interesting meditations on questions of societal structure and military theory.  It's a bestseller for a reason.

5. C.S. Forester - *The African Queen*: In which a gin-soaked tugboat pilot takes a very prim missionary woman down an African river while trying to avoid - and then attack - the German forces that surround them (it's set during the First World War).  It's a funny and exciting book, and was made into an equally great movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn.  

6. John Steinbeck - *The Moon is Down*: A novella in which an unnamed European town is occupied by unnamed totalitarian forces.  The book chronicles what happens to the townspeople as a result, how they resist, how they compromise, and so on.  Written in 1942, this would become Steinbeck's most notable contribution to the war effort.  It became a runaway success in occupied Europe, and was widely distributed there in underground translations.  It's very good.

7. Orson Scott Card - *Ender's Game*: A classic of modern science fiction about (among other things) a child genius in training to conduct a war against an alien race.  There are numerous subplots and many interesting ideas under consideration, and for sci-fi it is thankfully not especially predicated on the technology involved (though there is a lot of neat stuff).  It's more about characters and concepts than spaceships.

8. William Golding - *The Lord of the Flies*: A monstrous little tale of societal breakdown.  A tropical island full of stranded schoolchildren degenerates into a savage tribal bloodbath.  

9. G.K. Chesterton - *The Napoleon of Notting Hill*: A delightful and utterly bizarre little novel in which the King of England in the then-distant future (1984; the book was written in 1904) re-establishes the medieval boroughs and heraldry and clothing as a joke.  But one man does not see that it is a joke, and when some developers want to tear down his home to build a new road, his furious resistance ignites a civil war that consumes all of London.  It's a very funny book, but it's also full of epic grandeur and street battles and whatnot.

10. Edwin A. Abbott - *Flatland*: A strange novella in which Mr. A. Square, a resident of Flatland (a plane existing in only two dimensions), describes the astonishing consequences of being introduced to the world of the third dimension.  It also has a lot of fun side notes about the socio-political makeup of Flatland, and it makes for a quick read once you get used to the slightly antiquated style.

You might also consider the works of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, two English writers who deliver a lot of fun ideas under the guise of satire and adventure.  Adams is best if you like sci-fi, while Pratchett is more in the fantasy section, but they're both quite good and accessible.

I hope some of this will prove useful to you.  Reading can be a most enjoyable pleasure, and a profitable one besides.  Good luck with your beginning.",1425952215

One should remember that Venezuela is a deeply divided society.

These have very different opinions and interests from the mostly native majority. The two groups tend to clash, since many of their positions are so opposed.

I've often seen the question: ""why did he hate jews""? ""What led to this event?"" and so fourth.

The jews was hated or disliked in most of europe for very simple reasons:

* they lived in closed societies inside a society.
* they had there own rules (not laws of course).
* the didn't mix well with the general population.
* they had a religion, culture and language nobody outside the society understood.

That made them a very easy target for hatred and pointing fingers at one group, can help unify a country, by banging on the national drum. (something I do unfortunately experience at the moment)

They had much the same status as gipsies have today, except they did succeed in building business and trade, but it was more or less the only ""side"", the rest of the society saw. To a small degree we still have some of those clusters today, but they are of course much more open.

When we talk about Hitler as a atheist, you have to remember that most hardcore religious can't understand evolution or the difference of eugenics! I guess this is the main point.. or they simple don't and won't understand.

Actually if Hitler didn't like religion at all, then I guess more than jews would have been killed? I mean most German at that time must have considered themselves christians and a lot of the fathers? or reverend? supported Hitler (because its was the only way they could keep their positions). So I would rather think of Hitler as a ravening christian than atheist, although none of us can be sure.

The real reason to this debate is more based in the rejection of evolution in america and perhaps a natural lack of understanding German cultures? *not that I point fingers* But its easy to say every saudi is a ticking time bomb, if your audience no nothing about Saudis..",1425952257

Of course that doesn't mean you can't be a good person and an atheist. Nazism is based upon the philosophy of Nietzsche, who said God is dead, and should be replaced by the ubermensch, who will be the new meaning of the earth. In Beyond Good and Evil he wanted a racial caste dominating Europe and from there the world, and that there will be great suffering and experiments in human breeding to 'improve' the human race. The anti-semitic focus of this was the Nazi's own creation though, I think.

The Nazis had plans to completely extirpate Christianity once they had won the war, because as George Orwell said, the Christian ethical code is the antithesis of fascism and threatens them. A 'Christian Hitler' would not plan for this, obviously. Having said that, lots of Germans were Christians and so Hitler and the Nazis of course tried to use this and subvert Christianity into the worshipping of an Aryan Jesus etc. Napolean tried to use religion in the same way.

In all seriousness, how can you *actually* fight a war over forgiveness? It's an impossibility. If you're fighting a war in the name of religion based upon peace and love it's a safe bet if there were no religion you'd just find another excuse.

The fact remains no country in which you would want to live has ever been built upon atheism. Atheism always leads to power-worship in the real world.

I think a lot of people on here confuse the corrupt, politicized churches with Christianity, and are put off by right-wing nuts in the US who say they are Christian, and take *their* interpretation to be the religion itself.

I admit it, it is beyond my ability to grasp the idea that foreign law should have any part in interpreting our constitution.

So while the author admits that it's beyond his ability to grasp the concept, he has no qualms calling Ginsburg's opinion asinine? Typical.

First, the essential inquiry in Due Process jurisprudence is whether a right is fundamental. If a right is deemed fundamental by the court, then the S.Ct. uses the ""strict scrutiny"" test in which nearly every statute or administrative regulation is struck down as unconstitutional. If a right is not deemed fundamental, then the court uses the ""rational basis"" test in which nearly every statute or administrative reg. is upheld.

The question of whether a right is 'fundamental' is not an easy task. Not every fundamental right was listed in the Bill of Rights, or elsewhere in the Constitution. Generally, to determine how fundamental a right is, the court looks at a number of things. First, they look at the perceived right's place throughout our country's history. The look at laws and case law from the late 18th and 19th centuries; how the laws were written, how they were interpreted, and how they were applied. Because this country is only a few hundred years old, sometimes the justices find it necessary to examine the ""right's"" origins in Europe.

The only cases in which I've seen the Court examine European law or tradition have been in this arena; the examination of the origin of rights. 

The author's faux outrage is predicated on a false assumption, or a poor understanding of what the S.Ct. actually does. Justices on the Court are not using international law to ""interpret"" the Constitution per se. They use it as a set of ""guideposts"" (their term) to help them determine what rights, not specifically enumerated, are guaranteed by the document.",1425952291

That's not quite what she says. If you take it as two parts, first, establishing an 'anti-europeanism'

&gt; what Mr Obama has succeeded in demonstrating to his own nation is that no amount of charm and flattery, no degree of self-abasement and apology for American ""arrogance"" is going to get any meaningful reciprocity from the Old Europeans (which is to say France and Germany, and the EU which they dominate)

&gt;It is only now America has stopped swaggering that its more erudite, socially acceptable commentators have begun to engage in vitriolic condemnation of European selfishness and irresponsibility in the face of international danger: what is emerging is, in effect, a mirror image of the anti-Americanism which has become commonplace among European intellectuals.

Then considering how that might be applied to domestic USA politcs:

&gt;if the White House military strategy in Afghanistan fails, or there is another major al-Qaeda terrorist success, it will be very useful to be able to point to the pusillanimous refusal of France and Germany to offer any significant contribution to what Mr Obama does not call (out of deference to European sensibilities) the War on Terror.

&gt;If he cannot deliver economic recovery, he can summon up the ghosts of the G20 who failed to provide him with the stimulus package he demanded and declare that while he approached them with a full heart and an open mind, they sent him home with empty hands. He would not be the first American leader to exculpate himself by declaring that the world had let him down.

&gt;Just as anti-Americanism serves a particular indispensable political purpose in Europe (and in Britain) as a bonding measure for the Left, so anti-Europeanism will come to have a valuable function for the Left in America. It will be Europe's fault if the dreams of the Obama administration cannot be fulfilled: if universal healthcare is not deliverable, it will be because the US has had to foot the entire bill of defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan.

There's also the lack of proper religious education.  People want easy answers, and they don't care if that means they have to ignore reality.  This, in turn, leads to stupid situations where the popular gods stand against logic and reason.  A bit of this is due to the tolerance for religious innovation that the United States has nurtured through its history, though it is hardly alone.  Let's face it: Christian groups that are readily accepted here would have been condemned as heretics in continental Europe when they arose (I'm looking in particular at the Millerite and Pentecostal groups).

There's also the issue of the fact that many religious groups present older, more restrictive systems of ethics and morality, which aren't as appealing as the more libertine systems that philosophers have created without the existence of God.  As such, we as religious people either wind up in the position of moralizers, shouting *""O tempora o mores!""*[1] at the masses, or as people unconcerned with the world, damning it to Hell with our indifference.  The former does not win friends amongst the populace, and can even border on the unacceptably bigoted in the most extreme cases.  The latter makes a mockery of our beliefs.  I don't know about everyone, but I'm personally unsatisfied with those options.

1. For those who never took Latin, that's Cicero, a hypocrite of such proportions that he is unrivaled in that arena even today.  He was a bit of a douche, and successfully defended his douchebaggery to the Roman Senate in a series of speeches known as the Cataline Orations.  The speeches alone got him off the hook and have caused him to be lionized by classics professors over the millennia--he comes off as totally awesome in Latin.

I agree that the vast majority of Somalis want piracy and the current anarchy as much as they want starvation and plague. But piracy and starvation and rival thugs is what Somalia has, and it has it because there has never been a true Somali nation. Going back a thousand years, before Europeans began colonizing and meddling there, Somalia was a region of clans. The clans (much like tribes) traded and enjoyed prosperity, and also fought rival clans for control of areas and trade. There was no Somalia nation then and there is no Somalia nation now. Nation is a western concept that has never fit the Somalia region.

Sure, Somalis would rather see ships coming and going in Somali ports in the import and export of goods. But that is not possible in the warring clans environment of Somalia, so piracy (and local kidnapping and extortion) is accepted as an alternate form of trade. As the Somalis have for thousands of years, they do whatever they have to do to survive.

Piracy in Somalia: An Act of Terrorism or a Territorial Defense Mechanism?
WardheerNews Editorial
Dec 7 , 2008

Lately, the western media has particularly focused on stories of the
Somalia piracy, which in effect has received more coverage than the
often-talked clan conflicts, or the ever-growing muscle of the Youth
fundamentalist group Al-Shabab that hostage the fate of the Somali
people. 

Armed with speed boats and sophisticated light arms, Somali pirates,
overtly supported by local and regional authorities, have undoubtedly
enabled the highly effective and organized piracy to go on the Indian
Ocean and disrupt a key shipping line and a transit corridor for ""20
percent of world's oil"" supply without any signs of slowing down.

To date, the Somalia piracy covers a large area on the Indian Ocean
stretching between the Red Sea and the coast of Kenya. So far over 15
ships and close to 400 hostages have fallen victim to this enterprise.

The West has yet to fully understand the growing phenomenon of Somalia
piracy.  The most common view in the west summarily dismisses the whole
piracy enterprise in the Somalia coast as a banditry, opportunist and
criminal cartel that feeds on the vacuum created by the demise of the
Somalia state.  Some even brand it as “terrorism.”

But a more comprehensive view, often held by those who know Somalia
well, persuasively explains it in terms of Somali's national interest,
whatever that is, and the protection and preservation of that nation’s
marine resources.  The kidnapping and abduction of ships and boats
within the boundaries of the internationally recognized waters of
Somalia, which is where most piracy took place, maintains this view
point, is in essence a form of loosely organized national defense
mechanism of what legally belongs to Somalia.

WardherNews conducted an unscientific survey and called its regular
focus groups (two groups with each consisting of 15 Somali citizens) to
gauge the collective opinion on the piracy in Somalia.  About 70 percent
of those who participated in our sampling strongly viewed the piracy as
a form of crude, primitive, if you will, national defense of the
country’s territorial waters.  

Almost all of those participated in the focus groups agreed that with
the absence of any meaningful national defense system (Somalia has not
had its own government for the last 17 years), any protection to their
territorial waters from violators is dubbed as “people defending their
God-given"" natural marine resources.  Despite that piracy is illegal
internationally, most Somalis seem to agree that it is the only way
available to protect what is left off of the Somali national existence. 

Since 2000, commercial ships have illegally fished in Somali waters and
dumped nuclear waste materials and urban refuse from EU countries (in
particular European based Mafiosi companies that have a long history of
illegal dumping of radioactive and waste materials) with impunity.  By
some accounts, Somalia’s rare corral ecosystem has been damaged beyond
repair, thus risking the loss of fish and marine resources for good.
This is a fact that both Western countries, their one-track minded
journalists and the United Nations Organization are well aware of, yet
chose to remain silent and oblivious to the complaints registered by
Somalis 

Piracy is not that uncommon in societies where the national state is
either weak or non-existent.  For example, during the revolutionary war
of America, George Washington and the founding fathers strategically
commissioned pirates to protect the nation’s waters.  For that America
of 1776, involved in a bitter war with a disproportionately more
powerful Britain, there was no other way for George Washington and the
revolutionary leadership to protect the territorial waters of the
nation.  Despite that Britain dismissed the commissioned pirates as
banditry and criminals, Americans in general viewed their pirate militia
as volunteer sons and daughters responding to a call for a higher
purpose.

When observed closely, it appears a parallel reality is taking place in
Somalia.  Regional governments are implicitly supporting the piracy in
the Indian Ocean; some of the ransoms so far paid, as much as $150
million by some estimates, is trickling down to the region’s mainland
residents and authorities. In return, the militia who is conducting the
piracy are getting protection and are being welcomed by their
communities. How else can one explain that a disorganized pirate group
can successfully abduct a tanker like the Sirus Star carrying crude oil
worth of over $100 million or a first class ship carrying Russian-made
T72 tanks? 

Neither the West nor the rest of the world have any sway or an effective
channel of communication with the abductors, thus leaving the respective
owners of the ships abducted to directly negotiate with the pirates. But
here comes a freelance interlocutor in the person of Michelle Ballarin.
Ballarin, an American business women based in Virginia, notes that “she
is trying to market a solution for failed states through Black Star,” a
private “fortune soldier” type army. She proposed that she would train
500 Somali seafarers to patrol their own waters and discourage locals
from turning to piracy. Call this clarion call a charlatan call coming
from someone who understands less about the complex Somalia problem than
about making business venture.

The Somalia piracy is part and parcel of the larger crisis resulting
from the failed Somali state and the negligent and hands-off attitude of
the world community.  Neither a band aid approach, like the one
suggested by the Virginia millionaire, Ballarin, nor organizing more
aggressive military actions, like the proposed naval blockade touted by
the current Newsweek article, could be a solution to the Somalia piracy
crisis.  As a matter of fact Newsweek’s suggestion of military blockade
would prove to be more disruptive to this key transit corridor.

WardheerNews believes that the real solution lays on-shore. Short of
reinstating the Somali nation state would successfully solve either the
piracy problem at hand or larger terrorist activities which lately
became a main stay in Somalia. The world community must articulate a
comprehensive strategy to stop the piracy in Somalia without further
violating the territorial integrity of Somalia.

Heres something you can get your teeth into.

**UN report:** 22% of Palestinian children under five are suffering from malnutrition—a three-fold increase from 2000. * 9.3% suffer acute malnutrition—an eight-fold increase from 2000. 15.6% suffer acute anemia, which can lead to permanent impairment of physical and mental development. Food consumption has fallen 30% per capita; 60% of Palestinian households now live in acute poverty; and 50% are dependent on international food aid.

**British Medical Journal:** A 2004 field study published in the British Medical Journal reported that, in the previous four years, ""Two-thirds of the 621 children . . . killed [by the Israelis] at checkpoints . . . on the way to school, in their homes, died from small arms fire, directed in over half the cases to the head, neck and chest - the sniper's wound."" A quarter of Palestinian infants under the age of five are acutely or chronically malnourished. The Israeli wall ""will isolate 97 primary health clinics and 11 hospitals from the populations they serve.""

**USAid Report:** The report, by the US Agency for International Development, showed more than one-fifth of young Palestinian children are malnourished. This is more than a threefold increase since the last study two years ago. The plight of children under 5 years of age was particularly alarming. Twenty-two percent of Palestinian children under age 5 were malnourished, up from seven percent in an agency survey two years ago. Of that number, nine percent suffered from acute malnutrition—resulting from poor nutrition over the short term—and 13 percent suffered from chronic malnutrition—longer-term deficiencies that can result in stunted growth. About 20 percent of children under 5 had some form of anaemia.

**The Red Cross Report:**The Israeli blockade of Gaza has led to a steady rise in chronic malnutrition among the 1.5 million people living in the strip, according to a leaked report from the Red Cross. It chronicles the ""devastating"" effect of the siege that Israel imposed after Hamas seized control in June 2007 and notes that the dramatic fall in living standards has triggered a shift in diet that will damage the long-term health of those living in Gaza and has led to alarming deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and vitamin D.

**European Union Report:** The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: ""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"". The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that “in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”

**Israels attiutde.** ""The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet,"" jokes Dov Weisglass, Olmert adviser.

Yes.  However there are trade-offs:

Standard design means that useful new technology often isn't used.  This is itself a trade-off, quantity means lower prices, and you can see what broke elsewhere and inspect/replace that part before it breaks.

When you don't design for the limitations of your site, then either you design includes construction of things that you really don't need, or you can't build everywhere.  On the one hand you have things like cooling designed for the hottest desert even though you never have to deal with those temps. On the other you have a design that can only be used when there is plenty of cheap cooling water, meaning deserts can't get your plant.

If you don't account for the needs of the utility, the utility needs to figure out what to do with the excess power if they need 75% of the power a standard design puts out.   

Again, this is all about trade-offs.   The disadvantages are large enough that ""the NRC, vendors, and utilities want to eliminate this for any future construction.""  However lets not overlook them.",1425952655

One of my professors here in the States was something of a linguistic historian, he wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the subject of what the Japanese language was called at various times through the Meiji period.  So I got an early introduction to the subject.

On an interesting side note, if you watch My Neighbor Totoro you can see that, when the kids are working on their kanji, the textbooks are marked 国語 (kokugo), not 日本語 (nihongo).

As for Japan, traditions, etc.  Who knows?

Yes, some, but by no means all, of the younger generation is less traditional.  OTOH, while 60% of Japanese self identify as atheists, I think that to a very large extent being Japanese is something of the national religion.

Even the more liberal/young/weird of Japanese tend to buy into the mentality that there is something unique, different, that makes the Japanese special.  Books on the topic of why the Japanese are unique are published every year and routinely hit the bestseller list.

This is not, by the way, to say that individual Japanese aren't nice, friendly, and open to friendship with gaijin.  Or even to say that Japan, as a whole, will treat you like shit if you're a foreigner; they won't.  I liked my stay, I'd go back again.  But there is never any question of fitting in, or being wholly accepted, you can't and you won't be.

Most of the younger generation is politically apathetic.  Voting age, along with legal adulthood, happens at 20, but most people in the 20-25 range report that they don't vote, and they don't think their friends their age should vote, because they're too immature.  There are whole books on the topic of the extended Japanese childhood, and how that applies to the concept of 甘え, amae [1], and how that interacts with voting, and political activity.

This isn't to say that many Japanese customs aren't changing, and that young Japanese aren't more progressive than their elders.  But Japan, including the younger Japanese, is still very much devoted to the idea of Japan as a unique, almost holy, thing.

Don't expect any major upheavals in Japanese society is what I'm saying.  Gradual change, yes, but I think it'll be a while before we see any significant changes.

Mind, I'm a historian, my knowledge of modern Japanese sociology is based on living there for a little bit and talking to a lot of college age Japanese, plus some books on Japanese sociology for the layman.  If there are any Japanese sociologists out there who'd care to correct me I'd appreciate it.

[1] The concept of dependence on others which is expected in children, and to an extent in adults.  To a very large extent Japanese children are not, as European/American children are, expected or encouraged to be independent from an early age.  Instead there is a tendency to encourage dependence.

Anyway, even if we are going to assume that I own my body - how does that translate to property being a natural right? Its not like your average capitalist is mixing his labor with the businesses that he owns controlling shares in..

&gt;It is the individual that transforms nature or, equivalently, the individual that is the first ""appropriator"" of nature. If a piece of land is uncontrolled and unowned, then the first person there is the rightful owner. This is how property rights were formed.

Okay, so the Native Americans own the entire continent then.  In that case, we should probably all just up and return to Europe (correction, the Middle East - the Celts own Europe).

&gt; The canal nets Egypt billions of dollars a year, a revenue source second only to tourism. A strike on a ship crossing it would be a dizzying blow to Egypt's economy, President Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country's standing in the Arab world and its own national pride. Tourism would also experience a steep drop if Egypt became perceived as a country which cannot maintain its internal security.

That was the easy one because it is so easy to point to.

The second difference I have is with calling the US system the most (difficult) system. In the EU any job must be advertised for 6 months in the EU and the employer must prove that there is no EU citizen that could do it. (IMHO that was a strong force for the addition of eastern Europe freeing a flood of cheap labor.)

How can you possible own that which you are?

Well, by ""ownership"" I mean *exercises control*.  Ownership ultimately stems from the application of consciousness to all reality external to consciousness.

You're right, it's somewhat unintuitive to consider a person's body as anything but ""who they are"", but the considerations becomes easy to see once you compare slavery with freedom.  What is the difference between the two ideas?  The difference of course stems from answering the question ""who is controlling person A's body""?  Is it person A, or is it person B?

A somewhat happy result from thinking that the result is unintuitive, i.e. that it makes little sense to say that you own what you are, actually is a direct result of it being a natural property or natural right.  In many cases, the most obvious way of thinking about something is not considered, because people think a priori that the real answer has to be ""complicated"".  Sometimes the answer is staring at you in the face.  

Evolution is one such answer.  For many thousands of years, mankind came up with all sorts of complicated stories of creation, of who did what to who, where, and when.  All throughout those thousands of years, the answer was right there all along.  It didn't take advanced technology to come up with the idea of natural selection.  It simply took courage and simplicity of thought.  Natural law is found in the same way.

&gt;Anyway, even if we are going to assume that I own my body - how does that translate to property being a natural right? Its not like your average capitalist is mixing his labor with the businesses that he owns controlling shares in..

I knew these kinds of questions would be raised.

The answer to your question is that you have to go back in time and then from there look at what transpired.  For example, in the place where you are now sitting, at one time that piece of land must have been devoid of any human interaction.  For many thousands of years, the piece of land you are now sitting on was not controlled/owned by any person.  

It must also be true that at one point, there must have been a first explorer, and this one explorer was the very first owner of that land.  Nobody else could have been be the legitimate initial owner because millions of people cannot touch one piece of land all at the same time.

So that first person owned the land, and thus became the controller of all the natural resources under and on that land.

Now, this first owner of the land must have traded it to another person, voluntarily.  The right to own the land thus transferred from person to person over time, and eventually it got transferred to you or the owner of the land that you now rent from.

Of course there may have been a time where ownership of the land was transferred by force or violence, but from your perspective, it makes no difference because you are the owner now.  The only way your ownership would be illegitimate would be if you used force to gain the land, or if the owner you rent from used violence.  Legitimate ownership, as I said in my previous post, must be based on peace and non-aggression.

As for your proposal about capitalists mixing his labor with the business, you have to consider property title transfers.  A capitalist *purchases* factors of production like materials, fuel, land, and machinery.  Those goods are his because he traded for them with the previous owner, who himself owned the factors of production that went into producing his final goods, which are now factors of production for the capitalist you are talking about.  

For example, consider a show factory.  The capitalists of the shoe factory own the materials for making shoes, for example rubber, lace, and cloth.  The capitalist owns these factors because he bought them from the previous owners, i.e. the maker of rubber, lace, and cloth.  And so on back to raw materials, back to mines, whose owners bought the land from whoever owned it previous to them, and so on, back in time.

Now, in the production process, a capitalist takes his factors of production that he owns, and pays other people to *help* him produce final product.  The trade between the capitalists and the workers is not labor for goods, it is labor for wages.  For the goods belong to the capitalists, as the materials were originally their property.

&gt;Okay, so the Native Americans own the entire continent then. In that case, we should probably all just up and return to Europe (correction, the Middle East - the Celts own Europe).

No, not really, because Native Americans didn't occupy the entire continent.  They lived in sparse areas.  I am not denying that some colonists used violence to gain ownership of land, but in the majority of cases, the colonists paid the natives, which means the ownership transfer was legitimate.  Since the transfer (violent or peaceful) occurred so long ago, the biological offspring of the original natives have no legitimate right to the land.  A bloodline dating back 4 centuries cannot reasonably be basis for obliterating 3.9 centuries of legitimate ownership transfer.  

In economic competition, i.e. in the free market, once land is privately owned, then landowners no longer have a permanent stake in the land.  For if someone owns a piece of land, not only will he have an incentive to accept an offer to sell his land if the price is high enough, but also if he borrows to gain ownership of the land, which is the majority of cases, he is going to have to be productive himself if he is going to keep it.

For example, an entrepreneur could borrow money to buy a piece of land so that he can build a farm.  If he does not utilize the land well enough in the economic sense, i.e. if he cannot produce goods using the land and sell them for prices that people are willing to pay, then he is going to have to foreclose his property and the ownership title gets put into another person's hands.

In this sense, economic competition will result in the most productive people owning the land, and nobody is safe.  Nobody can just sit back and just sit on it, unless they use the land for consumption purposes, which again, would not persist if others are willing to pay a high enough price to buy it.  If nobody is willing to pay a high enough price, it is because the land is not wanted by anyone else.  The market price will clear the market for land, but again, this is true only if there is economic competition, i.e. capitalism.

It's not ""their money"".  You make the fallacy again.  They made what they have with the aid of society, and society takes some of what they have.

&gt;But if you take too much of their money they will just stop working and become a drain on the system you want them to support. And the more you try to help people with other people's money, the more people choose to game the system instead of contributing.

Baseless assertion.  There are countries that have enormously high tax rates on certain brackets.  At one point our highest tax rate was 90%.  That was during the 60s, a period of enormous growth for us.  European countries, despite the myths Republican feed you, aren't cesspools of laziness.  Their growth rates are fine.  It's not as simple as you libertarians make it out to be, and it's not true just because you say it is.

&gt;So why is it okay to take other people's money to effectively help people who won't help themselves?

False assumption: who is not helping themselves?  Let me ask an equally disingenuous question: ""Why is it okay to let people who lie and steal and cheat others to keep their ill-gotten gains?""  See, loaded and unfair questions are fun!

&gt;It says that how we have what we have is from people working to better themselves, not the people around them. 

Regardless of why the other people did what they did, you aren't succeeding or failing solely on your own efforts.  Your efforts are combined with society's efforts and knowledge.  You have what you have because of other people; ergo, it's not all yours.  

Of course people are selfish and will cheat at any opportunity.  That's an argument *against libertarianism*.  Your co-op example is an example of why libertarianism won't work: people fuck each other as much as they can without rules.  Hence we need a government.  Thanks for making my point for me.  Good example.

&gt;If you can't get people who actually believe in co-operative living to stop being so selfish for the good of the community, how are you going to get that to work in a larger society that doesn't hold those ideals?

Oh, this makes me laugh!  Yes, this is a major criticism of libertarianism, except with libertarianism there isn't even the facade of cooperation.  People are outright trying to destroy each other from the beginning.

We spent a decade having browsers be useful rather than pedantically correct, and all it got us was a decade of shitty HTML, invalid tag-soup markup, bloated, over-complicated rendering engines, hideous, hacky code and a generation of developers who didn't understand why the code they were shitting out onto the net was fundamentally broken, and useless for anything other than they originally intended it for (things they didn't intend it for include automatic translation, search engine indexing, etc, etc, etc).

Finally (with HTML/CSS validation and DOCTYPE sniffing) we're slowly moving back towards valid, standards-following code, and as a result web development, automatic code-parsing and browser-writing in general is getting a *hell* of a lot easier.

I hear your plea for [DWIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM), but I raise you ""encouraging unsustainable, inflexible development practices in an entire generation of developers"".

I'm speaking as someone who spends a good deal of their life cleaning up other people's shat-out code, and explaining to clients who've spent years hacking a site to pieces with Frontpage or Dreamweaver WYSIWYG editing why it would actually be faster to *redevelop their entire site from scratch* then to make a non-trivial modification to the existing site code (complete with quirks mode, browser-sniffing, CSS browser-hacks, unclosed/improperly-closed divs, &lt;overlapping&gt; &lt;html&gt; tags &lt;/overlapping&gt; &lt;/html&gt;, etc).

&gt; That's just punishing you the user so that a Firefox developer can make a pedantic point.

Actually, no.  That's encouraging the server administrator to do their job properly, or encouraging the user to move to another host who will.

To be fair, I'm not suggesting it works particularly *well*, but what you're characterising as smug, pedantic bloody-mindedness is actually part of a concerted, industry-wide shift back towards professionalism, instead of tolerating/encouraging pathetic, half-arsed amateurism (which *almost inevitably* comes back to bite you in the arse at some point).

Workarounds breed workarounds, bugs and security holes.  For example, rather than trusting the MIMEtype or the extension, sniffing the first 256 bytes of a file to determine the type probably seemed like a good idea at the time... except it caused [a glaring security hole in IE](http://www.h-online.com/security/Risky-MIME-sniffing-in-Internet-Explorer--/features/112589).

Other, more pedantic browsers don't suffer from this, and while it might be lovely for IE to Just Work in slightly more situations, I don't want it to Just Work when the Work it's doing is ""handing my online bank login credentials to anonymous eastern-European criminals"", or the like.

&gt; I'm trying to make a little tiny utility as a favor to anonymous web dude. I'm not going to buy a cert for that.

Good for you.  But *personally*, since you obviously have little understanding of security (for example, why self-signed certs aren't worth the electrons they're composed of), I'm just glad you were forced to do the right thing rather than dismiss what you don't understand and half-arse it.

Think about it like this: you didn't understand the subject area, and instead of half-arsing it and whacking it up on the net, you had to learn about signed scripts and acquire a non-self-signed cert before your app would work.

Now imagine you were a corporate drone writing your bank's online banking app.  Still unhappy that you were forced to certify your code?

Or would you rather your bank details were left available for anyone who wanted them because some uneducated outsourced contract programmer (like yourself) didn't know enough to do the right thing without being forced to?

Incidentally, if you don't think this would happen, you haven't worked on a lot of Enterprise software.

&gt; Users of my little utility should be able to decide for themselves if they trust me.

A noble sentiment, but one which has directly and irrevocably lead to a world full of malware, browser toolbars, viruses, spyware, trojans and irritating little ""desktop buddies"".

We're basically contrasting the Unix vs. Windows methods of security - put in place strict controls which prevent nothing, but require you to know what you're doing before acting, or allow clueless users to do whatever they like, and at best just *ask* them a horribly technical question they're fundamentally unqualified to answer prior to letting them shoot themselves squarely in the foot.

On of these models has lead to a relatively-secure system which is widely respected for being hard to break into.  The other has lead to a sprawling, insecure mess full of trojans, malware, viruses and confused-as-hell users who assumed their system would stop them before they unwittingly mailed their passwords and bank credentials to Russian hackers.

Face it - allowing the user to choose what they trust has *failed miserably*, and is slowly being replaced with strict controls (which knowledgeable users can still turn off) for this very reason.

Put it like this: when I buy a house or a car I'd rather it had locks on the doors, and they were locked.  If I want to I can always unlock them (or talk someone else through doing it), or even remove them altogether and let anyone who wants-to wander around inside.

However, by default, when non-locksmiths purchase the house or car, they're *safe by default.*

Your problem here is that you're trying to talk an uneducated user through an operation which should *only be attempted* by someone who knows what they're doing and understands and appreciates the risks.

That's also the precise use-case with malware, trojans and all other manner of nasties.

Unsurprisingly, you're having trouble.

&gt; Users of my little utility should be able to decide for themselves if they trust me. But instead of just being able to make that decision and click a button, they have to follow arcane instructions about using about:config, and then click a button.

The idea is to make it confusing, so that only technically-adept people who know what they're doing attempt it, and developers do it *properly* (signed scripts, etc) if they're trying to appeal to normal (uneducated users).

Although you might have a good one-off reason for what you're doing, *what you're doing is indistinguishable from malware*... and since malware is a recognised, serious global problem, it's not surprising that browsers are trying to make your life harder.

By analogy:

&gt; ""I should be able to carry whatever I want wherever I want.  I have *very good personal reasons* for wanting to carry this pound of semtex through airport security, but *unbelievably* the fuckers are trying to stop me, or require extra paperwork before I'm allowed on a plane with it!  And they're only doing it because of an irrational feeling of pedantic smugness, the fuckers.""

Uh... no.  There are *bloody good reasons* for pretty much everything you're complaining about, many of which (respecting MIME-types, signing scripts) are simply good, safe design, and some of which (disregarding self-signed certs, not trusting the average user to act in their own best interests) have only been learned through years of hard-won, painful experience.

&gt; That's too insecure, but at least it's not pedantic security theater.

FYI, security theatre means ""anything that increases the illusion of security without providing the substance of it"", not ""things which have *proven* necessary over a decade or more of real-world usage, but which I - without being particularly well educated on the subject - don't personally understand"".",1425953036

The results of food production then is either put into meat production (greatly increasing the effort to produce the same nutrition value) or exported.

The food production has problems not because the plants are not producing enough, but because the humans are changing the ecosystem in such a way the the production sinks. Often natural effects also play a role. It is also not a good idea to let humans reproduce with the current rate and think that there is enough food, water, energy and other resources if we only add more technology.

The social implications are, in my opinion, overstated and (in most of these stories) slanted towards creating a fearful image of a Europe fully under the control of sharia, European women wearing burqas and all. I think that's silly nonsense. Puritanism is not just a muslim trait, we've gone through our own dark ages and, really, you only have to go back to the fifties to take the western world back to a time where a lot of the same backwards thinking towards women and people of other faiths or races was the norm.

We westerners can think we're hot shit for being so ahead of this social curve, but it should tell us something about human nature and the reasons behind puritanism. We only managed to shed it by growing a middle class and letting it reach critical mass. These were mostly the effcts of industrialization, not of superior culture.

The point is that individualism is a really attractive proposition for those who can afford it. With nominally muslim individuals gaining a place for themselves in European societies, their own desire for freedom and individuality will grow. That's why you see plenty of middle class European muslims today taking a much less literal reading of things. Some of them drink alcohol. Most of them go out and woo women. Typical western stuff. But they believe in Allah. These people are not likely to welcome a Taliban state. In two generations, they'll be as secular as the rest of us.

Fundamentalism, be it in Christianity or Islam, is a form of rigor mortis of religion. It's an indication that the main stream of a religion has had to reconcile so much of it teachings with modern reality, that for some people it seems more honest to see the slippery slope and return to a literal truth of the faith. They know they're losing. This is just them putting fingers in their ears yelling 'La la la I can't hear you.'

I'm not big on ""Christian identity"" but they may have a point. This [essay on tribalism as a means to stop the Islamification of Europe](http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2009/02/pick-tribe-any-tribe.html) is worth reading:

&gt;Let me put it succinctly: if the BNP won two seats at the next general election, I would be delighted. If it won two hundred, I would emigrate. I view BNP support as playing a role similar to that of a price in a free-market economy, which is to say that I see it as a signal conveying a certain type of information. If the BNP were to be banned and its support therefore to disappear at the electoral level, this information would be lost to the system, easing the pressure on the establishment parties to formulate a real response to Islamization, which I fervently hope they will eventually do. Lamenting the advances of nativist groups at this level would be like lamenting a rise in the price in oil when demand grows more quickly than supply. That said, given my beliefs about the gap between the true ideological commitments of the BNP leadership and the motivations of those who vote for it, it is impossible for me to avoid the conclusion that it would be a disaster for it to obtain real power.

&gt;Regardless of whether readers agree or disagree with my reading of this particular matter, I consider an emphasis on a system-level analysis important if we are not to allow knee-jerk reactions to some aspects of tribalism blind us to the essential role it must play in allowing us to oppose Islam. To those who think I am making all of this sound very simple and inoffensive, let me acknowledge in closing that reality is sure to diverge from the most optimistic predictions of any of us. I have serious doubts as to whether a tribalism that reemerges to defend against threats its former self would have preempted without difficulty will have either the opportunity or the inclination to brook much opposition from other tribes, especially on what it will consider, with no small justification, to be home territory. To the extent that we believe tribalism has costs as well as benefits, both for ourselves and for others, it might be a good idea to start considering how to rein in the excesses some will inevitably push for when the rapidly heightening tension between Islam and the West, parasite and host, finally boils over into open conflict in our own countries.",1425953269

I think the more meditation, exercise, etc. that you do to increase your mental abilities to handle stress is probably good.

The good thing is probably t learn how to make more neuropeptide Y when you need it, but not produce it when you don't.

The 'combat-ready' soldiers probably don't know how to turn off their neuropeptide Y when they are at home and supposed to have a good time with the kids, the wife, etc.

It would be very interesting to study those people in those situations.  

Other people who have monotonous heart rates are people who have received heart transplants, and don't have their hearts wired up to their bodies well.  So it may be that neuropeptide Y 'shuts down' your emotions so they don't affect your heart very much, one way or another.

It is not a secret that laws have unintended consequences, but none of these discussions are about breaking the law.

One of the unintended consequences of this particular set of laws is that smaller companies *can't* afford this process.  As with many laws that put up paper barriers, it adversely impacts smaller companies dramatically more than larger companies.  Google can afford to have immigration ""fixers"".  Small tech firms have to do it themselves, and waste resources on figuring out the process and abiding by it.

You have to realize that *this* (""go through whatever motions are necessary to appease the US government and 'prove' that no qualified US Americans are available for the position"") is what is necessary to get a visa for someone with brown skin (Australians, folks from the UK, and several other developed European nations have special visa types that are easier to obtain and require far fewer hurdles; I work with an Australian whose process was dramatically less daunting than the Indian developers I know).  This is a process that assumes human beings are interchangeable cogs, when you may in fact be talking about the *only* person in the world with the knowledge and skills you need (the Australian I mentioned earlier is the only guy in the world with the experience needed for my company; he's worked on the same piece of Open Source software for over 11 years, and is the only developer who could possibly fill the position he holds).  Because the Australian process is simpler, the hoops are less daunting...but, if he were Indian or African or Asian, I would have to go through those hoops.  And, there would be nothing dishonest about it, even though we would have to place ads and deal with the process of proving that we couldn't hire someone else to fill the role.

You're talking about big bad corporations doing nasty things with *your* jobs, and I'm talking about real live human beings who are trying to build the best products and grow the US economy, despite the onerous rules and regulations and barriers put up by well-meaning, but poorly informed, bureaucrats.  There's a reason every tech company in the US wants more visas, and it's not because they want cheap talent (once someone comes to the US, they expect similar wages to their US-native peers, and they generally get it).  It's because the US is not producing enough great engineers to feed the world economies technology needs...if that technology can't be made here, it will be made somewhere else.  We will then lose all of those markets where we as a nation currently lead.  We have a culture that treats smart people like crap, so our kids don't follow those paths or want to have those kinds of jobs.  Until you figure out a way to fix that cultural problem, somebody has to fill those jobs...or, again, they will go somewhere else.  This isn't a case of, ""or they'll hire an American and everything will work out fine"".

The alternative is to accept that the US can't hold the lead in software anymore.  We'll fall to second or third or fourth place, and become like every other closed off society where the people choose to be big fish in a little pond over being big fish in the big pond of the world market.

1) Do I enjoy my job? Most of the time I enjoy my job. In order to pursue a career as problematic as ""musician"" you have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks. It HAS to be fun, or else you would pursue some other career which pays better. It's often fun to make music. Sometimes, however, it's not fun. I think about the jazz gig I did a few months back where everyone in the band fought with each other, at rehearsal and onstage. (I was a ringer.) There was no respect, loads of tension, and the music suffered. There are times where I have to play with people that are horrible to deal with on a personal level. (Musicians are not always fun and are sometimes socially awkward or even borderline sociopathic.) When it IS fun, for me the rest of the problems in life go away for a short time. Some people are so driven by music that they must pursue it; there's no choice about it for some of us. Some of us HAVE to. What else would we do? 

I chose to take the academic path and get a music degree. I recommend this path for a number of reasons. The first is that you can learn a tremendous amount about music and the way it works. I meet so many musicians who have absolutely no idea about the structure of music or its language, and yet they want to pursue music as a job. How can you work as a musician and not be able to speak the language fluently? Would you hire an IT person who didn't know code or HTML or Linux? Some musicians want to remain actively ignorant about the language they are working in. They may believe that if they lose the ethereal ambiguity of music, they lose the magic of playing and discovery. One friend tells me that every time he sits down to play it's always a mysterious voyage of discovery, and if he learned any music theory the magic would be lost, that he might as well just do math problems. Music theory is elitist, at least according to him. I cannot ever agree that knowledge is elitist. For me, knowledge is empowerment. My music education gives me the confidence to walk into any musical situation and be a functional participant. The other upside to pursuing an academic approach to music is that it gives you an upper-level degree. You can get a teaching job. Most working musicians I know have to teach at some point. There just aren't that many music jobs out there! Teaching pays the bills. Schools require a B.A or better in order to teach. Growing up, I had terrible music teachers who, for whatever reason, offered very little information on music theory, technique, or career options. I struggled through my teens and twenties without any good mentors, at least until college. Today, all of my students get a lot of information about music theory, technique on multiple instruments, instrument design and maintenance , live sound and recording, audio technology and electronics, history, career options, physics, and sometimes even the sociological and philosophical aspects of music. I think I'm helping them improve their lives.

I believe you have to be versatile in order to work continuously as a musician. It's not enough to know how to play an instrument. You have to read music. Sorry folks, it's the truth. I have to be able to interpret music that someone has written. I get jazz gigs, I play for musicals, I play in rock bands, I play pop music, I play classical, I play electronic music. Most of the time, people give me their songs in score form. Other times, people give me recordings to work from. I have worked to strengthen my listening skills and sense of pitch. One skill that has gotten me some work, or maybe even kept me on the job, is that I have learned to recognize pitch, rhythm, and chord progressions very fast. I got to tour Europe with a band because I was able to learn their entire set in a few hours. I believe that musicians should develop their listening and improvisational skills in order to work very fast. If it takes you days or even weeks to learn a piece of music, then why should people pay you? You have to show that you are necessary and needed. 

In addition to teaching and playing, I also went to school for recording and live sound, as well as digital technology. I worked as a soundman for many years, and I also worked as a recording engineer. I have had to be a stagehand and roadie too! There are many career paths in music, and many of them don't actually generate music. You have to pay the bills, right?

So, why do I do it? I love music. Of all the things that humanity has generated in our known history, I have decided that, aside from love and kindness, art is the best thing. I listen to an absurd amount of music, and I like a whole lot of it. The more I learn, the more my appreciation of music and art grows. Art and education almost always work for the betterment of society. Wars and politics seem to be working as a constant detriment to humanity. Though our current society undervalues it, music is, to me, one of the best things I could do that I could believe in. I also have fun making music when I like the music and the people I am working with. 

2) Is the pay sufficient? Sufficient for what? Do you need to be rich? You rarely get rich playing music. You get rich by working in the music industry. You luck out and become a pop star because you look good playing music. You manage to get a good contract that doesn't force you to move back in with your parents when your band fails. Maybe you get a job as a record exec and learn to rip off musicians. Thankfully, this job may be disappearing soon, though I doubt it. Maybe you can make money scoring for films. I just saw one of my friends from music school in the credits for a major motion picture. Hopefully he's doing well, he certainly deserves it. He's a great guy with a lot of talent. Is my pay sufficient? Well, I am definitely not starving to death. I have debt, but apparently that's the American way, right? I live in a nice house. I have a car. If I need a piece of gear, I can buy it. I have cable TV. I have a computer and the internet. My life is pretty good. I have an amazing wife, who is also a music teacher. Do I want more money? Who doesn't? Maybe the question should be: Am I pursuing this job for just the money, or is there another benefit? I know some rich people who work in finance who are serious assholes. They have no idea how to treat people and yet believe that what they are doing makes them better people, and that they hold a higher value in society. Are they right?

3) What inspired me to work as a musician? Certainly not my early music teachers. My mom and dad always had great taste in music and always had it on, and they certainly encouraged me to do music in grammar school and bought me instruments. They also tried to dissuade me from this job throughout my life. I would say two things motivated me to be a professional musician. The first was hero worship. Coltrane, Miles Davis, early Metallica, John Williams, Led Zeppelin, Jerry Goldsmith, John Zorn, Iron Maiden, Devo... all my heroes were musicians. I read Henry Rollins' tour diaries from his days in Black Flag with the same thrill that people got from Kerouac. I drooled on the backs of albums, wondering who the engineers were, what the inside of studios looked like. The second inspiration came from the woman I ended up marrying. She had ALWAYS been a musician. That was the only job she EVER had, and she was really happy. Everyone in her family were career musicians, some of them very successful. I saw that it really was possible to be a musician without having to do some other lousy job all day. I didn't have to have a day job... music could be my day job! Very liberating, very inspirational. 

I sure hope this helps with your assignment. I believe it's possible to be a full-time musician, and I believe that I have a good life. I think we help the soul of humanity a little bit. I think it's possible to pay the bills.

Seriously, I'm deeply concerned about attitudes that have developed over piped water in America. It used to be almost a birthright, it was one of the things that made America better than other countries, that EVERY house connected to a public water supply had safe, clean water. Because of that, ""do not drink the water"" became part of jokes about other countries. 

But then, the yuppies started going to Europe, and noticed that people bought water in bottles, and thought it was cool. Because they came from a place where tapwater was assumed safe, they took it for granted that this was so everywhere in the world, and didn't realize that Europeans drank bottled water because tap water wasn't always safe. 

So the ignorant yuppies brought bottled water to America, and about the same time, the bottled water companies started spreading rumors that tapwater wasn't safe! Gag!

Indeed, there are contaminants in water in a LOT of communities now, but hey, when was tapwater EVER safe, they say... we drink bottled water, don't we? 

So people are becoming conditioned to accept unsafe tapwater, as something that always was, when in fact, safe drinking water used to be FIRST PRIORITY for the government. Somewhere along the line, other things became more important. 

So now we haul billions of gallons of water in disposable plastic bottles all over the country, when DUH, wouldn't it be more efficient to PIPE it? 

What a giant step backward we've taken.

While there will be turmoil -- the end result is that the total economic **gain** from an increased global mean temperature would likely completely offset the economic *loss* from it; and probably actually create a net gain.

I'll give an example of what I mean.  Every year, twice as many people die globally from exposure to cold than die from exposure to heat.  If we modify these numbers by 50%, then the net result is that 1.5(1x)+.5(2x)=2.5x, as opposed to 3x. That's a 16% net reduction in fatalities as a result of things getting warmer.  This is, of course, a totally hypothetical example -- but it clearly illustrates what I mean.

&gt; The fact is, Earth cannot continue to support the current population growth and consumption rates with the current means. 

That's a rather mealy-mouthed statement, you know.  the current population has nothing to do with how sustainable we are -- only our current technological adoption.  Vertical farming, for example, could reduce our land use by over 90%.

To nick111; you are clearly incapable of doing real math.  Weather, first of all, is not climate.

It would be the same as Europe telling us that we must succumb to the rule of the EU because we are not fit to govern ourselves.

&gt; How is having an abortion not taking responsibility? You don't like it, so it's not a right or a liberty.

&gt;It's not technically hypocrisy to give back that which his constituents have already paid. 

It *is* to then decry other politicians for doing the exact same thing. Why does Ron Paul get a pass on his pork projects as 'just representing his constituents' while all other politicians are greedily raking in cash for special interest groups? *Is it because he's just so gosh-darned adorable?*

&gt;Protection of private property was important to the founders. Its important to Ron Paul.

Yes, Lockean protections *were* very important to the Founders. Not so much to Ron Paul. You see, John Locke wrote that the sole source of legitimacy for a government was derived from the extent to which it protected its citizens' rights to life, liberty and property. Ron Paul, on the other hand, believes that the federal government has no place in ensuring those protections where the state government would deny them.

As a bit of an ancillary critique, the entire deification of the Founding Fathers sponsored by people like Ron Paul and 'strict constructionists' in general is *completely* the opposite of what the Founders wanted. In fact, if you actually read their writings they were *terrified* that their descendants would place consecrate significance on their words, and ignore contemporary society as a guide for policy. They were scholars of the Enlightenment, and were wary of monarchical European societies where kings were more gods than men, and whose word bound their subjects long after their death. Exigent to their philosophy was the idea that 'Earth belongs in usufruct to the living', and Jefferson in particular thought that *every* law - including the Constitution - was rendered invalid after twenty years, since the generation which had passed that law was mostly dead by then. No, the Founders would be *horrified* to learn that more than two centuries after their deaths there exists a sect of political thought which treats their words as holy writ rather than the scribblings of mere, fallible mortals.

The Crown Corporation seems to have been independent of the Parliament of England before the Civil War (1642–1651), even though they may have had formal or informal agreements between the two and other societies, the members of the societies, or the equal under-standing under the Great Charter, 1215.

The war between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists: The first (1642–46) and second (1648–49) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649–51) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.

**On Trusts...**

The organic Parliament, being a private society, is a kind of Trust.  With **Trustors**, the **Trustee(s)** (the Parliament itself - a *fiction* - and the established entities and roles under it and in its jurisdiction), and the **Beneficiaries**.  Even if there was no original written document or the original written document is long gone.

By ""organic"" I mean the original that dates back many many centuries, rather than any new *corporate-entity* for administering its accounts in commerce (under the accrual accounting system and the fiat currency).

In the Parliament case, who the beneficiaries are supposed to be is not so clear, although the public of the U.K. are told to believe that they are the beneficiary.

In the case of the continental United States, the beneficiary are ""ourselves and our **P**osterity"" - supposedly the **P**osterity of the **P**eople - those lucky chaps over there.  ( [Re: The United States of America Corporation](http://tpuc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1441&amp;p=8675#p8675) | [Re: Starting my own society](http://www.tpuc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1500&amp;start=10#p9603) )

Note. The use of proper noun / capitonym use is very important in Trust documents.  The use of initial letter capitalization denotes scoped names - specifically defined things. For example, the **P**eople does not necessarily mean *any* or *all* people but only the **P**eople as agreed to the satisfaction of the Trustors at that time.

By creating a Trust and forming a society, the Trustors surrenders some right that may be administered by that society - by the Trustee and the agents thereof as defined under its jurisdiction which is limited in scope to the rights that are granted to it.  Supposedly surrendering some rights to the collective brings a benefit-privilege to all the Beneficiaries that may be themselves and their descendants - their posterity.

For very much the same reasons the EU and the UN are also private societies that are established as Trusts, whether incorporated or not.

**On the Corporation...**

From the discussion of a number of individual members of the Commons and the Lords, from my reading of it, it appears that the ""United Kingdom Corporation"" was incorporated later than the creation of the organic *legal-fiction* - the ""United Kingdom"" - that was created by private Statutory Acts of Parliament.

Already established on public record regarding the ""United Kingdom Corporation""...

The record seems to indicate that the United Kingdom (created by a private Act of Parliament) some time later created the United Kingdom Corporation, or at least some members of Parliament created the United Kingdom Corporation on behalf of Parliament and/or the United Kingdom or in their own interests.

But being a corporation, it surely could have changed hands since mentioned on public record in 1940, 1943, 1944 and 1949.
Also, what is the exact relationship of [The Bankruptcy Act of 1869](http://www.tpuc.org/content/70-year-bankruptcy-cycle-and-bit-more-acce) in regards to the United Kingdom and United Kingdom Corporation?

If that is so, it would be in a similar situation as the United States of America that later incorporated the United States, which then may have lost administration of it due to bankruptcy.  ( [Critical History](http://wayofkings.net/history.htm) | [History](http://teamlaw.net/history.htm) | [Historical Outline](http://teamlaw.net/HistoryOutline.htm) | [Is the U.S. a corporation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/79ra9/is_the_us_a_corporation/) | [The Two United States and the Law](http://supremelaw.org/authors/freeman/freeman4.htm) | [On the bankruptcy of the US Federal Government, 1933](http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/77p2j/on_the_bankruptcy_of_the_us_federal_government/) | [The history of the relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHistory/comments/844l5/the_history_of_the_relationship_with_the_federal/c086yix) )

All in all though, if you stand out from a private society, you are free in common law on the land.  Free to make law with your fellow man by agreement, consent, contract and mutual under-standing, as long as you do not harm any other, steal their property or deny their own rights and freedoms.

In that sense when one stands out from under every private society, the jurisdiction (private law and its enforcement policy) of that private society becomes foreign to you.

The least those born in rich countries can do, like us reading here, is acknowledge our fortune and make it work for us!

I owe it to the world to be happy because if I can't manage it, given all my advantages that these pictures serve to reinforce, my good and fortunate incarnation in this life has no meaning. Truly, if this being, (me, this self) can't turn consciousness into happiness then what hope for these kids.

Suddenly, I'm humbled. I'm down off my ""high horse"". I'm getting real.

You don't have to think you have to help everybody in order to be against child labor.

&gt; Plus helping them does the exact opposite.

Providing a child with education, food, and shelter does make their lives a heck of a lot better.

&gt; It's like Africa. Our aid prevents them from having an economy.

Africa is an _incredibly_ huge land mass, with a diverse range of cultures. Some parts are doing well, others aren't. The same could be said of Europe, South America or North America.

To claim Africa doesn't have an economy is stupefyingly ignorant. 

The problems in certain parts of Africa are complex. They were not caused by, or maintained, by foreign aid.

&gt; They can't set up shop and start selling food, it's going to show up for free.
They can't compete with free.

Red herring.

Providing food, shelter, and a basic education to children is not the same as providing the entire population with free food, or abandoning capitalism.

Make all the excuses for naked exploitation you want.

Contrary to most libertarian teaching, the benefits of society were not given to us by an enlightened upper-class or free market.

Okay, so here's the options:  
1.  Give people rights making them equal to others.  
2.  Don't give these people rights so that other people will be happy.   

Which is correct?  Which is moral?  I'll give you a hint; it isn't point 2.  

Is that the answer?  Sit about and hope that someone gifts you with the rights you should have?  When has that ever worked for *anyone*, at any point in history?  Did it work for African-Americans? Women?  When were rights handed out like prizes for a group's *patience*?  

As for the idea that this hurts the LGBT community?  Rubbish.  Look North.  Here, in Canada, Gay Marriage became legal.  It was ""pushed"" on those that disagreed.  They put it to a vote.  It passed.  The conservatives got in, and they put to a vote the option to have another vote on the matter.  That vote failed.  All those people who had prejudices before?  They still do.  Didn't fix that problem.  All those that were pro-gay marriage?  Still pro-gay marriage.  The only difference is that now the gay people in question can marry and enjoy the benefits thereof.

&gt; Birth of a Nation is important because it locked cinema into it's current status: an extension of theater.

A great many early silent films were adaptations of theater productions.  There's always been an affinity between film and theater.  If your argument is just that *Birth of a Nation* somehow finalized that relationship, I'd want to know how.  That isn't to say that Griffith wasn't an important director, but his contributions were generally more *cinematic* than I think you give him credit for.  He essentially pioneered some of the cinematic techniques that broke down the theatricality of American cinema by making the narrative use of close up, space, and intercutting (the last prominently featured in *BoaN*) palatable to wide audiences.

&gt; Every convention of editing comes from this film. Every time a TV show cuts to a close up (causing you to pay attention), every action sequence, every ""rhythm"" of cutting that occurs during a conversation, all of it comes from this film.

It *has* been argued that every major form of editing was used in *Potemkin*, but that isn't the same as every form of editing *originating* there.  Reverse angle cutting was first used in 1911 in *The Loafer*; cross-cutting on parallel actions was used in 1907 in *le Cheval emballé*; POV shots were used as early as 1910.  Eisenstein was an influential theorist, yes, and he argued that editing was the central artistic device of cinema (the act of interposing static images to make the illusion of motion being, itself, a form of editing), but he didn't invent editing out of thin air.  And in fact, his theory was diametrically opposed to the ""invisible editing"" characteristic of most mainstream film.  Montage theory was supposed to create an editing style which produced ideas by the juxtaposition of images; you were supposed to think about the edits, to tease out the political and social overtones.

&gt; It Happened One Night, directed by Frank Capra - This film was culturally relevant and influential, but not, in my opinion, artistically influential at all.

Capra was essentially the director who made social concern a part of the ""voice"" of the mainstream American movie director.  I'm not terribly familiar with *It Happened One Night*, but I suspect that's why TCM put this one on the list.

&gt; There would be no animated storytelling (""long form"" storytelling, that is) without this film.

I think that's probably overstating it a bit.  Animation had been developing over the years, and Disney may well have pushed its trajectory along by several decades, but that certainly doesn't preclude the possibility of someone else saying, hey, why not just make cartoons longer?  Probably the more prominent influence of *SNat7D* is the narrative structure it imposed on the form.  How many animated American films have been made since then that *weren't* musical comedies with fable/fairy tale elements?  Even Walt Disney himself was practically incapable of breaking the mold, despite his continued insistence that feature length animation should be capable of telling all manner of story.  To this day, the majority of animated films not tied to that mold come from outside of the U.S.

&gt; The Bicycle Thief, directed by Vittorio de Sica - This film is influential because it was gritty for its time and because it used non-actors. It created a rather shitty subgenre of film called neorealism. Not particularly influential, in my opinion, but a lot of people do seem to like it.

Not very influential?  The American trend towards urban realism, particularly during and after the 70s, is practically unthinkable without it.  It's influence over the whole of the American independent film scene is palpable -- it's hard to imagine a John Sayles or a Jim Jarmusch without Italian neo-realism.

&gt; Rashomon, directed by Akira Kurosawa

It also opened Japanese cinema to the West, making possible all sort of influence, from that of Ozu, to Kurosawa's impact on the Italian spaghetti western.

&gt; The Searchers, directed by John Ford - Same director as Stagecoach, and the same star. I think the photography is excellent, but nothing else strikes me as influential.

If I'm not mistaken, *The Searchers* was the first film to begin the progressive dismantling of the cinematic myth of simple morality in the American West.  It made it more difficult to distinguish the good guys from the bad, more difficult to say ""this was a noble act"" and ""this was a cowardly one"".  That's a theme that's pushed the quintessential American genre films -- Westerns, hard-boiled detectives, cop dramas like *The Wire* -- ever since.

&gt; Just as Reservoir Dogs seems like a pretty average action flick nowadays...

Am I that out of synch that it surprises me that anyone would consider *Reservoir Dogs* an ""action flick""?

&gt; New editing tricks abounded, convincing multitudes of audiences that they saw a brutal killing in a shower, when in fact the knife never touches her body in the entire scene.

The editing tricks in *Psycho* weren't really new -- Hitchcock learned his trade in the UPA studios of the 1910 and 20s German film scene, and his later work was essentially an alchemical blending of what he learned there, what he picked up from Eisenstein in the meantime, and the close eye he kept on European cinema.  The shower scene is essentially the most extensive major American studio experiment in Eisenstienian editing up to that time.  That in itself was a pretty radical innovation.  It's also the film that initially blurred the line between A and B pictures by putting A-list talent on what was essentially B-list exploitation material.  And finally, it had a subversive story line that played with people's perceptions of what to expect of a star and how a narrative should progress.

&gt; The dogfight scene at the end was quite something at the time. ... combined with a flawless emulation of Akira Kurosawa's visual style.

If I'm not mistaken, *Star Wars* was the first film to use go-motion photography.  It also pushed special effects to the forefront of story-telling, stretching out the boundaries of suspension of disbelief.  And on that end, it holds up really well.  Even before the special edition reworkings, the special effects in *Star Wars* rarely pulled you out of the world represented on-screen.  But I have to take issue with the idea that it's ""a flawless emulation of Akira Kurosawa's visual style.""  Ripping off a few shots from *The Hidden Fortress* and using wipes between scenes doesn't get you anywhere close to the mastery Kurosawa employed in nearly every phase of his film career.",1425953752

Not the same way.  More like how the ethnic Japanese, or the Japanese language, or some microscopic aspect of the Japanese culture, is super unique and can't be found anywhere else.

There's a large degree of exceptionalism in US thinking, but is of a different type.  More focused on nationalism and justification of poor international behavior than on the idea that there's something unique to Americans as a people.

&gt;When you say ""while,"" do you mean like hundreds of years? I'm not expecting major changes to happen overnight, but I think that more towards the middle of this century, when today's youth are in power and those in power now are ancient/decedent, we will start to see some big changes.

I mean more along the lines of two or three generations.  Seriously, the average Japanese kid is a lot more traditional than you, or they, would like to think.  Gender roles, as well as other social roles, are vastly more stratified and deeply embedded in Japanese culture than in American or European culture.

As a minor example take women as taxi drivers, bus driver, or train drivers.  There are women in those jobs, but its vanishingly rare.  Right now there is exactly one Japanese female commercial airline pilot.  One.

I lived in Tokyo for six months, during that time I did not see a single female taxi driver, bus driver, or train driver.  More to the point, this is not something that really bothers a lot of younger Japanese, or seems particularly odd.  There is plain old fashioned sexism and patriarchy involved in the issue, but more important is simply the idea that the way things are is the way they're supposed to be.  People who want to challenge the system are rare.

Or, to chose a different example, take porn.  Its censored in Japan.  Even doujinshi artists who are completely anonymous and who give away their stuff tend to follow the censorship laws.  Because that's just the way things are.  Worse, that's the **JAPANESE** way of doing things, so it must be superior to the barbarian way of doing things.

Japan is poised on the edge of a huge political shakeup, and that may ripple out to society at large.  Since WWII the Liberal Democratic Party (which, BTW, is neither liberal nor democratic nor a party [1]) has almost always held an absolute majority in the Diet.  That means it has had pretty much uncontested control of Japan for more than 60 years now.

And according to most observers of Japanese politics its about to come apart at the seams.  It isn't a party so much as a coalition of right and center-right groups, and the farther right groups are taking a serious dislike to the center-right groups; and often to each other.

If the LDP splits, or even if enough disgruntled politicians leave it for other parties, then Japan will suddenly stop being the (effectively) one party state its been for what amounts to its entire modern history.  That sort of thing can cause massive upheaval.

But, even assuming the LDP falls apart within the next decade or so (which it may not), I still don't see any major social change in Japan on the horizon.  Incremental change, yes, but nothing revolutionary.  Over time the incremental change will stack up and things will be different there, but I'm guessing we're looking at a timeframe measured in generations.

[1] Its more of a coalition than a real party.",1425953765

Those are all paid for by taxes (paid by the likes of YOU and ME), and at least in many European countries, road usage is taxed much more heavily than what is actually invested in improving existing roads, or building new ones. So if anything, road users are subsidizing people who do not own cars, rather than vice versa.

The fuel situation is even worse: fuels are taxed very heavily here. This is not the case in the USA, but still I wouldn't exactly call them ""subsidized"" over there, either.

Taxes on fuels (e.g., 50+%, and that's before VAT) and car usage in general (general road taxes if you so much as own a car, extra crazy taxes on buying new cars *on top* of 20% VAT, toll roads - you name it, we got it) are frankly getting to be completely absurd.

Humans evolved from less developed species. Those species (monkeys, fish, etc) tend to move in packs (for safety and reproductive reasons). Thus early humans also tended to congregate in packs. Those packs developed and got larger over time, as different tribes either took one another over, or allied. Once one tribe grew large enough, they became too large to move around perpetually, and with the advent of new technologies they were better able to settle down in a single area. This was particularly beneficial because they could now build more complex, protective housing. However settling down made them easy targets for other tribes, and so the tribes tended to have a chieftain to deal with attacks and organizing hunts, etc. As the tribe grew even larger and got more complex the people began to draft warriors, whose profession was to exclusively stand watch and fight. But people who stand watch and fight can't farm or hunt most of the time, so the chieftain had to levy a tax to get food for the warriors. As the clan grew farther and took over more tribes, and as they developed more and more as a single unit, they got more and more distinct culture, which was based totally on the location of the tribe and which chieftain they lived under. From here town and cities grew, and then countries, all on the basis of that early organization. 
This is of course a very simplified version of about 10000 years of history, and it's not a catch all, but it works for many regions (Europe, the Americas, Asia). 

Now remind me why it's necessary to posit a worldwide, thousands of years old conspiracy of the ruling classes who turn ""the people"" of the world against one another in order to maintain control to explain the existence of countries. ",1425953772

I'm all for reducing emissions by looking at alternative energies and more efficient uses of those energies. However, I think we need to start putting plans into place *now* for the coming consequences of climate change. For instance, Australia has been experiencing some of the worst droughts in history for the past decade or so. And they aren't relenting. They are having to import more and more feedstocks for their cattle and are relying more heavily on irrigation for what they do grow. It seems to me like they are treating it like a year-to-year problem rather than a ""this is here to stay"" problem. Maybe it's not so smart for them to be doing that. Maybe they need to have a Plan B because that practice is not economically sustainable. Another example is of people living in flood-prone areas. What happened during Katrina will happen again, and more often. The same with what has been happening in the midwest. Also, on the eastern seaboard of the US there have been warmer winters which seems great, but there have also been some pretty severe droughts in these areas, especially in the southeast. Conversely, parts of Europe are cooling.  Again, these are treated as year-to-year problems and not ""these are here to stay"" problems. My particular worry is that as people don't focus on the general trend and instead go from year to year, this is going to really lead us towards unsustainable water use for both lifestyle uses and especially agricultural uses. 

And...the *pièce de résistance* to all this is that if the earth warms *too* much *too* quickly, we could wind up at the doorstep of an ice age in a relatively short period of time - we're talking decades to a century or two. It would be a double whammy. First, [ice and snow increase the earth's albedo or the amount of solar energy it reflects.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age#Processes_which_make_glacial_periods_more_severe) Less snow and ice means more warming...it's a (forgive the pun!) snowball effect. Secondly, rapid melting of the ice caps would dump a large amount of fresh water into the oceans in a short period of time. [Saltwater and freshwater have different densities and ultimately this would really screw up thermohaline turnover and massively disrupt ocean currents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation).

Those people from the USSR were able to consolidate themselves socially and express themselves in high positions of power and major political parties (like Yisrael Beitinu, which Avigdor Lieberman -- the Moldovan immigrant -- belongs to).

Those immigrants arrived in 1990s: contrast that with the continuing plight of the Mizrahim (who started arriving before 1948) and the Falasha in the Israeli society and you'll get a clear picture of how ""teremendous an effort"" did the State of Israel make to accomodate the non-European elements in its society.",1425953786

I'm not knee-jerking.  I am talking about the reality of the approach.  More on this:

&gt; Population control is simply government mandated limits on the number of children you can have. Something that is necessary given the multitude of life extending technologies available today.

You genuinely don't know what you're talking about.  Here's why: the sustainable population is determined by the level of technology adopted in agriculture and manufacture.  If, for example, we were exclusively using meat tissue culturing and vertical farming, over 99% of the currently utilized lands could be made fallow and we'd still have room for a doubling of the population.

Post-malthusian economies tend towards fewer children.  Already, the native US &amp; Canadian populations and the native European populations all are experiencing negative population growth. And that's **with** ""the multitude of life extending technologies available today.""  Which, I'll add, are going to get worse with the much-deserving thanks going to the SENS and Malthusian Foundations -- of which I personally know a few of the researchers in the former.

The point I'm rambling towards here is simple; birth inhibition is absolutely useless to the timescale we're discussing.  Even if we limit births from this point forward to just 1/2 per person (non-retroactively, of course; no 'killing of people') -- we still would experience a climb to upwards of 7 Billion people before 2050.  It wouldn't begin to have population decline for several decades.

Which, as you've said, would be ""too late"" to save us from horrible catastrophe.

Or even society ""as a thing"" exists? ... I think it's an absurdity - decisions are made in minds, individual minds, whatever that happens between people merely influences decisions, but does not make them.

If someone really doesn't want to act with the group, no group decisions can ever force them to, but people almost never feel that strongly about anything.

On most things, people will act within the morality of their group by default, and not consider alternatives. People automatically rule out possible actions that involve rape, for example, even if this achieves personal goals. Their individual morality reflects the social morality. The social morality also reflects the individual one, as democracies pass laws that encode it, and then it is taught to children and influences their morality. 

If you want a concrete, non-philosophical example of collective group action on multiple occasions, just look at [Anonymous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)).
When I say Anonymous sees [action against Scientology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chanology) as (collectively) morally right, I mean that almost all people who identify with that group support the action as being morally right (by their individual morality) - and that the group has justified its actions with this social morality.

When I say Anonymous has collectively acted against the religion Scientology, I mean that a significant percentage (probably a majority, but the anonymous nature of the group makes it *very* had to count individuals) have directly attacked (via DDoS, vandalism, and other means) the group and it's resources, or produced anti-Scientology propaganda, or protested against Scientology, or argued against Scientology to people they've mention IRL and on the Internet, or have help to co-ordinate these actions. People who act in the name of Anonymous (or even who want to talk with Anonymous) use no identity while doing so (hence the name), so you can't say this is many individual actors.

I know examples of political groups acting to advance a shared group morality. In fact, this is what political parties are for - promoting a shared value system.

Also, I think we mean slightly different things by society. It makes sense to speak of Anonymous's personality and morality. I'd rather not describe them - Anonymous has a pretty wrong moral system (judged by my subjective morality). Although only an idea, Anonymous does exist, and can be described, and it makes sense to speak of it's actions as more than the actions of the individuals in it.

I think collective action is when a group acts with an understood unity of purpose, and *because* of some shared value. More on collective morality below.
------
&gt; A community, a society is good or bad if the actions of individuals are good or bad in it.

Good or bad? **Judged by what standard?** If subjective morality, then who shall judge it? If a certain person, then you have substituted a dictator for the law courts. If a person pulled at random, then justice will be as random as people's value systems are. If the victim, then you can never act, because you might violate someone else's morality. If the actor, then everyone can do anything, because they can pick a morality to justify their action, or choose one that judges no acts to be immoral. If none of these, then you *can not judge actions by any individual's morality*. 

To be able to call some acts good and bad for everyone - to have any justice at all - means having a morality that everyone will agree to. The collective morality is the weighted average  of the individual morality of the people in it. (The weights measure  how influential that person's views are.) By all acting to improve the world according to the ideals of the social morality, overall the world judged by each subjective morality will improve. Also, the group can take actions that an individual cannot achieve, like sending people to the moon.

In fact, I'm going to be an asshole (sorry ^_^) and quote *you* on this:

&gt; 3) Of course it doesn't follow that all inequal societies are just: an inequal society is just insofar as the different results/punishments/rewards that make people inequal correlate to the accepted values of that society.

Justice is rewards correlating to the accepted values of a society - the societies morality.

&gt; we love our children or parents not because they are good or worthy of it, but because they are our children or parents, i.e. because of the relationship.

I don't disagree here, but I think it's more because the relationship has meaning and therefore value. For family relationships, the value is emotional.

And I think this morality is an essential part of the definition of ""society"". In fact, I think that this morality, plus the relationship and communication networks between people, *define* a society.
------
&gt;something that truly changes how society works.

The establishment of republic democracies in Europe in the late middle ages and the revolutions that established many of them changed how society worked.

&gt;I thought everybody has a realistic and unflattering view of democracy ... it's better than dictatureship/tyranny ... But that doesn't make it good. 

I *have* a possibly realistic and definitely unflattering view of democracy. I think it leads to personality politics and political fashions, and also gives far too much power to the media, as people who don't have (or don't seek) unbiased complete information cannot make meaningful moral judgments. I think the ""tyranny of the masses"" is a real problem, as I hold minority views on many topics, and do not want legislation passed outlawing how I live.

However, I think it's better than a monarchy, dictatorship, or anarchy, it makes it easy to determine the values of a society, and I don't know of a better system except representative democracy. In New Zealand we do have citizen-initiated referendums which provide almost all the advantages of direct democracy. If they were binding, I'd say we *had* a direct democracy.

&gt;let's call them ""wordsmiths"" (in classical terminology: demagogues, sophists, rhetors), people whose major ability is that they can speak or write texts that can convince a lot of other people. To be honest, I don't have much respect for them. Wordsmiths, by their very definition, live in the artificial world of words and have little contact with reality. 

I disagree with you about rhetoric: I think if everyone learned about it, it wouldn't work so well, and we'd have a higher standard of public debate overall. (I also think there can be honor in the rhetorical arts, and respect the skill of people who can write and speak convincingly, and want to study rhetoric to learn how to better communicate my ideas and my philosophy, but that's off topic.)

&gt; They tend to think everything is possible, because it is possible to speak about almost everything convincingly.

With a democracy and the masses on your side, anything *is* possible. (It's *very* tempting to Godwin the thread right about now :P) This is a problem with democracy, yet the ability to act in ways harmful to the society seems to be a problem with any other form of government. 

&gt;But please, do not idolize democracy. There is no need to do that, it's really not ideal, not in any sense 

No worries on that count. :P

&gt;Most people I know in the job (programmer) truly respect, adore and imitate those people the most who ""made it"", businessmen ... They dream of wealth and adore the honest wealthy the most.

Maybe we just know different programmers. ^_^

I program in Common Lisp and C#/Mono for personal projects. I'm trying to learn Haskell, Python, and Assembly language. I hang out in proggit a lot and I read programming blogs, and also lurk in some other programming-related places on the internet (like comp.lang.lisp). I use desktop linux, and have modified the source of programs I use. (But no patches so far, probably because I don't really know C/C++/Java/Python very well)

The programmers I meet usually code as a hobby, or because they enjoy it. A lot of them do have programming jobs, but mostly seem to be thankful that people pay them to work at something they love. Many of them actively resist promotion to management positions, because they prioritize the work they do over their pay. They tinker, they hack, and they hold good abstraction and clean, beautiful code as ideals. They seek the respect of their peers more than anything except an interesting problem to work on.

This includes a lot of people in the demoscene, and also quite a lot of academic computer science type people, as well as amateur and professional computer security researchers. Also a people working in web startups coding in ruby, and also some guys who do on embedded code, mostly in C. Almost no-one working on business or enterprise stuff. Maybe that's the difference.

I don't want to think about how long I've spend commenting on replies to this article, and what other things I could have been doing instead. I have been relpying to you for over five hours total. It is now noon, and I have had no sleep. This scares me, but I am enjoying it. I think both love and hate reddit very strongly.

&gt; According to Sir Henry Bartle Frere (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 slaves in India in 1841. In Malabar, about 15% of the population were slaves. Slavery was abolished in both Hindu and Muslim India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843. Provisions of the Indian Penal Code of 1861 effectively abolished slavery in India by making the enslavement of human beings a criminal offense.
&gt; ... Though any formalised slave trade has not existed in South Asia, unfree labor has existed for centuries in the Medieval ages, in different forms. The most common forms have been kinds of bonded labor. During the epoch of the Mughals, debt bondage reached its peak, and it was common for money lenders to make slaves of peasants and others who failed to repay debts. Under these practices, more than one generation could be forced into unfree labor; for example, a son could be sold into bonded labor for life to pay off the debt, along with interest.


Don't forget the rigidly enforced caste system where your entire role in life is determined at birth and trying to step out of that role is impossible.

&gt; by contrast, there are libraries full of atrocities committed by the british against india.

Not a big surprise. It's popular to report on the atrocities of europeans. Reporting the atrocities of non-white people is insensitive to their culture. The system of debt bondage that currently exists in India dates back to the Mughals. In fact, it was the British who forced the Indians to outlaw slavery.",1425953861

For instance, I played college football.  Throughout college I had a BMI of about 35 (technically Obese) but a body fat percentage of 10-13%--I was just very muscular and so quite heavy for my height.  BMI does not account for different bone or muscular density and so is a very poor measure of what actually constitutes healthy weight.

As for the discrepancy between the US and the rest of the world, I've seen studies (but can't be arsed to look now, sorry :-P ) that indicated that it was a matter of population distribution.  Essentially obesity was much more prevalent in rural areas than metropolitan ones and the US population is more rural by proportion than most European nations.  If you take that into account then the obesity rates were much more comparable.  At least that's what I remember without citation :-P

I mean really take a nice look at those big 'ol resolutions you talk about. How many are initiated by countries that don't like Israel at all? And pass with an automatic majority because of that? It's not just the HR council. It's the general assembly as well.

Have you ever wondered that all these countries have reasonable grounds for disliking ISrael? Why do immediately assume that they are being irrational? After all ISrael is an illegally established european colony, has ethnically cleansed the region of hundreds of thousands of  natives (they and their descendants still to this day live in squalid refugee camps waiting to return to their ancestral lands), launched numerous unprovoked wars against its neighbours, is engaged in a brutal, repressive, illegal 4-decade long military occupation of land which it grabbed in one of its imperial wars of expansion, supports illegal alien settlements in said occupied territories etc. etc. ect.   

&gt;What I'm trying to say is that Israel had a damn good reason to refuse.

They don't have 'good' reasons to refuse at all. Their selfish, flagrant refusal to abide by international law is not something to be commended. 

&gt;There has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the...

Stop handwaving. The UN is not a perfect organisation but that doesn't at all justifiy Israel's repeated transgressions against International law and its refusals to abide by the resulting UN resolutions. And in case you think the UN is always one-sided, 500,000 Iraqi children died because of UN sanctions on the country for violations far less severe than those committed by Israel.

No that's not the problem here. So go ahead, be tired. Fall right asleep for all I care. Tiredness doesn't change facts.

The fact of the matter is you brought up the ""No True Scotsman"" argument -  and that line of thinking is one that only ""works"" when you don't have a stable definition for what a Scotsman is. We're getting into Logic here.

Inversely, that line of reasoning utterly crumbles when you do have a definition of what a Scotsman is.

The fact of the matter is there are very clear definitions given about what a Christian is and what a Christian isn't. You simply refuse to acknowledge these definitions (or are confused about the definition yourself) and that's painfully obvious. (But you would think that the founding documents of a religion on that very topic would be considered authoritative on this matter.)

I offered you a chance to offer your own definition of what a ""Christian"" is - yet you don't give one. You don't back up anything you say except with blunt generalizations. 

Your arguments are half-reasoned and well worn to the point of breakage. Either that or you're just (1) hateful of Christians in general or (2) you lack the ability to communicate your ideas thoroughly or (3) your living with a healthy dose of cognitive dissonance. Heck, maybe it's a cocktail of all three - Don't fall into this trap. I see so many atheists who are just seething masses of hate and vitriol. Honestly and truly, I can walk away from this discussion with no ill will towards you. I wonder if you can do the same?

And, for the record, about the Spanish Inquisition Numbers - yes, in ""legal"" terms the Inquisition lasted some 400 years, but in terms of killing, only around 25. And even if I was to take the worst death toll estimates of Scholars, which puts it around 125,000 (this number isn't taken very seriously in scholarly circles), that still pales in comparison to the millions left dead in the wake of Atheism and every philosophical offshoot from it. Ideas have consequences!

And here's sources for you on that:

You will find this statistic repeated over and over and over again with a simple Google Search.

(I studied this stuff at Oxford for a reason - just so I could know definitively what I was talking about when I spoke).

So what are we left with? 

Looks like you might have to dig a little deeper and (1)Get some Evidence to back up what your saying instead of just spouting off generalized and incorrect reasons as to why I'm wrong or (2) look at the real evidence for yourself and either deal with correcting those incorrect perceptions or (3) continue in incorrect cognitive dissonance (which, needless to say, isn't a very happy way to live).

Yes - but note the term: *people* act. Not the group acts, but the people. They often act in unison - but as individuals. Being part of a group influences decision-making, but the decisions are made inside individual minds.

The reason I'm dwelling on the impossibility of collective action is that I suspect that what would follow from collective action is that collective action is legislation. That, just like an individual is acting compassionately if he gives charity, a compassionate society as a collective similary acts via f.e. legislating welfare. This is I think a very slippery slope, and this is why I'm ""fighting"" it at the root, that individuals can sometimes or often act in perfect unison but this is still a set of individual actions. Thus, legislation is not the action of a collective. It's an action of some individuals in order to set up rules to influence or change the behaviour of other individuals.  From this thought of train comes that then such rules can have unforeseen consequences, can give out malincentives, etc. This much for the theoretical part. On the practical one, politicians legislate. All the ""collective"" can do is to choose who will legislate for a limited set of choices.

""Judged by what standard? If subjective morality, then who shall judge it?"" - this is exactly the hardest question of morality ever, but still, the correct answer isn't ""no one"" and perhaps ""the most numerous"" isn't the best answer either. I think it's necessary and possible to have ""experts"" of value judgement: respected, well-known ""wise men"", just like there are experts in everything.

But that's not very important here because I think the subject now is justice and justice isn't a value judgement, but the enforcement thereof. Thus, if people think everybody over 40 must be killed, then within this (im)moral system it is just if nobody over 40 escapes it, and everybody under 40 escapes it. This sounds shocking, but justice means punishing bad, rewarding good and it can work for any definition of good and bad. 

""To be able to call some acts good and bad for everyone - to have any justice at all - means having a morality that everyone will agree to. The collective morality is the weighted average of the individual morality of the people in it. (The weights measure how influential that person's views are.)""

These two contradict :)) Probably nothing ever will really everybody agree with, but it's not necessary, each disagreement modifies the weighted average. With the second one I agree with, except that it's not the morality of the collective as a being, a subject in itself, as it doesn't exist, but it's basically a statistical aggregate.

""By all acting to improve the world according to the ideals of the social morality, overall the world judged by each subjective morality will improve.""

Doesn't follow at all. X has view 12, influence 100, Y has view -3, influence 10. Weighted average 10.6. It gets done. Will Y think it's an improvement? :))

But what I'm driving at is what follows from it: that collective action is legislation. No, legislation is not an action in itself, but a set of rules to circumscribe individual action. This is a very important difference, because I think collective action is a slippery slope, it makes it too convenient to say that ""we should do X"" means ""we should have a law for X, or, the government should do X"". 

Nope. Playing Monopoly is not the same as writing the rulebook of Monopoly. If the players agree in rules, that's not collective action, but a common agreement in the limits of individual action. 

This sort of reasoning (mine) leads towards a smaller-gov't view: all the state should do is to tell us what we are forbidden to do, but nothing else. (Where I differ from the Libertarian view is that I have no problems with outlawing drugs and stuff like that. That's included in forbidding what not to do.) Writing the Monopoly rulebook, as a group, together is not some sort of collective form of playing it but merely agreeing in what NOT to do.  

""The establishment of republic democracies in Europe in the late middle ages and the revolutions that established many of them changed how society worked.""

Did it, if we disregard the formalities and just take a look at how things actually worked? Didn't [Joseph II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Joseph_as_ruling_emperor) and [Louis XV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France#First_attempt_at_reform) try to do the same kind of liberal reforms are the later democracies, largely because they were influenced by the same kind of intellectuals (""parti philosophique"")?

Or perhaps, worthless greenwashings - CFL bulbs, ""Earth Hours"". Instead, Obama's guy takes the hard-nosed approach - he works the numbers, and concludes that he must promote the politically unpopular in the world - the nuclear reactors, the CO2-sequestration plants - because they are mostly likely to *work*. I don't know about Obama's priorities, but Steven Chu has CO2 emissions square in his sights, and will defy political winds to shoot them down.

In his own words:

&gt;""It absolutely is worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage because we are not in a vacuum,"" Mr. Chu told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at an Energy Information Administration conference. ""Even if the United States or Europe turns its back on coal, India and China will not,"" he said. Mr. Chu added that ""quite frankly I doubt if the United States will turn its back on coal. We are generating over 50% of our electrical energy from coal.""

The dissenting view is that wind and solar are somehow 'superior' (ha), and, more worryingly, that we should *ignore* things like clean coal, because they are 'not needed'. I think James Hansen has some harsh words for them:

&gt;With a rising carbon price, renewable energy can perhaps handle all of our needs. However, most experts believe that making such **presumption** probably would leave us in 25 years with still a large contingent of coal-fired power plants worldwide. Such a result would be disastrous for the planet, humanity, and nature.

http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/20081229_DearMichelleAndBarack.pdf

Is it any surprise that the world's preeminent climate-change physicist is a strong defender of nuclear and clean coal?

Back to the article - Chu also points out that the clean-coal technology is **dual-use** - it adapts equally well to biomass-burning plants, in which case it is a net carbon sink!

&gt;Mr. Chu said he didn't want to comment on ""any specific proposal."" He said that the Energy Department was ""thinking of investment in"" research projects that gasified biomass to separate out the carbon dioxide.

&gt;""When you gasify it, you can capture the carbon and sequestrate the carbon -- that actually becomes a net sink of carbon, meaning that as the plant grows, it takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" Mr. Chu said. ""I would be very enthusiastic about anything that goes in that direction.""

I'd like nothing more than to see every damn one of the recent terrorism related laws (or changes) reverted, the people behind them voted out of parliament and publicly ridiculed, and I'd like to see people actually care and try to do something about it.

But that does *not* mean I am blind to the fact that the British judiciary actually take their independence and their duty to the public seriously - far more so than elected representatives do at times, and often they care far more about peoples liberties than the UK public at large does (hence the regular public outcry over how horrible those pesky EU human rights laws are). 

There's a centuries old tradition in the UK for promoting civil rights via the judiciary, often to the chagrin of whoever has been in charge and often actually with minimal support from the public whose rights they have protected. Doesn't mean they don't get it wrong sometimes, but if I were to make a bet on who will do most to curtail the extended power the current government has given police, I'd pick the judges over MPs or the public at large any day.

Pointing out that a situation is *likely* to improve once someone fights for their rights in court in no ways equates to advocating that people sit back and wait. It is a statement about what I believe is likely to happen, not a wish or a recommendation of any course of action.

The Norwegian system works fine - there are things to improve on, but there are things to improve on everywhere. The WHO agreed with me in their report in 2000 (I believe there is a never one, but I don't have it): The Norwegian system was ranked 11th in the world - ahead of western european countries like the UK, Germany, Portugal, Iceland, Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Spain, Italy and France were the only major western European nations ranked higher.

As for the tax level: The overall Norwegian tax level isn't all that much higher than in most other developed countries. It's a myth.

I make well above average. When in Norway, I paid ca.30% tax after deductions. Adding in VAT doesn't affect the tax rate nearly as much as you seem to believe, as most people spend a minority of their after tax income on taxable goods. 

In my case I spent less than 30% of my pre-tax income on taxable goods, meaning in Norway at the current 25% VAT rate, the VAT would add up to at most an additional 7.5% in taxes for a total tax burden of about 37.5%.. While the top tax brackets drive the income tax level up for higher earners, higher earners also typically spend a lower percentage of their income on buying taxable goods and as a result the VAT part of the total tax burden offsets a lot of the income tax increase as salaries increase.

I really wonder where you get your 70%. It'd take someone well into the top tax bracket spending almost their entire income on taxable goods to get to that number.  If I'd been smoking, drinking lots and driving a car I'd have paid more in taxes, but after housing costs etc. I simply didn't (and don't) have enough money left to even be able to spend enough money to end up paying that much tax.

In the UK where I live now I pay approximately 32% total national and local taxes on my income excluding VAT (the UK have lower tax rates than Norway, but a far less generous system for deductions which actually makes the Norwegian system more favorable for many high earners), and about 4.5% in VAT (based on the temporarily lowered VAT rate of 15% - from next January it'd be about 0.75% higher), for a total tax burden of about 36.5%. 

For comparison, this is pretty much what I would be paying in California (I was considering a move for work reason a couple of years back and so looked into it in detail) too, while getting fewer services for my money (for the record: Many US states are cheaper).

So would you say that religion throughout history only played negative roles when it came to deciding laws, or would you admit they have had positive impacts on law making as well?


&gt;what has religion contributed on its own and without help.

This is a strange question, because religion, just as every other entity, is always influenced by something else either in its inspiration or while carrying out it's task.  So no matter what anyone claims they might have done, one could argue that they did not do it completely ""on its own without help"".  One can only definitively say that an entity contributed a big part of something.

Religion played a big part in exploration of the West by Europeans.  Since modern society today is heavily influenced by the West, you can say religion played a major role in shaping modern society.

Religion also played a huge part in the Independence that the US Constitution adopted, I might even go as far as saying that it contributed that on it's own without any help.  
As you probably know, the Puritans were the ones to populate the American colonies, and the main reason why was because the Church of England was moving away from Puritanism, and laws were being made against ministers who deviated from the Church of England.  Puritans disagreed with many traditions of the Church of England, so they left for the American colonies. The new Americans decided that they would not repeat the mistakes of England and allowed the freedom to follow any religion.  Of course this is the first amendment, and from this also came freedom of speech, freedom of the press, right to peaceful assembly, and right to petition.

&gt; As for the taxes they are extremely high and if you actually only pay 30% tax I need to get in touch with your accountant.

I didn't use one. No need to. My income and deductions were trivially simple - nothing unusual. Actually I just checked Skatteetaten.no, and with current taxes and my current situation the income tax and national insurance (trygdeavgift) today would add up to about 28-29%. 

The ""headline rates"" are 28% on taxable income + 7.9% national insurance for a basis of 35.9% on taxable income. Then 9% or 12% on anything exceeding the two higher rate brackets (""toppskatt""), and I would pay toppskatt with my current income, even after deductions. But before any of those there's the basic deduction of up to 70k NOK as well as deductions for interest expenses, child care and a number of other things that means that your taxable income is far lower than your gross income. 

Now the *theoretical* maximum approaches 47.9% (but you'd need to be be making millions and not have any deductions for that to be the case. If you did, and spent *all* of that on products subject to VAT (if so, where would you live?), you'd end up paying in 60.9% taxes including VAT.

If part of that cost is alcohol, tobacco or you buy lots of cars you could drive it up higher, but get real - to reach 70% you'd have to be a multi-millionaire alcoholic chain smoking car enthusiast with no place to live. 

While you might pay a higher percentage than me if you factor in car taxes (I don't drive) or have few deductions (mine would add up to about 120k NOK beyond the basic allowance), you'd have to be filthy rich and have a really bizarre spending pattern to even reach 40%.

I know the costs of living in Norway, thanks - I lived in Norway for the first 25 years of my life, and have visited several times a year in the 9 years since.

As for TV license - in the UK it is about $240 a year, and while a lot of things are cheaper, all in all I'm not much better off here than I was in Norway. Housing in London makes Oslo seem cheap and makes up for a lot of the difference. Granted, other parts of the UK are cheaper, but mostly makes up for it with far lower salaries.

And no, I didn't live in Finmark, I lived in Oslo.

I'm all for high-speed rail if it makes sense.  It sounds like a good idea, but it's also unbelievably expensive.  I think you'd need to look at a pretty thoughtful cost analysis before you jump on board.  The US is not a very dense country.  What works well in parts of Europe or Japan doesn't necessarily work well in the US (just as it doesn't necessarily work well in Canada).

You have to be careful not to just automatically think a certain technology that is good for one region is good for all regions.  It also goes beyond just population density.  You have to take into account consumer preferences as well.  People in the US love cars.  They'd rather spend $20 to drive to work than $1.50 to take the bus.

What bothers me is when governments spend shitloads of money for something people really don't want to use, so they take extra steps to punish people for not using their newest toy.  That's not the way it should work.  You should identify a genuine need and then provide a solution that answers this need.

Now, this may be the case with high-speed rail across the US . . . but it may not.  What would be a shame is if we spend trillions of dollars on something we don't end up using.",1425954261

I moved out because I got a really interesting job elsewhere. See, some of us actually enjoy moving around even if we liked it where we moved from. I find it more amusing that you live in Norway when you have so much to whine about, but that's typical Norwegian culture.

&gt; Ive visited most of the countries in Europe and north America and I have many friends who live in those countries. And all of them say its better than Norway; ill believe them and my own experiences over some report made by WHO. 

Yeah, because facts and well founded research is so much more unreliable than anecdotes from someone who has already demonstrated they don't even have a clue at all about how much tax they pay (your ""70%"" comment, which has no basis in reality). It's impossible for me to take you seriously after that.

&gt; Also if you actually knew what you were talking about you would know that the average pay of a Norwegian is in the top two brackets of taxation(toppskatt) and that's not because the average person makes a lot.  You're a joke..

No, it is **NOT**. See http://www.ssb.no/lonnansatt/

Contrary to you I'm not actually pulling numbers out of my ass, but have looked them up. If you're going to try fooling someone, at least try doing it with something that isn't so easy to check.

Average salary (based on 2007 numbers from Statistisk Sentralbyrå) was 32300 NOK per month, or 387.600,- **gross**. Toppskatt kicks inn from a *taxable* income of **441.000,-** or more.

Let's look at what someone making the average salary would actually pay, based on information readily available from the tax authority at www.skatteetaten.no/:

First you need to subtract the base deduction (minstefradraget), of 36% limited upwards to 70.350,-. That leaves 317.250,- **taxable** income before any other deductions, well below the limit of 441.000,- for the *lowest* toppskatt bracket. 

Lets assume **no** deductions, which is highly unusual in Norway given the amount of allowed deductions (as noted, in my case I'd have at least 120k deductions, and during the years from I started working in Norway until I moved to London I didn't once file a tax return without substantial deductions.

Of the 317.250,- net taxable income on an average salary, you would pay 7.8% national insurance (trygdeavgift) for a total of 24.745,-. You would further pay 28% on any taxable income exceeding 40.800,- (which means I actually overestimated my tax in my previous message because I forgot about the floor) or 77.406,-.

Total tax is then 102.151,-, or **26%** of gross income. In reality most people making the average salary would pay less as they would have at least some deductions.

(for comparison, I suggest you also look up average salaries elsewhere - not only does Norwegians in an average salary actually pretty much pay tax at the same percentages as in other European countries, they also earn substantially more than most other places, including the UK which means that despite high prices they come out very well in terms of purchasing power parity)

I can only conclude that you don't have the faintest clue about how the Norwegian tax system works. Having run several companies, managed payroll for my employees, and actually bothered to calculate my own tax both as an employee and as self-employed, I actually do. But even if I didn't, detailed instructions and example calculations are easily available online.

&gt; Norway is nice if you are a non smoking, non driving, no fun having, unemployed, christian family father; anything else and you get fucked over. Don´t believe me? Then move the fuck back from London.

I've spent enough time in Norway to know I enjoy it there just as much as I do in London. I had plenty of fun, was employed at an above average salary, is an atheist with no kids yet. Non smoking, yeah, and not driving which led to spending a fortune on taxis (that I will agree are ridiculously expensive in Norway) and public transport.

Even pretending that it's a fair comparison, it's STILL flawed because he's not factoring in that people in Japan and France have far *more* options for transportation.  Both of them have much more robust public transit options than we do.  Both of them are also much more friendly towards bicycles, mini-cars, and other alternative vehicles.

Note that according to [this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade):

&gt; Slavery varied in form in different African cultures, but in many cases there was no clear distinction between slavery and servitude. In some cases slaves could accumulate property and buy their own freedom - some even rose to the status of rulers 

The European slave trade to the Americas allowed no such thing. The European slave trade to the Americas reduced people to chattel.

Furthermore, on your page:

&gt; It has been estimated that from the 10th to the 19th century some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year

That's about 5.5 million people over 900 years.  Compare to the American slave trade:
12-18 million people (depending on the historian) over 4 centuries:

&gt; Only slightly more than 3 percent of the slaves exported were traded between 1450 and 1600, 16% in the 17th century. More than half of them were exported in the 18th century, the remaining 28.5% in the 19th century.

That's about 75,000 per year during the 18th century. 

My claim:  Africa's technological backwardness has everything to do with population movements, deaths from the *wars* that were used for one African nation to enslave the next, whole societies being reduced as their people were hunted, etc.

Racism has these (above) redditors believe that Africa was backwards because Africans are somehow deficient.  Logic shows, however, that Europeans and Americans were a large contributing factor in the continent's ""backwardness"".

&gt;Clearly not, as money trickles down family trees just as much, if not more, then it comes to the more worthy.


 I have actually given this a bit of thought lately. Having grown up in an upper middle class albeit somewhat unconventional family, I have watched my father a man that joined the US Navy at 17 rather than endure another year of high school bust his ass hard enough so that now at 70 his salary makes him one of the top 1% of all income earners. Is he one of the evil rich that are so decried by the media? His father was straight off the boat from Europe and drove a bread wagon and later a truck. 

  Many of my friends have extremely wealthy parents and as they are moving on it is interesting to see what gobs of money does to people. The old axiom of the first generation makes the wealth, the second generation enjoys the wealth, and the third generation squanders the wealth has played out many times during my life watching families at different stages of the cycle. 
   Is it not as natural for there to be some worthless, shiftless, layabouts in the upper incomes as there are at the lower income levels? My point is that money is dynamic and very hard to hold onto. I have seen people from the bottom make it to the top. In my experience government has never been anything but an impediment to achievement and usually screws up whatever they touch. It is my opinion that for these reasons government should be kept as small as possible. ",1425954565

You shouldn't, but you sound like you don't have a balanced view of history though. Europeans weren't innocent, but then again, nobody was.

I don't buy that and I'll tell you why.  What you're doing is applying your own morality and general sense of the world to people who existed in a time and place that had a very different morality and sense of the world.  You think it's OK to do this because you feel like you are the direct descendant of those you condemn (basically Europeans) and therefore are somehow not obliged to make the same sort of cultural shift or allowance that you would make in other cases.  

I think that's intellectually cheap, a sellout, and basically a false reversion to some kind of universal moral standard that has never really existed at all.

On the other hand, you are not for a moment to imagine that I in any way condone the catastrophic consequences that have *always* been the fruit of contact between technologically disparate groups of humans.  

My point is this; at a certain level, it stops making sense to castigate different groups of human beings based on what *we* see as *their* moral shortcomings when viewed through *our* perspective, when in fact the history of group to group contact where one group has technological superiority, has been virtually identical throughout history and prehistory.  It's always been so that technologically advanced groups have taken advantage of others, and it has nothing to do with ethnicity --Europeans are only the most recent bad guys in this respect-- and has far more to do with basic human nature.  

I want you to cast aside your moral outrage because while it does you credit on an individual level, it does nothing to further your understanding of what's *really* happening when two technologically disparate groups make contact.  To my mind, understanding the mechanics of said encounters in terms of human nature is far more conducive to creating a just world than is shouting about what is and isn't right.  I for one care less about who was right or wrong in the past, then I care about understanding the forces that caused injustice in the first place.  My idea is that it's by understanding said forces that they can best be redressed and ameliorated.       ",1425954593

I don't disagree with that.  My main point in the original post is just to call it what it is.

It's either self-deception on both their parts or they're lying.  (Or some self-serving combination of the two.)

I agree with all your stated benefits of high-speed rail, but all of this is assuming people opt to use the rail in the first place.  Keep in mind that people often use automobiles even when doing so is more expensive and more time-consuming.  Many of the costs of operating an automobile are hidden, so people think of the cost as just the price of gas (which is only about 1/3 of the real cost).

In Japan and Europe, cars are often out of the question simply because of the high cost to own/park them in the first place.

I think your analysis of plane-train transportation is dead on.  Anyone who's ever flown to Tokyo knows you don't actually ever fly Tokyo . . . you fly to Narita and then take a train.  That works, if your only option is to fly anyway, but if you can drive between your destinations in just a few hours, you may choose that option, and it appears most of the proposed high-speed rail segments are essentially just eliminating 3 hour commutes.

Since their plans do not seem to indicate any industrial centers in this town, your estimates are off.

You can't hide energy costs just because because they are somewhere else. If they have no industrial zone (unsurprising, considering the unreliability/cost of solar PV) then their city is pushing their hidden energy usage to some other city, and not compensating for it.

&gt;It is doubtful, for example, that Florida has the same home heating requirements of, say, Wisconsin,

No, instead they have cooling requirements.

http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/waskdays.htm

&gt;Your assumption seems to be that they will, by default, rely exclusively on coal when solar is unavailable.

A large amount of coal (and natural gas), and hence a large amount of CO2. Per your numbers, these fossil fuels are together a super-majority.

&gt;Finally, while the blog may be misrepresenting the facts, and perhaps in many ways the city planners are as well, the city planners are not actually claiming to run the entire city from the 75 megawatt facility. Rather, that is simply the initial amount, ready to be expanded as the town grows.

At what cost? Extrapolating from the $300M/75MW figure, an average city of their size in the US would need 20x$300M = $6 billion worth of solar panels, or $300,000 per household. If a city uses less energy because ""they have no industry"", then fine; the other city, the one with the factories, will need correspondingly more. And the average is the same.

My point is: solar electricity, solar PV or solar thermal collectors, is not a feasible way of cleaning up energy generation. Either it is small and relatively affordable - as in this city - in which case it is too small to make any difference; or it is large enough to make a difference, in which case it's not practical. There is no middle ground: the intensive quantities, of the form (resource)/(energy) - like $/kWh, land area/kW, resources/kW - are just ridiculously unreasonable.

It tends to not be the people who are reproducing at a fast rate who are really the ones who are putting a strain on the planet's resources.  Sure, the poor in third world countries don't have environmentalism as their primary concern.  Money really buys you that privilege, even if developed nations (and the US specifically) tend to have that money and ignore the environment anyway.

But back to my point.  The poor are not the ones that are sapping this planet of resources.  That much is apparent if you simply look at the figures for how many ""planets"" it would take if all ~7 billion people on the planet lived as, say, Americans do, as opposed to living as even your average Chinese or Indian does (I believe it's between 1 and 2 for China and about 9 for the US).  So, as of *right now*, the problem is the West.  

Of course, the standard of living throughout the world is generally on the rise.  More and more Chinese and Indians are moving into their respective countries' middle classes.  However, as far as I can see, overpopulation tends to be a problem that solves itself as long as standard of living goes up.  The better your economic condition, the less children you tend to have.  The population growth rate across Eastern Europe and Southern Africa is [actually negative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_growth_rate_world.PNG).  That's not to say that their standard of living is *great* compared to Western Europe or the US, but both of those areas have very low growth rates.  Compare that to most of Asia or Africa where the standard of living is fairly poor, and you obviously see much higher rates.  

So then you see it doesn't make much sense, as I suppose you already know, to assume that most of the world is going to breed like rabbits *if* we get much more effective at fighting global poverty, and the signs are encouraging.  And so the problem becomes not the growth rate or the number of people, but *standard of living itself*.  The world can stand 7 or 8 billion people living off of small farms and subsistence agriculture, to a point, but it almost certainly cannot absorb the damage from humanity going from a species of under a billion living Western consumerist lifestyles to 7+ billion doing so.

The solution, then, seems to me that we need to come up with better ways to live the better lives that we want to live.  A big part of that is simply not being stupid.  For example, bottled water is a big thing in the US, but a lot of it is simply tap water that's been filtered a bit.  The only real difference between that and something you get out of your faucet through a Brita filter is that the bottled water industry creates enough trash to fill your average landfill in no time at all.  For no reason.  That sort of thing needs to stop, soon, before all the people in the rest of the world who are climbing up the economic ladder pick up our bad habits.",1425954717

The patent system as a protection for mechanical processes isn't a bad thing, but it has serious inherent flaws when applied to biological processes, the main one being that, once you've introduced an adaptation or change into the environment, it's notoriously difficult to control and can be employed as a way of essentially growing monopoly.  That's what has happened to the corn industry in America, and European growers are rightly concerned that the same could happen there.

The exact opposite, in fact.  Far fewer people see farming processes now than did even 60 years ago, due in large part to the automation of the process and, more recently, the conversion of previously open air farms into closed and quarantined factory models.  Farming actually *is* a good deal less pleasant these days -- at least for the animals.  We've bred chickens to the point where they're so heavy their many times more prone to broken legs.

*Fallacy 1: More drivers equals better sound.*

This is abject bullshit.  The reason you use more drivers is that your drivers, depending on the design, do not necessarily reproduce all frequencies.  *Necessarily.*  Ideal speakers use one driver that operates from DC to light.  The more drivers you have, the more stuff you have to notch out with your crossover, the more phase shift you get, the more it sounds like mud.  Back in the '80's professional sound companies used to run 4-band crossovers.  Now they run 3, or 2 if they can get away with it.  Whenever you switch from one driver size to another you create a null in your frequency response.  That's just physics.

*Fallacy 2: Big equals better.*

This completely ignores the physics of sound: air displaced equals volume.  Longer wavelengths equals more air displaced.  Which means you can have a speaker the size of a wall that barely whoofs or you could have some retardo Velodyne cabinet that has an inch and a half of excursion.  Saying ""bigger is better"" is a generalization that works... but as soon as you invoke $100k speakers in your discussion all generalizations are off.

*Fallacy 3: There are no metrics that matter.*

Well, Sensitivity does matter, but only from a design standpoint; unless you're building a PA, your speakers probably go loud enough just fine.  But ""Watts"" FUCKING MATTER, douchebags.  You need to know the max RMS watts the speaker can take so you can match it with the max RMS watts coming off your amplifier.  Amplifier mismatch is one of the leading causes of distortion or (air quotes here) ""bad sound.""  Which, if you're going to be talking about $100,000 speakers, is worth discussing.  Certainly if you're going to deliver salesman saws like ""With good speakers, you want to keep cranking it up, like accelerating a fast car.""

*Fallacy 4: """"physics is dogmatic.""*

Yeah, and psychoacoustics, which is what we're really talking about, is subjective.  Because the Japanese grow up with a language focused on vowels, the Japanese (and most Asian cultures) actually hear midrange and midbass better than Americans and Europeans do.  Likewise, because Americans and Europeans grow up with a language focused on consonants, Westerners actually hear high end and high frequencies better than the Japanese do.  This is why Americans think Japanese speakers sound ""brittle"" and why the Japanese think American speakers sound ""woofy.""  And that has fuckall to do with physics, and everything to do with the most important part of acoustics - the ear that hears it.

There's other bullshit that makes no sense - ""as the copper wire inside heats up, it can deform or melt, and the driver gets messed up"" (if you're worried about melting your speakers, you're listening WAY THE FUCK TOO LOUD - this from a guy who says ""watts don't matter) and Electrostatics:  ""Steve mentioned ribbon tweeters, which are only in the highest-end speaker systems"" (Hey, Steve - here's a pair of ADAM A5s for [$800 a pair](http://www.mercenary.com/adama5.html).  And while we're at it, Wal-Mart used to sell the [SLS Q Line](http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterinaboxinfo/fr/slsqlinefull.htm) for $499 all in - not bad for six speakers and a reciever!) but the bottom line is towards the end:

""Hey, Definitive Audio - how much should we spend on speakers?""

""A thousand dollars.""

To me, that's the most disingenuous pile of bullshit I've ever seen out of the mouth of someone who isn't in the audiophile industry.  They spend 500 words talking about how completely unquantifiable things are (Here's an actual review of a Tannoy loudspeaker - [PDF link](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audioxpress.com%2Freviews%2Fmedia%2FAX901DA.pdf&amp;ei=PJPoSe_nG5v0tAOcjaniAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuAH-RFL7rYJF_S-CCGtrm9KIaGw) - that has polar plots and frequency charts and all that shit the *actual* industry uses to gage speaker performance) and then just give you a price.

The 1995-2006 period is problematic, one because it is so resent, and two because the conclusions from this Winter-08 article are too easy to dismiss without its inclusion of a post Lehman-collapse world.

The article's explanation for the other periods can be oversimplified as the following. Europe's rapid 1950-73 growth was almost inevitable — they already had the strong institutions and highly developed human capital that are lacking in other countries that trail the US, they just needed to rebuild the capital they had wasted and sabotaged by fighting WWII on their own soil. The '73-95 period is different in that in some cases European capital intensity exceeded that in the US. However there was much lower labor participation rate meant, so that while GDP growth/hour worked was still faster (though actual output/hour still trailed) the GDP growth/capita was actually slightly slower than that in the US. They do not attribute working less to higher marginal tax rates alone as many of Krugman's fellow Nobel laureates do, but also point out:

&gt;other labor market issues, such as generous unemployment benefits, **poor educational standards at the bottom**, and high unionization with little coordination also play an important role in accounting for Europe’s rise in unemployment since the mid 1970s. Europe’s welfare state rapidly expanded in the 1970s, causing an increase in labor cost, a **strong bias towards insiders in the labor market**, and **an increase in structural unemployment**, in particular among youth and elderly workers. \[emphasis added\]

Essentially, they are saying that that period was as influenced by a conservative, less-agile economy as it was by marginal tax rates alone.

Then we get to the recent 1995-2006 period. You are right that Table 6 is a good one to look at here. They show US market services\* productivity increase of 3.2% compared to 0.9% in the EU. The authors conclude that the US has done a better job at utilizing information and communication technology with a more liberal economy that has less structural rigidity, and that new business models face a better environment for innovation. Krugman looks at the numbers and sees that 1.2% is from financial services, so only 2.4% (it is additive the way they calculated the numbers) should be real productivity increases. The BEA paper acknowledges that they don't know a good way to measure banking output, yet we can at least use consistent methods. The relative increases in multifactor productivity are interesting here, because it counts all the inputs (which include executive compensation and capital investment such as for buildings, machines, etc). Despite the Wall Street excesses we are well aware of, in the US finance MFP *grew* by 0.4%, while it *declined* by 0.5% in the EU. You have to measure the work they accomplish some way, and if you find that taking all the money used to build the firms and to pay the people one is getting more work accomplished per dollar, then one really is more productive.

And finally! We come around full circle to the beginning. The only way to discount the finance services productivity growth contribution to overall services productivity growth is to postulate that banks do not provide any real service. I don't think that he makes this case convincingly by stating the non-question:

&gt;And given recent events, are we even sure that the expansion of the financial system was doing anything productive at all?

Maybe he could talk about lenders who took advantage of information asymmetries, or he could talk about the diminishing return from increasing expertise in finance and the brain drain from other sectors of the economy. However, I think it is a specious argument to claim the current crisis means growth in financial services expertise produced no value, without better explaining himself.
