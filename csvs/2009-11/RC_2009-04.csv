Regarding ""what people want"", I haven't lived in the US in &gt;10 years.  My impression was always that American cars were bulky, inelegant, inefficient and clumsy.  

I compare an ""average"" car like, say, my grandfather's Pontiac Freebird or Firebob or Four-Iron or whatever it's called, with my dad's 4-door Golf or a friend's Volvo, the interior is plasticky, the body has lots of blobby-looking overhangs, it handles like a handful of wet coleslaw, has no turn radius to speak of, gets middling-at-best gas mileage, has crappy quality paint, is underpowered, and looks plain ugly.  Even my mom's Toyota Corolla (a US-market car, I've never seen any in Europe) is half again as big as most cars here.  You just plain couldn't park them.

I compare this to a 1967 Mustang or even an old Dart or Fairlane and it's clear why GM &amp; co. are doing so badly.  While the first was a real automative revolution, admittedly, the latter two were pretty par for the course regarding engineering and design; they looked pretty good and were well-made.

As for the Crocs comparison -- they are ugly, but functional.

1425946772,"Your comment is extremely ironic. After all, it was France that originally gave Israel the technology to build its nuclear weapons.

&gt; For reactor design and construction, Israel sought the assistance of France. Nuclear cooperation between the two nations dates back as far as early 1950's, when construction began on France's 40MWt heavy water reactor and a chemical reprocessing plant at Marcoule. France was a natural partner for Israel and both governments saw an independent nuclear option as a means by which they could maintain a degree of autonomy in the bipolar environment of the cold war.

&gt; In the fall of 1956, France agreed to provide Israel with an 18 MWt research reactor. However, the onset of the Suez Crisis a few weeks later changed the situation dramatically. Following Egypt's closure of the Suez Canal in July, France and Britain had agreed with Israel that the latter should provoke a war with Egypt to provide the European nations with the pretext to send in their troops as peacekeepers to occupy and reopen the canal zone. In the wake of the Suez Crisis, the Soviet Union made a thinly veiled threat against the three nations. This episode not only enhanced the Israeli view that an independent nuclear capability was needed to prevent reliance on potentially unreliable allies, but also led to a sense of debt among French leaders that they had failed to fulfill commitments made to a partner. **French premier Guy Mollet is even quoted as saying privately that France ""owed"" the bomb to Israel.**

&gt; On 3 October 1957, France and Israel signed a revised agreement calling for France to build a 24 MWt reactor (although the cooling systems and waste facilities were designed to handle three times that power) and, in protocols that were not committed to paper, a chemical reprocessing plant. This complex was constructed in secret, and outside the IAEA inspection regime, by French and Israeli technicians at Dimona...

&gt; Both the scale of the project and the secrecy involved made the construction of Dimona a massive undertaking... At the height construction, some 1,500 Israelis and French workers were employed building Dimona. To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the reactor components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a desalinization plant bound for Latin America. In addition, after buying heavy water from Norway on the condition that it not be transferred to a third country, the French Air Force secretly flew as much as four tons of the substance to Israel.

1425946845,"Why wait for a survival situation? Dandelions in America and Canada(as well as the rest of the world) are not weeds in the sense that they just developed where they grew. In fact, dandelions are the result of nearly 2000 years of selective breeding to produce a plant that grows in nearly all climates, sprouts and produces seed at lower temperatures, concentrates vitamins and mineral at rates of up to 20x better than other edible plants, who's seeds last for many years without degrading and much more. There is no other plant that grows with so little care and offers so much for human food and comfort.

American pioneers brought dandelions to the Americas in the early 1700s and distributed the seed as an easy way to ensure a very early food crop--very important in a time where salted meat was the winter food. The plant itself was brought to Europe from the Far East, where it was used for centuries as a food and medicine.

Right now, while I am struggling to protect my lettuce from the cold, the dandelions are providing fresh, healthy greens everyday.

Roots- Coffee replacement and medicine

Leaves- Food to replace spinach, lettuce, kale, collards, chard. 

Flowers- Base for wine or batter and deep fry for floral ""oysters""

Dry seed heads- separate the seeds and fluff. Seeds replace poppy seeds, fluff can be used as insulation.

Stems- waterproofing and glue

If on the other hand, Ahmadinejad is talking about the Israeli *regime* and wanting to get rid of *that*, it's a very different thing. That's still good reason for the Israelis not to like or trust the Iranians, but what can they expect, given their own treatment of the Palestinians who were in the way when they wanted to create the state of Israel.

&gt; As the world's largest consumer, we can implement this tax on imports.

Not without triggering all sorts of WTO sanctions we can't.

Severe restrictions on our carbon output (also known as our ability to cheaply acquire energy) without corresponding reductions from the other major economies will almost certainly just migrate money and capital from the U.S. and Europe to China and other developing nations. If we were talking about some localized pollutant like smog, that would be a good thing, and would happen naturally: China values the extra economic growth over clear skies, and we're the reverse, so we trade. But greenhouse gasses aren't like that.

Rather than introducing these market distortions, I'd much rather we spent our money coming up with ways to ameliorate emissions more cheaply, either through technology that can be applied at the source, or simply dealing with a warmer climate.

Usually, when an infant is born, their baby teeth are soon to emerge, but even then, their adult teeth are starting to form beneath their baby teeth.  But there doesn't seem to be any possible way for replacement adult teeth to form underneath adult teeth.

The ability to regrow adult teeth is found in some animals, however, so we shouldn't be to quick to assert that it is impossible.  More likely, there is an obscure genetic trigger that for some reason activates at very rare intervals, causing the phenomenon in those extraordinary individuals.

It's not perfect, but it's the best I could find on short order with Google; if you want better, you're going to need to identify a country and pull up some statistics.

[Here's a table of population densities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density).

Sweden is very cheap; broadband there is heavily subsidized, and you're still paying for it, but through taxes instead of on your bill.  That's good for heavy users, because it forces, by law, lighter users to subsidize them, but the dollars are still coming from somewhere.

Korea and Japan are high-density countries where I suspect that most content is transferred locally due to language limitations; good comparisons to the US (transfers anywhere in the English-speaking world) would be Canada, the UK, Australia, Ireland, etc.

ISPs have no reason to not want to sell you product, if they can make money on it.  It's just that that bandwidth does cost money, and pricing schemes haven't necessarily reflected that in the past.

BitTorrent and friends are artifacts of that pricing model.  This is nothing new; back in the day when local phone calls were cheap or free and long-distance ones weren't, people built [Fidonet](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fidonet) to allow data interchange to take advantage of this quirk.

My guess is that, if it's the upstream costs that are dominant, at some point, ISPs will offer reduced prices for purely-local transfers (probably it will count less towards your quota or something), and P2P software will start trying to optionally keep transfers local, which will ultimately be more efficient.

1425947689,"&gt;condom use ACTUALLY IS correlated to a higher rate of HIV/AIDS infection.

Except, of course, for the minor detail that the claim is either a lie, or a deliberate misrepresentation of facts.

Uganda is a perfect counterexample to the absurd claim that condoms lead to higher HIV/AIDS rates.  Prior to Rick Warren's evil minded support of anti-condom forces Uganda had a very low AIDS rate thanks to a program called ABC (""Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condoms"").  Warren threw millions to people who fought hard against the ""condoms"" part and they were successful in virtually ending the use of condoms in Uganda.  Result?  The AIDS rate there skyrocketed, and is continuing to skyrocket.

So the central claim (""increased use/availability of condoms leads to higher AIDS rates"") is demonstorably false.

A sudden upsurge in condom use in areas that have a high AIDS rate also makes sense.  People say to themselves ""hmm, lots of people here have AIDS, I'd better use condoms"".  Since the advent of the newer retroviral drugs it can take decades before we see a significant decrease in AIDS infection because the victims aren't dying as quickly as they used to.

The real question is not so much AIDS per capita, as it is AIDS transmission rates.  As in: do we see an increase, or decrease, in AIDS transmission with the introduction of condoms?  And the answer, completely to the surprise of no one except the Anti Sex League is that condoms reduce the transmission rate of AIDS significantly.

The problem is that some groups, especially the Roman Catholic Church, are being disingenuous, at best.  The RCC may care about preventing AIDS, but it is not the central concern of the Church.  The much more important and pressing goal, from the POV of the Church, is to make people stop fucking for fun.  The idea of sex for pleasure is anathema to the Church, and preventing people from having sex for fun is their primary goal.  The prevention of AIDS is a distant second from their standpoint.

Obviously many individual Catholics disagree with the RCC, I'm friends with a Catholic OB/GYN who not only uses birth control herself, but prescribes it, and performs hysterectomies.  But the Church, as an organization, is completely opposed to such things.

Remember that the Church, in the person of Archbishop Chimoio recently claimed that condoms actually **CAUSED** AIDS because the evil Europeans had deliberately infected condoms with AIDS out of a pathological hatred of Africans.

Quite simply the Church is perfectly willing to lie in pursuit of its primary agenda of ending sex for fun.   Worse, the Church is not only unconcerned about AIDS rates, it is willing to actively promote the spread of AIDS in furtherance of its goal of ending sex for fun.",atheism,False,t1_c08muub,sotonohito,0,True,1238775383,0,0,11,c08muub,t1_c08mtg3,,False,11,,t3_89qha,t5_2qh2p,

This bailout fails any test I can think of for defining is as a Socialist policy. 

In a Strict sense, socialism refers to the common ownership of the means of production with a fair method of distributing the 'wealth' that is created.

In a wider sense socialism can be seen as a broad set of measures that provide social stability and protection for all members of a society.  Usually this is done by the state providing services (directly or indirectly) and regulating private industry.  (This is the European model, things like the minimum wage, nationalised health-care and education, welfare payments and state provided housing would fall into this).

The Bailout in the US fails to meet either criteria, it neither transfers ownership of formerly private assets to common ownership, nor does it support society, in fact the bailout does the opposite, it provides public money to organisations that benefit a very few, in the hope that their survival might ensure that the US economy survives, even if the working class fare badly.

1425948345,"Oh boy, somebody has really taken a liking to the Zionist kool-aid. Lets look at these claims closely.

&gt; 1948 - Israel is invaded by five Arab countries within hours of being established. 

The establishment of Israel had no legal warrant under international law and was a flagrant act of war against the Palestinians (who rightfully refused to accept the grossly inequitable partition plan) and the entire  region. Further the Zionists had already started ethnically cleansing the region creating a huge refugee influx into the surrounding countries which the Arab governments had to resolve. The Zionists started this one. It isn't even close.

&gt;1956 - Israel responds to multiple attacks by Fedayyin from Egypt and to the closing of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships. 

Here are the first few sentences from the wikipedia entry on this war:

&gt;The Suez Crisis, also referred to as the Tripartite Aggression,[4] (Arabic: أزمة السويس - العدوان الثلاثي‎ ʾAzmat al-Sūwais/Al-ʿIdwān al-Thalāthī; French: Crise du canal de Suez; Hebrew: מבצע קדש‎ Kadesh Campaign, or מלחמת סיני Sinai War) was a military attack on Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel beginning on 29 October 1956.[5][6]

Go figure.

&gt;1967 - Nasser closes the straits of Tiran to Israeli ships, which is an act of war. 

Nope, embargoes and blockades aren't considered acts of war and are in fact commonly seen as a way to enact peaceful political and economic pressure without resorting to outright hostilities. Israel was itching for any excuse to launch an invasion. Israel started this one and grabbed huge chunks of land which it still sits on today. It was a premeditated imperial war of expansion by Israel.

&gt;1973 - Israel is invaded on all sides during Yom Kippur 1982

You may have an argument here but most knowledgeable people recognise that it was a just war to regain territories Israel had grabbed in its war of expansion of 67 and still hadn't returned. 

&gt;Israel invades Lebanon to attack the PLO, which had tried to assassinate Israel's ambassador to the UK

So you justify this barbaric invasion because a single diplomat was targeted by a group located there?  Fucking ridiculous. You know how many people died because of this ridiculous invasion?

&gt;and had also fired katyusha rockets at Israel and carried out various other terror attacks. 

Not surprising as Israel was engaged in an illegal occupation and had expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were living in squalid refugee camps. I would be surprised if they didn't launch attacks against Israel. 

&gt;2006 - Israel invades Lebanon to try to get back two soldiers who were captured by Hezbollah which crossed the border into Israel.

Israel was illegally sitting on the Golan Heights and Sheba farms. Israel was also holding Lebanese prisoners at the time which Hezbollah and the Lebanese gov wanted back. So Israel is ultimately responsible for this one as well.

&gt;2008 - Israel attacks the Hamas in Gaza after 8 years of having rockets fired into its cities.

Actually, this round of hostilities was started by Israel after it broke the ceasefire in November by targeting several Hamas members. 

You really need to get your information from more balanced and reliable sources.

&gt;I never said Israel would accept all the refugees back. That would be suicide for Israel. 

Then Israel doesn't genuinely seek an equitable resolution to this long conflict. ""A bad peace is worse than war"" Tacitus said. Real peace here would require all main grievances which drive this conflict to be rectified. The huge number of Palestinian refugees created by Israel is a major one. 

&gt;The Palestinian refugees should be settled in the host countries the same as Jewish refugees from Arab countries were settled in Israel, and don't make claims to have their houses returned.

The expulsion of Jews from Arab countries does not morally justify the ethnic cleansing of the native Pals. Nobody with a brain is going to take this argument seriously.

For a start, wherever 'Westerners' go, they try to create their own little home from home.

People will assimilate as much as they have to, but no more. They will almost always try to follow the rules they were brought up to believe in, as opposed to the 'local' rules.

As someone who has lived in a number of different countries in my life, I have first hand experience of this happening with Brits abroad, just as I have seen it happening with 'foreign' communities here. It's just human nature.

Over time, both communities kinda merge into one, depending on the relevant sizes, consuming parts from both, and dropping other parts, as seems fit. It has happened numerous times in the UK (Norman, Saxon, Roman, etc), and will continue to happen. It's kind of a 'community evolution'.

As long as both parties agree, any purely *civil* law matter can be resolved by Sharia law. I have no problem with this, because it still has to comply with our laws.

First of all they will no doubt be attracted to those of their physical age, or similar, because what's the alternative? There usually aren't many immortal women around, and if there were, the conflict between loving a mortal you may see grow old and die wouldn't be there. 

Looking at it scientifically, if you stop aging as a teen, your brain stays the way it is, even if you gain knowledge with time. So that whole thing where you're told that you don't get full grasp of how activities are dangerous until you're 20 something, so teens do stupid things? Yeah.

But presuming that these immortals are mature for their physical age [some teens are after all mature], and presuming a fantasy setting [often coupled with a historical time period that is vaguely Ye Olde Englandy-Europe where teens were more mature than today] it's not unreasonable at all in terms of attraction.

$1,928 per capita is very low figure if we are talking about total spending. Based on NationMaster statistics, it's [below average](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_hea_car_fun_tot_per_cap-care-funding-total-per-capita). Now, if we are looking at [*private* spending](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_hea_car_fun_pri_per_cap-care-funding-private-per-capita), then the $1,928 looks slightly more in line. Of course, referring to private spending when most industrialized countries have publicly funded health care is incredibly misleading.

Furthermore, most medical research in the world happens in the US. And in some calculations, this has been slipped in partially or as a whole, which naturally inflates the total. I don't if that is the case here, but since the number is low when compared to others, it may not be the case.

And we can't ignore the fact that US health care is more or less a half private, half public arrangement in terms of funding. **It is not a private industry**. And having government pay for private anything usually leads to price hikes as government isn't or can't be a discerning consumer. Nor is it an unregulated industry; the cost of following regulations tends to be very great.

Now, the most important point is one that is rarely mentioned: socialized health care tends to be *undercapitalized*. Which means that, instead of having as many X-ray machines as there is demand for, hospitals only acquire as many X-ray machines as the budget allows. So a direct supply and demand connection is severed, with politicians and bureaucrats directing supply. Which leads to delays and a downgrade in health care. Futhermore, socialized health care allows the government to act as a monopsony, which means that as the government is the only employer in town, they can also set the wages. Thus driving down total costs of health care at the expense of doctors and nurses. Which is huge component in making European health care so cheap (of course at the cost of having an acute deficiency of skilled doctors and nurses).

Now, all this is not meant to claim that the US system doesn't need reforming. I'm simply trying to highlight that the situation isn't a false dichotomy between socialized health care or the US system; that other alternatives exist. And that one should truly look at the reasons that cause the problem in the first place, instead of relying on simplified correlations that looking at expenses tends to give.",politics,False,t1_c08o5ze,Atomics,0,True,1238959320,0,0,5,c08o5ze,t3_8a5k4,,False,5,,t3_8a5k4,t5_2cneq,

There are no follow-on effects, since people won't panic and take their investments out, because it's not an investment scheme.

True. There is no panic since the government doesn't allow people to opt out of the system.

As for claiming that it isn't a Ponzi scheme on account that the government can force people to pay more isn't a very convincing argument. If a Ponzi scheme operator had similar authority as the government, he could just as well order people to pay in more and/or decrease out-going payments.

1425948655,"&gt;The egalitarian society is what proponents of socialism view as the result of the abolition of private property. 

No, they see an egalitarian society a product of the common ownership of the means of production, that is as opposed to an unfair society in which the means of production are held in private and people are unable to fairly benefit from their labour.  It's less of an issue now, but a significant issue when we first started to see real benefits and problems with industrialisation, in short, people worked for very little and produced much for someone else.  

&gt;The true definition of Socialism is the abolition of private property, and you should find this in any serious text.

There is a lot of discussion about this, usually from a left/right perspective, however it is nonsensical to presume that socialism is defined by the abolition of private property (indeed it seems more like right wind propaganda than anything else).  Under a socialist system your private property remains your own, unless that private property happens to be a factory, farm or shop etc.. In which case it is collectively held.  Your iPod, your shoes, your clothes and your bike don't suddenly become everyones, people can't just come into your house and take what they wish.

&gt;The reason socialism does not produce wealth is because wealth is a subjective concept of property. When property is collectively owned, there is no exchange of property between entities making subjective valuations.

This is false, unless you are in a position where the whole world is socialist and everything is abundant, then you will still have what amounts to market forces in play.  Some people will want certain items, other will want something else, at that point things have real and subjective value.  People seem to assume that in a socialist system the idea is that the system should only strive to fulfill needs but not attempt to provide anything else.  Now obviously if you look at the most notable attempts at all out socialism (and I am misusing the term here) such as the Soviet Union, it is clear that those systems failed to even provide for the needs of their citizenry, let alone their 'wants'/

However, this the above is an ideological discourse that is at a tangent to the point.

&gt;As for how this translates to the bail outs, the issue is that property is being appropriated by a collective entity - the government. In this case it is doing it primarily through debt (which will end up as tax) and through the destruction of the currency.

This is true, but not a product of the bailout on its own, inflation, the products of the fractional reserve system, taxation and a few other elements have continuously taken 'wealth' from one group and handed it to another (whether that is the government workers, welfare recipients, universities, road builders or the military).  It is rather clear however that the government have not taken control of the means of production, either directly or indirectly.  This bailout is a rather stark reminder of that, rather than taking over and winding down banks, they have been propped up and ownership has remained with the shareholders.  

The US bailout is not a socialist policy, it does nothing to take from the owners of companies and provide for the workers, it does nothing to promote an egalitarian society.  It does the opposite, it robs ordinary Americans and hands the proceeds to the select few.

&gt;This is why a good measure of how socialist a country is is its ratio of GDP to government spending (although both these statistics are routinely falsified by governments).

No, that is a good measure of government spending, no more and no less.

A measure of how socialist (using the strict definition) a country is would be to look at who owns what, specifically who owns the industry, the mines and the farms.

If you use the absolute definition of socialism then the bailout is clearly not socialist.  If you use the European model of socialism, whereby the state provides certain services, then it isn't that either.  Look at who is benefiting and who is suffering.  It isn't society generally that is seeing a benefit here, it is a select few. 

I assume you have a dim view of anything even akin to socialism, either in an ideological sense or a practical sense, you also seem to be strongly against this bailout.  Well I don't take a dim view of socialism, quite the opposite, although I wouldn't describe myself as either a communist or even a straightforward socialist, I also feel strongly that this bailout is a bad thing, it does nothing to forward my political aims (and frankly it isn't supposed to). 

I should also probably add that I don't think that the fractional reserve system, as it is structured now and in the recent past is viable, nor do I think that banks should be able to loan money in return for interest (direct investments into actual projects or assets is fine), but I do think governments should finance certain core services and provide them to society generally (and pay for them through taxation not deficit spending).

So in short, the bailout is a bad thing, it is not socialism, it is a misguided attempt to retain the status quo that gave rise to the situation.  The situation we find ourselves in is as a result (in my opinion) of mismanagement, over-regulation where it wasn't required and a lack of regulation where it was, a poor legislative agenda generally, greed on the part of banks and individuals and as a result of the kind of mess that occurs when you use mock capitalism to concentrate wealth massively.

Ok,  I am not a mechanic,  bear with me a sec;  but no,  the automatic does not go through the fluid coupling all the time;  the thing locks in,  e.g.,  when on the highway.

Note:  I have learned to drive on manual transmissions;  actually spent half my (driving) life driving those,  I now drive automatics (crossed the pond sometimes along the way);  so I know the gospel,  heard it all before;  from first hand experience however,  driving similar kind of cars (I am a cheapskate,  I go for econoboxes,  not fancy stuff,  i.e.,  nothing above 2L displacement four bangers -- the kind of cars where auto transmissions are supposed to do their worst),  I didn't notice a 20% difference (and as a card carrying cheapskate,  I do pay attention to gas mileage);   I did however notice a greater difference in gas mileage between different styles of driving than I did between auto and manual  (I did mellow a bit with old age);  how much care I take in maintaining the thing properly has also a greater influence IMHO than the difference between auto and manual;  so I would guess that you would also notice a greater difference in gas mileage between two different drivers driving similar cars (not necessarily a difference in skills,  but in driving style) than again, between manual and auto.

EDIT:  if your argument is that driving manual transmissions is more fun,  there is no contest;  also it can (not anymore apparently) reduce the price tag a bit (in Europe,  automatic transmissions are mostly found on higher end cars,  so it is more often than not thought as an expensive luxury);  both are valid arguments.

Now I don't agree with him, but I defend his right to say it. Other European countries protested the conviction.   You are effectively *hurting* a version Christianity to *protect* gays from verbal injury.  

How does one  justify stifling religious liberty (the right to oppose homosexuality) in order to prevent gays' feelings from being injured by some crazy pastor?   Would the law also be brought  against a Muslim preaching against gays?   

It is true that Green was eventually acquitted, but only after being dragged through the mud by a legal process that never should have had this tool at its disposal.

&gt; Also, you are separating muslims from the West, what makes you say that a muslim cannot also be a westerner?

No, I pointed out that ""Most of Europe's Muslims did have a thicker skin, and ignored these insults, just like **all other** good Western citizens.""   Did you have a hard time understanding this blindingly obvious sentence?

I'm not sure the West prides itself on 'respect'.   And 'equality' is a complicated concept, often at odds with freedom.  And 'freedom' and *mandatory* respect can conflict.

1425949539,"&gt; Two solar power plants in San Luis Obispo County, California will produce as much energy as a nuclear power plant. 

Wrong, unless they last, at the very least, four times as long as a NPP, which would be about 200-300 years.  The installed capacity, AFIACS, is 750MW, which is larger than the installed capacity some of the smallest nuclear.  However, the utilization (how much MW do you actually produce at a given time) of NPP is roughly 90% (European number, but US should be in the ballpark), while the best utilization factors for PV I know of are 24%.  

That means NPP has much higher net energy production per year and MW than PV, and hence 750MW NPP installed capacity will produce almost 4 times the energy 750MW PV will.  Doesn't mean this project isn't impressive.  

&gt; Combined, the two installations will cover 12.5 square miles of undeveloped land.

Thanks for the encouragement.  We are all human, and no matter what we learn or how much we advance, encouragement is always respected.

&gt;I've only just been getting into politics/government/economics for the past 6 months, but my intuition is strong when it comes to the power of free market capitalism.

If I can recommend anything, it is to *not* listen to central planners.  They are not interested in the human spirit, they are only concerned with squashing it.  They use other people's actions as an excuse for whatever dogma they want you to believe in, but every person's ideas and wants are a reflection of themselves.  If they want more control in society, what they really want is to have control over others, because they can't deal with people in a rational way, so they force it.  They want to control other people because their philosophy is based on collectivism, the most evil philosophy there is for mankind.  If you look at history, at all the evil dictators and declining civilizations, in every single case, with no exception, it was caused by institutions that are based on a collectivist philosophy.  Roman Empire, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and today in the US and Europe.  If you take the time to understand the philosophy that institutions are based on, you can then understand the destruction that is unleashed.

Never, and I mean NEVER, waver from wanting liberty and freedom.  This yearning and fight has been taking place for thousands of years, in many civilizations, and wherever that drive is lost, oppression and cruelty replace it.  

Many people, unfortunately, have this ameliorative philosophy, popularized by Karl Marx.  This philosophy is there is an (alleged) absolute, inescapable progressive social process, where no matter what form society takes from one generation to the next, it is considered progress and improvement.

If you consider this for a moment, you will be able to see how pernicious and influential that philosophy is among the majority of the public.

So they think that if we get rid of liberty, economic freedom, capitalism, etc, then it will be considered progress.  But what they don't understand is that freedom and liberty can only exist if people want it.  If nobody wants it, then it is not going to exist.  It is the responsibility we must assume because we have free will.  Our ideas are much more powerful than most people realize.  For the last couple hundred years this realization has quietly been lost, because of irrational philosophy, and that is why brute force has taken the place of reason.

The human race needs real intellectuals, and although I am not famous, I sure as hell know that the philosophy I have is the best that mankind has to offer.

&gt;However, I have had trouble articulating my position when discussions arise amongst friends and family. Thus, I am curious, what do you recommend as the best means to learn this material?

You have to start from the beginning.  Since none of us got the proper education in school, we have to teach ourselves.  It's a long process.  Be prepared to spend the next 5 to 10 years of serious self-study.  Remember, you are going to fix 16 years of brainwashing.  Some things cannot be done overnight.  We are a society now of quick fixes and quick solutions, but the steady mind is never shaken.

So, start with philosophy.  You have to start with philosophy because it is the bedrock upon which every other field of knowledge is based.  If you don't have a philosophy, you are like an airplane pilot with no radar and no windshield.  Sure you know if you are airborne or if you hit the ground, but you will never know why.

Some good philosophers are Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, David Hume, Wilhelm Von Humboldt, Herbert Spencer, Ayn Rand, Lisander Spooner.  In addition to reading what they had to say themselves, read what they said about their predecessors.  That is the best way to learn in depth the various ideas.

After, or during if you get bored of just philosophy, start reading the laissez faire economists.  The reason I recommend reading them first is because that is where the real economic *principles* are found.  In socialist economist writing, there is more of what they *want* to be true, rather than what *is* true.  For economists, I recommend starting at the beginning, with the French Physiocrats, like Quesnay, and Turgot.  There is not much surviving material, but you will be amazed at what 17th century level thinking produced.  These intellectuals are the world's first economists.  After that, read the British Classicals.  Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, John Stuart Mill (James' son, and better IMHO), John McCulloch, John Baptist-Say, Fredrick Bastiat, Charles Holt Carroll (he wrote a wicked series of essays in the mid 19th century showing how fractional reserve banking causes the business cycle).

After that, read the Austrians Carl Menger, Von Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, and George Reisman.  My favorite is Reisman.  His 1000 page book Capitalism is in my opinion the best economics book ever written, and I have read a lot.  If you master this book, you'll become untouchable.

After all this, you have to read history.  And I mean a lot of history.  The best part is that your interest in economics matches the need to know history.  Economists, surprisingly, always write the best history books.  If you read all the history books from Rothbard, such as his awesome books ""History of Economic Thought"", ""Conceived in Liberty"", and ""History of Money and Banking"".  Also read his writer idols, H. L. Mencken and S.J. Perelman.

Of course, if you want to sharpen your skills, you have to read not only the good people, but the bad.  After you have read all the good, go through all the books of the enemies of capitalism and liberty.  Read Karl Marx, Keynes, Galbraith, Stiglitz, Samuelson, Nordhaus, and Krugman.  Their miasmas of cerebral diarrhea are much easier on a mind that is prepared to withstand the contradictions, misinterpretations, and outright fallacies.

In terms of websites, the Mises Institute is the best for the amount of information and free books (many of which are in my list here).  Lew Rockwell is awesome too, although it is less academic.  Campaign for liberty is great as you say, it has lots of knowledge.

1425949891,"This isn't entirely relevant to your comment, but I had to piggyback it onto a comment that is higher up in the thread so that people can see it.  In the comment section of the article, there is one comment thread named ""Frankly.""  I was reading through that comment thread when I ran across this very insightful post. 
&gt;I think your year in Dubai must have been at least five years ago… before the property boom and influx of expats actually peaked.

&gt;I have lived here for going on five years and I can tell you quite honestly that most of the 'facts' written in this feature are entirely true, if not simply based on what is commonly known, but not discussed, in this concrete desert.

&gt;I am gay and since arriving here I have been privy to many a sweaty night out surrounded by Arab, European &amp; American gays. Muslim culture dictates UAE national men and women are forbidden to date prior to marriage. Therefore, there's thousands of young Emirati &amp; Arabic guys looking for some! I have never found easier in my life to pick up men as I found in my time here! A simple walk through a mall can mean anything up to 3 or 4 khandoora clad Emirati boys slipping mobile numbers into my hand, not to mention the ubiquitous 'are you married?' conversation with horny taxi drivers looking for a quick fix before the end of their shift. (however, I do avoid the latter)… Dubai is also such a superficial city that everyone who lives here &amp; is lucky enough to have a comfortable life (by this I mean the ones who aren’t slaves) are so self obsessed with their own appearance that it is often hard to distinguish who is gay and who is straight. 

&gt;Regarding the ‘facts’, yes there are thousands of ‘slaves’ here. Labourers, maids, office workers, waiters, sanitation workers, taxi drivers; all here getting paid a pittance for long hours, no breaks and the promise of a ‘better life’. These people might be working in less taxing professions but once here they find themselves living in a country that caters only to the super rich. Everything is overpriced and accommodation costs have risen to ridiculous levels. I think the better off in Dubai know full well how corrupt it is here but they just get on with their lives because going home to work in grey, wet &amp; cold cities, whilst paying tax, is actually worth the guilt.

&gt;With regards to other aspects left out of this article, this country is so hypocritical with its laws it borders on the laughable: Unmarried couples/friends being forbidden to share accommodation yet you would have to be on $10,000 per month to afford a 1 bedroom apartment. Women being asked to cover themselves out of respect for 'Muslim culture' yet tourist are shipped into 'Arabian Night’ events with belly dancers flashing their semi-naked torsos at the audience. Debt being forbidden yet every single bank offering loans and credit cards whether you bank with them or not. An 'Open doors' policy yet anything Christian or Buddhist being banned from the media. Alcohol licences being required by ex-pats in order to purchase alcohol yet you can freely drive 35minutes in order to buy it ‘illegally’ from Um Al Quwain where one is served by, or standing in a queue behind a line, of UAE nationals. 

&gt;The author also didn’t touch on the fact that many UAE nationals find themselves so completely above the law that hundreds of people die on the roads each year due to their lack of experience or respect for other drivers... and that they can get off with as little as a slap on the wrist or a fine for wiping out an entire family of five. In my time here, every single fatal accident I have read about or seen has involved a white 4x4 - the car of choice for young Emirati men. 

&gt;Frankly, Dubai is not a beacon of the modern Muslim world. It is a melting pot of money, parties, socialising, arrogance, greed, racism and hypocrisy... I’m not condoning this at all. It is simply a fact of life here. The treatment of the lower classes is downright disgusting but it DOES happen… people ARE leaving in floods because of bad debt… the picture painted of Dubai is NOT what it seems and the country we all came to IS, quite frankly, falling apart. It is ALL TRUE!

While it's popular to blame the Catholics for all sorts of crimes, the truth is that despite their superstitions they were the only entity in Europe that  had any respect for books and knowledge at all.

There's a reason why all the really old universities were originally run by the priests - or were even seminaries. In a world where ""the best and the brightest"" were expected to fritter away their lives in petty little battles, the cloistered monks were the only ones that even remembered that the world had once been different.

Hell, at the very beginning of the scientific age, it was the priests who were so keen on the idea of sharing knowledge with each other and other educated people - creating the most fundamental principle of the scientific method, which is that if you don't publish, it doesn't count. (If you don't believe me - check out the various *Connections* shows by James Burke and the BBC - he repeatedly made reference to how a few priests acted at a scientific clearinghouse during the renaissance, passing information back and forth between various ""natural philosophers"" who were working out the principles of things like air pressure and the beginnings of chemistry....)

Think about that for a second - history is full of geniuses who were centuries or millennia ahead of their time - but because those geniuses jealously guarded their knowledge, it died with them - which is why we don't really know how the sword smiths of Damascus made their amazing swords, or the chemical composition of greek fire or whether Archimedes really was capable of making a mechanical calculator for predicting eclipses.

You can blame the Catholics for being a bunch of superstitious reactionaries who held back the Enlightenment when it came - but without them, the Enlightenment probably would never have happened.

1425950111,"It's getting really hard to respond to this thread, since I can't even get one full post on my screen anymore.

Let me start off by saying that you can't quote Ilan Pappe one paragraph after you dismiss the article I referenced because the American Media has always been partial to Israel.  Ilan Pappe is an historian whose work has been discredited in his own department.  He views history as a set of ""narratives"" from which you can pick and choose, because they're all ""true"" in their own way.  He chose one to match his ideology.  There have been a number of students in his department who made similar claims in their theses, only to have claim later that they made some things up.  Saying that Israel had a master plan to cleanse Palestine of Arabs based on what Ilan Pappe says is like saying that Barack Obama is a communist Muslim anti-American who plans to destroy the US based on what Rush Limbaugh says.  It's like saying that God created life through Intelligent Design because there are some ""biologists"" who say so.  It's like saying that God created the earth in six days a bit less than 6000 years ago because there are some young earth ""geologists"" that say so.

Note that I'm not saying this to discredit *your* views (although I *do* disagree with them).  I'm saying this to discredit your *argument*.  If you have any other references other than Ilan Pappe and his students I'll be happy to discuss them.

So what are we left with?

* ""Who started"" the wars in 1956, 1967 and 1982.
* A solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees.


So, you have a point that the Sinai war in 1956 wasn't started by Israel.  I claim that the British and the French had impure motives here, and that there were impure parts in Israel's motives too.  However, Israel had a pure motive here too, which was to stop the attacks coming from Sinai and Gaza, which was still part of Egypt.

Israel started hostilities in 1967 after a 3 week period of waiting (the hamtana) in which tensions were rising and it was clear all over that there *was* going to be a war.  Israel chose to strike preemptively in a defensive move in a war that was itching to start.  I don't see how Egypt thought it would avoid hostilities by closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships.

Regarding 1982, if you ask that I take into account the context of the Palestinian situation, then I have to ask you to take into account the context of the Holocaust and 2000 years of persecution when you discuss the establishment of the state of Israel.  In my view the context of Jewish history trumps the plight of the Palestinians.  That doesn't mean I think they should be mistreated or their problems ignored, nor do I think it gives Israel the right to act immorally.  It does mean that Israel has as much right to defend itself against enemies in *any* context as any other state or entity.

Regarding the second point, of solving the Palestinian refugee problem, you say that comparing the Mizrahim to the Palestinians in this context is wrong, because the Mizrahim are no longer stateless refugees.  I claim that that's *exactly* why they should be compared.  The Mizrahim and the Palestinians started out the same.  The Mizrahim were refugees in refugee camps in Israel, while the Palestinians were refugees in the neighboring Arab countries.  Moreover, the Mizrahim didn't have UNWRA to help them out.  Israel took responsibility for the refugees in its territory and integrated them into the state.  The host countries of the Palestinian refugees didn't.  That's why the Palestinians are still refugees, and the Mizrahim aren't.  That's why the Jordanian option is the correct solution (along with the Lebanese option for the Palestinians in Lebanon, and the Egyptian option for the refugees in the Gaza strip (by which I imply returning Gaza to the Egyptians), and the Syrian option for refugees in Syria).  

I challenge you to find a major refugee situation in which the refugees returned home.  Think of the Jewish refugees in post-WWII Europe, of German refugees from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, of refugees from the war in Rwanda or any other conflict in Africa, of Vietnamese boat people.  Oh, you may find some exceptions to the rule, but in general refugees find a new life elsewhere.  That may be ""immoral"", and it most certainly is unpleasant, but that's the best solution all around.

I don't justify ethnic cleansing of any sort.  However, I don't think what went on here in 1948 was ethnic cleansing.

Let me add one more thing.  If you support the right of a people to return to their homeland, then you must support the return of the Jews to Palestine.  If you don't support that right for the Jews, you can't logically support it for the Palestinians.",worldnews,False,t1_c08q4j6,nfellman,0,True,1239171535,0,0,1,c08q4j6,t1_c08q17a,,False,1,,t3_89ndy,t5_2qh13,
1425950114,"They do, but if it's a horse that lived and was slaughtered in the US, it's a really, really bad idea. I support banning horse slaughter on US soil as well as banning the transport of horses from the US to other countries for the purpose of slaughter for human consumption. Why? Let me put it to you this way:

Even if you ignore the animals' welfare and the fact that the slaughter process used for horses in the US was designed for cattle, which are extremely different physically and behaviorally, meaning it's often very cruel... even if nothing about the suffering of the horses themselves persuades you, it's downright unethical to pass horsemeat off as suitable for human consumption when it comes from the US.

I have a horse. If I go on any given day and look in my tack box, I'll find various creams, medicines, ointments, grooming sprays, etc, with the following warning: ""Not for use in animals intended for human consumption."" These range from the just-not-studied-in-humans to known carcinogens that are stored in muscle tissue for *years* after being administered to an animal. It's illegal to give most of these things to cattle, but there is no tracking or testing process to determine if these known toxins and carcinogens are present in horsemeat exported for human consumption.

The EU has a strict ""passport"" system that does a pretty good job of tracking animals and determining whether or not they are suitable for human consumption, but they don't apply the same strict standards to imported meat. In other words, there's a giant loophole that allows the shipping and sale of toxic, carcinogenic horsemeat.

Personally, I'd like to say anyone who'd eat a horse deserves what they get, since they're among my favorite animals. But I just can't really justify in any way feeding known carcinogens to children in other parts of the world so a meat producer can make a buck.

However I applied for jobs I never would have considered a year ago, but I also read about jobs that seemed very interesting once I started to learn more about them.

I know it's a very painful situation, but you have to confront the pain. You have to ignore all negative feelings about yourself and the future. It's also very cathartic. I had to look into myself and ask myself what I wanted in life. To be honest I have been very disillusioned on and off.

This may sound obvious, but your lack of motivation is not going to disappear unless you start to do something. In the worst case, you'll get into a bad depression if this goes on.

I don't know why you lack motivation, but I think I have some kind of understanding of what you are going through. I know I never want to experience these last few months again.

* Don't sit at home looking for jobs. Looking for jobs is your new job. Separate your new job from your personal life/leisure time. Bring your laptop to a coffee shop and work for some hours. Don't worry about jobs when you're at home.

* Make a template CV/resumé and cover letter. Make small changes depending on which position you are applying for, but don't put to much effort into individual applications. The rejection will feel much harder if you get all fired up about a potential job.

A) No government is responsible. Which we both agree is false.

B) It doesn't matter whether it's a centre-left or centre-right government, they have committed the same errors.

The Japanese thought they could negotiate a better deal, which is why they wouldn't surrender. In a non-atomic age, they knew that a protracted land war with guerilla resistance would not be in the allies' best interests particularly with Europe more or less destroyed. The problem for the Japanese was that the Soviets revoked a non-agression treaty. Whilst the Chinese weren't a serious threat, they knew that they couldn't fight the Russians, Allies and Chinese all at the same time, even without the bomb.

Also, if the Allies were to land on Japan (as planned in Operation Downfall), they would have to reconsider their proposed terms because the Japanese also didn't want a protracted land war against multiple sides. To put this into perspective, a Japanese invasion by the US would've probably resulted in immediate surrender so long as the Emperor maintained rule to avoid coming under Soviet dominion or the country being broken up like Germany. A Soviet invasion would result in an immediate unconditional offer of surrender in exchange for help from the Allied forces because of the worry that the Soviets and Chinese would try to make a land grab.

&gt;During his second voyage, Columbus and his men instituted a policy in Hispaniola which has been referred to by numerous historians as genocide. The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved and murdered. Hundreds were rounded up and shipped to Europe to be sold; many died en route. For the rest of the population, Columbus demanded that all Taino under his control should bring the Spaniards gold. Those that didn't were to have their hands cut off. Since there was, in fact, little gold to be had, the Taino fled, and the Spaniards hunted them down and killed them. The Taino tried to mount a resistance, but the Spanish weaponry was superior, and European diseases ravaged their population. In despair, the Taino engaged in mass suicide, even killing their own children to save them from the Spaniards. Within two years, half of what may have been 250,000 Taino were dead. The remainder were taken as slaves and set to work on plantations, where the mortality rate was very high. By 1550, 60 years after Columbus landed, only a few hundred Taino were left on their island. In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained.

1425950770,"&gt;""always a give away that a defense mechanism is at work""

Why? I pretty honestly don't respect intellectuals much other than what they really produce in their own field of research, because I think their shielded life makes them voefully inadequate in the field of practical wisdom (common sense, phronesis).

&gt;""Ethical claims are prescriptive, and do not need to honour ontology.""

But it itself is a _prescriptive_ statement, it is your value judgement about value judgements. My value judgement is that ethics must _work_, it must be useful, practical, therefore it must be based on historical experience or empirical psychology or whatever, I think it's crazy for a zebra to want to become a lion, it should want to become a good zebra and nothing more, which MUST be based on a good understanding what a zebra _is_.

&gt;""a liberal rights based model, or a utilitarian goods based model""

Models. Theoretical speculations, based on almost nothing _real_, at least that's what I found when I've read the perhaps most important book on social justice, Rawls's A Theory Of Justice. How should we think if we were bodiless souls etc. Right. That sounds practical and based on real life? Er... not.

No insult meant, hope none is take but this is exactly why I disrespect intellectuals (except in their own fields). Any reasonably old and experienced blue-collar person has more common sense: they think more limited, more cautious, more practical-minded ways.

&gt;""Material causality is not relevant to political deliberation.""

Except that violating cause and effect leads to unexpected consequences. Tweaking one factor of the system, tweakers hope that nothing else will change, but of course it will if it's part of a causal chain.

&gt;""As it is, ethical and political reasoning argue toward their goal, and are not deduced from given conditions.""

Why? It's by no means the only possible way to think up practical programs. One can for example do it the other way around: see how things are and see how much and what kind of improvement do the conditions allow. 

Thankfully, teleology was almost completely eliminated from science f.e. from evolution, why keep it around in political philosophy?

""What is ideological typically misreads historical experience as a material given""

No, the definition of ideology is: the logos (or logic) of an idea. Idea + logos, pretty straightforward. Ideology is trying to explain history by a model, an idea, claiming history has an internal logic, such as class struggle or racial struggle or something like that. 

""Legitimacy lies in agreement."" That's democractic fundamentalism and easy to disprove. Would it be acceptable if 51% voted to kill 49%? If not, then the agreement of the majority is not enough. Perhaps the agreement of all? Nope: criminals don't agree to be sent to prison, yet they need to be. Thus the agreement of all is not needed, the agreement of the majority is not enough. Whose agreement is needed then?

Hint: I think legitimacy is not very important. The important thing is to have working, practical ideas, legitimacy can be seen as a mere tool to find them.

""We relate to it, but as reflexive beings, we are able to modify its effects and self-select better outcomes in democratic procedures.""

Democractic procedures. What a naive illusion... there is no such thing. Democratic procedures everywhere from Asia to Europe to America are choosing between 2-4 elite groups, usually based on who has the better haircut or the better slogan. Please. Let's get real. Whenever something got done, it was done by some intellectual or pressure group convincing/bribing the folks who won (by a haircut or a slogan) that it would be either a good thing for the people and/or in his own interests.

No seriously honest person is a harcore democrat - who would really want the dumbest people (those with the greatest number) to rule? Usually, to be a democrat is to say ""I have some very convincing ideas, so let the people rule because I think they will listen to my ideas, so through a proxy, basically, I will rule."" Not a very honest position.

The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was obviously one of the great turning points in
world history. It is an event over which misinformation abounds. The myth-makers and
re-writers of history have done their landscape painting jobs well. The establishing of
Communism in Russia is a classic example of the second ""big lie"" of Communism, i.e.,
that it is the movement of the downtrodden masses rising up against exploiting bosses.
This cunning deception has been fostered since before the first French Revolution in
1789.
Most people today believe the Communists were successful in Russia because they were
able to rally behind them the sympathy and frustration of the Russian people who were
sick of the tyranny of the Czars. This is to ignore the history of what actually happened.
While almost everybody is reminded that the Bolshevik Revolution took place in
November of 1917, few know that the Czar had abdicated seven months earlier in March.
When Czar Nicholas II abdicated, a provisional government was established by Prince
Lvov who wanted to pattern the new Russian government after our own. But,
unfortunately, the Lvov government gave way to the Kerensky regime. Kerensky, a socalled
democratic socialist, may have been running a caretaker government for the
Communists. He kept the war going against Germany and the other Central Powers, but
he issued a general amnesty for Communists and other revolutionaries, many of whom
had been exiled after the abortive Red Revolution of 1905. Back to mother Russia came
250,000 dedicated revolutionaries, and Kerensky's own government's doom was sealed.
In the Soviet Union, as in every Communist country (or as they call themselves-the
Socialist countries), the power has not come to the Communists' hands because the
downtrodden masses willed it so. The power has come from the top down in every
instance. Let us briefly reconstruct the sequences of the Communist takeover.
The year is 1917. The Allies are fighting the Central Powers. The Allies include Russia,
the British Commonwealth, France and by April 1917, the United States. in March of
1917, purposeful planners set in motion the forces to compel Czar Nicholas II to abdicate.
He did so under pressure from the Allies after severe riots in the Czarist capitol of
Petrograd, riots that were caused by the breakdowns in the transportation system which
cut the city off from food supplies and led to the closing of factories.
But where were Lenin and Trotsky when all this was taking place? Lenin was in
Switzerland and had been in Western Europe since 1905 when he was exiled for trying to
topple the Czar in the abortive Communist revolution of that year. Trotsky also was in
'exile, a reporter for a Communist newspaper on the lower east side of New York City.
The Bolsheviks were not a visible political force at the time the Czar abdicated. And they
came to power not because the downtrodden masses of Russia called them back, but
because very powerful men in Europe and the United States sent them in.
Lenin was sent across Europe-at-war on the famous ""sealed train."" With him Lenin took
some $5 to $6 million in gold. The whole thing was arranged by the German high
command and Max Warburg, through another very wealthy and lifelong socialist by the
name of Alexander Helphand alias ""Parvus."" When Trotsky left New York aboard the
S.S. Christiania, on March 27, 1917, with his entourage of 275 revolutionaries, the first
port of call was Halifax, Nova Scotia. There the Canadians grabbed Trotsky and his
money and impounded them both. This was a very logical thing for the Canadian
government to do for Trotsky had said many times that if he were successful in coming to
power in Russia he would immediately stop what he called the ""imperialist war"" and sue
for a separate peace with Germany. This would free millions of German troops for
transfer from the Eastern front to the Western front where they could kill Canadians. So
Trotsky cooled his heels in a Canadian prison-for five days. Then all of a sudden the
British (through future Kuhn, Loeb partner Sir William Wiseman) and the United States
(through none other than the ubiquitous ""Colonel"" House) pressured the Canadian
government. And, despite the fact we were now in the war, said, in so many words, ""Let
Trotsky go."" Thus, with an American passport, Trotsky went back to meet Lenin. They
joined up, and, by November, through bribery, cunning, brutality and deception, they
were able (not to bring the masses rallying to their cause but) to hire enough thugs and
make enough deals to impose out of the gun barrel what Lenin called ""all power to the
Soviets."" The Communists came to power by seizing a mere handful of key cities. In fact,
practically the whole Bolshevik Revolution took place in one city-Petrograd. It was as if
the whole United States became Communist because a Communist-led mob seized
Washington, D. C. It was years before the Soviets solidified power throughout Russia.
The Germans, on the face of it, had a plausible excuse for financing Lenin and Trotsky.
The two Germans most responsible for the financing of Lenin were Max Warburg and a
displaced Russian named Alexander Helphand. They could claim that they were serving
their country's cause by helping and financing Lenin. However, these two German
""patriots"" neglected to mention to the Kaiser their plan to foment a Communist revolution
in Russia. The picture takes on another dimension when you consider that the brother of
Max Warburg was Paul Warburg, prime mover in establishing the Federal Reserve
System and who from his position on the Federal Reserve Board of Directors, played a
key role in financing the American war effort. (When news leaked out in American
papers about brother Max running the German finances, Paul resigned from his Federal
Reserve post without a whimper.) From here on the plot sickens.
For the father-in-law of Max Warburg's brother, Felix, was Jacob Schiff, senior partner in
Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. (Paul and Felix Warburg, you will recall, were also partners in Kuhn,
Loeb &amp; Co. while Max ran the Rothschild-allied family bank of Frankfurt.) Jacob Schiff
also helped finance Leon Trotsky. According to the New York Journal-American of
February 3, 1949: ""Today it is estimated by Jacob's grandson, John Schiff, that the old
man sank about 20,000,000 dollars for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia."" (See
Chart 6.)
One of the best sources of information on the financing of the Bolshevik Revolution is
Czarism and the Revolution by an important White Russian General named Arsene de
Goulevitch who was founder in France of the Union of Oppressed Peoples. In this
volume, written in French and subsequently translated into English, de Goulevitch notes:
""The main purveyors of funds for the revolution, however, were neither the crackpot
Russian millionaires nor the armed bandits of Lenin. The 'real' money primarily came
from certain British and American circles which for a long time past had lent their
support to the Russian revolutionary cause…
De Goulevitch continues:
""The important part played by the wealthy American banker, Jacob Schiff, in the events
in Russia, though as yet only partially revealed, is no longer a secret.""
General Alexander Nechvolodov is quoted by de Goulevitch as stating in his book on the
Bolshevik Revolution:
""In April 1917, Jacob Schiff publicly declared that it was thanks to his financial support
that the revolution in Russia had succeeded.
In the Spring of the same year, Schiff commenced to subsidize Trotsky …
Simultaneously Trotsky and Co. were also being subsidized byMax Warburg and Olaf
Aschberg of the Nye Banken of Stockholm … The Rhine Westphalian Syndicate and
Jivotovsky,. whose daughter later married Trotsky.""",Economics,True,t1_c08rmtj,[deleted],0,True,1239337095,0,0,1,c08rmtj,t3_8b6ub,,False,1,,t3_8b6ub,t5_2qh1s,

The US - not unlike China, western Europe, Scandinavian countries, and the former USSR all have *hybrid* economies which take elements of both. Some countries lean further in one direction than the other, but there's never been a pure system and never will be.

I'm damn happy with socialist security (police and national defense), education, postal service and fire protection. I like our social safety nets and want to make them stronger. I wish we'd socialize healthcare and more of our national transportation infrastructure. At this point I'm even flirting with the idea of socialized banking.

Meanwhile, I'm quite happy with capitalist markets for consumer goods, entertainment, and luxury services, provided there's minimal product safety regulation.

I think that a properly incentivized free market is the way to solve our energy and climate change problem. I think that adopting socialist principles will cure much of what ails our healthcare system. I think economic sectors that lend themselves to natural or de facto monopolies (utilities, for example), that monopoly ought to be the government. Meanwhile I don't think the government should prohibit competition where private industry can compete: let UPS deliver first class mail to mailboxes.

I'm confident that if you tax me at an appropriate level to fully fund all of the socialist sectors of the economy, I'll still have enough left over that I can participate in the capitalist sectors of the economy.

A few gems:

&gt;In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell and Boris Johnson, then editor of The Spectator magazine, Berlusconi claimed that Mussolini ""had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them ""on holiday""


&gt;In mid-May 2005, while opening the European Food Safety Authority in Parma (preferred over a Finnish location, after Berlusconi made an assertion of Finns ""not knowing what prosciutto is""), Berlusconi claimed that he had to ""dust off my playboy skills"" with the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to convince her to locate the EFSA in Parma.


&gt;In March 2006, Berlusconi defended accusations he made that the ""Communists used to eat children"", by responding with claims that ""... read the Black Book of Communism and you will discover that in the communist China of Mao, they did not eat children, but had them boiled to fertilise the fields""


&gt;At a joint press-conference at Villa La Certosa (17 April 2008) in Sardinia with the Russian president Vladimir Putin, a Russian journalist, Natalia Melikova, put a question to Putin, asking him if he intended divorcing his wife and marrying Alina Kabaeva, an Olympic gold medalist and an MP in Russia. When his guest showed annoyance, Berlusconi intervened with a gesture toward the journalist that imitated a gunman shooting [90]. The journalist was reportedly reduced to tears. Putin denied rumours that he was to marry Kabaeva.


&gt;On 18 November 2008, Berlusconi played ""hide-and-seek"" with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He was set to receive Merkel but opted to hide behind a column while Merkel and her entourage walked by. According to reporters present, Berlusconi called out ""coo coo"", prompting Mrs Merkel to turn around, saying ""Oh, Silvio"".

1425951740,"A gypsy is an ethnic group that somehow ended up in south eastern Europe. They're related to Indians and have been around for centuries. They make up around 10% or so of Romania but its hard to tell because there is de-facto segregation in Ro, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, France, Spain, and anywhere else with significant populations. They're extremely poor, mainly because of political problems in their home countries, racism, disenfranchisement and other pervasive problems. The legacy of the ""thieving Gypsy"" is prevalent throughout these countries but only because they are a marginalized community in historically important parts of the world. Ironically, Romanians as a whole are marginalized throughout Europe because of the stereotypes they have set up in their own country.

1425951760,"&gt;It seems to me that if socialism were really a good idea people would do it voluntarily and the government would not have to force people to participate. Force is only required to make people do things they don't see as beneficial.

Actually, I would say that is the central problematic issue with all institutionalized forms of socialism in our world.  If socialism isn't run from the bottom up, from the people deciding to socialize together, and not asking a government to be an intermediary, you can have a socialism that *might* work (I ain't makin any bets.  I'm of the mind that *most* governments/economic ideals really work.  The most we can do is try to do our best.).

Anyway, to respond to the OP, the main difference between those is the implementation of the governance.  In europe its essentially democratic socialism, so, its still democratically elected governance/representation, just with more taxation and social programs.

The Native American populations were very small after about 1600, and the continents were very sparsely populated at the time that serious colonization began to take place. And the reason is diseases such as smallpox which the Native Americans had almost no immunities to, and the death rate among them was far larger than the Black Death for Europeans centuries before. It's hard to say for sure, but many estimates suggest that 80% of the New World population died of disease outbreaks within a century of Columbus' first voyage. And even after this, outbreaks of disease continued to kill natives in high numbers for the following centuries, far more than guns or swords ever did. 

For example, if you recall the story of the Pilgrims in 1620 and how they landed at Plymouth Rock... they found that they had settled near the former Patuxet village, where every single member of that tribe had died probably due to smallpox about five years before their arrival. The only survivor of the tribe, Squanto, was in England at the time... and he died within two years after the pilgrims landed... of smallpox. (also, these epidemics were not the result of any biological warfare, which the Europeans only discovered during the Seven Years War).

This is one of the main reasons why native peoples were conquered with little resistance. Whenever a war did begin, the Europeans far outnumbered the Indian tribes they fought.

This is not to say atrocities didn't happen; they did, and often. Hell, they probably would have been a lot worse if such large numbers hadn't succumbed to disease. But to suggest that natives were slaughtered on the same scale as Jews in the holocaust is totally inaccurate... at the time that Europeans began to heavily colonize the Americas, there simply weren't enough natives left to be slaughtered at such high levels.",politics,False,t1_c08sjbi,[deleted],0,True,1239461793,0,0,25,c08sjbi,t1_c08sd0l,,False,25,,t3_8bmv3,t5_2cneq,

Herpes is downright common. I don't disagree AIDS is bad news if you get it. Herpes is a good reason for most people reading this ... hetro white males having sex with white women, to wear a rubber (not to be racist, I'm from a mixed family, just assuming most people are white reading reddit).

AIDS is going to be seen as a fearmongering thing, as despite seeing Pedro years ago, and Magic Johnson (both not white incidentally), most white kids in America couldn't even name someone who knows someone with HIV/AIDS. That's going to be in the back of most white kid's minds. Like a, ""weed is going to lead to smoking crack in a ghetto lab like in New Jack City"" argument.

You really shouldn't push AIDS as a dangerous issue to white hetro people. It just isn't, and no amount of P.C. MTV spots makes that true. Herpes OTOH, is rampant in suburbia, and gross enough to make kids wear rubbers is shown as a large risk to them. I wasn't ignoring the other STDs, I was saying that we should point out the danger of them before even bringing HIV into the discussion with white people who don't shoot up in the hood with other people.

Males catching HIV from a known infected female during unprotected sex in the United States is a .05% chance. Not .05, .05%, but no one seems to like the facts. The nation matters, because of something called viral load.

http://depts.washington.edu/hivaids/post/case5/fig1d.html

My link above also points out it is under 1/3 of a percent you even meet an infected person *period*. Never mind a hetro person. Which are outnumbered by infected gay people in the United States 39 to 1. ;)

Add to that it's nearly statistically impossible to *find* an HIV infected white female non-drug user ... well, I think you know where I am going here. I'm certain it is so rare no one reading will even be able to say they know someone who knows someone who is a hetro white non-drug user with HIV. While it isn't ""safe"" to have sex with an infected person you are looking at the stats. .031% chance of infection from an encounter. Obviously not cumulative. So .031% any time you have sex with an infected person no matter how many times you do.

In the USA, infected male to uninfected female (receptive vaginal transmission) is .1%, (10 in 10k according to the Dept. of Health and Human Services) Which would be stand alone percentage for each act. Each act is .1%, the next is .1% ... like a saving throw with a 99.9% chance to save each time, in a way. **IF** you meet that elusive infected female I mention above, and wear no condom.

The key left/right divide is big/small government.

&gt;Classic liberalism...

??? I said classical liberalism is compatible with conservatism. I'm not sure what your point is.

&gt; Mosely was a conservative originally 

In 1918, at the age of 21, he was elected a Conservative. 
In 1920 he became an independent
In 1924 he became a Labour MP
In 1929 he became a Labour minister
In 1930 he formed the New Party
In 1931 he formed the British Union of Fascists.

He was clearly a man 'of the left'

&gt;Fascism's roots are drawn on nationalism in the late 19th century

There is nothing 'fascist' about nationalism. Nation states predate fascism by several hundred years.

&gt;If British fascism was a product of the 1930's and opposed in the 1930's how can it be said there was no stigma prior or at all in the 1920's/30's?

Fascism/national socialism emerged in the 1920s. It was seen at that time as a variant of socialism. The British Union of Fascists could be seen as a split of the Labour Party. 

Later in the 1930s the BUF would have been seen through the context of the rise of Germany, and the anticipation of a European war, in which Britain and Germany would be on opposing sides.

&gt;1920's street battles between socialists and nazi's in Germany .

this was a power struggle. People frequently switched sides. Ideologically the distance was not great.

&gt;This applies too with the Spanish civil war

The Spanish Civil War is a complicated thing.

Vis a vis the relatively new application of genetics in medicine and animal husbandry, I don't think a decade, even 2 is enough to make decisions that may impact adversely future generations. We do not know for sure what the long term effects are. I hope you're right and that the side effects are checked. But considering our growing resistance to drugs like antibiotics, the disastrous cross-pollination of Monsato crops which drives so many, not only Indian farmers, to suicide when their efforts fail to produce seeds that will produce next year's crop, I'm skeptical. Something does not add up re Monsanto which induced EU to ban their products in Europe.  

Actually human cloning has already happened. An Italian (I think) scientist made the news about a year or so ago. Like Dolly, his cloned human did not survive, but these are early days. World opinion may have come down on the scientist, but Mary Shelley did too good a job with ""Frankenstein"" for someone to resist the challenge. And a cloned human bred to wash dishes will alway be cheaper than a high tech machine that needs to be replaced every so often. A dumbed-down clone want event know the difference. And have you ever had any machine repaired!? Another reason why most simply buy a new one. One more lump to leach its contents thru the rubbish dumps into the soil.

You suggest that if something goes wrong, we can always ""unwrong"" (my inference) it. Really? Then why do we have a problem with the growing menace of plastic and leaking nuclear waste? Has anyone even tried to ""unwrong"" such mistakes? What about the africanised bees? Has anyone produced anything to fix that problem? What about the radioactive dumps full of discarded computers, cell phones, etc., leaching their poison into the soil?

I DO have high hopes for genetics and the promise of any science. I am, however, distrustful of Nobel-hungry scientists and patent-mad corporations. Humanity has an eternity ahead of it. Or until it's time to join the extinct creation. What the previous century started can be continued by the generations to come. They and their offspring will bear the consequences of our rush to get that patent or Nobel check.

Let's not forget that even Darwin, despite his guess about Wo/Man's descent from the apes, until his death he was not entirely convinced of his own theory. That's what it is, and still is - a theory. The same goes for the meat diet-large brain theory. And no I don't buy the 7-day world creation or Intelligent Design rubbish. We really don't know, and very few have the courage of Socrates to admit it. Modern science has barely started. Let's not forget: errare humanum est.

Well, it is now, and I don't think conservatives would disagree with you except for the ""necessary"" qualifier. The conservatives goal is to go back to a time when institutions weren't publicly owned.

Take banks for example, American conservatives are frightened by the fact that some were nationalized, they don't realize that this has been done plenty by other nations to successfully save institutions during difficult recessions (like the Asian Financial Crisis). After doing so these economies quickly recovered. (this is not to say that letting the institutions fail would necessarily be a bad idea either). What I am concerned that American liberals don't realize is that once these institutions  become self sustainable again, they need to be sold off and reprivatized. Government bureaucrats just don't have the mindset or the incentives, or the risk taking instincts to compete in the private sector. In the long term nationally owned companies just become entrenched and inefficient. Again this is not to say that national organizations are bad, they have a need, another one of which is in the case of rapidly developing economies, such as those in Asia. But again here, once the national corporation fulfill their function and develop ones economy they need to be sold off or they become a drag on it.

Lastly both American conservatives and liberals need to take a better look at Europe. While many European countries provide services to its citizens that seem to be socialist in nature, its interaction with other businesses are much less so.

&gt;Millions of Americans are poor because they are unskilled labor and the value of unskilled labor has been on a steady decline ever since the industrial age, and this will continue. And the increasing population size further exacerbates.

I think one way forward is to federally subsidize training for skilled labor jobs.

1425952215,"You might consider checking out some books *about* books, to start with.  There have been a lot of books published in the last few years that are basically lists of other books as introduced and recommended by various people, and some of them can be quite useful for the beginner.  Michael Dirda's *[Classics for Pleasure](http://www.amazon.com/Classics-Pleasure-Michael-Dirda/dp/0156033852)* would be a good place to start.  He has written a number of other books along the same sort of lines, too ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/Bound-Please-Extraordinary-One-Education/dp/0393329631/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b) might also be of interest), but *Classics for Pleasure* has been very well-received.

Paradoxically, I'd recommend *against* tackling the classics themselves from the very start.  One of the reasons they're classics in the first place is because they're advanced examples of the craft of writing, and for someone not used to reading for the pleasure of that craft rather than for other reasons (which I'll mention in a moment), they can be quite daunting.  Your whole project would probably collapse at the outset if you just picked up some Dostoevsky or Flaubert and hoped for the best.

That said, love of the craft isn't the only reason people read, and your understanding of that craft will mature and grow like any other faculty.  Some people read to pass the time or to escape from a more mundane life.  Some read for a love of incident; that is, they like to read about things happening, and favour books that have strong narratives (sometimes at the cost of description) and exciting things going on in them.  I guess the most reductive example of this would be something like a Dan Brown novel, of which type of book it is so often said that ""it really moves along.""  I use this as a familiar example, but you shouldn't take it to mean that enjoying incident in your books is a bad thing.  It's not the same as enjoying the craft, but it's not necessarily worse; it just means that people who love a Danielle Steele novel and people who love Tolstoy are loving these works in different ways.

Anyway, here's a list of ten enjoyable, non-threatening, small- to mid-length books that combine craft and incident under one cover:

1. George Orwell - *Animal Farm*: An interesting refiguration of totalitarian thinking in terms of farm animals.  Short and sweet, and certainly quite sad.

2. Alexander Solzhenitsyn - *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*: A short novel recounting a day in the life of a prisoner in a Soviet Gulag.  It's a brutal and intriguing work, but quite easy to get through. 

3. J.R.R. Tolkien - *The Hobbit*: A reasonably straightforward story of fantasy and adventure.  It's very good, and if you find you really like it you can then graduate to the much more elaborate endeavour that is the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.

4. Max Brooks - *World War Z*: A series of fictional interviews with survivors of the great zombie war.  If you don't like zombies it won't really be your thing, I'm afraid, but if you *do* like zombies there is pretty much literally no better book to read.  It is by turns hilarious and heartbreaking, and contains some interesting meditations on questions of societal structure and military theory.  It's a bestseller for a reason.

5. C.S. Forester - *The African Queen*: In which a gin-soaked tugboat pilot takes a very prim missionary woman down an African river while trying to avoid - and then attack - the German forces that surround them (it's set during the First World War).  It's a funny and exciting book, and was made into an equally great movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn.  

6. John Steinbeck - *The Moon is Down*: A novella in which an unnamed European town is occupied by unnamed totalitarian forces.  The book chronicles what happens to the townspeople as a result, how they resist, how they compromise, and so on.  Written in 1942, this would become Steinbeck's most notable contribution to the war effort.  It became a runaway success in occupied Europe, and was widely distributed there in underground translations.  It's very good.

7. Orson Scott Card - *Ender's Game*: A classic of modern science fiction about (among other things) a child genius in training to conduct a war against an alien race.  There are numerous subplots and many interesting ideas under consideration, and for sci-fi it is thankfully not especially predicated on the technology involved (though there is a lot of neat stuff).  It's more about characters and concepts than spaceships.

8. William Golding - *The Lord of the Flies*: A monstrous little tale of societal breakdown.  A tropical island full of stranded schoolchildren degenerates into a savage tribal bloodbath.  

9. G.K. Chesterton - *The Napoleon of Notting Hill*: A delightful and utterly bizarre little novel in which the King of England in the then-distant future (1984; the book was written in 1904) re-establishes the medieval boroughs and heraldry and clothing as a joke.  But one man does not see that it is a joke, and when some developers want to tear down his home to build a new road, his furious resistance ignites a civil war that consumes all of London.  It's a very funny book, but it's also full of epic grandeur and street battles and whatnot.

10. Edwin A. Abbott - *Flatland*: A strange novella in which Mr. A. Square, a resident of Flatland (a plane existing in only two dimensions), describes the astonishing consequences of being introduced to the world of the third dimension.  It also has a lot of fun side notes about the socio-political makeup of Flatland, and it makes for a quick read once you get used to the slightly antiquated style.

You might also consider the works of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, two English writers who deliver a lot of fun ideas under the guise of satire and adventure.  Adams is best if you like sci-fi, while Pratchett is more in the fantasy section, but they're both quite good and accessible.

One should remember that Venezuela is a deeply divided society.

These have very different opinions and interests from the mostly native majority. The two groups tend to clash, since many of their positions are so opposed.

1425952321,"I guess it's a combination of factors that are causing a trend towards atheism.

The first is the explosion of scientific knowledge.  With the ability to explain almost all natural phenomena without the existence of any deity, one of the biggest purposes of deities goes out the window.  Of course, this isn't the only reason to believe in the existence of a God or multiple gods, but it was important to a classical worldview: the world could not exist without gods before science.  In this environment, the revealed truth of religion seems to be a falsehood.

There's also the lack of proper religious education.  People want easy answers, and they don't care if that means they have to ignore reality.  This, in turn, leads to stupid situations where the popular gods stand against logic and reason.  A bit of this is due to the tolerance for religious innovation that the United States has nurtured through its history, though it is hardly alone.  Let's face it: Christian groups that are readily accepted here would have been condemned as heretics in continental Europe when they arose (I'm looking in particular at the Millerite and Pentecostal groups).

There's also the issue of the fact that many religious groups present older, more restrictive systems of ethics and morality, which aren't as appealing as the more libertine systems that philosophers have created without the existence of God.  As such, we as religious people either wind up in the position of moralizers, shouting *""O tempora o mores!""*[1] at the masses, or as people unconcerned with the world, damning it to Hell with our indifference.  The former does not win friends amongst the populace, and can even border on the unacceptably bigoted in the most extreme cases.  The latter makes a mockery of our beliefs.  I don't know about everyone, but I'm personally unsatisfied with those options.

I agree that the vast majority of Somalis want piracy and the current anarchy as much as they want starvation and plague. But piracy and starvation and rival thugs is what Somalia has, and it has it because there has never been a true Somali nation. Going back a thousand years, before Europeans began colonizing and meddling there, Somalia was a region of clans. The clans (much like tribes) traded and enjoyed prosperity, and also fought rival clans for control of areas and trade. There was no Somalia nation then and there is no Somalia nation now. Nation is a western concept that has never fit the Somalia region.

Sure, Somalis would rather see ships coming and going in Somali ports in the import and export of goods. But that is not possible in the warring clans environment of Somalia, so piracy (and local kidnapping and extortion) is accepted as an alternate form of trade. As the Somalis have for thousands of years, they do whatever they have to do to survive.

That does not make Somalis bad people. In fact, typical Somalis are very polite, warm, outgoing people (as long as you don't piss them off).

&gt;Now, at this point, most people will agree that this analysis is logical so far. However, this next step is where people have problems:


Well, in the first place I don't agree that you can *own* your body - that just seems like a huge fallacy to me.  Honestly, I have no clue what you are talking about.  You *are* your body.  There is no little man in the back of your skull driving the machine, you are the sum of its parts.  How can you possible own that which you are?

Anyway, even if we are going to assume that I own my body - how does that translate to property being a natural right? Its not like your average capitalist is mixing his labor with the businesses that he owns controlling shares in..

&gt;It is the individual that transforms nature or, equivalently, the individual that is the first ""appropriator"" of nature. If a piece of land is uncontrolled and unowned, then the first person there is the rightful owner. This is how property rights were formed.

Okay, so the Native Americans own the entire continent then.  In that case, we should probably all just up and return to Europe (correction, the Middle East - the Celts own Europe).

Have you read the constitution? It's not very long and the answer to that question is in there.

The International War Crimes Tribunal?

At Nuremburg at the end of WW2, one of the judges described the worst war crime of all as being, not genocide, but the aggressive pursuit of war, i.e. going to war without the justification of self defense. If it turned out that Blair had authorised or was aware of the WMD story being a fabrication that would almost certainly make him guilty of the ""worst war crime there is"". Blair being guilty would point to Bush being guilty, although as the US didn't sign up to the IWCT there's not much that could have benn done apart from grumbling within the UN.

* Closing Guantanamo was an excellent opening move, something that was desperately needed.  You're right, we need *more* of that, but it's in his favor.

* Instructions to make it more difficult to deny Freedom of Information requests is also in his favor.

* Obama's handling of Iran has so far been a vast improvement on the previous administration's isolationist policy, since you can never normalize relations with a hostile nation unless you start *talking* to them.

* He's taken the [first steps](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1066821.html) to altering our relationship with Israel so we're not so uncritically supportive of them.  I personally have sympathy for Israel's situation but it is not without conditions.  When the US, Israel or any other nation commits atrocities it deserves criticism.  I can only hope Obama will continue to be critical when circumstances call for it.

* Obama's initial [executive orders](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/us/politics/23GITMOCND.html?hp) went a long way toward correcting many of the abuses perpetrated by the Bush administration.  That he's decided to adopt *other* abuses distresses me greatly and I'm not being shy of criticizing him for it.  But we're shooting for things he's done *right,* and those qualify.  Individually, those executive orders outnumber the good things Bush did over the course of eight years.

* The Stimulus Package he organized is the first step toward correcting the economic failures of the Bush administration.  He allowed it to be hamstrung in the name of bipartisanship, but it's still a step in the right direction.  Again, there's room for criticism in his appointment of Geithner and the deference the Obama administration is giving to the people most directly responsible for tanking out economy, but I have to expect this from an avowed centrist.  He promised to govern from the center, and he's kept that promise fairly well.

* His tour of Europe went a long way toward mending fences with our allies, given the way Bush treated them as lapdogs.  He struck the appropriate tone of resolve and humility, which is why the right-wing noise machine lashed out at him for apologizing.  The US has **much** to apologize for, and Obama deserves credit for doing it.

* His handling of the auto industry bailouts has been fairly even-handed.  I can only wish he'd treat the financial industry the same way, but I've already addressed that.  The US auto industry painted itself into a corner, and Obama is doing the right thing by demanding proof of change instead of simply giving them money without conditions or allowing them to collapse.  The US steel industry was allowed to collapse forty years ago, and it has never recovered.  Do we really want to see the same thing happen with *another* US industry?  We have so little left to export, it behooves us to at least try to help rehabilitate the Rust Belt.

&gt;It's not technically hypocrisy to give back that which his constituents have already paid. 

It *is* to then decry other politicians for doing the exact same thing. Why does Ron Paul get a pass on his pork projects as 'just representing his constituents' while all other politicians are greedily raking in cash for special interest groups? *Is it because he's just so gosh-darned adorable?*

&gt;Protection of private property was important to the founders. Its important to Ron Paul.

Yes, Lockean protections *were* very important to the Founders. Not so much to Ron Paul. You see, John Locke wrote that the sole source of legitimacy for a government was derived from the extent to which it protected its citizens' rights to life, liberty and property. Ron Paul, on the other hand, believes that the federal government has no place in ensuring those protections where the state government would deny them.

As a bit of an ancillary critique, the entire deification of the Founding Fathers sponsored by people like Ron Paul and 'strict constructionists' in general is *completely* the opposite of what the Founders wanted. In fact, if you actually read their writings they were *terrified* that their descendants would place consecrate significance on their words, and ignore contemporary society as a guide for policy. They were scholars of the Enlightenment, and were wary of monarchical European societies where kings were more gods than men, and whose word bound their subjects long after their death. Exigent to their philosophy was the idea that 'Earth belongs in usufruct to the living', and Jefferson in particular thought that *every* law - including the Constitution - was rendered invalid after twenty years, since the generation which had passed that law was mostly dead by then. No, the Founders would be *horrified* to learn that more than two centuries after their deaths there exists a sect of political thought which treats their words as holy writ rather than the scribblings of mere, fallible mortals.

1425953772,"Ok here's a little history lesson.

Humans evolved from less developed species. Those species (monkeys, fish, etc) tend to move in packs (for safety and reproductive reasons). Thus early humans also tended to congregate in packs. Those packs developed and got larger over time, as different tribes either took one another over, or allied. Once one tribe grew large enough, they became too large to move around perpetually, and with the advent of new technologies they were better able to settle down in a single area. This was particularly beneficial because they could now build more complex, protective housing. However settling down made them easy targets for other tribes, and so the tribes tended to have a chieftain to deal with attacks and organizing hunts, etc. As the tribe grew even larger and got more complex the people began to draft warriors, whose profession was to exclusively stand watch and fight. But people who stand watch and fight can't farm or hunt most of the time, so the chieftain had to levy a tax to get food for the warriors. As the clan grew farther and took over more tribes, and as they developed more and more as a single unit, they got more and more distinct culture, which was based totally on the location of the tribe and which chieftain they lived under. From here town and cities grew, and then countries, all on the basis of that early organization. 
This is of course a very simplified version of about 10000 years of history, and it's not a catch all, but it works for many regions (Europe, the Americas, Asia). 

Now remind me why it's necessary to posit a worldwide, thousands of years old conspiracy of the ruling classes who turn ""the people"" of the world against one another in order to maintain control to explain the existence of countries.

We don't have walkable living areas because cars rule. The major car companies bought up what transit systems we had before everyone was humping the Car God and destroyed them. Public transit and bike riding stink of Poor People or dirty hippies, so Americans run screaming from them.

Furthermore, let us not forget that the State of Israel literally imported 1 million people from the former USSR republics in the 1990s and paid for their education, integration, and housing (incluing inside illegal settlements in the West Bank). Those people from the USSR were able to consolidate themselves socially and express themselves in high positions of power and major political parties (like Yisrael Beitinu, which Avigdor Lieberman -- the Moldovan immigrant -- belongs to).

I'm not knee-jerking.  I am talking about the reality of the approach.  More on this:

&gt; Population control is simply government mandated limits on the number of children you can have. Something that is necessary given the multitude of life extending technologies available today.

You genuinely don't know what you're talking about.  Here's why: the sustainable population is determined by the level of technology adopted in agriculture and manufacture.  If, for example, we were exclusively using meat tissue culturing and vertical farming, over 99% of the currently utilized lands could be made fallow and we'd still have room for a doubling of the population.

Post-malthusian economies tend towards fewer children.  Already, the native US &amp; Canadian populations and the native European populations all are experiencing negative population growth. And that's **with** ""the multitude of life extending technologies available today.""  Which, I'll add, are going to get worse with the much-deserving thanks going to the SENS and Malthusian Foundations -- of which I personally know a few of the researchers in the former.

The point I'm rambling towards here is simple; birth inhibition is absolutely useless to the timescale we're discussing.  Even if we limit births from this point forward to just 1/2 per person (non-retroactively, of course; no 'killing of people') -- we still would experience a climb to upwards of 7 Billion people before 2050.  It wouldn't begin to have population decline for several decades.

In Malabar, about 15% of the population were slaves. Slavery was abolished in both Hindu and Muslim India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843. Provisions of the Indian Penal Code of 1861 effectively abolished slavery in India by making the enslavement of human beings a criminal offense.
&gt; ... Though any formalised slave trade has not existed in South Asia, unfree labor has existed for centuries in the Medieval ages, in different forms. The most common forms have been kinds of bonded labor. During the epoch of the Mughals, debt bondage reached its peak, and it was common for money lenders to make slaves of peasants and others who failed to repay debts. Under these practices, more than one generation could be forced into unfree labor; for example, a son could be sold into bonded labor for life to pay off the debt, along with interest.

The reason I'm dwelling on the impossibility of collective action is that I suspect that what would follow from collective action is that collective action is legislation. That, just like an individual is acting compassionately if he gives charity, a compassionate society as a collective similary acts via f.e. legislating welfare. This is I think a very slippery slope, and this is why I'm ""fighting"" it at the root, that individuals can sometimes or often act in perfect unison but this is still a set of individual actions. Thus, legislation is not the action of a collective. It's an action of some individuals in order to set up rules to influence or change the behaviour of other individuals.  From this thought of train comes that then such rules can have unforeseen consequences, can give out malincentives, etc. This much for the theoretical part. On the practical one, politicians legislate. All the ""collective"" can do is to choose who will legislate for a limited set of choices.

If subjective morality, then who shall judge it?"" - this is exactly the hardest question of morality ever, but still, the correct answer isn't ""no one"" and perhaps ""the most numerous"" isn't the best answer either. I think it's necessary and possible to have ""experts"" of value judgement: respected, well-known ""wise men"", just like there are experts in everything.

But that's not very important here because I think the subject now is justice and justice isn't a value judgement, but the enforcement thereof. Thus, if people think everybody over 40 must be killed, then within this (im)moral system it is just if nobody over 40 escapes it, and everybody under 40 escapes it. This sounds shocking, but justice means punishing bad, rewarding good and it can work for any definition of good and bad. 

""To be able to call some acts good and bad for everyone - to have any justice at all - means having a morality that everyone will agree to. The collective morality is the weighted average of the individual morality of the people in it. (The weights measure how influential that person's views are.)""

These two contradict :)) Probably nothing ever will really everybody agree with, but it's not necessary, each disagreement modifies the weighted average. With the second one I agree with, except that it's not the morality of the collective as a being, a subject in itself, as it doesn't exist, but it's basically a statistical aggregate.

""By all acting to improve the world according to the ideals of the social morality, overall the world judged by each subjective morality will improve.""

Doesn't follow at all. X has view 12, influence 100, Y has view -3, influence 10. Weighted average 10.6. It gets done. Will Y think it's an improvement? :))

But what I'm driving at is what follows from it: that collective action is legislation. No, legislation is not an action in itself, but a set of rules to circumscribe individual action. This is a very important difference, because I think collective action is a slippery slope, it makes it too convenient to say that ""we should do X"" means ""we should have a law for X, or, the government should do X"". 

Nope. Playing Monopoly is not the same as writing the rulebook of Monopoly. If the players agree in rules, that's not collective action, but a common agreement in the limits of individual action. 

This sort of reasoning (mine) leads towards a smaller-gov't view: all the state should do is to tell us what we are forbidden to do, but nothing else. (Where I differ from the Libertarian view is that I have no problems with outlawing drugs and stuff like that. That's included in forbidding what not to do.) Writing the Monopoly rulebook, as a group, together is not some sort of collective form of playing it but merely agreeing in what NOT to do.  

""The establishment of republic democracies in Europe in the late middle ages and the revolutions that established many of them changed how society worked.""

Did it, if we disregard the formalities and just take a look at how things actually worked? Didn't [Joseph II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Joseph_as_ruling_emperor) and [Louis XV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France#First_attempt_at_reform) try to do the same kind of liberal reforms are the later democracies, largely because they were influenced by the same kind of intellectuals (""parti philosophique"")? Both ""enlightened absolutism"" and the later democracies were/are basically about the power of intellectuals, the wordsmiths...

I have advocated no such thing. Don't put words in my mouth.

You are jumping to conclusions that are not in any way supported by what I actually wrote.

I'd like nothing more than to see every damn one of the recent terrorism related laws (or changes) reverted, the people behind them voted out of parliament and publicly ridiculed, and I'd like to see people actually care and try to do something about it.

But that does *not* mean I am blind to the fact that the British judiciary actually take their independence and their duty to the public seriously - far more so than elected representatives do at times, and often they care far more about peoples liberties than the UK public at large does (hence the regular public outcry over how horrible those pesky EU human rights laws are). 

There's a centuries old tradition in the UK for promoting civil rights via the judiciary, often to the chagrin of whoever has been in charge and often actually with minimal support from the public whose rights they have protected. Doesn't mean they don't get it wrong sometimes, but if I were to make a bet on who will do most to curtail the extended power the current government has given police, I'd pick the judges over MPs or the public at large any day.

Pointing out that a situation is *likely* to improve once someone fights for their rights in court in no ways equates to advocating that people sit back and wait. It is a statement about what I believe is likely to happen, not a wish or a recommendation of any course of action.

1425954139,"Have you actually *lived* in other European nations and seen their health systems first hand? I have. 

The Norwegian system works fine - there are things to improve on, but there are things to improve on everywhere. The WHO agreed with me in their report in 2000 (I believe there is a never one, but I don't have it): The Norwegian system was ranked 11th in the world - ahead of western european countries like the UK, Germany, Portugal, Iceland, Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Spain, Italy and France were the only major western European nations ranked higher.

As for the tax level: The overall Norwegian tax level isn't all that much higher than in most other developed countries. It's a myth.

I make well above average. When in Norway, I paid ca.30% tax after deductions. Adding in VAT doesn't affect the tax rate nearly as much as you seem to believe, as most people spend a minority of their after tax income on taxable goods. 

In my case I spent less than 30% of my pre-tax income on taxable goods, meaning in Norway at the current 25% VAT rate, the VAT would add up to at most an additional 7.5% in taxes for a total tax burden of about 37.5%.. While the top tax brackets drive the income tax level up for higher earners, higher earners also typically spend a lower percentage of their income on buying taxable goods and as a result the VAT part of the total tax burden offsets a lot of the income tax increase as salaries increase.

I really wonder where you get your 70%. It'd take someone well into the top tax bracket spending almost their entire income on taxable goods to get to that number.  If I'd been smoking, drinking lots and driving a car I'd have paid more in taxes, but after housing costs etc. I simply didn't (and don't) have enough money left to even be able to spend enough money to end up paying that much tax.

In the UK where I live now I pay approximately 32% total national and local taxes on my income excluding VAT (the UK have lower tax rates than Norway, but a far less generous system for deductions which actually makes the Norwegian system more favorable for many high earners), and about 4.5% in VAT (based on the temporarily lowered VAT rate of 15% - from next January it'd be about 0.75% higher), for a total tax burden of about 36.5%. 

For comparison, this is pretty much what I would be paying in California (I was considering a move for work reason a couple of years back and so looked into it in detail) too, while getting fewer services for my money (for the record: Many US states are cheaper).

Nice (lack of) logic. I trust the WHO report - that actually went into a lot of detail - over a single anecdotal report any day.

&gt; As for the taxes they are extremely high and if you actually only pay 30% tax I need to get in touch with your accountant.

I didn't use one. No need to. My income and deductions were trivially simple - nothing unusual. Actually I just checked Skatteetaten.no, and with current taxes and my current situation the income tax and national insurance (trygdeavgift) today would add up to about 28-29%. 

The ""headline rates"" are 28% on taxable income + 7.9% national insurance for a basis of 35.9% on taxable income. Then 9% or 12% on anything exceeding the two higher rate brackets (""toppskatt""), and I would pay toppskatt with my current income, even after deductions. But before any of those there's the basic deduction of up to 70k NOK as well as deductions for interest expenses, child care and a number of other things that means that your taxable income is far lower than your gross income. 

Now the *theoretical* maximum approaches 47.9% (but you'd need to be be making millions and not have any deductions for that to be the case. If you did, and spent *all* of that on products subject to VAT (if so, where would you live?), you'd end up paying in 60.9% taxes including VAT.

If part of that cost is alcohol, tobacco or you buy lots of cars you could drive it up higher, but get real - to reach 70% you'd have to be a multi-millionaire alcoholic chain smoking car enthusiast with no place to live. 

While you might pay a higher percentage than me if you factor in car taxes (I don't drive) or have few deductions (mine would add up to about 120k NOK beyond the basic allowance), you'd have to be filthy rich and have a really bizarre spending pattern to even reach 40%.

I know the costs of living in Norway, thanks - I lived in Norway for the first 25 years of my life, and have visited several times a year in the 9 years since.

As for TV license - in the UK it is about $240 a year, and while a lot of things are cheaper, all in all I'm not much better off here than I was in Norway. Housing in London makes Oslo seem cheap and makes up for a lot of the difference. Granted, other parts of the UK are cheaper, but mostly makes up for it with far lower salaries.

And no, I didn't live in Finmark, I lived in Oslo. 

You seem to have a bizarre idea of how little people pay in taxes elsewhere... But then that's common of people who live in Norway.

I moved out because I got a really interesting job elsewhere. See, some of us actually enjoy moving around even if we liked it where we moved from. I find it more amusing that you live in Norway when you have so much to whine about, but that's typical Norwegian culture.

&gt; Ive visited most of the countries in Europe and north America and I have many friends who live in those countries. And all of them say its better than Norway; ill believe them and my own experiences over some report made by WHO. 

Yeah, because facts and well founded research is so much more unreliable than anecdotes from someone who has already demonstrated they don't even have a clue at all about how much tax they pay (your ""70%"" comment, which has no basis in reality). It's impossible for me to take you seriously after that.

&gt; Also if you actually knew what you were talking about you would know that the average pay of a Norwegian is in the top two brackets of taxation(toppskatt) and that's not because the average person makes a lot.  You're a joke..

No, it is **NOT**. See http://www.ssb.no/lonnansatt/

Contrary to you I'm not actually pulling numbers out of my ass, but have looked them up. If you're going to try fooling someone, at least try doing it with something that isn't so easy to check.

Average salary (based on 2007 numbers from Statistisk Sentralbyrå) was 32300 NOK per month, or 387.600,- **gross**. Toppskatt kicks inn from a *taxable* income of **441.000,-** or more.

Let's look at what someone making the average salary would actually pay, based on information readily available from the tax authority at www.skatteetaten.no/:

First you need to subtract the base deduction (minstefradraget), of 36% limited upwards to 70.350,-. That leaves 317.250,- **taxable** income before any other deductions, well below the limit of 441.000,- for the *lowest* toppskatt bracket. 

Lets assume **no** deductions, which is highly unusual in Norway given the amount of allowed deductions (as noted, in my case I'd have at least 120k deductions, and during the years from I started working in Norway until I moved to London I didn't once file a tax return without substantial deductions.

Of the 317.250,- net taxable income on an average salary, you would pay 7.8% national insurance (trygdeavgift) for a total of 24.745,-. You would further pay 28% on any taxable income exceeding 40.800,- (which means I actually overestimated my tax in my previous message because I forgot about the floor) or 77.406,-.

Total tax is then 102.151,-, or **26%** of gross income. In reality most people making the average salary would pay less as they would have at least some deductions.

(for comparison, I suggest you also look up average salaries elsewhere - not only does Norwegians in an average salary actually pretty much pay tax at the same percentages as in other European countries, they also earn substantially more than most other places, including the UK which means that despite high prices they come out very well in terms of purchasing power parity)

I can only conclude that you don't have the faintest clue about how the Norwegian tax system works. Having run several companies, managed payroll for my employees, and actually bothered to calculate my own tax both as an employee and as self-employed, I actually do. But even if I didn't, detailed instructions and example calculations are easily available online.

&gt; Norway is nice if you are a non smoking, non driving, no fun having, unemployed, christian family father; anything else and you get fucked over. Don´t believe me? Then move the fuck back from London.

Even pretending that it's a fair comparison, it's STILL flawed because he's not factoring in that people in Japan and France have far *more* options for transportation.  Both of them have much more robust public transit options than we do.  Both of them are also much more friendly towards bicycles, mini-cars, and other alternative vehicles.

I agree with all your stated benefits of high-speed rail, but all of this is assuming people opt to use the rail in the first place.  Keep in mind that people often use automobiles even when doing so is more expensive and more time-consuming.  Many of the costs of operating an automobile are hidden, so people think of the cost as just the price of gas (which is only about 1/3 of the real cost).

In Japan and Europe, cars are often out of the question simply because of the high cost to own/park them in the first place.

I think your analysis of plane-train transportation is dead on.  Anyone who's ever flown to Tokyo knows you don't actually ever fly Tokyo . . . you fly to Narita and then take a train.  That works, if your only option is to fly anyway, but if you can drive between your destinations in just a few hours, you may choose that option, and it appears most of the proposed high-speed rail segments are essentially just eliminating 3 hour commutes.

You can't hide energy costs just because because they are somewhere else. If they have no industrial zone (unsurprising, considering the unreliability/cost of solar PV) then their city is pushing their hidden energy usage to some other city, and not compensating for it.

&gt;It is doubtful, for example, that Florida has the same home heating requirements of, say, Wisconsin,

No, instead they have cooling requirements.

http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/waskdays.htm

&gt;Your assumption seems to be that they will, by default, rely exclusively on coal when solar is unavailable.

A large amount of coal (and natural gas), and hence a large amount of CO2. Per your numbers, these fossil fuels are together a super-majority.

&gt;Finally, while the blog may be misrepresenting the facts, and perhaps in many ways the city planners are as well, the city planners are not actually claiming to run the entire city from the 75 megawatt facility. Rather, that is simply the initial amount, ready to be expanded as the town grows.

At what cost? Extrapolating from the $300M/75MW figure, an average city of their size in the US would need 20x$300M = $6 billion worth of solar panels, or $300,000 per household. If a city uses less energy because ""they have no industry"", then fine; the other city, the one with the factories, will need correspondingly more. And the average is the same.

My point is: solar electricity, solar PV or solar thermal collectors, is not a feasible way of cleaning up energy generation. Either it is small and relatively affordable - as in this city - in which case it is too small to make any difference; or it is large enough to make a difference, in which case it's not practical. There is no middle ground: the intensive quantities, of the form (resource)/(energy) - like $/kWh, land area/kW, resources/kW - are just ridiculously unreasonable.

1425954717,"&gt;Why does everybody insist on having so many fucking kids!?

It tends to not be the people who are reproducing at a fast rate who are really the ones who are putting a strain on the planet's resources.  Sure, the poor in third world countries don't have environmentalism as their primary concern.  Money really buys you that privilege, even if developed nations (and the US specifically) tend to have that money and ignore the environment anyway.

But back to my point.  The poor are not the ones that are sapping this planet of resources.  That much is apparent if you simply look at the figures for how many ""planets"" it would take if all ~7 billion people on the planet lived as, say, Americans do, as opposed to living as even your average Chinese or Indian does (I believe it's between 1 and 2 for China and about 9 for the US).  So, as of *right now*, the problem is the West.  

Of course, the standard of living throughout the world is generally on the rise.  More and more Chinese and Indians are moving into their respective countries' middle classes.  However, as far as I can see, overpopulation tends to be a problem that solves itself as long as standard of living goes up.  The better your economic condition, the less children you tend to have.  The population growth rate across Eastern Europe and Southern Africa is [actually negative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_growth_rate_world.PNG).  That's not to say that their standard of living is *great* compared to Western Europe or the US, but both of those areas have very low growth rates.  Compare that to most of Asia or Africa where the standard of living is fairly poor, and you obviously see much higher rates.  

So then you see it doesn't make much sense, as I suppose you already know, to assume that most of the world is going to breed like rabbits *if* we get much more effective at fighting global poverty, and the signs are encouraging.  And so the problem becomes not the growth rate or the number of people, but *standard of living itself*.  The world can stand 7 or 8 billion people living off of small farms and subsistence agriculture, to a point, but it almost certainly cannot absorb the damage from humanity going from a species of under a billion living Western consumerist lifestyles to 7+ billion doing so.

The solution, then, seems to me that we need to come up with better ways to live the better lives that we want to live.  A big part of that is simply not being stupid.  For example, bottled water is a big thing in the US, but a lot of it is simply tap water that's been filtered a bit.  The only real difference between that and something you get out of your faucet through a Brita filter is that the bottled water industry creates enough trash to fill your average landfill in no time at all.

&gt; ...

&gt; I can't believe you would fight this, it's like saying Colombia isn't a major source of blow, or Afghanistan isn't a major source of heroin (since we cleared out the Taleban). Seriously, EoZ, lying on blatantly factual points like this is what discredits ultrazionism aside from the apartheid and genocide that is.

What does EoZ stand for? I did a little research on the subject of Israeli ecstasy trafficking and came up with [this article on the subject from Ha'aretz](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=477978). You're partly right insofar as Israelis are heavily involved in ecstasy trafficking. You're also partly wrong insofar as they ecstasy they traffic is produced in Europe, not in Israel itself. 

&gt; According to a report issued in 2003 by the U.S. State Department, Israel is at the center of international trafficking in Ecstasy and Israeli crime organizations, some of them linked to similar organizations from Russia, achieved a dominant status in the Ecstasy market in Europe, and went on to control the drug's distribution in the States. ""Israeli drug-trafficking organizations are the main source of distribution of the drug to groups in the U.S, using express mail services, commercial airlines, and recently also using air cargo services,"" the report states. The authorities do not provide official data on the scope of the Israeli trade in Ecstasy, but the most commonly heard estimate is that Israeli criminals control no less than 75 percent of the Ecstasy market in the U.S.

&gt; How did Israel become a central player in this dubious game? The explanation is apparently historical in character. A report of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) explains, in understated language, that ""Israeli drug traffickers, perhaps thanks to their long-standing ties in Antwerp, continue to be the major elements in the transfer of large shipments of Ecstasy from Belgium [to the United States]."" Underlying this cautious formulation is the assumption that Israeli mobsters have been operating for years in Belgium, mainly in diamond smuggling, and that when the country became a source of Ecstasy production in Europe and Antwerp became the drug's major export hub to the U.S., Israeli criminals naturally became involved. After all, they were already there.

&gt; The Israeliness of the Ecstasy smugglers is a relative matter. Law-enforcement sources in the States and Israel emphasized that few Israelis are involved, and often they can be described as ""former Israelis."" Frequently they are young people who left the country of their own volition and hooked up with the underworld and the drug trade overseas. Some of them were, in fact, already connected with Israeli criminal organizations back at home, while others operate without any connections there. In some cases the struggle over control of the Israeli crime families has been exported to the drug market in the U.S., though the Israeli players in the Ecstasy market in America are only loosely connected to the major criminal organizations back home.

Basically, everyone thought the bits and piece they knew about were actually bits and pieces of Asia.

This is important when one considers the context of President Obama's granting of immunity to lower-level CIA interrogators (if they acted in ""good faith"" upon ""authoritative"" legal advice).

What even a cursory examination of historical precedent demonstrates is that after World War II prosecution of war criminals and accessories to war crimes were not limited to the famous Nuremberg 22 high-level Nazis, nor the few hundred or so prosecuted through the Nuremberg tribunals, but thousands of accused throughout Europe.

What follows is a brief lesson in how these prosecutions occurred, who was involved, and where and when they took place. It may surprise you that the United States, for instance, has an Office of Special Investigations (OSI) at the US Department of Justice. Its mission was to hunt down war criminals and bring them to justice. Established only in 1979, the OSI has a sterling record:

1425955607,"When you look at an Indian menu, it’s quite natural that you may be confused the first time. Food menus don’t begin and end with meat, and you’ll find multiple vegan and meat recipes. It’s easy to try and determine what you want to eat by reading the information printed with each item on the menu as it will give you a fair idea of the ingredients that are used to make a certain dish. Indian food can be spicy for Europeans. However, the food is usually seasoned with yoghurt and other base ingredients to make tastes more subtle.
Indian food stresses on the use of natural spices which makes the food flavorsome. The use of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, gloves, ginger, and the likes add to the uniqueness of Indian cuisine. Such tastes can’t be replicated with the use of other spices or even spice on powdered forms.  When selecting an Indian restaurant you may want to pick on one that serves the type of cuisine you prefer. Since Indian food offers a very vast platter it would be wise to know whether you’d prefer to eat vegetarian or non vegetarian food. You can even choose a particular cuisine by opting for Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, and other cuisines.
If you’re skeptical about what Indian food you should eat, try and concentrate on starters to get an idea of what you could be expecting. All restaurants will denote spicy items with the help of a red chilly icon. Don’t try very spicy food right away because it’s always better to go easy on the taste bud when you’re starting out. The popularity of Indian cuisine can’t be undermined in the UK. In fact, even though it may be hard t believe, rumors have it that the “Chicken Tikka Sandwich” is the most popular Lunch takeaway. Of course the bread could be wholegrain and organic, but you can’t deny the Chicken Tikka Indian connection.

It's a chicken-and-the-egg dilemma. Until enough rail exists for people to really get around, it makes no sense for people to use it. However, unless people are using it it's impossible to get a large enough income stream to create enough infrastructure for people to want to use it. 

Plus, people aren't willing to pay very much to use the train. Even if a business were able to build a large enough system to be viable, the payback time period for it would be huge. It would need to be massively independently wealthy in order to hold out until it reached the breakeven point.

1425956367,"Banks have bad assets but they are not the only assets they have, and they are not completely worthless either. Their mortgage assets may be still hugely overvalued (~50%), but they are not worthless unless every American is unable to pay their mortgages. Toxic asset is nontechnical term that means assets that banks can't sell (or value) at their current market value without going bankrupt. 

Basically it depends on how much defaults there is going to be in those mortgages. Latest estimate from IMF is that there is $4 trillion of toxic assets ($1 trillion of those is in Europe and Asia). That is not the final number.  A secret document leaked from the European Commission suggested that European banks alone hold up to $24 trillion in “troubled” assets. Final sum might be of $8-9 trillion eventually. 

In any case governments don't have much other options than prevent banks from collapsing.

Unfortunately, when discussion about the EU comes up, we get a lot of nut jobs from the UK - that have been fed a lot of crazy propaganda by the UK press - chiming in with all kinds of rubbish about the EU. (Ironic really as Brits really ought to be more paranoid about their own government than the EU).

These proposed reforms are principally about breaking down internal trade barriers in the EU in the telecoms industry to make it more competitive and to better serve people across Europe, and movement/trade between European countries. Remember that the EU is made up of lots of different countries. The first phase of this reform has already happened - previously most countries had public monopolies as telcos, now those are gone and each country individually has a competitive market. There are still many barriers between countries however, and these reforms are about addressing those.

So what does this mean in practice? Things like number portability - being able to move telephone numbers between companies. Things like the last mile problem - preventing the companies that own the last mile from using that to stifle competition (as happens in my country - with Telefonica in Spain and something that affects me personally).  There are also proposed regulations to make it so that different telecoms operators cannot treat internet traffic differently - in other words, all traffic needs to be treated the same.

These are pretty much all good things. You should also note that the Commissioner Viviane Reding has her head screwed on pretty well and is very aware that the major telecoms companies try to sway this kind of legislation to their own advantage.

If you want to criticise this then please be specific about the proposed legislation that worries you and not just OMG the evil EU is going to relgulate the Internets!! There is nothing in this legislation about preventing access to web sites, as suggested by the wikipedia article. In fact, there was proposed legislation to make it _illegal_ for telecoms to block access to internet sites, but that legislation was removed. (Can you guess why? Pressure from the UK!)

I dated a girl who had this disease.  Well, she actually devloped the symptoms after we broke up, but she swore she would be sick for a day or so if flour even came close to her food.  I'm sure there was some truth to it even if some of that was just her psyching herself out.  You'd be surprised what caused problems with her. Even things you wouldn't associate with grains.

Now be a decent boyfriend and get her to a doctor, and if you have previously take her to another one.  Most of the time we associate things like this with a person being a little bit crazy, but often they aren't.  Well,  sometimes maybe they are crazy but the symptoms still often have a physical/medical cause.  If she is crazy well then take her to a different type of doctor.

""Tabloids"" are newspapers printed in a way that fold only once across the spine, and the term has a negative connotation because publications like the New York Post or the National Enquirer have used the form the earliest.  

What's interesting is that, not to get into the history of the broadsheet, but it was the most efficient printing process early on - printing a broadsheet required half as many presses as printing a tabloid.  With mechanized printing, the need was irrelevant but the form was familiar so it remained.  

On the other hand, the tabloid format is more efficient for those who wish to read newspapers on the morning commute on the subway, train, or bus, meaning that urban populations greatly prefer the format - after all, you don't have to flip through tons of pages, it takes up a lot of room to go through the paper, etc. 

In Europe, where mass transit generally works and the morning commute can indeed be 30 minutes on a train where you can read/eat breakfast, many newspapers come out in what is known as a ""Berliner"" format; which is a little bigger than a tabloid, a little smaller than a broadsheet.

To start, let me ask you a series of questions: would you want a Navy Admiral commanding an Army Battallion? Would you want an Army General commanding a naval fleet? Would you want an Air Force General commanding a Marine Expeditionary Unit? How about a Marine General commanding an Air Force wing?

You see, each branch of service has its own training and understanding of how to use its own forces. 

The Marines excell in quick, hard strikes, and that's how they are logistically built. They can not sustain themselves in theater for extended periods of time because that is not their mission.

The Army is built for the long-haul ground battles. They can also be used for the quick strikes similar to the Marines, but because it is not their main mission, they don't have the same prowess at it that the Marines do. Their equipment supports their main mission.

The Navy is built for naval defense and naval force projection. They project their force on the ground through the Marine Corps, and project their force through the air with their Super Hornets. They can also protect their naval fleet with their aircraft as well. However, their aircraft are built for shorter-ranged attacks (why stray so far from the carriers?) and are not able to carry out assaults far away from the sea. Yes they can be refueled in the air, but again, they are most effective at their mission when they are close to their ships.

The Air Force is something that has always been hard to define. In the early days of manned flight, it was seen by the ground and sea commanders as nothing more than a means of reconnaisance. Then someone decided to bring a rifle onto a plane. That later became explosives. Still, the ground and sea commanders couldn't really see what the future would be for aircraft. People like Billy Mitchell could see it though, and he showed how it could be used to counter navies (even though he was facing harsh criticism). Look up Giulio Douhet, Curtis LeMay, and Hap Arnold, all Air Power pioneers. They were able to take a new technology and see how it could better be used in warfare.

I think that's the main point - air power is a relatively new military option. Ground wars and naval wars have been fought for many centuries, whereas manned powered flight has only been around a little over a century. 

I veered a little off-topic with that, so I'll try to steer it back now. As I was trying to show above, each branch has its primary mission that it excells at. The Air Force is built to be a global entity. It is why we have bases all over the world. As the article states, only 5% of the troops in Iraq are Airmen. That is because Airmen at many bases are directly supporting OIF and OEF. Many of the unmanned aircraft are flown by pilots here in the US. The bombers come from all over the world. We have bases in Europe and Asia that logistically support what's going on in Iraq. Saying that 5% of the troops in Iraq are Airmen is ignoring the thousands of other Airmen around the world that are also directly supporting that operation.

Based on the fact that many Airmen, including friends of mine, are filling Army slots on convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan, I'd say the Army has its hands full already. Suddenly giving the Generals all this extra equipment, without the years of doctrine and training in how to effectively use it would be a waste.",reddit.com,False,t1_c0905vd,tekkou,0,True,1240328854,0,0,11,c0905vd,t3_8e70g,,False,11,,t3_8e70g,t5_6,

I am new at reddit.com and figuring it out. I am not sure I am submitting to a right category.
It suppose to go to programming. But maybe better to create my own reddit or something else?
Please advise.
Sorry I am posting this again becouse system moved my first post down after
I accidentally clicked voting arrows to see what happened plus previous header did not include 
word ""Compress"". So that was not clear what this all about. 
Also I have noticed some people(?) bookmarking the first post from Readers. 
   
Please help us to improve our free online website compressor. 
Why have we done this? Why to reduce size of HTML or any code for ten/fifteen percent? It's not a big deal. 
Well, when we type any programming code we usually insert extra spaces
and bunch of other characters inside the code and forget about it. Especially it affects javascript files
that sometimes are bigger than calling HTML page. So it's better to convert javascript. 
If we convert javascript why don't we convert all of them?
So to reduce time of page/code loading it makes sense to compress all of them. Size of pages becomes less around 
15-30% in average. As I webmaster I am concerned about the time loading. 
My page comes to user browser in a 3 seconds instead of 5 seconds. 
What we are feeling if a clicked link does not appear quickly.
If user network connection is slow the time will be bigger. 
And also providers charge and are being charged for traffic.
   
The bulk compressor removes redundant information from single file or entire website: 
white space and unnecessary special characters (scope from 0 to 31 of ASCII table), 
from any kind of web pages, HTML, XHTML, CHTML, WML, CSS, XML, javascript or any 
plain text files. Also for web pages with '.htm', '.html' extensions the compressor is functioning 
as a converter-encoder to UTF-8 encoding (charset) from European or Asian initial encodings (charsets). 
It supports Arabic, Baltic, Central European, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Cyrillic, 
Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Unicode, US-ASCII, Vietnamese, 
and all Western European languages.

Just archive by Winrar.exe everything you would like to compress and press submit 
on the link posted link above. Your opinion is greatly appreciated.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading this.

It will be at play here too... I'll respond to your points, be correct, and then you'll change angles and try again.

There's nothing wrong with AIPAC or the other lobbies. Moving on from the ""Israeli lobby"" to your new chosen topic of spies... obviously I'm not going to defend someone convicted of spying against the USA, as it's wrong and should be prosecuted. But neither Pollard or Kadish are part of the ""Israeli lobby"". They worked for the US government and contractors, they didn't make or direct policy.

Being Jewish doesn't mean someone will be disloyal to the US, and doesn't condone the generalizations you were making previously concerning ""citizens who aren't citizens"", and so on. Being a US citizen means you're a US citizen... not a citizen of somewhere else. Many people of Jewish decent have had relatives in the US since before the creation of Israel... which is to say they're thankful to the US for helping them escape the pogroms of Tsarist/Soviet Russia, the ""pale of settlement"", Europe in the 30's and 40's, and so on. That's not a weak bond and you don't understand the depth of it, judging by your comments on ""foreign citizens"".

A government with spies? An unheard of concept. Obviously not condoned or appreciated, but it's not as if most governments, the US included of course, don't try to gather intelligence. It's not likely to hurt relations much either because, a few individuals aside, it doesn't amount to much.

What can be said about Harman? Anonymous sources, no statements from law agencies and no court proceedings? I have no comment, for or against, as there's no information.

To bring this full circle, you started out primarily concerned about the influence of AIPAC, JStreet, and so on. There's nothing wrong with the fact these lobbies exist, in the same sense that the NRA, NAACP, and other lobbies do. It's fine if you completely disagree with them or oppose their policies. But you have to oppose them on their policies (supporting the only democracy in the middle east, having a strong trading partner, etc), not because you label people supporting them as foreign agents or anti-American Americans.",worldnews,True,t1_c090plg,[deleted],0,True,1240367670,0,0,1,c090plg,t1_c0901qw,,False,1,,t3_8dzpo,t5_2qh13,
1425957792,"&gt;Argument #1: Americans will not give up their cars. They'll downsize, minimize, drive one or two instead of four or five, but they will not give them up. Autos provide too much individual freedom of choice and travel.
Argument #2: People who have their drivers licenses revoked almost always risk jail time to keep driving illegally. Illegal immigrants who never get drivers licenses still drive as soon as they afford a car. Even the poorest people in this country find a car is indispensable. The automobile is a major part of our culture. It will always be so.

High speed rail is about long distance travel, it is meant to relieve the airports.

&gt; Argument #3: High speed rail has been an utter failure in Accela on the Northeast Corridor. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent, and it still takes about a business working day to get from Boston to DC. I have no confidence in Amtrak, any other government agency or GSE making another route successful by any reasonable (unsubsidized) standard.

citation please. The stuff I read suggests that Acela on the North East corridor have been pretty successful. Time and comfort and convenince are not necssarily mutually exclusive

&gt;Argument #4: Building more of these white elephants is exactly what we should not be doing right now. Many historians and economists argue about the true effectiveness of the New Deal and make work programs. Several programs live on (like TVA) when they should have sunset at least 30 or 50 years ago.

Please, by republican teabagging economist

&gt;Argument #5: As a primary means of long distance transport, rail barely competes on a time-and-cost basis anymore. It is a commodity transit means, or it moves large numbers of people in high density cities, but it will never replace cars, airplanes or busses as a popular transit mode. Trains and railways simply cannot be built which could compete on maintenance costs alone, let alone with construction costs, without massive subsidies. And guess where that money comes from? Cars and trucks.

You're mixing local and long distance rails in your argument. Rails are never suppose to replace the other form of transport but as a piece of the overall public transport system. If anyone thinks that rail is meant to replace cars, planes or buses, than they're completely clueless.

&gt;Argument #6: Rail lines are so expensive to maintain that many underused lines are abandoned rather than reconditioned. Perhaps you've heard of Rails-To-Trails ?

i.e. like the very sucessful rail system in Europe or Japan ? A failed line should be removed, but that doesn't damn the whole train system.

No one said that the high speed rail is suppose to be a magical fix, it is meant to be another tool in the public transport system.

Arroyo and her Islamic opposition at the Northern southeast region of the country dominated by this Islamic militant factions which in recent times has led to the killing of great Roman Catholic personalities ,ex-cabinet and their kindred.

Being a Mistress of the former president Joseph Estrada, couples with my political neutrality ,faith , economic recession, and recent assassination of ex-cabinet relatives are just too scaring and terrible for me to stay here.

The fact that I  was used by Joseph Estrada (former President) to did deposits in Carri-bean ,Europe and Africa fund(s) Joseph Estrada Misappropriated from national fund and  the Red cross humanitarian organization met for refugees, deposited  in disguised of family treasures concealed in metallic safes on his behalf on the ground that he never want his name to be associate with these deposits .

However , the recent political instabilities has provoke great insecurity as well as  trials on president Joseph Estrada .

And his former ex cabinet members concerning this misappropriated funds , had led to political sanctions ,confiscation and seizure of   properties and ,assets, inclusive was my real estate firm  as his mistress

Honestly ,there is this deposit Amounted Fourteen Million United States Dollars($14 Million U.S dollars ) Concealed and disguised as family treasures in a metallic safe deposited with a security firm out in this remote country

The fact that this particulars  deposit was made in my name ,I have in possession the legitimate deposit certificate and deposit contract in my name and favour, this bring my purpose of seeking your partnership if you would assist me in having this have this metallic safe containing this aforementioned fund retrieved and ask for the diplomatic shipment of this particular said metallic safe from the security company on my behalf as my foreign business partner, the reason is that ,due to political anticipation empowered only my appointed and introduced foreign business partner  to retrieve or dictate the relocation of this metallic safe from the security firm to any country of  his or her  choice on my behalf .

Please do not ignore this as I am expecting your empathy and understanding to enable me discuss how we should proceed on this by affirming your interest so that in my subsequent mail I will forward to you the details and information of the security company to you to contact the director to verify all I had being saying to you.

Just because they created their art in an environment full of religion doesn't mean religion was required for them to make art.  I don't see a reason to believe that they might not have been inspired by the stars, love, and prancing squirrels if religion didn't inspire them first.

Just because the Catholics created some of the first widely attended organized schools in Europe (to train scribes to copy the Bible) doesn't mean that religion was required in order for the concept of public education to come about.

&gt;So if you want to brush under the carpet a large portion of our cultural heritage, yeah, mock religion.

I can mock religion...  not everything that came from things related to religion came about because of religion.

These days, there is a student protest going on in Croatia, on the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb, aimed against students having to pay for their education. A bit of history: Croatia was until 1991. a part of Yugoslavia, which was a socialist country. Education was free for everyone who could make it to college through admission/entrance exams (don't know how else to call it, sorry if my english is bad). Since independence, through slowly adopting the practices of western countries, more and more students had to pay for their education. When I enrolled in college in 2004, about 20% of students payed for it, and the rest of us had it free, based on entrance exam ranking combined with high school grades. Today, a few years after Croatian universities started to enforce the Bologna process, about 50% of students pay. Next year it should be about 60%, and the students don't like it. Our ministry of education says it wants our universities to look like american and many EU universities. On the other hand, most of us students don't like the model in your countries because we are against the commercialization of education. We don't want education to become a privilege of the rich. Accessibility of education regardless of financial status (but regarding to individual competence) is even in the constitution of our country. And most of us think that's a great thing, along with universal healthcare, pensions, public infrastructure etc. We are not socialists, but we are socially sensitive, and only think these things are among the great achievements of civilization and society. We are not and don't want to be freeloaders, and we are not against enterpreneurship and free markets. We just want to say that not every aspect of the society and the economy should be privatized.  No one is ofcourse so stupid to think all these things are free, but we are willing to pay taxes for it. I'm not looking for an ideological fight on these issues, i just wanted to explain the motives behind the protest. So, now it would be nice if some of you answered these questions:

1. What is your impression of the accessibility of education in your country?
2. Do you think that college education in your country is the privilege of the rich or the competent/smart?
3. Do you think education should be a privilege of the financialy capable?
4. In reality, what do you think could be done to make education accessible to those who deserve it by their merit, having ideals on one side, and limited goverment and/or college budgets on the other?

Your point is wrong.  At its lowest level, the universe is fundamentally stochastic, not deterministic.  Subatomic particles randomly poof into and out of existence without physical cause.

1425958096,"Their estimate, at least according to my understanding, is that we earn 30 billion in net income every year, which is in no way an insignificant amount (approx. 1% of GDP). If their estimate is even in the vicinity of the correct amount, then joining the EMU would be a huge mistake.

Secondly, while we do have our own economic interests to look after, we are free to set whichever interest rates we want to. Our interest rates do kind of follow that of the ECB, but that may change. Many parts of the Euro zone doesn't really instil confidence in their economic ability.
And on that Iceland/Soros ""argument""... neither is applicable here. We do not have Iceland's amount of debt, nor the stubbornness of the Bank of England (not to mention a floating exchange rate). And, while I do not have any numbers I seriously doubt our banks are in much trouble. They are well capitalized and seem to have learned their lesson from the banking crisis of 1992.

While depreciation is usually one of the effects of a lowered interest rate it do have many other effects that need to be taken into account. Only looking at one or a few of the effects on the economy is, in my opinion, what led us into this crisis. Inflation is a major factor in this case. Saying that savers lose money is only partly true. Unless there is also a large inflation, which there isn't, savers can still buy as much as they could previously. Unless, obviously, they go abroad in which case their money won't be worth as much.

So the other companies suffer do they? The thing here is that they also gain lower wage costs. At least relative to their incomes since they sell everything in Euros, Dollars etc. and pay wages in kronor. This means that they, since workers in Sweden are pretty expensive, probably gain more than they lose. Note that the workers will not feel nor really be poorer since they can still buy as much with their wages.

On that note, here in Sweden, the general feeling has been ""thank god we aren't in the EMU"".

Lastly, I won't defend subsidies for the forest industry. That is my main problem with the EU as a whole. The ridiculous agricultural subsidies, the huge tolls etc. On that Swedish-Finnish competition I can't really say much. Don't really know much about it, but I'm just guessing that we had yet to float the Krona and didn't pay much attention to inflation. Both these things have changed, and I can't really see Finland depreciating it's currency any time soon. And why is that? Because you no longer have any control over monetary policy. Guess you solved that one for us ;)

1425958151,"Yes, we can't depreciate our currency and that is regarded as an good thing. You see in the old days, when industries had made bad investments or unions had gotten too high raises, making them non-competetive in global trade, govermeant intervened by depreciating the currency which in essence was that everybody took the tap for mistakes of few.

Now when we have Euro, if industries make bad bets, they go either bust or have to reorganize themselves and if unions get too high raises the unemployment will go up. In essence as all actors in the economy have to take responsibility and be more realistic in their actions. In addition as we don't subsidise uncompetetive industries, new industries can take their places, i.e. the continuation decline of forrest industries and growth of high tech industries.

Now even thought Finland doesn't anymore depreceate its currency, that doesn't mean that you wouldn't do it. The Swedish Kroona has went down in comparison to Euro and that means that you are subsidising industries and workers and thus preventing the economy to re-organize and be more effective.

You also missed that while the prices of domestic products, if there still are such things, remain the same, the prices of most products and services go up, in anothers words making the workers and savers poorer. Just try to find a fully Swedish made computer or a car etc..

You should also note that when the value of currency goes down, debts in foreign currency, in another words govermeant debts go up thus the state has to use more and more money to interests and repayment of those. Constrast this to Finland where out state had in last ten years, moved to only have debt denominated in Euro. 

And of course, what ever the export council says or calculates, in times like these, the benefits of good times and nullified. Just look at that chart, in here that would have caused headlines comparable to ""the end is coming"".

I also disagree on your note about risk involved with having a own currency, the risk in reality is still there. The Swedish banks have risks especially in Baltic and other Eastern European countries and if old EU countries and IMF had not interved, those economies would have exploded and that could have jeopardized the Swedish banking system and created an lucrative moment for hedge-funds to short Kroona until it breaks. The risk is still there, you may think it isn't, but the risk materializes you will know it.

Now I don't say that Sweden at whole couldn't make it with using its own currency, but there are risks and costs associated with that decision and at the end of the day somebody is going to have to pay for those.

I'm going to try to provide an actual answer to your question.

The closer an object is to its orbital parent, the faster it has to go. 

The equation we want to use here is for a small body in orbit around a much larger one:

    T = 2*pi*sqrt(a^3/GM)

where T is the orbital period in seconds, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the distance), G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the star.

We have a time of 3.15 days and a distance of 0.03 AU, and he mass given in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia is [0.31 solar masses](http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=Gl+581).

yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he
said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I
liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew
I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could
leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first

geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower
of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian
girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the
Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked
him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to
say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and

In fact I know you can make hundreds of such comments on Indians and it would be difficult for us to ""defend"" them. Though you must understand that dialogue and understanding comes with a genuine willingness to do so without falling into the traps of me versus you, and without any pre-intentions to tell your point of view than to understand the others'.

&gt; Why do some of your countrymen walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk/hallway?

When the standards are different my right is your wrong and vice versa.

&gt; Why do some of your countrymen take a shower in / spit in / blow snot in / drink from the bathroom sinks of American office buildings where they work?

Not sure what you mean, but, many Indians come from areas of water shortage (not something Americans understand), water is the medium used for any type of cleaning and satisfying ones thirst, and basins are the most common mode of accessing water. Btw, we find it gross when we latrines in the US without a drop of water and only a tissue paper to use!

&gt; Do you poop outside?

Yes, nature is the latrine for a significant number of Indians who live in villages or slums due to lack of water and infrastructure to build latrines.

&gt; Why do some Indians not wear deodorant or shower regularly?

Thats culture specific. Most Hindu Indians take a bath daily, I know many muslims who don't take a shower for days on end. Some of us find excessive use of deodorants disgusting for various reasons. It may be true that some communities in India genuinely do not understand the concept of personal hygiene and cleanliness, but even those that do, may not conform to the european standards of using excessive body sprays etc.

&gt; Why do you never see white women with Indian men?

If your intention is to somehow indicate that whites are superior to brown Indians by this statement, you can satisfy yourself with your beliefs. However if it is otherwise, I may not completely agree with your observation, but it may be true that very few Indians from India (not NRIs) may be hitching it up with white women. Either white women are not used to experiment with a relatively unknown culture or they haven't got over their white supremacy tendencies, or the average Indian is still a relative novice to this game of dating which plays out in the west much more early in your life and a part of the culture, while in India it is just getting out of the taboo status. Just wait for the next generation of Indian casanovas to hit your women, if you really want them to!

Reddit and the internet social scene in general has become a new age enlightenment of sorts for many white people. I've noticed that you guys often say things ""most whites are smarter than blacks"" like it's scientific fact, and everyone just goes along with it. That same thing happened in the 1500-1700's for the European aristocracy. What came out was Eugenics, Slavery and the carving up of Africa under the guise of civilizing the savages. There weren't any voices of decent in Europe. It was just one big circle jerk since everyone was white. If that's allowed to occur again, we may be looking at another holocaust or worse(whatever that could be) check out US African Command. 

You liberal white so-and-so's are the future of your nations and if you really care about freedom and equality, the pedding of these psudo-sciences and generalities need to be stopped and ostracized.



As for sub-Saharan Africa there's actually a problem with that question. Before around 2000BC, All of Africa was predominately similar in terms of genetics and physical appearance. The first foreigners to enter the continent in any serious numbers were the Hyksos in the 1900-1700 BCE. Before this time, lighter skinned people only trickled in here and there. Most of sub-Saharan Africa was people by Twa. Europeans pejoratively call them Pygmies. All of the Bigger Africans lived in the North. When Europeans and Asians(present day arabs) started to move into the Nile valley, the Blacks began to migrate south. Thats why peoples such as the Dogon in Mali, and the Tutsi in central Africa say that they descend from the Ancient Egyptians. So in essence all of Africa's greatness, including the Nile Valley civilizations are from sub-Saharan people. But technically they exist above it. 

But since you asked,
Here's a few examples of advances made south of the Sahara.

Here is the thread:


Message from A: 

Physics prove ""like attracts like'. We live in a world of physics. Yes, that's where I believe in..

Message from B: 

My understanding is that LOA works because quantum physics has learned that each of us chooses the quantum particles that we perceive in each atom, causing the atom to have a unique appearance to us, and that each time we turn around or look at something we have created it uniquely as it appears to us at that moment - the next time we turn around, we will create it differently again - that's power! Attracting is creating.

Message from Me:

I have to say this is as much physics as reading tarot cards, reading coffee grinds, or chicken bones. The truth of the matter is that if you have a positive outlook in life then the glass will look half full. Also when you look positive people sense you are more approachable not because you have a better vibe, but because of million years of Evolution that made us very good at reading body language, and being more approachable leads you to more success in finding a mate, working in teams, finding food, etc, etc. Oh and physics doesn't say anything about like attracts like, it actually says that opposites attract, but thats about positive and negative charges...
Sorry to burst your bubbles.

Message from B:

 You have NOT burst the bubble!! I’m not a quantum physicist, but I’ve read quite a bit about it, and here’s how I understand why the law of attraction works:
You are totally right that like-charges repel each other in quantum physics – positive charges repel positive charges, for example – that’s the electromagnetic force.
But, there is another force that is 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force, and physicists call that the “strong force” – it’s the force that holds the nucleus of every atom together. The nucleus of an atom is composed of neutrons and positive-charged protons, which normally repel each other completely.
Dr. Hideki Yukawa (Nobel prize in physics) discovered way back in 1935 (and it was confirmed in 1947 and accepted as fact ever since then), that neutrons and protons in the nucleus of the atom (together called nucleons) constantly emit “virtual particles” called “mesons” and that they exchange these mesons with another nucleon (proton) or with themselves, and this interaction is what creates the “strong force” that holds the nucleus of the atom (and therefore all of physical reality) together.
In order to create this strong force, protons (nucleons) emit the virtual meson particles toward other like-particles in order to attract them into, or keep them in, the nucleus of an atom. The action and result that is created by this exchange of virtual particles among like-particles is that “strong force” itself – the strong force would not exist without this exchange of virtual particles.
Thoughts are virtual particles. Atoms, particles, everything that exists has intelligence and memory. Virtual particles are the thoughts of particles. Attraction would not exist without thoughts, the exchange of thoughts, the exchange of virtual particles.
That’s how like attracts like - by the exchange of information, virtual particles, thoughts – on the atomic level, and on the human interaction level. And, this attraction force is100 times stronger than the repelling force.
Of course, quantum physics also says that you create the entire universe unique to YOU every time you look at it – every time you turn around, and you create it based upon your belief at any given moment. So, since your belief now is that like can only repel like, that’s the truth for you and no one will ever convince you differently! You don’t put out the virtual particles, the thoughts, that would make it work, so the truth for you is that, the law of attraction does not work. You’re right, and you always will be – for you.


Message from Me:

Nobody is saying that Strong interactions don't exist, but you should realize certain limitations that they have first they are between quarks only (reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), which are the fundamental elements that make neutrons and protons, second this force even though very strong have a very fast decline and are not visible after 10 femtometers (1.0 × 10-14 meters) which means they only hold inside the nucleus. This is because the strength that they have falls very quickly in a non-linear matter.
But anyways this doesn't have anything to do with proving my point, the point is just because there exist attracting forces that keep atoms together, gravity, or whatever other force you might like to use as example tomorrow, doesnt mean that they have anything to do with people that think good thoughts are going to get good things...
You see even if we pretend that this magic you believe exist does, that would mean that there would have to be something that marks energies as good, and as bad, yet good and bad are complete human constructs. The physical universe doesn't have such attributes.
But I think this conversation is not going to lead anywhere people who usually believe this just like to twist science to whatever snake oil they are trying to sell.
If you are going to answer please explain how you are bootstrapping from physics to human's wishful thinking.
Particularly this beautiful line:
""That’s how like attracts like - by the exchange of information, virtual particles, thoughts – on the atomic level, and on the human interaction level. And, this attraction force is100 times stronger than the repelling force.""
How do you go from virtual particles to thoughts, and atomic level to human interaction level?
Also take a look at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Attraction#...


Message from B:


For those who do believe in the law of attraction, I’m responding to Federico’s statements that there can be no connection between the atomic level and thought, that virtual particles can not be thought, and that there is no proof for the law of attraction in quantum physics.
I did not make it up!! And this is not new information. A particle, whether it’s a virtual particle or a real physical particle, does not even exist until an observer (ie. a person) focuses a thought upon it and causes it to appear from nowhere. Before that moment, it was only a probability, a specific frequency, raw information that had no locality and no form. The act of a thought brought it into existence. And, raw information itself is a thought (intelligence), and a thought (intelligence) is raw information. These are all commonly accepted principles in quantum physics.
The concept that a thought creates particles, that a thought creates physical form, has been put out in theory and later confirmed in research by very many people. Among those theories are those of Max Planck in 1900 (quantum hypothesis), Niels Bohr in 1924 (probability waves), Werner Heisenberg in 1927, Richard Feynman in 1949, J.S. Bell in 1964, David Bohm in 1970. There are many others, then and now.
For the connection that a virtual particle is intelligence (a thought) being communicated between like-particles, information being exchanged, therefore thoughts, see the decades-long work of physicist Dr. David Bohm, whose theories are widely accepted among quantum physicists. He also says the universe (and everything in it) is constructed like a hologram, where all the information of the whole is distributed equally everywhere in the whole, and the information of the whole is available at any given point in the whole, and that everything is composed of pure frequencies, pure intelligence, pure thought – everything is.
Even in biology, neurophysiologist Dr. Karl Pribram discovered that one of the ways thought is manifested in physical form in the brain, is by brain cells exchanging information, intelligence (thought) in the form of molecules that are called neuropeptides (molecules are composed of particles).
Later, neurophysiologist Dr. Candice Pert and her team discovered that neuropeptides exist everywhere in the body, not just in the brain, and that this is how the cells of the body communicate the information necessary for the body to function. She says the mind (thought) exists everywhere in the body, not just in the brain.
And, neuropeptides behave like virtual molecules. Candice Pert and her team have also discovered that the information in a neuropeptide from a cell in the foot, or anywhere in the body, gets transmitted instantly – instantly – to the brain. That’s not possible physically, so they are saying that neuropeptides behave like virtual molecules (do not have physical form, yet they appear to have it), and their only purpose is the exchange of information, of intelligence, of thought – instantly.
If you want to read about all the people I’ve mentioned and many more, I recommend these 2 books: http://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Universe-Mich... http://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Wu-Li-Masters-Ove...
They will likely empower you and change your world.
There are also quotes about the fact that physical reality does not actually exist, that it is an illusion which you create – quotes from Einstein, physicist Max Planck, etc. here: http://www.psychicwalter.com/Quotes.html
Also, Wikipedia.com is not a reliable source for information. Almost anybody can contribute information to it and nobody ever checks it for accuracy.

1425958774,"If you read carefully through what I wrote, you will see that the objection is to whether those bits of stone are man made or natural. I didn't object to the 50,000 year date as such. Sure, they've dug deep enough to have uncovered 50,000 year old strata. I can do that in my back yard. But the question is, have they found evidence of human habitation there?

Since stone can't be radio-carbon dated, the layers have to be dated using organic remains. The 50,000 year old date comes from charcoal found in those layers. The authors make it very clear that there was zero evidence for a hearth, so the charcoal came from some natural source, most likely forest fires.

The ""evidence"" for human habitation was **not** the charcoal (that was simply used for dating), but the stone bits. Some people thought that they were fashioned in the form of tools, and took that as evidence of human habitation.

However, the paper itself points out that such shapes could be caused by natural forces (freeze-thaw fractures). Further, they do not resemble tools that are known to have been made by hominids 50,000 years ago in other parts of the world. So this evidence is very slim, at best.

Also, ""pre-Clovis"" does not mean 50,000 years old. There is a growing body of evidence that there were humans in the Americas before the earliest evidence of Clovis culture. Your own first post mentioned this, when it talked about the coprolite found in the Oregon cave, which is 14,000+ years old. All of this fits very well with the idea of migrations from Berengia during a period from 18,000-14,000 years ago. As I said earlier, yes there were people here before Clovis, but they were the same sort of people as Clovis, originating from the same ancestral group in Berengia.

What it does **not** fit in with is the idea of humans in the Americas 50,000 years ago. I don't doubt there's a ton of pre-Clovis literature out there; I've read some of it myself. But I am pretty sure that there are no credible reports of other sites in the Americas that are 50,000 years old.

Finally, you mention a bunch of other random stuff, from native folklore to the Solutrean hypothesis. I don't want to spend a lot of time going over everything point by point, but if you do a quick web search you will see that none of these is accepted scientific evidence.

Yes, Clovis points do kind of look like Solutrean points from Europe. But guess what, they also look like the pre-Clovis points right here in the US, such as Cactus Hill points. Why bring in a resemblance to a culture 5000 years and 4000 miles away, when there is a precursor right here on the same continent?

It goes to show that tools are designed for a certain job and their shapes show this. There are only so many ways that you can design an efficient spear head from stone, so it's not terribly surprising if two working spear heads from two different parts of the world happen to look similar. Both Clovis people and the Solutreans hunted big game, why shouldn't their spear heads look similar? They were designed to bring down the same kind of animals.

I'm not even getting into the nitty gritty of how there are big differences between them as well, how there is no evidence of a seafaring culture that could cross the Atlantic at the time, or the inexplicable 3000+ year gap between the two technologies, etc. Other people have done that adequately if you want to check the web.

Haplogroup X **derives** from precisely that population in Berengia I mentioned in my first post. It proves that the first Americans came from Berengia in Asia, not from Europe. I even provided you with a published, peer reviewed article on that in my earlier post. I guess you didn't get the chance to read it, so I'll quote from it:

*Haplogroups A–D are also frequent in Asia, suggesting a northeastern Asian origin of these lineages. However, the differential pattern of distribution and frequency of haplogroup X led some to suggest that it may represent an independent migration to the Americas. Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Native American haplogroups, including haplogroup X, were part of a single founding population, thereby refuting multiple migration models.*

This stuff is all out there in the peer reviewed literature. It's not controversial, except on sensationalistic conspiracy theory web sites. Check out your library.


EDIT: heh, I just noticed that you had modified your earlier post to add that PBS link about Haplogroup X. I already answered it above, but just to provide some extra background, this was an area of speculation when that PBS documentary was made (2004).

&gt;If Israel is actually the demon you say what's the point of discussing it?

Israel is the demon I say. See above for the reason.

&gt;There is not much the Palestinians could do if your beliefs are true.

Every palestenian knows they can be killed by an israeli on any given day. My comments are not aimed at them. It's aimed at americans and europeans who have influence over their governments and can hopefully stop their governments support of israel.

it is also aimed at everybody who buys products in the hope that they will boycott israeli goods.

Does that answer your question?

What are you trying to achieve by cheerleading the deaths of palestenians?

1425958986,"That's ""almost"" how it is in most of Europe, and it works. Rather than have it municipally owned, for the most part the incumbent telcos were allowed to keep it, but they were required to offer equal access to their own retail arms and their competitors.

In the UK, for example, any provider has the right to choose between one of two options: Wholesale access via British Telecom where they get backhaul on dedicated capacity to one or more locations, at cost + a margin (that is limited by the regulator so BT can't gouge anyone), or ""local loop unbundling"" where the provider covers cost + a regulated margin to get equipment at BT's local exchanges, where they can get raw copper (and fibre as BT rolls it out) to their subscribers.

A lot of broadband providers in the UK now offers ADSL options with higher bandwidth than what BT themselves have been offering, over BT's own network.

In addition of course everyone is free to negotiate resale options ""on top"" of any of these providers, but that's at the discretion of the providers - only the ""raw"" access to the subscribers is regulated.

In some European countries it's similar for cellphone networks. In Norway, or example,  most (all?) of the licenses have terms that require the operator to resell access to their network at at most cost + a regulated margin. As a result there are dozens of ""virtual"" operators, and a few that have built their own networks only for small regions and rely on roaming from the main operators to cover rural areas.

Energy companies and fixed line telephony also operate the same way in Europe, where the physical infrastructure is accessible to any company that can meet certain terms, at a cost + regulated margin.

It largely works very well - there was a lot of consumer confusion initially, but now the only confusion is figuring out who is best and cheapest - we have so much choice.

1425959002,"&gt; Knowing the history as you do, how can you say the Catholic church was the catalyst for moving beyond the oppression of the masses, and the denial of information that was so prevalent back then?

I'm not really sure what you're talking about here.  ""The oppression of the masses"" is a sentiment from a much later age.  There was no sense in the Dark Ages that any particular institution oppressed the masses.  I'm not even sure there was any sense that the diverse populations of the post-Roman world could be lumped together as ""the masses"".  They were a million independent communities, fighting against the entropy of a period in which communication, trade and security were breaking down of their own accord.  Hunger, poverty and the violence of blood-feuds oppressed them.  The Church was the one widespread institution that set itself to the task of opposing those things.  So the Peace and Truce of God set limits on when and against whom the armed and landed classes could use violence as a way of resolving disputes.  Efforts at ecclesiastical organization provided the basis for local municipal structure and maintained civic communications between regions.

&gt; ... but you can't say that the Church's attitude towards science was HELPFUL back then, can you?

What science?  No one was practicing science at the time.  Modern scientific method requires a number of things that a disintegrated society simply cannot provide, foremost among them a social structure that's conducive to the spread of information.  That requires a standardization of measurements, a standardization of jargon, open lines of communication to ensure the spread of information, and a peer system of organized labor.  Europe had little to none of that in the Dark Ages, and feudal society was too hierarchical to really provide for a scientific community.  The practice of science also requires *time*, and the problem of violence, famine, plague and poverty held a monopoly on most people's time throughout the era.  What little science was practiced during the era tended to blend into alchemy.  The Church *did* have an ambivalent relationship with alchemy, but then, alchemy also tended to bleed into idolatry and demonology.

What ultimately provided the social structure Europe needed to develop modern science was the monastic system that began in the Dark Ages and developed throughout the Middle Ages proper.  The monasteries developed scholarship, cultivated the scientific documents that had survived the Roman era, established the mechanical measurement of time necessary for many kinds of experiments, and devoted themselves to developing the techniques of medical and agricultural practice.  For the better part of 1000 years, Catholic monks were just about the only European practicing some form of science, and the innovations they introduced helped spark the agricultural revolutions that eventually gave birth to the modern era.  You can still see the lineage of monastic science in the Mendelian genetics and the theory of the Big Bang, both of which were the work of Catholic clergy.

The Church didn't start showing outright hostility to science until the Renaissance.  On the whole, its role was less defensible during this period, but even so, the case against Christianity isn't as clear cut as it might seem.  The Copernican system was initially accepted by the Church without argument, and only banned later on.  The Church patronized men like Leonardo da Vinci and Brunelleschi.  As time progressed, its relationship with the scientific pioneers of the Renaissance darkened, and to understand why, it's important to look at the context of the time.  Interest in pagan philosophy, religion and culture were on the rise.  Yes, Giordano Bruno was a philosopher and scientist, but he also dabbled in Arab astrological magic, Hermeticism and Pantheism.  Protestantism was on the rise, and seemed to many to herald a breakdown of social mores.  Disputes between European nations were growing more frequent and violent, Spain and Portugal were embarking on the conquest of both trade and land outside the Continent.  None of those things excuse the Church's opposition to some scientific theories during this period, perhaps, but they serve to explain in part the shift.

&gt; Were it not for the Church, wouldn't information (via books, literacy) have been propagated more freely?

Without the Church, there probably would have been no literacy at all.  The Church kept Latin alive, which is all that maintained Europe's connection with its Greek and Roman literary past during the Dark Ages.  Clerical scribes copied older books by hand, without which the original manuscripts would have simply mouldered and been lost.  The Church was also practically the only institution capable and willing to provide education during that period.  At a later date, yes, the Church created lists of banned books and there were occasional purges that sent those books to the fire.  But on balance would I say that the Church was more detrimental to literacy than it was helpful?  No.

&gt; As for changes within the Church, I suppose they did indeed take place, but they aren't the same as changes within science. Why?

All sorts of reasons.  Probably most basic is that science and religion are typically after two different things.  Science is looking for a practical way to order our understanding of the world so that we can make changes to parts of that world for our own benefit.  Religion is looking for a set of rituals, symbols and relationships that will shape people in certain ways and (in the case of Christianity) allow us some contact and reconciliation with God.  Different goals, different methods.

Method is another reason.  Science has a highly refined method that allows -- practically demands -- that it continually revise the model it creates so as to strike a balance between ""saving the appearances"" (ie. representing the world as we experience it) and providing a program for action.  Religion doesn't really have that sort of method, nor am I sure that it could or that it would be any better for it.",atheism,False,t1_c092yfu,blackstar9000,0,True,1240587913,0,0,1,c092yfu,t1_c092pdv,,False,1,,t3_8exwl,t5_2qh2p,

1425959049,"&gt; The secular authorities were acting on behalf of the Church, and would not have done the things they did were it not FOR the Church.

I'm not sure how you intend to substantiate those claims.  There are actually a number of documented instances of members of the clergy interceding on behalf of heretics turned over to the secular arm, arguing for clemency.  And prior to the 15th century, the Church forbid persecuting accused witches on penalty of excommunication -- without which the secular authorities might very well have held weekly bonfires.  To some degree the members of the Holy Office must have encouraged secular punishments, and as the centuries marched on that encouragement no doubt increased, but I see little evidence to suggest that loyalty to the Church is all that induced an otherwise docile secular judicial system -- a system that still sorted out civil cases with duel and ordeals -- from punishing heretics.

&gt; ... but it was also as much a result of the inherent belief in Christianity that one can make something true by repeating it enough times, and the people who disagree are ""heretics"" who deserve to be ""silenced"".

Can you provide some sources for that caricature?

&gt; The Crusades were what I was referring to, more than the Inquisition, and they slaughtered thousands of Muslims for their beliefs.

They justified it to one another by citing Muslim belief.  The factors that drove the Crusades were primarily the growing desire for economic and political expansion and the Church's need to channel a growing martial and feudal culture away from intra-European conflicts.

&gt; But the picture you're giving me is more along the lines of, ""The Catholic church did a lot of good during the Dark Ages, gained a lot of power, and spent the next few hundred years doing everything it could to maintain that power, eventually going WAY too far.""

Which is pretty much my understanding of the long line of Catholic history.  So far.  It's a subject that I'm continually studying, so my opinion may change.  But you don't have to take my word for it, as LeVar Burton would say.  Let me know if you want some references.

**Me**:

&gt; paradigmatic changes -- like the Copernican model, or Darwinian evolution -- tend to cause convulsions and generational conflict.

**You**:

&gt; BECAUSE of religion!

Nope.  Because a change in paradigm means a change in the way a particular field of study is conducted; the upheaval of reputations that are tied to the old paradigm; a radical new way of thinking about the world that people schooled in the old way may simply not be able to wrap their heads around; a shift in where money for research goes; and so on.  Darwinian evolution provided a brand-spanking new principle on which to organize the whole of biology.  That meant a lot of the discoveries that had made already established scientists so reputable and famous would fall to the wayside.  More, it meant that anyone who couldn't wrap their heads around the new theory -- and remember, these were men in their 50s, who hadn't been taught evolution in high school and college -- likely wouldn't be able to run with the wolves anymore.  And it was, at the time, a theory with significant material problems.  It hadn't yet been connected with Mendelian genetics, so there was no understanding of *how* offspring inherited traits from their predecessors, nor of how mutation could take place.  And the theory was roundly criticized for being built on an inductive argument rather than deduction from experiments.  It benefited from having some very outspoken and persuasive early adherents, but they jumped on board mostly because they saw the explanatory power of the theory.  That's rare insight; most of us have to have the power of evolutionary theory explained to us.

Writers like Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins make a big deal about how open and ""self-correcting"" science is, but they gloss over a lot of the issues in part because they're popularizers.  In a sense, they're selling science to the rest of us.  For a better rounded view, it's a good idea to take their enthusiasm with a little counterpoint.

Ziman's *Reliable Knowledge* is a solid explanation of what it is science does, along with a consideration of both its strengths and weaknesses.",atheism,False,t1_c09321f,blackstar9000,0,True,1240594989,0,0,1,c09321f,t1_c0930z2,,False,1,,t3_8exwl,t5_2qh2p,
