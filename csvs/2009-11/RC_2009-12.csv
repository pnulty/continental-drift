The question is certainly not would or could this be an inside job
just simply was it. For the record I don't know, in many ways I don't care. There is enough public information to know how power operates to lead me the conclusion that all these things are inside jobs whether planned directly or not. A relatively small group of people hold sway over huge resources militarily, economically, culturally and create an environment that maintains the status quo - a status quo of hopelessness, environmental destruction and human misery. Power is not passive in this it continually lobbies for it and against any challenge to this status quo by 'pretty much' all means necessary.

I don't think anybody but an idiot says it's an absolute certainty, but when the carbon dioxide levels correspond perfectly with our levels of fossil fuel consumption you have to draw an inference somewhere. When the average temperature correlates with both of those variables in near lockstep, you really have to work hard to discount it.

The sanctions were terrible, but I don't think you can simply blame the U.S. for international sanctions on behalf, again, of Kuwait and Saudi. Nor am I confident that there was a better way. Meanwhile they ignore the deaths of Iraqi Shiites at the hand of Saddam.

Then they talk about the deaths in Somalia because some Somalis decided that it was far better than Somalis starve than Europeans feed them.

For the current Afghan and Iraq wars they do seem to ignore deaths at the hands of Muslims and seem to put all of the responsibility on the U.S.



FTA:

&gt;Similarly, the United States is not solely to blame for the sectarian violence that engulfed Iraq after the 2003 invasion.

Solely? It is hard to see how it has more than a minor responsibility. Saddam was massacring Shiites and the U.S. shamefully did nothing. 

I have an idea, why don't Muslims start taking some responsibility for their decisions and their actions. Yes, the U.S. has been a murderous bully. Yet Iran and Iraq sent their teenagers to their deaths because of their own moral failings. 

FTA:

&gt;Americans should also bear in mind that the figures reported above omit the Arabs and Muslims killed by Israel in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank. 

I suspect that a big part of the reason they left the numbers off is because they would be so much smaller than people expect. Instead they can use vague comments as a substitute. 

And somehow they left off the numbers of dead in the various Kurdish revolts over that period, the number of dead in the Yemeni civil wars, the number of dead in Algeria and Morocco, the number of dead by Khaddafi's adventures, the number dead in Sudan and Somalia. Somehow the millions upon millions of dead Muslims at the hands of Muslims are ignored and Israel and the U.S. are blamed for all of the problems. The article is accurate in that the Muslim world does this, but that is the problem. Friedman is right in part: the narrative in the Muslim world is that the U.S. is the aggressor and the killer. The true story is that it is a violent unjust world and the sooner they recognize their role and the roles of their various leaders in this violence and death, the sooner they can make things better.

In regards to Native Americans - Edwards' family was key in mission work to Native Americans. I know that a lot of mission work then also tried to European-ize the native people, which is sad. And it seems like you dislike the claim of Christianity as truth to the exclusion of other beliefs - so I get that as a starting point. But for those missionaries, believing that the native Americans would go to hell without hearing about Jesus, going and telling them was one of the most loving things they could have done (I also understand that sometimes that mission work manifested itself in bad ways as well)

So, I think to lump Edwards into some larger ""Puritan"" label, and then bringing up all the crimes of Congregational churches from 1650-1800 is unfair.

As far as the sermon, it was a fire and brimstone sermon that was trying to encourage people to not trust in their own goodness and to trust in Christ. Worded very strongly, and given with all sorts of emotion drawing metaphors. The people in your quote thought they didn't deserve God's wrath, and they (like, according to Edwards, all mankind) absolutely did deserver God's wrath.

Anne Hutchinson is a lamentable case - she did say in her trial (which is where, from what I have read, wikipedia got off track from the historical record) that she received direct revelation from God, which is why they charged her of heresy. Her being a woman had a bunch to do with it, no doubt. But again, she died 60 years before Edwards was born. 60 years is a long time for the shape of faith to change. Edwards even strongly disagreed with the practice of his grandfather who pastored his church just before he did. 

Salem also had nothing to do with Edwards. 

The continuity of ""Puritans"" is not what you make it out to be. It is certainly not big enough to blame Edwards for the faults of every other Congregationalist Christian in the area in the century. In fact, Congregationalist church government is based on individual congregations having the right to govern themselves, without any sort of strong centralized hierarchy.

Again, I am not saying Edwards was perfect, but it seems like your problems are mostly with 1) Christianity in any form or time claiming exclusive rights to truth or 2) bad deeds done by some people who are lumped together with Edwards because we have to make some sort of categories in history to create some sort of narrative.

As far as I know, Cyprus is occupied mostly by Greek Cypriots and some Turkish Cypriots who were pretty much transported from Turkey to create the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, who is only recognized by Turkey (yeah, open up a Turkish map.

Turkey says that they used their guaranteer rights (or something like that) granted by the 1960 agreements to occupy the island for the safety of its citizens.

Also, there was the Annan plan which, according to what I have heard, would have helped a lot and was supposedly not very biased as it was put together by UN (hence the name) that was accepted by Turks but not the Greeks.

So given all that, I think Turkey gets too much heat for what's happening.

Islamic scholar obviously means a scholar of Islam. And a Muslim scholar a scholar who is Muslim.

Are people who get degrees in various theology-related fields in secular universities known as scholars of Christianity or Judaism? I've never heard that used. But then again, graduates of Jewish seminaries for instance, might be called Rabbis. But in Islam, we call the scholars 'Ulema', and an individual an 'Alim'. Perhaps that's a better word? It means 'scholars' and 'scholar' respectively, but the Arabic word obviously denotes the Sunni/Shi'a context when Muslims hear it.


&gt; I don't have to be accredited in order to study Islam and be called a scholar.


Thank God Western civilization doesn't follow the same principles otherwise Europe would still be in the dark ages. Imagine the chaos that would reign if all fields of learning were dominated by unaccredited institutions.

Muslims started the Bimaristans (medical schools and hospitals) following the model of their legal institutions, which is the same model followed today all over the world (re: the Wiki link I pasted about 'ijazah'). Imagine if medicine were still practiced in the old manner.


&gt; Unbiassed study is essential for honest reflection, and for that to happen, I believe outside scholars should be free to study Islam while retaining the title of ""scholar"".


That's why Sunni Islam arose in the first place. It's called 'orthodox' Islam because the methodology was designed to root out personal bias and get to the truth (historical and scientific) of what Islam actually is, as laid out by Muhammad and his companions. It was born out of necessity. This is precisely the issue with 'scholars' like Dr. Naik. They let personal bias creep into their 'scholarly' opinions. Muhammad has repeatedly denounced people who issue personal opinions about religion as rulings or fatawa. The point is to issue a ruling that reflects the truth of what Muhammad actually said and did as well as the spirit of Islamic law. You need to be educated to do that. You don't have a sufficient education unless you've mastered all the material available under proficient teachers. Thus the Islamic idea of universities and academic degrees. It's usually a 4-5 year course to be an 'Alim', an 8-year course to be equivalent to a 'Mawlana' (title usually used in South Asia though), and the equivalent of a Ph.D. makes one a Mufti (Shi'a call it Ayatollah and their total run is 12 years I believe).

10 years of professional education in the most competitive atmosphere where all your work is reviewed and critiqued versus someone who's self-taught. Yeah... right.

It's not even a huge deal because most (but not all) of the time, Dr. Naik just regurgitates the rulings of actual Muftis. Even he acknowledges the difference.",False

A graduate of the Pakistan School of Fashion Design, Maria launched her label ‘Maria B’ in Lahore back in March 99. Right after the fashion show, she opened the doors to her new boutique located in the Defence residential area. Her cotton shalwar kameez and embroidered evening wear, all meticulously cut and stitched, were quickly snapped up by trendy Lahoris. 

During her four years at the Fashion School, Maria learnt to make patterns, drape and stitch by hand – all that hard work has obviously paid off. Maria’s clothes can be described as chic and modern – they are wearable, well-cut and neatly finished. For the shoot with Meera, she selected outfits off the rack. “I wanted a glamourous look – to depict a lifestyle with a certain image. These are clothes for every occasion; they are laid back and eccentric.” The outfits she has selected – from a cotton sleeveless shalwar kameez to black net culottes to a chiffon sari – embody her look for the modern Pakistani woman in the late 90s.

Unlike other aspiring designers in Pakistan, Maria has been exposed to the international fashion scene early in her career. While still a student, in 1997 she participated in Forcea, a competition in for young designers, in Belgium and walked away with the “Les Etoiles De La Mode” Award. “I had designed some modern, futuristic pieces, but I had used traditional embroideries and indigenous materials. I didn’t expect much, but I did try my best – after all, we were the first batch from Pakistan to participate in this event, she recalls. Maria went home with an award and there was no turning back. She learnt that there was tremendous scope for Pakistani fabrics in the international market and was determined to make her mark globally. As she says with confidence, “I’m a staunch patriot – I want to take Pakistan’s name in the international fashion scene. I want to show people around the world what a great heritage we have. That really is the core philosophy of my business. We want to go into the international market and prove ourselves as a Pakistani brand name.” 

Maria’s main goal is to export her outfits abroad – “I want to send haute-couture items such as evening wear, bridal wear etc. to Europe and then eventually to the US.” She knows it is difficult to break into the international market and has given herself ten years to do so. “That is how long it takes for most designers – so it is good that I am starting so young!” She remains undaunted by the global competition and says “you have to aim high – and I do want to get to New York, Milan and Paris one day.”

A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution. A wise nation will combine all these considerations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties.

&gt; The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment.

&gt;The study of mathematics appears to slow down after the onslaught of the Islamic invasions and the conversion of colleges and universities to madrasahs. But this was also the time when Indian mathematical texts were increasingly being translated into Arabic and Persian. Although Arab scholars relied on a variety of sources including Babylonian, Syriac, Greek and some Chinese texts, Indian mathematical texts played a particularly important role... eventually, Indian algebra and trigonometry reached Europe through a cycle of translations, traveling from the Arab world to Spain and Sicily, and eventually penetrating all of Europe...it appears that original work in mathematics ceased in much of Northern India after the Islamic conquests. http://india_resource.tripod.com/mathematics.htm

&gt;There has been much written in certain modern academic circles regarding the “stealing” of ideas by one civilization from another. In no case was this truer than in the wholesale appropriation of India’s intellectual treasures by the early Arabs. Keay points out that India’s “scientific and mathematical discoveries...were readily appreciated by Muslim scientists and then rapidly appropriated by them. Al-Biruni was a case in point: his scientific celerity in the Arab world would owe much to his mastery of Sanskrit and access to Indian scholarship.”  http://islamicexpansionanddecline.blogspot.com/

You aren't sure how distortions and half truths from the IPCC are relevant?

&gt;I was referring to the years the IPCC reports came out, not the years in which the studies were done....I'm not sure why any of this matters though.

It matters if you are purposefully trying to insert space between graphs in order to make one appear more antiquated.  If that was not your intent, then no, it doesn't matter.

&gt;According to the studies in the 2007 report, it started around the year 800 and peaked in the year 1000 or so. Since Mann's 98/99 studies start in 1000, you don't see a bump, but later studies do.

versus, from your own link:

&gt;The terms ""Little Ice Age"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" have been used to describe two past climate epochs in Europe and neighbouring regions during roughly the 17th to 19th and 11th to 14th centuries, respectively.

Which is it?

Regarding the effort to ""get rid"" of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), if Mann's graph isn't enough to demonstrate it, consider the huge effort to downplay the maximum temperature from that epoch, and the silly red herring of trying to claim it was only regional.  Consider the propaganda from the alarmists: http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2006/02/medieval-warm-period-was-just-as-warm.php

You will note the following quote, supposedly from a NOAA website:

""The idea of a global or hemispheric ""Medieval Warm Period"" that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.""

The trouble is, the [page](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/medieval.html) this is supposedly from doesn't say that at all.  It is this kind of thing that makes me doubt alarmists' claims.

In fact, as study continues, the Medieval Warm Period is being shown to exceed current warming:

&gt; Prophetically, the world government is linked to previous world empires, and particularly to the Roman Empire:

&gt;    * A seven-headed beast (Rev 13.1) implies that the final world system or government (the 'seventh') embodies the royalty, learning, brutality, godlessness, and corruption of the six previous world systems, from Egypt to historic Rome. In particular, the fourth beast 'speaks like a lion' (Babylon), tramples with 'the feet of a bear' (Medo-Persia) and moves fast 'like a leopard' (Greece) - see Rev 13.2.

&gt;    * Prophetically, the world government is tightly linked to historic Rome. This implies it will have the strength and brutality of Rome, as symbolised by the crushing and shattering 'iron' of Dan 2 and Dan 7. It is interesting to observe that the **EU Constitution claims 'absolute power' over member states**, and that the **EU is creating a European army**. The Roman Empire was also known for its strongly centralized government and massive public works, such as roads.

&gt;    * Whilst having the strength of iron, the world government will also have great weakness. This is symbolised by the 'feet of iron and clay' (Dan 2.41-43). Just as iron does not combine with clay, the member states of this government will never readily combine with each other. **Such disunity is apparent between member states of the EU.**

&gt;    * The Roman Empire adopted Christianity under Constantine in the early 4th century. Prophecy indicates that the coming world government will also embrace a form of Christianity. A Roman revival and 'Christianised' empire (the Holy Roman Empire) has been at the heart of Europe's leaders and aristocracy for well over 1,000 years. However, this religious system will be a corrupt (apostate) church (Rev 17).

&gt;    * Roman society was organised on a strict hierarchy; citizens, provincials and slaves. Full citizenship was granted to provincials en masse as a way of securing their loyalty to Rome. It is interesting to note that the **1992 EU Maastricht Treaty forced all citizens of member states to become citizens of the EU**.

&gt;**Signs of the coming World Government**

&gt; The move to create a New World Order (NWO) probably started in America during the early 1900's. Significant milestones are:

&gt;   * 1935: a NWO symbol appears on the back of the US dollar bill

&gt;   * 1940: H. G. Wells publishes a book entitled 'The New World Order'

&gt;   * 1945: UN is founded

&gt;   * 1948: World Council of Churches (WCC) is formed

&gt;   * 1954: Bilderberg Group is formed

&gt;   * 1957: EEC is formed under 'The Treaties of Rome'

&gt;   * 1973: Trilateral Commission is formed

&gt;   * 1974: Universal Product Code (UPC) introduced in retail stores

&gt;   * 1990: George H.W.Bush spoke on 'Toward a New World Order'

&gt;   * 1995: World Trade Organization (WTO) formed

&gt;   * 2002: American FDA approved the 'VeriChip' (human implanted microchip for electronic ID)


&gt;Other major players in the NWO are international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Illuminati and NATO. At present there are three major economic areas in the world: Europe, North America and the 'Pacific Rim' nations (Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan etc.). An objective of the Trilateral Commission is to harmonize these three regions. In turn, each region is being harmonized by merging nations into a superstate. This process is virtually complete in Europe and economic union is being pursued in the Americas. Who will lead this World Government? Prophecy points to ten world leaders and a world dictator associated with the fourth beast of Dan 7. This beast is strongly linked to Rome, suggesting that world leadership comes from **Europe**, ***not*** **America**.

&gt;**World government is clearly happening**. Outwardly it may seem to be beneficial, but according to prophecy it will exercise the control, intolerance and brutality of ancient Rome. Other events that characterise the end of this age are the emergence of a world dictator, the emergence of Israel, world-wide persecution of the true church, the emergence of an apostate church, forced electronic ID of individuals, and God's judgements upon the earth.

&gt;**The good news is that you can escape God's judgements by putting your trust in Jesus Christ.**

As (s)he says v/u were interchangeable and were essentially the same letter until the 17th century. When the convention to use 'u' for the vowel and 'v' for the consonant became entrenched. Previous to that the usage had been based primarily on word position (as for s/long s) it's worth noting that English did not have the 'v' sound until the middle English period (when it emerged from Scandinavian loan words like 'viking' and 'valley'. I don't know whether Latin had the 'v' sound, but it makes sense that it wouldn't be necessary to distinguish 'v' and 'u' if they represented the same sound. 

'j' was also used as a numeral in Latin at the end of a number in place of 'i' e.g xxiii (23) could be written xiij I don't know enough about Latin spelling to be specific about how it was used in words but I would hazard a guess that there was some similar pattern at work. (As you may have guessed I've never learnt Latin.)

In terms of the English alphabet the 'j' that we know and love today is a johnny-come-lately letter. Whereas 'a', 'h', 'k' and many others can be traced back to the earliest Semitic alphabets which were formed from their hieroglyph ancestors and have pedigrees going back three millennia, (eg 'A' was the 'ox' symbol) 'j' used to represent consonant sounds /dʒ/ (the J in Jar or James and the dg in bridge or wedge') and occasionally /j/ as in 'Jung' 'Jacques' (i.e where the 'j' is pronounced like 'y')  only dates from medieval times. It was an innovation of the post-invasion Normans who were wrestling with transcribing Middle-English with their own alphabet. They made lots of changes to make this easier for them like throwing out a few old English letters like 'ash' æ and 'wyn'  þ and making 'Q' a standard replacement of 'cw' or 'kw'. These changes go along way to explaining why English spelling is so idiosyncratic compared to other European languages. When you see modern transliterations of Arabic words like qua'ran or al'Qaeda it's usually a close but not quite right approximation of the word in question, the same would have been true of the Norman-French scribes writing down the Old-English words they heard in their own alphabet. 

The relative recentness of 'j' is evidenced by its varying usage across languages. English uses it differently to how Latin used it and Spanish, German, Albanian, Basque etc use it different to how English uses it.

Considering that it is *as* important as a (but *not* a) utility, and there's been a big push to deregulate utilities, please cite an example of where deregulation has led to an increase in competition or lower prices in the utilities market.

An example of the opposite that I know of first hand is the deregulation of electricity in Maryland. Prices went up so much that there are [now calls to re-regulate](http://www.theenergydaily.com/hottopics/electricity_dereg/2132.html).

* Day n: Banks are completely deregulated.
* Day n+1: An orgy of consolidation and deal-making ensues, leaving the US with only a handful of consumer banks.
* Day n+30: That handful of banks, realizing that their customers are captive, raise rates and fees on all products and services by hundreds of percent.
* Day n+60: Filling the need for low-cost banking hundreds of fly-by-night operations open banks with no backing, taking deposits and disappearing overnight when they can't meet their obligations.

The concept of Wahhabism came prior to major imperialist action in the region (though it should be noted that it did not precede enlightened European excursions into the area), but did not gain steam until the 1970s.

Salafism, as per Wikipedia:

&gt;In modern times the word has come to have two sometimes dissimilar definitions. The first, used by academics and historians, refers to denote ""a school of thought which surfaced in the second half of the nineteenth century as a reaction to the spread of European ideas,"" and ""sought to expose the roots of modernity within Muslim civilization.""

Sounds to me like a conservative reaction to new, liberal ideas.  This isn't a phenomenon.

It should also be noted that English imperialism in the region goes all the way back to 1815.  Following World War I, America was extremely popular amongst Arabs simply because they believed that America's Western ideals of self determination were worth believing in, and that we'd exercise influence on Britain and France in order to allow for the Middle Eastern countries to control their own outcomes.  Obviously this never came to be, since as it turns out we don't always follow our own ideals when it comes to non-Western countries.

&gt;But what do you propose as a solution? We have already seen what the Arab street will do when left to it's own devices (i.e. the Taliban, Iran and the election in Algeria).

The Taliban emerged following the drawn out Soviet invasion that destabilized the region.  Iran was backlash for a US backed dictatorship, which resulted in extreme religious backlash (an example of what happens when an ulema has the real power in the region).  Algeria I'm not well informed enough about to argue.

I propose we leave countries to their own devices, perhaps suggest our own methods in terms of equality, but not by force, and allow them to move towards what we view as progressivism on their own.  Countries naturally trend towards this on their own when there is no outside interference, but nothing makes a person cling to archaic values more than an outside power telling them they are wrong for what they believe in. Social justice is an internal process.  It wasn't that long ago that America had prayer in public schools and segregation.  We didn't make these changes because an outside group told us what to do.

I'd remind you that initial US interest in the region was oil.  Then it was installing ""Democracy friendly dictators"" (always a hilarious term) when we were worried about Soviet incursion, and to an extent the wellbeing of Israel (though typically the motivation behind installing a certain leader was first and foremost being opposed to Communist powers).  Arabs have reacted negatively to being constantly invaded and interfered with for almost 200 years.  Wouldn't you?  Doesn't it seem logical that they'd probably stop being a threat if we didn't do that all the time?

Furthermore, why do we call Muslims the problem when they potentially pose a danger to US soil, but consider it a matter of justice and doing what is right when we intervene on foreign soil?  I'd love to do a comparison of how many civilian women died at the hands of the Taliban and how many died at the hands of US collateral damage in Afghanistan.

People keep forgetting just how long it took us to get to where we are as a culture.  We didn't do it by having an outside power tell us what to do.  We changed internally with a lot of kicking and screaming along the way, and we're still doing it.  America fought it's bloodiest war over whether or not it's acceptable to keep other human beings as property.  What makes you think that other social justice issues will come so quickly in the Middle East, with or without religion involved?  Wasn't the mainstream Civil Rights movement based largely in black churches?  Why can't it be the same way for Islam?  Progressive ideas don't just spring from nowhere.  It's an ongoing process.  After all, you may have just forgotten about it or not considered it, but you neglected to include sexual identity in your list of necessary equalities.  Maybe you think that it fits in with sexual identity or gender, but transgendered individuals certainly think their problems are unique.  We've not yet reached the pinnacle of equality, because once again it is a process.  Why is it not a process for them?  We can encourage change, but why do we need to force their hand?

I also happen to think that spending all our time pointing our fingers at how awful Muslims are detracts from race, gender, and sexuality based issues in our own country, but that's another issue entirely.",False

I was planning a 3 month backpacking trip through Europe after graduating from college. I had never even traveled outside of California up to that point. Everything was on track and ready to go. Plane flights booked, hostels reserved, everything. I checked on the status of my passport, which was due to arrive about a month before my plane trip. It still had not arrived at my house.

Another couple of weeks go by. Still no passport in the mail. I try calling the federal bureau of beaurocracy from work. Their phone lines are jammed. Now I'm starting to get really worried. A week before my trip, I find out that there is a website I can track the status of my passport on. It says that my expected date of arrival has been changed to a MONTH after my plane takes off due to an increase in volume of applications! (I later found out that this was due to a new law that required a passport to travel to Mexico.)

I freak the fuck out. My boss tells me to forget about it, there's no hope; so I quit my dinky job at Borders and drive to LA from Santa Barbara to go straight to the federal building itself and get answers.

I stood in line for three days straight to appeal to a human being. I kept getting denied. I was told life or death situations only. Come back with a doctor's note. Come back with an itinerary. Wrong window, go to window 7. Finally I'm told they can only help me if my plane is leaving within *24 hours.* That's cutting it pretty close.

I show up a day before my plane takes off. It's 4:30 in the morning. There's already a line 50 people long to speak to a single person at a window outside the building. I show them my itinerary, they direct me to another line to get into the building. I stand in that line for a few hours. I get into a line to take a number to wait to speak to a person at another window. 

There's an older Chinese lady who looks at me like it's my fault she's stuck in this shit job. She says she can't help me without a copy of my birth certificate. I tell her my original birth certificate is with my original application, which they have. She says she can't help me without it. I ask her why I would even be standing here if it wasn't for the fact that they botched my application? She gets really pissy, tells me not to yell at her, and I'm afraid I may have fucked myself over. I apologize profusely. I ask her to find it in her heart to help me. She says I can go to another building downtown where they produce official copies of birth certificates. It's already about 11am now, I've been waiting this long just to get to her - what hope do I have of getting back here before they close?

She writes me a note and says to show it to the security guy in the front to get back to her.

I'm a blur for the next hour. I run to my car, call my brother for directions to this building. Drive. Park. Elevator. Line. I remember the lady at the window is Jamaican. A few minutes later, I can't believe my eyes as I'm watching a copy of my birth certificate being printed out before me. Running. Driving. Park. More running. Back in line.

I tell the security guy I've got an urgent appointment with miss Le. He says to get into the ""urgent appointment line."" It's 50 feet long and not moving. I wait for twenty minutes, very little movement. I call the security guy over. I say I think I'm in the wrong place. I show him the note from miss Le, tell him she told me to go in ASAP. Holy fucking shit, it works. 

It's 3pm. Through security, past 2 more windows flashing smiles along the way hoping the people on the other side remember me. Miss Le beckons me over when she's done with her customer. She puts my application on top of the ""urgent"" stack and tells me to wait for my name.

After waiting all day in that stuffy building full of sad, desperate people, I didn't hear one name being called over the loud speakers. I felt like the fuckin' king of the world when they called my name to the window where they hand me my brand new passport.

I vividly remember walking back to my car with my passport in hand, not believing that I got it. I sat in my car and started laughing out loud. It wasn't until then that I could actually see myself in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Istanbul... I thought that fate had screwed me over, and I could have accepted it, but through a combination of perseverance, charm, luck, whatever, I pulled through. I'm pretty sure that's the happiest I've ever felt in my life.

I still can't think of that moment without getting choked up and laughing out loud.

He can turn a good phrase and present that famed starched British elegance to the world, but cannot really hide his anti-Euro fanaticism. To wit, he has Godwinned the Europarliament multiple times, comparing acts of legislation to the Ermächtigungsgesetz, for example. For further reference he went on Glenn Beck's show and told him he wished Britain had its own Glenn Beck (Goddess help them if that should ever happen) as well as essentially agreeing with most of Beck's asinine assertions about the coming new world order and long march of socialism, etc. etc.

Some of his criticisms of Gordon Brown are correct but to praise him for this is like calling someone who hits the broad side of a barn with a beachball an expert marksman. Brown is the captain of a sinking ship and an incredibly easy target. One does not get very many points for biting, accurate criticism of him. Hannan isn't exactly alone in pillorying the Prime Minister. Mocking Gordon Brown has become something of a national past time in the UK. Everyone, across the spectrum, hates him, and Labour never seemed too keen to say they're *proud* of him.

Of more concern is the fact that Hannan, short of vaguely nationalist statements, has never really illustrated how the European Union can better operate within its mandate. It's patently obvious he hates the institution, and moreover he even hates the values of his own country. He's out of step with the crushing majority of the British people on the NHS, to name just one example.

He does not explain how freedoms are being taken away, other than to occasionally quote some of the more superfluous and useless votes the EU has taken on fluff issues.

Well that's easy, you know exactly what he'd say.  The parliament is less open in regards to its waste and expenses (which is saying something when compared to the UK in light that all summer has been owned by the expenses scandal), less representative (divide the population of the EU27 by the number of MEPS and you'll see that it is approximately 10x less representative as the UK) and now legally bound to think of itself in terms of a separate national entity with the amalgamation of the three pillars and not for the advantage of any constituent member.

&gt; Obama's escalation in Afghanistan is the last in a string of disappointments. His flip-flopping acceptance of the military coup in Honduras has squandered the trust of Latin America. His Wall Street bailout leaves the poor, the unemployed, minorities, and college students on their own. And now comes the Afghanistan-Pakistan decision to escalate the stalemate, which risks his domestic agenda, his Democratic base, and possibly even his presidency.

* Obama said he would escalate the war in Afghanistan during his campaign. That is what you voted for in 2008. 

* As I remember, nobody seemed mad at all about the bailouts when they happened. Most of the left was all for them and the right was against them. Funny how different it is just a year later, eh?

* The Democratic base will vote for Obama in 2012 no matter what he does. This is because the other choice is the Republican candidate. A vote against the Republican is as good as a vote for the Democrat. 

* I don't know enough about the Honduran coup to comment on it, but I have to say, support for Obama in his own country seems much more important than support for Obama in Latin America.  

Obama has done pretty much what he said he would do during his campaign (although there are a few exceptions). You can't just assume the Democratic candidate is anti-war. This is not always so. You have to think critically before you vote and make sure you are voting for the candidate who you actually agree with. You can't really vote someone into office and then complain that they are doing what they promised you they would do during the campaign. 

As for the peace prize, I have no idea why it was given to Obama. I lost a lot of respect for the peace prize and the Nobel Institute that day.

If we accept that humans will most likely not devolve in intelligence (and don't go extinct), the first rise of civilization proves that there is a certain probability that civilization will arise again (after all, once an area becomes overly populated, as some place eventually would, it becomes highly advantageous to cooperate and form larger groups), making it virtually inevitable.  Writing would certainly arise again (if we don't lose it--but with writing, lengthy discourse and thus, eventually, science arise, and with science naturally implements would be invented to make man master of the land).  Anyways, if you suggest a return to wandering hunter-gatherer, people will still always tend towards the desire to better their lives--to be warmer, safer, to raise more children to adulthood--which inevitably points us towards domesticating plants and animals, leading to where we were before.

Conversely, some argue that the elimination of major (or all) beasts of burden, in particular the horse and the ox, would prevent the rise of much of civilization (after all, the best that North and South America had before the arrival of the Europeans was the llama).  Perhaps that is also true, but I am not entirely certain--perhaps it is enough to settle into stable villages and towns.

I would also posit, just for the sake of it, that you could view humans as the sort of scions of the Earth, as its first beings capable of complex inventions and the development of civilization.  Perhaps this is the point of the universe, and we should respect the Earth as our home but we should not deny our ability to reach outwards.

&gt;Before the glory that was Greece and Rome, even before the first cities of Mesopotamia or temples along the Nile, there lived in the Lower Danube Valley and the Balkan foothills people who were ahead of their time in art, technology and long-distance trade.

&gt;For 1,500 years, starting earlier than 5000 B.C., they farmed and built sizable towns, a few with as many as 2,000 dwellings. They mastered large-scale copper smelting, the new technology of the age. Their graves held an impressive array of exquisite headdresses and necklaces and, in one cemetery, the earliest major assemblage of gold artifacts to be found anywhere in the world.

&gt;At its peak, around 4500 B.C., said David W. Anthony, the exhibition’s guest curator, “Old Europe was among the most sophisticated and technologically advanced places in the world”

What Old Europe lacked that Egypt and Mesopotamia had is a mass of slaves to do the bidding of a powerful class, to build them palaces and monuments. The civilization of Old Europe seems to have been very egalitarian with everyone living in the same kind of structure and with only grave goods showing much difference. ",False

CCE's Major two regions are Europe and America. We have separate EU and US data centers, I think. Either that or there are two separate EU and US servers in our US data center.

&gt;Which ERP do you use? (SAP I assume) and is it well run?

SAP and yes. We're still transitioning from the old system, which is a long and painful process.

&gt;Do you have off-shore departments in India etc and how do you find working with those?

Not in India. We do have a separate development facility in the US where we have developers that are fresh from college, to help them get a foothold in the software development industry. (and, you know, develop for us and stuff) It's a nice place.

I don't, but business class seems like a good compromise between cost and benefits.

I'm not sure what you're getting at there. That completely dismissed what I just said. The way the economy runs in those nations is largely irrelevant. Hybrid economies are a *very* recent invention, and even then, ""hybrid"" is the wrong term to use. The reality is that the economies of the nations you're referring too merely have a well developed nationalisation of portions of industry while maintaining Capitalism's mode of production.

The reason for the hefty nationalisation, public welfare etc, is as I stated before, due to the struggles of the people against the interests of Capital. Europe is a great testament to that. 1860-1890 in most developed western nations, 1900 - 1930, 1940-1980. These brackets are where the biggest blows were struck (the exact dates depend on the country, obviously.) Capitalist society didn't hand us anything, and it didn't just decide to be a hybrid, nor did any of its parliamentary leaders make that decision of their own accord. The gains we have made were made with our own hands, resisting Capitalism's logic, and demanding what they have taken from our labour back. And even today, even in places with high quality welfare, Capital and its Parliaments still seek, rather viciously in places like Australia and the U.S. in the past 30 years, to revoke those victories.

The ""hybrid"" economies had *nothing* to do with higher standards of living for those of the working class. I would say it is more the *fear* of Capital that those national working classes would fight back if they rock the boat *too* much.

As for the trickling up schtick, that brief ""sounds like a bit of a wank"" was a stab at the fact that for a very long time now many people have toted that line about. But the fact remains that these people do not say these things out of some genuine belief that it is possible, at least not at first. These things are said because they either refuse to admit (out of class interests usually - most reformists are middle class nowadays) that people, working people, could decide their own fate, and create a better world with their own hands, or because they have vested interests in maintaining an already degenerate, brutal social order.

It is a matter of refusing people the right to fight of their own will. It is a claim that restricts this struggle to the current social order. Work within the limits of Capitalism, do not dare question *their* world.

It's subordination, its a naive at best. And most certainly, no change is possible via Parliamentarism when the parliament itself is an institution of Capital for the purpose of protecting Capitalism.

It would be like asking the tortoise to give up its shell.",False

But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news.""

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

""If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer.""

""Heavens! what a virulent attack!"" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

""First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest,"" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.

""Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?"" said Anna Pavlovna. ""You are staying the whole evening, I hope?""

""And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,"" said the prince. ""My daughter is coming for me to take me there.""

""I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.""

""If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,"" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.

""Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know everything.""

""What can one say about it?"" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. ""What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.""

Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.

In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:

""Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!""

She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.

""I think,"" said the prince with a smile, ""that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?""

""In a moment. A propos,"" she added, becoming calm again, ""I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?""

""I shall be delighted to meet them,"" said the prince. ""But tell me,"" he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, ""is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.""

Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the baron.

Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.

""Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,"" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.",False

The keyboard is going to be a matter of personal preference.  I have thick enough fingers that playing guitar takes extra practice to keep them from being a problem.  That said, After a couple of weeks, I'm very comfortable with the Droid keyboard.  I have an  LG V and a Voyager.  They both have much easier to use keyboards, with much more unorthodox layouts.  I find the little bulges of the Droid keys give me plenty of feedback, and I'm having no trouble getting up to speed.  I found that using a hard case with the Droid made the keyboard seem a lot worse than it is.  Once I stopped using it, I had much better access to the top row of keys.  

The camera got a whole lot better when the datestamp bug stopped screwing with the focus.  I think they have a lot of work to do, but the camera is not horrible.  If you turn the quality down to 3 megapixels, it speeds up a lot, so there's plenty of wiggle room until they get the software just right.  

I haven't had any stuttering problems, so I can't speak to that.  I find things here and there that I downloaded that fail from time to time, but that's not the phone's fault.  I think the android app situation is good and only going to get much, much better. 

The hardware supports multitouch.  I have a photo editor, PicSay that uses pinch zoom.  Other apps make use of it.  It's probably just a matter of time until the browser takes advantage of it.  I heard somewhere that the browser on another Android phone already does.  (European Droid maybe?)

If Obama pulls out of Afghanistan and there is an attack (not even nuke - just think Mumbai somewhere in europe or america) that is even remotely able to be tied back to Afghanistan - this would almost certainly guarantee a hard right shift in America (that would make Bush look like a bleeding heart lib) and would make CERTAIN that your ""gang banger"" scenario becomes reality.

Now there may only be a 10% chance that that happens - but are you willing to take that chance?

By going in and at least making an attempt to clean up some of the mess from the last 8 years we knock out any legs the right has to stand on if the worst case scenario comes true (and history has shown this to be the case - ie: the last 8 years)

I'll be the first to admit it's not a noble, or righteous position - but it is at least some kind of insurance against a right wing take over of America that would dwarf the one we had after 9/11.

The many forces interacting creat all the events of the world, certain things could be done to help certain things happen - sacrifice being the most commonly talked about of course and most likely the lest practiced form of nature worship - ritualistic planting behavior, complex fertility practices and narcotic experimentation were of course the more common 'religious' experiences within the pagan world.  In todays world we plant crops in very ritualistic ways, perform complex 'alchemical magic' for both the fertility of ourselves and the soil and then in our free time we engage in narcotic or televisual stimulation.

We can't even say that we as a secular portion of society don't still rely on the pagan religious myths today; 'love' describes a concept we can't easily express as does 'anger' and 'fate'.  To some degree we're still anthropomorphizing geopolitical events such as 'war' using the same kind of dialog Homer might have, most of the pagan systems in pre-christian europe (upto approx 500ad ish) are simple attempts to understand complex events or to observe important natural events i.e. the winter solstice.

&gt; European men are confused


Please realize that the effeminate style is mostly a subculture consisting of a minority of the population. Overall however, I think Europeans do indeed care more about fahsion and looking good in general than Americans.




&gt; The dense population and strong culture


City population density is pretty much equal everywhere, and Amsterdam, our capital, has less than one million inhabitants. With strong culture, I think you could better describe it as strong cultural differences with America. As when traveling in California some months ago, I found a lot of culture as well. Culture's is just a set of values you share with the people around you. Every group has it, you just don't see your own because you've gotten used to it. Europe has a longer cultural history but I don't think that has too much to do with dressing well.




&gt; they straighten their hair and they just look ridiculous

Can't help people who try but don't succeed. Dressing well doesn't mean that you should stand out. You should just be dressed *well*. The right fit, good quality material and colors that don't contrast in a bad way, that's pretty much all there is to it. Ofcourse, if you belong to a certain subculture, you can dress like that subculture because you want to be associated with it. For example, I associate Radcliffe's clothing with young partygoers into techno or rock, using drugs and getting girls. I don't think it would make much sense for him to walk around like that in the US, or maybe if he wanted to pick up European girls.




&gt; the neanderthals would not pleased with our cultural evolution

I don't know if it's our duty as men to please the neanderthals, but if it is indeed, I'd say you're completely correct in that looking effeminate is wrong. Wearing a sturdy overall would probably be best. You should realize however that pretty much every piece of clothing has cultural annotation to it, otherwise a suit for example wouldn't make any sense at all.




&gt; Are they not for comfort and protection?

That's indeed their basic function, but all jeans fulfill that purpose. It conveys creativity and interest in fashion to dress well. Not all people care to convey that. A construction worker wouldn't have any idea about all this, and he doesn't need a girl who posesses such values either. 




&gt; Let women worry about clothing trends.

So why should women care about them and men shouldn't? I think that in accordance to your theory, noone should care at all. Also, do you consider a girl to be more attractive when she dresses in a certain sense (i.e. not wearing the sturdy overall)? Girls have the same with guys, it's very easy to be a hundred times more attractive to a girl just by wearing cloths that convey you know what you're doing.",False

Yes. The most viable alternative currently is the religious fundamentalists. It's hard to say what political process Saudi will develop into but it'll be slow and gradual from the current status quo.

&gt; What would happen if you were to advocate for democracy?

If you advocate for democracy too loudly you'll be arrested. This is a monarchy after all!

&gt;It seems as if Saudi Arabia is very often on the same side as Israel in disputes, for example both oppose Hezbollah and support Hariri in Lebanon - they are also on the same side regarding Hamas vs. Fatah. How do you explain this?

You make a good point. I think the Saudi population are more averse to Israel than the gov. Saudi gov wants peace in Palestine, so they've suggested the Arab peace plan, etc. Saudi population see Israel as an aggressor and an occupier, period. I don't know what will eventually pan out. It's sad. The situation in Palestine is tragic on so many levels.

&gt; Do you believe the Saudis manage oil prices at a lower level than they otherwise would because of the Saudi relationship with the United States?

The relationship with the US is def there but it doesn't drive Saudi oil policy. If one thing because clear over the last decade or so it's that no one really knows how to control the oil market, even OPEC. They basically just pretend to and the world believes it. Don't get me wrong, they do have some influence, but it's very minimal.

&gt; Why is monarchy so prevalent in your region when it has died almost everywhere else in the world? Do you think there may be a religious connection?

In the Gulf it's probably more a result of oil being found in a rather primitive culture, so democracy never really had a chance to develop. I don't think religion per se is responsible, but honestly I don't know... This is a complex question. 

&gt; Are you ever embarrassed by your government, its backwardness?

Yes in some ways. It bugs me that some idiots at the top don't see how ridiculous it is that women can't drive, for example. But every country has its hangups I guess. Saudis (or Muslims more generally) didn't become the 'bad guys' till 911 even though we were the same before and after. Politics and public opinion are shifty and often illogical.

&gt; How do you feel when you see pictures of the King? Does he look respectable to you, not at all like a moron playing dress-up?

I actually really like and respect him. He's old, but he is genuine and a progressive reformer. I'm pretty sure it's the other vested interests and his influential half brothers that stymie efforts at reform. I hope he outlives them.

&gt; Saud is the name of a family. An Iraqi parliamentarian once mocked the fact that an entire country is named after one family. Do you have feelings about that?

Some do but I don't. They unified a country the a third the size of continental US. There were also other examples of this in history like the Hapsburg Dynasty in Europe. The official name of Jordan today is also the Hashimite kingdom of Jordan. To me there are many more important issues to think about than the name.

&gt; Have you come across the idea that America favors your country having a backwards political system because a modern leadership system would pose a more effective threat to Israel? Do you have any thoughts about that idea?

I think Saudi Arabia is rather primitive on the political development scale. It will be more representative but I see that happening gradually. I don't think that has anything to do with Israel... This suggestion strikes me as rather conspiratorial. I do believe though that the current alternative is much worse (the religious zealots).",False

That is very far away from the real problem. The issue Europeans have isn't with immigrant stores or restaurants, there are plenty of those from the immigrants that do contribute, the problem is the people that don't.

No, it isn't. Not at all, when compared to the *world* and not only Europe.

&gt;The integration of the immigrants have failed completely. Tax money is being spent on giving the immigrants a good start and having them integrated in society. For example, they are given social subsidies for as long they are studying swedish. There has recently been exposed that some are exploting the system and keeps on studying Swedish for years, faling tests deliberately, taking advantage of the social benefits given to them.

Sure, some people take advantage of social benefits (what do you mean, by the way, by ""taking advantage""? Isn't that what social benefits are for?) but does that invalidate the system? Do you have any statistics on how many cheaters there are out there? Are we talking one out of 1,000? One out of 10,000? You have no idea, right? You're just making (racist) groundless assumptions, right? Thought so.

&gt;Another case is that there has recently been a large increase in ""Alone refugee children"". These are ""children"" that have no identification when they come to Sweden and claim that they are under 18 years old. As they can't be proven to be older than 18, they must be accepted and given residence permits.

Again, do you have any proof here (more that the odd case), or are yyou just working from yoiur own fantasies? Also, if someone who is older than 18 feels the need to lie in order to get to stay in Sweden, doesn't that say more about the harsh Swedish immigration laws than anything else?

&gt;To speak against immigration in Sweden is also taboo and you will be called a racist or islamophobic. One popular argument is that people generalize and blame their real problems on minorities (the immigrants) as Hitler did. No large newspapers are writing about the over-representation of non-western perpetrators in rape cases the last couple of years. And only this year there has been an ongoing rampage of over three hundred cases of lighting cars on fire in highly immigrant-populated areas in Malmö and Gothenburg. Firefighters are required police escort when going inside these areas.

""Talking against immigration"", when basing yourself on your own racist fantasies, will get you called out for being a racist. 'Cause you are one. Obviously the arsons in the suburbs are problematic, but why do they happen? Is it because the youth aren't Aryan, or could there be a more complex explanation? What about unemployment, isolation, social destruction, cuts in the welfare state? Nha, it's probably because of the Arabs' inherent arsonist genes!

&gt;In some of these areas, like Tensta and Rinkeby in Stockholm, the population is 95% immigrants from either Somalia, Iraq, Iran etc.

True. Segregation is a problem that needs to be worked on. But is this not more a question of class rather than race? And what about ""some areas"" such as Lidingö or Danderyd where 95% are ethnic Swedes? Is that not a problem?

&gt;There are now plans of a building a Islamic Center in Helsingborg. Which will cover 10,000Sqm and will have it's own mosque, stores, swimming pools, sports center and so on.
&gt;If you dare to critize the building of these kind of projects you are called a racist and islamophobic and are said to respect the freedom of religion. But what I think is that that they are contributing to a more segregated society by isolating themselves and are given their own special places. Another example has been the recent controversy regarding the ban against Minaretes in Switzerland.

Yes, if you ""dare"" (brave man) to criticize people building a place of worship ONLY because you don't like them, be it Muslims or Jews or Buddhists, you are a racist. Why is building a Synagouge or a Mosque, or even a Christian church ""isolating yourself from society""? Does this apply to all religions?

&gt;Like another recent problem has been that children from tradional Muslim families forces their children to stay out of school becuase they find that educating children in music, religion, physical excersise (because the teacher was a woman), home education (because boys should not cook food) and sexual education is offensive.

That's right, and it's totally wrong. Just as wrong as when Christian families who put their children in schools where they are taught equally sexist and anti-scientific religious myths from the Bible.

&gt;As a finishing touch the swedish nationalparty (Sverigedemokraterna) have recently gained a massive upswing in recent polls and is now the 4th largest party with over 5% in votes. But as they are gaining power, the social democrats would want to consider a majority government to close out Sverigedemokraterna to gain a place in the parliament (Riksdag).

It is true that the deeply racist, xenophobic Sweden Democrat party are gaining in the polls. This, remember, is a party that was founded out of the neo-Nazi ""Keep Sweden Swedish"" group in 1988, that used to consist of skinheads and neo-Nazis well into the '90s, and that today again and again proves to be extremely racist against Muslims.

&gt;EDIT: Why is this getting down voted so much? Yes it's a controversial subject, I know, but it's still worth debating

Replace ""islamification"" with ""jewification"", ""Muslims"" with ""Jews"" and ""Mosques"" with ""synagogues"" and you'll see exactly how filthy this racist crap is.

Who could have predicted that kind of outcome? It must be a muslim conspiracy. 

Riots? People breaking the law? Lock them up, fine them, put them in retraining programmes, whatever. When there are riots in towns and suburbs mostly populated by migrants, whose cars do you think are being put on fire? Hint: People tend to park their vehicles near their homes. 

You are not a racist? Yes you are, substituting 'culture' for 'race' is just cosmetics. Saying you're fine with Arabs but you don't want any immigrants from places with a dominant culture based on Islam and that happens to just include all Arabs ....... what a lucky coincidence, eh?

Crime? Wwhen crime is an issue in immigrant communities, the victims are mostly immigrants themselves. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to be robbed by some guy AND to be blamed for all robberies in your neighborhood due to your ethnicity or religion? 

Enforce laws equally without regard for religion. Kids need to go to school, no matter what Mohammed or Jesus have to say about it.

If by ""larger"" you mean fatter, then you are probably right.

However, the height/bulk of humans has by no means followed some linear trend which you could extrapolate to the past and conclude that people were smaller then.

For example, Cro Magnon man 30,000 years ago was about as tall as humans are today, as we can tell from skeletal remains. People grow taller and shorter based on a number of factors, among which nutrition, climate, and life style are some of the more important. As these factors change, human height also goes through periodic cycles of growing taller and shorter.

There are dips and peaks through history. The average European a thousand years ago was almost 3 inches taller than the average European 700 years later, at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Only in the last 50 years have we caught up with people who lived a thousand years ago, and slightly exceeded them.

Bulk is another matter. Neanderthals, for example, may have been shorter than modern humans, but they were much bulkier, with heavier skeletons and much more muscle mass than modern humans. So I really doubt that humans today are ""much larger"" than they were in the past, unless you specifically pick some point in the past when they were known to be smaller.

Every single immigrant group that has ever come to America has run into these same issues - The assimilation problem, the language problem, the criminal element problem, the racism directed in both directions.   Eventually, after a generation or so, people learn English, intermarry, start participating as full citizens after injecting their own piece of culture into the mosaic of what it is to be American.   

Before you toss out the ""at least my ancestors came over legally!' argument, be sure you vet your own background.   I know that my family was surprised to learn through some ancestry research that the ""cousins"" that all came over from Poland back in the 1800s weren't really cousins at all but a whole village of people, some related, some not.   I'm pretty sure that was common practice back then, before birth certificates and good record keeping became common practice.   It was also common practice for people to ""visit"" relatives in the states and never return to the homeland.   My grandmother was born here on a family visit from Poland that looks to have been deliberately timed for her birth.   Chances are, if you're an American of Polish/Irish/Italian/German descent whose relatives came over from Europe in the late 1800s/early 1900s, your family may not have done it legally.   You or one of your relatives may have been an ""anchor baby"" or may not really have been aunt or uncle or cousin to people you thought were related.     Did you ever notice how Italian, Polish, Chinese immigrants all have very loose definitions of ""aunt"", ""uncle"", ""cousin"", ""brother"", ""sister""?   Now you know why.

All that said, I think we have to have good immigration law to ensure that the US continues to be a viable country.  We don't want to ever bar immigration, that would be a disaster.   But it makes sense to have reasonably controlled paths to citizenship.   I have mixed emotions about citizenship by birth.    That particular law was designed so that African Americans who were born into slavery could be citizens.    In a day and age when air travel is fairly common, I think we might want to rethink that particular right.   I'm not saying it's wrong to allow citizenship by birth, just that I think we need to look at it from a practical perspective.

To conclude, immigration by any one group isn't what I fear.  Democracy is fragile.  So what I really fear is that someday, the US could become such a hostile place that it becomes a net loser of population.   I can imagine scenarios where ""Americans"" feel so threatened by one another that laws become draconian and emigrants decide to take their skills, talents, ambition and culture elsewhere giving some other place the economic engine that we currently have.

#2.  The muslims they get in europe are a different type than what we get in the U.S.... We tend to get the wealthier, educated Muslims that are genuinely seeking a better life.  Europe tends to get the impoverished dregs that are forced from their homes due to war or oppressoin and are less interested in starting a new life.

In the U.S., immigration is largely a scapegoat, as we only really have two kinds of immigrants here:  Immigrants that want to integrate, and immigrants that do not want to integrate and instead live quietly in their own communities.

&gt;Have any of you good folks read George Weigel's, ""The Cube and the Cathedral""? I think he gives us the key to understanding this culture and religious conundrum. First by pointing to the changing demographics of Europe with a Christian birthrate that is insufficient to maintain a significant role within the social and political countries of the near future; certainly insufficient in the face of the of high birth rates of Islamic immigrants. (Please spare me the migrant worker/immigrant name game. The difference does little more than point out the prejudices of the proponents of the word game).

&gt;That is a demographic fact.

&gt;Further, there is a subset within Islam which Weigel refers to as ""Islamists"" or ""Islamic fascists"" which does recruit within the Islamic community. In the great clash of cultures that is happening all around us, these people are truly our enemies for they would deny us our right to live and believe as we do now as Christians and secularists.

&gt;Yet this danger must be measured against the majority of the Islamic faith whose understanding of the rights of religious thought, belief and expression are compatible with western societal convictions.

&gt;The Swiss Catholic Bishops have expressed immense disappointment with the results of the referendum. A media campaign of a right wing party in the final two weeks of the campaign strongly swung the vote; a media campaign that used the worst images of Islamist extremism to play to the fears within the small and relatively homogenious society of Switzerland.  Their complaint with the result is its blatant attack upon the freedom of expression of an individual or a communities faith in the public square.

&gt;Those who have previously posted that we should practice a ""tit for tat"" policy with Islamic countries are neglecting to consider the example of Jerusalem. Here the three faiths that claim Abrahamic and Mosaic roots, have churches, mosques and synagogues co-existing within the old city for thousands of years. To those who would demand a right to open a Christian church on the Temple Mount or within the al-Aqsa grounds would blanch with indignation of a Muslim community demanded to set up a mosque in the Vatican!

&gt;While there are legitimate restrictions the are required of any religious community (we don't allow for human sacrifice no matter whatever claim of religious rights), there must be sufficient room offered within our present and future society to allow for freedom of religion, and public religious expression.

&gt;We can use noise legislation to control any public calls to prayer, just as bells are controlled now within Christian bell towers, but we must not let the illegitimate suppression of religious expression stand unchallenged, lest we become the ""baby"" that gets thrown out with the ""bath water"".

&gt;Instead of playing to societal unease in the face of the demographic crisis (at least from a Christian perspective) Christian's must be engaging honestly and openly with the various Islamic communities (Sunni, Shia, etc.) in helping them to develop the arguments of faith such as Christian walked as we transitioned from Christendom through to our modern western societies of today.

&gt;Actions that threaten their rights of expression such as this vote has brought before the Muslims of Switzerland serve only to make the task of their scholars to bring about an Islamic ""enlightenment"" to their faith communities that much harder.

From MIT climate researcher and IPCC contributor Richard Lindzen:

&gt;... At this point there is no basis for alarm regardless of whether any relation between the observed warming and the observed increase in minor greenhouse gases can be established. Nevertheless, the most publicized claims of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deal exactly with whether any relation can be discerned. The failure of the attempts to link the two over the past 20 years bespeaks the weakness of any case for concern.

Setting aside the technical and scientific considerations (this is /r/politics after all), if you actually think that the educated people of America, Europe and the rest of the world are going to allow their elected representatives to commit to a treaty which will redirect a not-insubstantial fraction of world GDP to mitigate AGW - without the ability for outside independent experts to meticulously verify the scientists findings - then you are perhaps high on drugs.

I totally disagree. On one hand you have punishment for crimes and on the other you have the *prevention* of crimes. This is an issue that can be tackled at the source.

The fact is we can cherry pick extreme examples from either side all night. Both sides of the equation require more education and acceptance.

The point we differ on is which side is making (or should be making) more of an effort. My argument has been and will be that the immigrants need to make much more of an effort than the locals - and especially now in Europe much more of an effort than they have. Claiming discrimination, rioting or making threats of violence over cultural differences is not acceptable. There is this idea that the burden of integration is on the countries accepting the immigrants. I bet if you compared all of the things Switzerland has done for immigrants against the few things they've done against them (like the whole minaret thing) you'd see a huge imbalance in favour of immigrants.

There has recently been exposed that some are exploting the system and keeps on studying Swedish for years, faling tests deliberately, taking advantage of the social benefits given to them.

You've implemented a system of public benefits and now people are *gaming* it?  I'm shocked.  Obviously there's something wrong with them.  The only conceivable solution is to restrict immigration.

&gt; To speak against immigration in Sweden is also taboo and you will be called a racist or islamophobic.

This might, I say *might*, have something, I say *something*, to do with characterizing Islamic immigrants as a monolithic bloc.

&gt; But what I think is that that they are contributing to a more segregated society by isolating themselves and are given their own special places.

How do you feel about synagogues and Jewish community centers?

No, really.  The hand-wringing about Muslim self-segregation is really not different in kind from earlier hand-wringing about Jews failing to assimilate.  

I'm not saying, ""Therefore, you're a racist and an anti-Semite and you're wrong.""  What I'm saying is that there's a difference between ""These people are not becoming Swedish at the pace and in the manner I'm comfortable with"" and ""These people intend to remain different forever.""

Also:  Is it *possible* to become Swedish?  What does it mean to be ""Swedish""?  Like most European countries, Sweden doesn't have a whole lot of experience with ethnic identity and national identity being at variance.  This is absolutely a social problem, but it's not a social problem whose responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders of immigrants.

&gt; Like another recent problem has been that children from tradional Muslim families forces their children to stay out of school becuase they find that educating children in music, religion, physical excersise (because the teacher was a woman), home education (because boys should not cook food) and sexual education is offensive.

Living in a country where teaching evolution in school biology classes and providing education in contraception to teenagers is a subject of heated controversy, I have sympathy for your concerns here.  It's called ""pluralism,"" and it's a complicated social problem that your country doesn't have very much experience with.  It's really not obvious what the right response to it is.  The Dutch model of tolerance clearly has its limits - if we were tolerant (in that manner) in the US, teaching evolution in Kansas would be not only difficult but illegal.  But there are solutions.

&gt; I'm not against etnological backgrounds, therefore I cannot be called a racist. I'm however against all religions and some cultures that have questionable morals and values.

Um, I hate to break it to you, sport, but that's a distinction without a difference.  Very few racists say, ""I hate the niggers because they're an inferior race.""  They mostly say, ""Niggers are lazy thieving complainers who don't believe in hard work like normal people do.""  Or they speak in code, saying things like, ""I think African-American cultural norms are at variance with American middle-class values,"" which is not really fundamentally different.

&gt; It always seems like the tolerant and open-minded Swedish people that should adapt to more intolerant and ignorant muslim families.

Yes, I can see the beacon of Swedish open-mindedness shining out from the words of that very sentence.

It's not actually impossible to learn what kinds of cultural conflicts someone who grew up in the Rif Valley of Morocco is having now that he's trying to raise his kids in Slotervaart.  It does require that you go outside the circle of complacency and trouble yourself to try to understand how other people think.  It's hard work, but it's a necessary first step.  It's the difference between coming up with a rational and compassionate social policy and running around with your hair on fire going ""OMG MUSLIMS!  THEY BUILD MOSQUES!""

&gt; I'm sure this is not only a problem in Sweden, but in all of Europe.

There is no question that cultural pluralism is a relatively novel problem that wealthy nations in Western Europe are beginning to encounter.  There are basically two different perspectives that you can take.  

One of them is to say that ""we"" are being overrun by ""them.""  That would be the Swiss perspective:  let's ban minarets, because they're not Swiss.  That's a pretty appropriately Swiss response.  But the Swiss national identity is one of cultural isolation - the Swiss, a fantastically smug people, are basically hillbillies with a banking system.  It's probably not the model that a cosmopolitan country ought to adopt.

The other approach is to say, ""This is what we are becoming.""  The ""we"" *includes* your new ""ignorant and intolerant"" Swedes.  You need to help them become more Swedish, sure.  But you also have to recognize that the social benefits that come from admitting a large number of impoverished immigrant workers are attained at the social cost of incorporating their way of life into yours.  You have to forge a way of life that encourages interconnection between ""native"" and ""immigrant"" cultures.

But with those two Americans there are going to be differences, they will have different cultural experiences. A large part of those cultural experiences are made up of the groups those people have identified with, and race makes up part of why people associate with those groups. It's ridiculous to say that African-Americans have the same cultural experience as WASP Americans.


People from Jamaica are usually described as Afro-Caribbean (well, usually they’re described as Jamaican, but you know what I mean). There are many people who are far darker in skin colour than people from Africa (Bougainville in New Guinea springs to mind); so using a term like ""black"" makes the group entirely about skin colour, rather than shared cultural experiences. African-American is referring to a specific group who have a shared cultural experience, that of being descended from Africans brought to America as slaves, it embraces those who feel an affinity with that experience (Barak Obama's writing on his feelings of identity are very interesting on this point), and is tolerant of those who are desire to be a part of that culture (""Wiggers""). 


I guess my point is that ""black"" only describes one thing, the colour of someone's skin, and in a not very accurate way. There are lots of other groups with the group ""black"": Moorish people, Afro-Caribbean, Aboriginal Australian, Bougainvilleans, etch. One group within the group ""black"" identify themselves as ""African-American"", there are lots of reasons why that term is used, and ultimately they don't matter, because enough people within that group are using the term. 


Personally, I hate being called ""white"", not because I'm more accurately called pink and freckly, but because Europe is a great big morass of different cultures, and my cultural heritage is just a part of that. 


Ultimately, people should get to decide what they want to be called. Currently, African-American is the preferred term of that community; as ""Australian of Irish background"" is the preferred of mine (it was Anglo-Celtic Australian for a while, which sucked).

Classrooms were segregated, children were taught all their lessons from the Koran, and patterns of what Westerners call physical or emotional abuse became rampant.

To make matters worse, immigrant communities DO tend to weigh heavily on the social services budget.  And there IS a real culture of people who would rather live on the state subsidies than meet the language and civic knowledge requirements of a normal work visa - or a job.

You need to have a system in place to stop democracy becoming bureaucratic mob rule.

The western European nations (and Australia where I am) have a Prime Minister or equivalent to govern the country, but they also have a completely separate Head of State with the power to dissolve the government if it behaves unconstitutionally, abuses it's power, or simply fucks things up really badly. In Australia, the Whitlam government was dismissed when it fucked up the budget in 1975.

It's safe to vote in your own self interest in most democracies because laws are there to stop rampant self interest from undermining society.

The US is a major exception, where the head of state actually runs the country, too. They don't have a government like us, they have an administration, elected in a ""first past the post"" or ""winner takes it all"" style system. In other democracies, if 49% vote for one party, and 51% vote for another, the 49% are still represented in the House of Representatives or House of Commons or whatever.

Sunday is a great day to leaflet because people tend to be at home, and so they look at the advert immediately, instead of it being mixed in with all their mail and getting more easily tossed out unread. My experience from the first time I did this was that I got a phonecall every day that week, and a few more from this same area even months late.

Get coloured paper from Staples or somewhere - bright yellow attracts the eye. Cutting the sheets in two is a real pain, but I don't know if you can even buy half-letter sized paper (we use the  A4 / A5 system here in Europe) readily by the ream.

Print your fliers single sided.

Anyone of any ethnicity can be “Australian” — despite what John Howard would have liked you to believe, it doesn’t require being of Anglo-Saxon extraction and playing cricket. That mentality is what lead to Cronulla.

The proposition that Australia is a racist country is an interesting one. The White Australia Policy certainly was, and it was brought in by our first PM, who was pretty racist by modern standards.

But we’re speaking in a social context many decades after its end. Penny Wong may have been called an “Asian wh*re” growing up in Corromandel Valley, but the fact is that Australia has relied on an influx of migrants for a very long time, and that’s no less true now than ever.

So in the sense that Australia is a “melting pot”, or a “multiculturalism”, I think there is a lot of *hysteria* about racism. What happened to the Indian international students in backwater suburbs of Melbourne was awful, but it was overblown. What occurred was a criminal offence; it’s not condoned or encouraged by the vast majority. The PM isn’t morally obliged to apologise, though the local authorities may be.

Having said that, I’ve lived in Adelaide all my life. Maybe tensions are higher in Sydney and Melbourne. But Australia has no institutionalised racism, unlike some European countries, and I’ve never heard anyone decry that migrants are “stealing our jobs” (though this is probably only because the Quaint British Expat Way™ is to alienate people with a subversive passive-aggressive facade).

The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms.

To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did.

im now 29 and have progressivly watched the change as immigrants entered into these countries, graffittied ancient churches, castles, landmarks and so forth. i have gone to malls in st germain en laye in the most beautiful part of paris imaginable. right next to versailles castle. and i have witnessed a group of burka wearing teens torching cars and throwing bottles at french nationals trying to enter the mall.

i have stood in bars with my freinds in paris, when one said "" oh fuck we have to go"" at which point 3 turkish men came over and decided that it was their job to teach people a lesson for ""saying the fuck"" minutes later he grabbed his girlfreind by her hair and slapped the fucking piss out of her when she tried to tell him they were outnumbered and being fucking dicks. you can visit this bar in paris near the opera, its an irish pub, i think it was called mcfinnigans.

i sat in exon provence and watched children playing happily when i was an 8 year old on the french riviera, you could go out at night at any time. now it is north africans on the beach fist fighting all night and stabbing people. fucking shame i cant take my son there now. they came, set up a hash trading cartel out of marseille and now the whole place is a warzone at night.

i used to go to Oslo a lot with my freind gyum to see the swedish hardcore bands shred with the most brutal guitar chords imaginable,(by the way, americans ideals of music are pretty lame too). last time i went 2 people got stabbed at the show and guess who the fucking perps werids from the wrong side of town that goddamn didnt want hardcore in this hood. because its close to the local islamic school. 

when my wife was 15 had her virginity taken from by being raped by a spanish migrant worker here in DC. im sure reddit will try to pin it on my wife and call me mr

we have no real ethnic ties back home to whatever fucking country we're from, we dont even know how to practice whatever culural beliefs our ancestors instilled in us.

i cant tell you how many german americans i know dont know what the fasching holiday is, or how many french americans dont even know what the bastille is. but these are the same people that say, "" im smart cuz im german"" or, ""i would know, my great grandmother is half french""

ive read both sides of this arguement. The Eu has evvery right to be fucking concerned just like these dumb dipshit americans are worried about when the cable is gonna come back online, or if daddy will put the rent on his credit card. germany is the size of oregon. there is not a lot of room for expansion. 

in my town if you killed a cow, you beter have a good fucking reason. that cow is the towns milk source, fertilizer,farm field manicurist and many times part of a local event. thats why you cant go to germany and get a 22 ounce teabone steak. theres not enough reesource to feed people like that, theres not enough real estate to maintain that kind of lifestyle. so how do theyfeed evveryone a good meal? grind the whole fucking cow up, put it in a sleevve, call it a bratwurst and that is how you order a steak in germany.. 

americans have a culture of around 300 years. i live , currently, in one of the oldest cities in america, fairfax va, its been here since 1750 or something. how cute.... my town in germany was founded by druids in 600 bc. was finally recognized as a township in 1132 AD and to this day only has 400 people in it. americans feel everything is theirs and not much is sacred. even thoguh the housing merket is bottoming out, i just saw several thousand acres of forest cleared and a bunch  more cookie cutter homes thrown up on them. no one has ever bought those houses and are still on the market empty a year and a half later. americans feel its their right to just continuosly build and build and build and thats fine, but its way beyond necessity.

and empty houses are great for people to smoke crack in. the cops are over there every night. 

most americans have never been told to stay at home because angry muslim youths had quite literally started a riot because chirac would not put into law the necessity for girls to wear burkhs in school. most americans have never had their cars torched or even seen a riot.

at the same time, reddit is right, this gonna get better but the EU has to be more firm and decide to take an active role in HOW THE IMIGRANTS  ARE INTEGRATING! That means a ""good ole fashion"" pie to your neighbor hospitality and letting them know its ok to integrate. 

my neighbor from egypt attempts once a month to cook a pie for my son my wife and I. he fails, but when he gets here with his lopsided shit with apples and shit hanging out everywhere, it doesnt matter. he comes in, we chat about cairo, airplanes, anything. that is integrating him. 

again a man i know in florida from sierra leone, an ex child soldier the victim of ""one love"" where they cut all your fingers but your thumbs off. (thumbs up, ONE LOOOOOVE, ITS FUCKING HORRIFYING). dude can cut grass better and faster than anyone.  hes awesome. he was a burden of sierra leone, a killer of many many innocents, and now, he is a contributor to ours. 

i luvthe shit out of everyone. but i will be damned to watch a place as beautiful europe or america for that matter just simply be whitewashed of its identity, when its been standing just fucking fine without a bunch of dumb fucking americans or religous zealots deciding its their turn to own this or that.

[Pardon my MS paint skills (or lack of).](http://imgur.com/Tb7E2.png)

Something about aquariums puts me in a trance, and I've always thought it would be pretty fun to turn one into the site of a rave. Ideally, I'd host it in an indoor octagon-shaped structure that's surrounded on all sides (barring entrances of course) by a domed saltwater fish tank. In the centre, a cylindrical tank serves as the post to erect all staff quarters around.

The big draw here would be the potential for unique lighting arrangements. There wouldn't be lights or laser arrangements affixed to the ceiling, but rather all lighting would be shone through the surrounding water. As a bonus, the central tank would have an arrangement of lights that would be synced to the beat of the bass, effectively bathing the entire structure in a rainbow from all sides.

This would be a relatively small rave by my standards, 2000-2500 tickets given out at most because I can't fucking *stand* trying to organise anything larger (it stops being about music and starts being about trying to manage a small city). 

Staff would be handpicked, and I'd make a point to include a lot of Eastern Europeans that I can trust to *do their job.* Many of these people were around for the original scenes, Chicago/Detroit/M25 Orbital, and are the best at what they do. 

Drugs would be limited to MDMA, possibly mushrooms and LSD if we could find a way to capitalise on them. No liquid E, no ket, nothing that involves fire (marijuana/salvia), and no alcohol. Liquids are only allowed if purchased on site to further profits and keep out banned substances. 

Music would have to maintain a steady and strong beat: a mix of Chicago/Deep House, Hard/Jumpstyle, maybe a bit of Baltimore Club. I'd really want to keep things on the slow side so that the central lights gently pulse rather than imitate a strobe light. 

We'd also have proper medical facilities on-site. Only being able to find one or two EMTs willing to work with you is frustrating, and the term ""hospital drop"" makes me cringe. Likewise, I'd try and keep it at least quasi-legal.

Weather-wise, pouring rain and a mid 30's-40's Celsius night, wind blowing. Indoors, AC would be set to 20c max, and I'd really strive to keep it that chilly (that would probably be the biggest challenge).

Last but not least, it would be a private event to ensure quality control as far as patrons are concerned. This is a rave, not a nightclub, and anyone wishing to treat it as such will be promptly fed to the fish in the massive tanks that surround it.  

edit: And as for atmosphere, the venue itself serves as atmosphere. With pulsing multi-coloured lighting beamed in from all sides, synced to a central control panel to remain consistent, and the fishy fishersons, it's basically like a massive kaleidoscope.

I disagree. A good ""civic culture"" policy should ensure that their populace is tolerant of other cultures in general, not that they can pick and choose particular groups.

In addition, there are groups who migrated centuries ago that still are discriminated against (see African descendants in the Americas). The same usually does not happen against European descendants (maybe against Italians in the Bronx, but not against British or German descendants).

&gt; *making policy that encourages/allows large amount of a particular immigrant group in immigrate to an area*

That policy is called **economic growth** -- compare the inflow of Latin American immigrants into the US with the economic cycle of the source and target countries. Does that mean government officials shouldn't encourage economic growth while their populace is intolerant?

But if by *making policy* you mean immigration control, what you are referring to is actually the ratio between legal and illegal immigration, not gross immigration.

If you want to stop immigration altogether, you need to make your country a really *sucky* place to be living in (like mine).

Historically, Christianity (as was practiced in Europe) was all about ownership of women. Just look at the wedding ceremony - the ownership of the female passed from the father to the husband. That her presence in the church was sinful enough that when the priest kissed the husband (to confer the blessing of the church), the husband was to transfer some of that to the female with the magic phrase ""you may now kiss the bride."" All women had to be owned: by their fathers, husbands, brothers or sons. And those without worldly men to own them, they were to be owned by the church (as nuns or beguines), and for the remainder, the only male left to own the remaining (unowned) women was satan.

The judge incorrectly took it upon herself to apply an ""Islamic"" bent to her ruling because the parties involved were Muslims. It is indeed racist, paternalistic and inappropriate, but it's relevant to my point because it demonstrates that:

1. It is **not always** a good idea to bow to the customs/law of other cultures out of a sense of cultural sensitivity.
2. There are indeed examples of extreme Islamic law influencing and operating within the legal system of European countries.

Spiegel ALSO published an article that is critical of a [""chain"" of recent rulings that have taken aspects of Sharia law into secular courtrooms](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,474629,00.html), so not only is this not an isolated case but it's an example of what I was saying - an improper infringement of religious thought on explicitly non-religious sectors. 

I think it's even more dangerous that in this woman's case, she was looking for help from what should have been an entirely secular entity (the court). Instead, out of a sense of misguided and extreme cultural relativism, the judge applied the law of the victim's home country/religion. This is the so-called ""line in the sand"" that I'm talking about. As in the Spiegel article I linked, it's clear that the cases with the halal butcher and employee who was barred from praying were correctly decided in their favor. But these rulings relied on the promise of freedom of religion/expression - a foundation of secular law - and NOT on Islamic law, as the example of the divorce did. I strongly believe that cultural liberties end firmly at the doorstep of secular law. 

It's really simple: Islamic law, Judeo-Christian law, NONE of it should influence the way a country is presently run. This separation should not be compromised in an effort to respect other cultures or religions.

People are very nice but a lot of them haven't travelled and aren't very curious about the rest of the world which really limits the scope of what there is to talk about.       

Thankfully though lots of them are hot so we can still shag :)

Anyway  - if you're looking for a hookup there are better sites than craigslist or gay.com.  Something like manhunt has much better reach.

If you're looking for more then everything depends on how you connect with the person/trick when you meet them and as a European you're much more likely to find a cultural match on  the coasts of the US rather than the flyover zone (as the term for anything between the coasts was once explained to me by someone in NY).

It's good to be there for a few days and hit all the sights like the Collosseum, the palace, pantheon and the Vatican, but the people were rude, the city was covered in graffiti, broken windows and things were way overpriced.  It was also not safe.  I was glad I stayed right in the center of things, although I was still followed into my hotel with my wife and sister by some creep.  (I took August off and went to London, drove to Sherwood Forest, took the Euro*star* to Paris, then flew to Rome and drove from Rome through Piza to Florence to Venice)

I'd recommend going to Paris.  The City is BEAUTIFUL, there are so many things to see and the history is also amazing.  The people are also VERY friendly and willing to assist you and the weather is better than in Rome, and they have the best food and wine that I have had in as long as I can remember.  It did take 4 hours to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the view was beautiful.  The Louvre is literally an ALL DAY event.  We got a map, found the things we wanted to see and then mapped out a route that was the most time savvy, and we were still there a good 8 hours.  You also have the Palace of Versalles and the Catacombs, and the history of the French Revolution, the Moulin Rouge...

London was also very nice, people were polite and the city was CLEAN.  The Tube is MUCH nicer than the NYC MTA, but don't expect to eat too much meat.  You'll be lucky to find a hamburger.  Most likely you'll get fish-n-chips or some type of carbohydrate.

Going back to Italy, Florence was AWESOME.  It has enough to see in a few days, but it is totally laid back and the people were some of the most friendly I had met on my trip.  Piza is the same way, but the only real tourist attraction is the Leaning Tower.  The rest is as normal as a regular town in CA, except there are very little waves at their beach.
Venice is also nice, but you can really do everything in 2 days.  It's mostly just trinket shops EVERYWHERE with gondolas, which will cost about 100 euro, but are worth it.  We took a night ride.

I would definitely recommend an EYE WITNESS travel book on where you are going.  It tells you the history and significance of everything, translation pages self guides with maps and points of interest.  You can also get the Rick Steve's books or Europe on a Shoestring.  We took all of these and had a great time. As far as travel goes, STAY AWAY FROM RYAN AIR!  The airports they fly to are about an hours travel from any major city and you'll most likely have to take an expensive cab or commuter bus to the city.  

**I would highly recommend going to only 2 places in 2 weeks.  There is a lot to see and you don't want to spend many days traveling.**  This was the mistake we made. 

Send me a PM if you need any more pointers or recommendations of places/locations to stay.  *HAVE FUN!""*

**EDIT** If you take the EuroRail, don't buy the tickets online before you go.  With friends and family living in Europe, the EuroRail online tickes are seen as a way of identifying tourists and you will be charged extra fees when you arrive at the station.  My parents were even told they had to purchase tickets again because the EuroRail online *everywhere* pass did not include the trip from Paris to Rome.  Just don't do it.  It's a trap.  Get them when you get there. :)  The Euro*star* is the way to go.  A bit more expensive, but faster, more luxurious, and lets face it.  You want to have a good time on the trip rather than arguing with a guy behind a counter.",False

In Europe, where carbon trading has been under way since 2005, energy corporations were asked how many permits they needed and were given that amount for free.

Solution: 

1) Determine the amount of carbon emitted by a company in the previous year.

2) Give that company enough permits to allow them to maintain this level of carbon emissions.

&gt;Here's the second problem. Cap and trade includes offsets -- a kind of carbon trading that allows polluters to finance projects outside the cap that purport to cut emissions, and then claim the cuts for their own. Even in theory, offsets don't lower emissions -- they simply move reductions from one place to another. In reality, offsets are rarely ""additional"" -- meaning that the cleaner projects were going to happen anyway. 

Solution: Do not include offsets in cap and trade, or ensure that such offsets are ""additional"".

Getting to a place immediately, getting a shower, leaving your bag and exploring to find a better place for the rest of your stay is much better. 

I went travelling around more than 10 years ago and stayed for either 2 or 3 nights in each place. We hit Amsterdam, Brussells, Paris, Nice, Munich, Venice, Marseilles, Barcelona - not in that order. We had a very limited budget and decided not to have too much of an agenda so we weren't stressing about seeing things just to tick off some kind of list. We saw what we saw as we felt like it... but we're all from Europe so we knew it wasn't going to be hard to get back to somewhere if we really wanted to. If you're travelling with friends, make sure you all sit down at least once to be open about what you want from the trip - you don't want to get there and realise this person wants a fast, feature-filled trip while you want a chilled-out strollabout, whatever happens happens.

I highly recommend going to Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Florence. I've been to Rome and it is amazing and worth a visit but I put Florence above it. It's much more like walking around a live-in art gallery. Barcelona is one of the coolest places I've ever been, particularly the graffitti and really chilled out bars. Paris is gorgeous with amazing architecture and Amsterdam is just obvious really.

I also highly recommend learning at least the fundamentals of the languages, people really do appreciate that and it's only fair to try. At least be able to greet and thank people and ask in their language if they speak yours.

I would definitely recommend more than 2 weeks, since you are coming all the way across the pond. When I was inter-railing, it was 5 weeks which was about right I think. It all depends on how long you want to stay in one place, how many places you want to see and how far apart they are because travelling by train, if you do, can take up a fair bit of time. 

Enjoy!

Christians converting to Islam? Chinese Muslims in Switzerland? What are you saying: That Middle Eastern immigration has absolsutely nothing to do with the subject of minarets in Switzerland? It's due to all these sudden Alpine conversions of blonde people in lederhosen who just can't get enough of Mohammed? Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha. (I seem to remember that religious affiliation in Europe is dropping off massively. . . . But if you insist that there are all these blond, yodeling Swiss converts to Islam, then . . . all I can say is: Wow! I've been so fooled by statistics and articles on the decline of religion in Central and Northern Europe! Didn't know about this secret mass Swiss conversion.)

Sometimes you'll see a guy standing in prayer with half a dozen toddlers sitting or standing around his feet. If one of the kids gets fussy, a handoff to another adult will often quiet her. If anybody graduates from generic quiet kid babble into actual crying, then whoever has the child can easily walk outside for a minute or two until the noise stops.

We have a room downstairs with a couple of rocking chairs and a speaker, so nursing moms can step out as needed. Otherwise, our kids are full members of the community so they learn to worship with us. I like when toddlers who can barely talk, can sing parts of the familiar hymns and prayers.

I'm usually over to one side with the other cantors, or standing with the choir behind the congregation, but at the Eucharist I get to go get my godsons and bring them up to Communion. One of the high points of my Sunday :-)

Consider the case of Phil Jones, the director of the CRU and the man at the heart of climategate. According to one of the documents leaked from his center, between 2000 and 2006 Mr. Jones was the recipient (or co-recipient) of some $19 million worth of research grants, a sixfold increase over what he'd been awarded in the 1990s.

Why did the money pour in so quickly? Because the climate alarm kept ringing so loudly: The louder the alarm, the greater the sums. And who better to ring it than people like Mr. Jones, one of its likeliest beneficiaries?

Thus, the European Commission's most recent appropriation for climate research comes to nearly $3 billion, and that's not counting funds from the EU's member governments. In the U.S., the House intends to spend $1.3 billion on NASA's climate efforts, $400 million on NOAA's, and another $300 million for the National Science Foundation. American states also have a piece of the action, with California—apparently not feeling bankrupt enough—devoting $600 million to their own climate initiative. In Australia, alarmists have their own Department of Climate Change at their funding disposal.

And all this is only a fraction of the $94 billion that HSBC estimates has been spent globally this year on what it calls ""green stimulus""—largely ethanol and other alternative energy schemes—of the kind from which Al Gore and his partners at Kleiner Perkins hope to profit handsomely.

What I'm asking is: what happens when one party wants a secular court and the other wants a religious court? Do you just drop the case all together? This is going to happen a lot if one party feels like a particular court will be more sympathetic to their case.

Furthermore, the article about talaq does not lay out the reasons why a divorce is considered allowable. It says you can't divorce without valid reason. Since wife abuse is both legal and common in many Muslim countries (Afghanistan has explicitly made spousal rape legal), it may not be considered a ""valid reason"". Furthermore, in countries such as Iran men are granted FULL custody of children, even when the proceedings are initiated *against them*. So these religious courts will be given the right to decide things like alimony/child support (not provided in most Muslim-majority countries), visitation, division of property and custody. Nine times out of ten women fare far worse than men in these areas when cases are tried in Islamic courts. 

Just so you know, you might want to fully read the articles you link. The article about domestic abuse and Islam explicitly states that there is still debate about whether/how much it's appropriate to beat your wife. In other words: RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS ARE STILL NOT SURE. These are the people *who will be deciding cases in a religious court*. It also says they can only be taken to court and be prosecuted if they do not respect ""the limits set down by the Qur'an and Hadith"". Those limits are laughable - you can only beat your wife if you fear ""rebellion"" (see the link you posted for reference). So if under Shariah law beatings are not necessarily grounds for divorce, the judge in question was acting appropriately in her ruling. 

Do you honestly think order will persist in a country that has one court that says spousal abuse is illegal and another says that it's not only okay, but it is prescribed in some cases by god himself? How can you say that this is not a perversion of the foundations of the countries where people have fought and died for freedom and self-determination? I'll say it again: if someone wants to live in a land dominated by fairy tale law, move to a country where it's already in place. One shouldn't try to change another nation to follow their regressive whims.

Now, I said read. READ. It has a lot to do with the Muslim influx that Europe is currently facing. Countries like England, France, Spain, and Italy are seeing huge booms in the population of foreign Muslims in their countries. Now, this wouldn't be a problem, except for that these Muslims don't integrate with the countries after they move in. They simply move into big Muslim communities, and practice their own Muslim law, and have even tried to have local law repealed and have it officially replaced with Muslim law in some places (what, you want a link or something? Looks like you're going to have to do some reading and finding!).

Which leads me to my next point.

Switzerland is a fairly homogenized, culture-clash-free people, and is one of the world's most desirable places to live (THE most desirable, depending on who you ask), and the Swiss are scared to death of letting the Muslim thing get out of control, which as other nations can tell you, is a very real situation. So they nip it in the bud; no minarets, no special Muslim laws, nothing of the sort. You can still be a Muslim, practice Islam as much as you want, but if you're an immigrant, you need to integrate, and need to be as Swiss as possible.

Also, many Swiss cities have construction laws prohibiting buildings that block views/historical areas/other culturally important things. This factors in, but not as much as the integration/community aspects.

I think the Swiss people's line of thought is definitely on track, but I agree that they probably should have gone about this in a different way (I dunno, making special immigration laws or something).",False

How would that happen? How could it be significantly warmer in but one part of the globe, yet not in others? The source of warmth is sunlight.

That is, of course, improbable in the extreme.

You state that you don't see climate scientists ""vigorously opposing any mention of global warming."" I suggest that the reason you don't see them is because you must not be looking for them. They are there, presenting the evidence of their information for any to look at. However, their work is not reported in the Mainstream Media for the simple reason that it is being suppressed by special interests. In my post above, you can find a link to ""450 Peer-reviewed papers supporting skepticism of Man-Made Global Warming."" Click on the link, read the material, *then* decide.

You cite ExxonMobil as having spread disinformation about climate change. I haven't studied the issue but I would hardly be surprised to learn that a powerful special interest had distorted information in order to advance its agenda. However, please don't confuse the fact that because a corrupt industry makes a statement that the statement must therefore be false. It is important to seek out independent corroboration of facts to determine what the truth may be.

p.s. Just for clarity, climate scientists who are skeptical of Anthropogenic Global Warming (man-made) may not necessarily be saying that climate change is *not* happening. As the data shows, the climate of Earth is constantly changing. They just reject the idea that the cause of that change is significantly due to human activity.

Your ideology is bankrupt and based on ignorance. The only two fields of medicine that have seen their prices come down in the last 10 years are cosmetic and laser eye surgery, which happen to be the two fields of medicine least regulated and subsidized by government.

It is competition and innovation that lead to cost coming down, not health care bills that contain 2,000 pages of rules, subsiidies and fines.

The problem with your argument is that you think that the problems that the US health care system has are related to the free market. I highly advise you educate yourself on this issue, starting with this article:

The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America

Other Western countries offer no panacea for American woes.

****

The fact of the matter is that America's health care system is like a free market in the same way that Madonna is like a virgin--i.e. in fiction only.

***

But France is not doing a whole lot better. Its health care system is the third most expensive in the world with over 11% of its GDP going toward health care--nearly three times more than the amount in 1960.

***

But it is unclear how long this will last. Struggling with exploding costs, the French government has tried several times--only to back off in the face of a public outcry--to prod doctors into using only standardized treatments. In 1994, it started imposing fines of up to roughly $4,000 on doctors who deviated from ""mandatory practice guidelines."" It switched from this ""sticks"" to a ""carrots"" approach four years later, and tried handing bonuses to doctors who adhered to the guidelines.



I also advise you to learn about how Singapore does health care.

Singapore's health care system is one of the lowest cost in the developed world, and Singapore has a very high life expectancy (higher than every major European nation and only behind the principality of Andorra). The vast majority of health care spending in Singapore is private sector.

People in Singapore rely mostly on individual medical savings accounts. The thing is, Democrats HATE these things. They opposed it vigorously when it was created by Republicans:

http://thinkprogress.org/2006/01/30/the-truth-about-health-savings-accounts/

Here's more on Singapore's health care system:

http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/singapores_heal.html


In The Undercover Economist, Tim Harford highly praised the health care policies of Singapore. But it wasn't until I read the section on health care in Ghesquiere's Singapore's Success that I realized how amazing the official numbers are. If the following is true, all the comparisons showing that the U.S. greatly outspends Europe without getting better health are beside the point, because Singapore makes Europe look like the U.S.:

----
The Singapore government spent only 1.3 percent of GDP on healthcare in 2002, whereas the combined public and private expenditure on healthcare amounted to a low 4.3 percent of GDP. By contrast, the United States spent 14.6 percent of its GDP on healthcare that year, up from 7 percent in 1970... Yet, indicators such as infant mortality rates or years of average healthy life expectancy are slightly more favorable in Singapore than in the United States... It is true that such indicators are also related to the overall living environment and not only to healthcare spending. Nonetheless, international experts rank Singapore's healthcare system among the most successful in the world in terms of cost-effectiveness and community health results.
---

How does Singapore do it? Singapore is no libertarian health care paradise, but it does self-consciously try to maintain good incentives by narrowly tailoring its departures from laissez-faire:

----
The price mechanism and keen attention to incentives facing individuals are relied upon to discourage excessive consumption and to keep waste and costs in check by requiring co-payment by users.

[...]

The state recovers 20-100 percent of its public healthcare outlay through user fees. A patient in a government hospital who chooses the open ward is subsidized by the government at 80 percent. Better-off patients choose more comfortable wards with lower or no government subsidy, in a self-administered means test.
---

I've heard a lot of smart people warn that co-payments are penny-wise but pound-foolish, because people cut back on high-benefit preventive care. Unless someone is willing to dispute Singapore's budgetary and health data, it looks like we've got strong counter-evidence to this view: Either Singaporeans don't skimp on preventive care when you raise the price, or preventive care isn't all it's cracked up to be.

More details on how Singapore's system works:

* There are mandatory health savings accounts: ""Individuals pre-save for medical expenses through mandatory deductions from their paychecks and employer contributions... Only approved categories of medical treatment can be paid for by deducting one's Medisave account, for oneself, grandparents, parents, spouse or children: consultations with private practitioners for minor ailments must be paid from out-of-pocket cash...""
* ""The private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare, which helps contain prices in both directions. Private medical insurance is also available.""
* Private healthcare providers are required to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping.
* The government pays for ""basic healthcare services... subject to tight expenditure control."" Bottom line: The government pays 80% of ""basic public healthcare services.""
* Government plays a big role with contagious disease, and adds some paternalism on top: ""Preventing diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tobacco-related illnesses by ensuring good health conditions takes a high priority.""
* The government provides optional low-cost catatrophic health insurance, plus a safety net ""subject to stringent means-testing.""

Last year, Robin Hanson stuck his neck out and argued that we should cut health spending in half. If Singapore's numbers are right, Robin was being conservative. Singapore has achieved American health outcomes for about a quarter of the share of GDP the U.S. spends. Furthermore, if Canada shows that socialized medicine can save a few percent of GDP without hurting health, Singapore shows that the free lunch offered by greater government control is meager compared to the free lunch offered by old-fashioned individual incentives.",False

This particular World Cup involves 32 countries. They are initially divided into 8 groups of four teams each. Out of these 32 teams, 16, the top 2 out of every group qualify for the knockout stages. So there is the round of 16, then the quarter-finals, then the semi-finals, and then the final, you get the idea. 

So how are these 32 teams chosen? By a planet-wide qualification tournament in each continent. The host team gets automatic qualification. But each continent gets its own set number of places, which is based on the strength of the sport of soccer in that continent. So Africa gets 5 teams, Asia gets 4.5 (will explain the 0.5 later), [Oceania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation) gets 0.5, South America gets 4.5, North America gets 3.5, Europe gets 13. 

So the 0.5, team that gets 5th position in Asian qualifying plays the team that topped the Oceania qualifying. So Bahrain, which ended up fifth in Asia played New Zealand, which ended up 1st in Oceania. So in the World Cup, they would have an amalgamated team of New Zealand and Bahrain. So out of a team of 11 players, 6 would be from New Zealand and 5 from Bahrain. Why does New Zealand get more players than Bahrain in the combined team? Well, it is because New Zealand beat Bahrain in a home-and-away series to decide who gets to field more players. The name of the combined team of is still in arbitration, with New Zealand wanting the team name New Zearain, while Bahrain wants the team name to be New Bahrain.

America, Australia and New Zealand are always split between their 'traditional' culture and the settled one.  At least, that's what I've noticed living in Australia and the US and visiting NZ, and being born in Eastern Europe. 
When a white person in a settled country complains about immigrants, they're being hypocritical because they stole the land from other people.  In Aus there was the whole Terra nullius deal, I'm guessing something similar elsewhere.
But Europeans are the traditional owners and settlers of the land.  Their culture is being compromised by the massive immigration.  The same way the Aboriginal culture was consumed by the British, Europeans are being overwhelmed by Middle Easterners and Asians and Africans.  
My personal opinion is that instead of taking up lots and lots of immigrants, the money should be spent on improving the impoverished countries so that there is no need to escape.  Nothing will be solved if people just move out of the troubled areas.  But I know it's not as simple as that, I'm tired and hope I made some sense.

To average Westerners, yeah, eating from a spoon probably seems a bit childish.  And eating off a knife seems brutish.  You just can't win!

To a Thai, eating from a fork seems similarly brutish as eating of a knife would seem to Americans and Europeans!

Also, we Westerners we care about whether or not you continue to hold your knife while you insert food into your mouth (still a bit brutish, I suppose, or maybe we think you won't like our pork roast and leap across the table to stab us with the knife you're holding).  We also care about the precise manner in which you hold your fork (tines curving up or down), but that seems to vary by specific subculture and -- amazingly -- the dish in question.

For an approximation, we'll exclude anyone outside the USA. (Europe and Japan and Australia could presumably furnish a fair number of such women, though.) So that's 300 million people. Roughly half will be female. 150 million. https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States tells us that there are about 100 million women between 15 and 64.

But that's too broad; 15 is pushing it jailbait-wise, and we can probably exclude over 30 as not being hot enough. This means we can only look for females in the 'echo boomer' group (https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographic#U.S._Demographic_birth_cohorts) - past 1976. http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0101&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-state=st&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false tells us that women 15-29 make up 20.2% of the entire female population (152,981,937), so 152,981,937*0.202=30,902,351.274.

So in the right American female age group, there are 31 million targets. Now, I have heard that a reasonable guess at the commonness of 'truly stunning' or 'supermodel looks' is 1 in 100. So that cuts the group down from 31 million to 309,000. Now, the question is, how many of that 309,000 really hot young women are geeky enough to qualify? Unless it's more than 1/6th, then StaticSignal's upper bound is overly generous. Indeed, it could easily be off by an order of magnitude or more: if we guess that 1/10th of hot chicks are geeky, then that brings us down to 30k, nearly half 50k, and if we make the more reasonable assumption that 1/100th are this impressively geeky then we go down to 3k.

So of 300 million Americans, 3 thousand of them fit all the parameters. Now we can try to figure globally. Japan &amp; Europe &amp; Australia together have 880 million people. 880m is 2.9 * 300 million, so our global population of hot geeky chics becomes (3k + 2.9 * 3k), or 11,800.

Which is a factor of 5 less than StaticSignal's upper bound. For a subject this fuzzy, that doesn't seem to be too vast an overestimate, actually.",False

Yeah, I imagine that most people think that, if they even consider what kind of information they're exchanging for free services.  Based on [past evidence](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1F3FF93AA3575BC0A9609C8B63), I doubt that most Web users are aware that there's any sort of logging happening *at all*.

Anyway, no, that won't hide you. Google has engineers that specialize in data-mining and has moved into providing ""free"" services that are particularly useful in identifying someone.

Google also owns DoubleClick, so it can track activity on different sites, YouTube, which has accounts (and stores Flash shared objects, which act as a cookie but aren't cleared by cookie settings), Google Talk (which has accounts), and Gmail (which also has accounts).  They know which IP you were using at any given time, and they will never throw away their logs.  With a bit of correlation, they can associate IPs and account names on any other site that that know passwords with your identity when searching unless you clear all other identities at the same time.  Even if you do exactly that, they still have browser version string and the fact that Identity I at IP X suddenly vanished in all forms and was immediately replaced by Identity J at IP X, who follows similar search patterns.

If you ever do Google Maps directions from, say, a home address or to identical addresses, or search for the same (rare) keywords, Google has another point with which to correlate identities.

Plus, Google acquires people and does partnerships.  So, let's say that ten years down the road, Slashdot is purchased by or cuts a deal with Google so that Google gets their logs.  Google can trivially correlate a Slashdot username with Google activity.  So if you subsequently log in to Slashdot, you've identified your IP to Google.  Same is true for any other site with accounts.  Think about Amazon.com, for example, or Reddit.  Or let's say they purchase Kongregate.com or another Flash games site that people tend to maintain persistend cookies for (or just cut a deal with them for logging data).

Ever email gmail.com users?  You're providing your IP address attached to your email address every time you do so.  If you're a large enough ""free"" email provider, you can get a pretty solid picture of where people are online with this.

It's certainly in their *interest* to do so, even if just for internal use -- Google is the largest ad-display company online today, and specializes in doing profiling and displaying accurately-targeted ads.  The fact that they can sell profile data  to arbitrary other parties down the road (unlike Europe, the United States does not place restrictions on what companies do with user data) who might use it for other purposes is also of concern.

And once you obtain an extensive profile of someone (the above data, times they tend to operate, etc), it becomes ever more difficult to vanish off the profile radar, since similar searches or communication with the same IM or email contacts can allow re-correlation with your own profile.

Google has generally been investing in systems that allow it to gather *exactly* this type of data, and then providing the services for ""free"".  They've experimented with free wireless access in Mountain View, CA (and tried in San Francisco, CA).  They're now [providing it in airports](http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/10/technology/Google_free_wifi_airports/).  Whenever you log on, you send out a unique identifier that re-associates you -- your wireless NIC's MAC.  They just started providing [free DNS service](http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/), which allows monitoring what DNS queries you perform (e.g. what websites you visit, even if you block advertisements or don't visit sites that DoubleClick monitors), also very useful for profile-building.",False

I believe some immigrants should be taken by all countries that can, but only those that are in imminent, horrible danger.  I've seen immigrants lining up to get public housing, claiming they've been living on the street for months while flashing fancy watches and bling.  Then there's the whole Sri Lankan boat people saga in Australia.  They refuse to go to Indonesia where they will be given public housing and whatever because they paid to get to Australia.  The whole system is broken.

I just think it's hypocritical when Australians want a 'White Australia' when it wasn't white to begin with.  The argument is weaker, because Australia has maybe 200 years of European culture whereas Europe has 500, 1000+ years to protect.

I don't see how it's insulting.  On the most simple level the situations are similar.  Aboriginal culture was diluted, then decimated by Europeans.  European culture is being diluted, although not yet decimated.

It's not that European culture is weak, it's that culture is something inherited and depends on where a person grows up.  Migrants simply do not take it up.  The same way that a person from Europe will always keep some part of their Europe-ness if they move to Africa, an African will never completely meld to European values.

I understand this is an old IAMA, and this is almost futile, but I felt that having the knowledge I should make some points clear. Having grown up with Father who has managed (CEO) numerous bottlers and distributors throughout the World (Though not Europe/US), I know a lot. Too be honest, I don't think you know enough about the company to truly answer these questions correctly.

&gt;If your company, CCE, does all the actual work with the beverages, what the hell does the Coca Cola Company do.

The Op is correct, but generally distributors in countries outside the US, such as Coca Cola Amatil  (AUS) etc, operate under a sort of franchise agreement in which TCCC licenses and supplies the distributor with syrup (All of which is manufactured in the US). The distributor will then bottle Coke and distribute and sell it. These distributor companies are generally independently owned (albeit TCCC has a percentage share). In fact in some developing countries a Coca Cola distributor may be owned by a single family. 

&gt;Why do Coke products taste different in different countries?

Whilst some tweaking of the product may occur when introduced into a new market, the differences in taste is largely a result of the differences in (local) water and the type of sugar used. Coca-Cola Syrup is always the same.

&gt;Do you get Coca-Cola for free?

Yes, a substantial amount. You also accumulate a large collection of promotional gear (eg. Beach towels, umbrellas, clothes etc.) Any bottling factory is an amazing place to visit, and a cold coke of the production line is one of the best tastes. Also the stock warehouses are amazing, rows upon rows of promotional merchandise (yo-yo's, clocks, radios, etc).

All of the bottlers and offices I have visited have had stocked open fridges. But as mentioned previously I generally visited the executive offices.

&gt;Can you steal the secret recipe and post it on WikiLeaks?

No the syrup is only manufactured in the United States, but most of the other ingredients (and some components of the syrup) are easy to determine and are quite well known. 

&gt;Ever tasted the Coca Cola concentrate they send to the bottlers, pre-water &amp; sugar addition?

Yes it is disgustingly sweet and thick (post-mix syrup).

As for rivalry with Pepsi and drinking competitors products it is not really a big deal,but employees are encouraged to buy Coca-Cola products. In fact I have seen people switch sides of the Cola Wars and work at Pepsi and still get a job at Coca-Cola later on.",False

You do have a point that if all climate science is wrong etc. then well you know what you wrote.  The problem is, there is no evidence it is wrong, flawed, distorted or manipulated.  Especially not ""all"" of it.  

A caveat on that word ""no"".  Nothing in science is completely correct, lacking flaws, or in no way manipulated, not in phsyics, chemistry, or any other scientific discipline you want to examine.  So when I say ""no"" i'm using it in a manner that has the amount of uncertainty that all science inherently does.

I have no idea if Gary Sutton has a scientific background but I do know he is being very credulous in this article.  When more and better information is gathered scientific opinions change, that is what happens in science.   What the NSB said in 1974 was based on information obtained prior to 1974.  

&gt;You can't blame these scientists for sucking up to the fed's mantra du jour. Scientists live off grants.

If the climatologists were simply seeking money to fund research they could find a great deal more of it by backing anticlimate change.  This erroneously concludes that the only way to make money on this issue is by backing climate change.  Not to mention it is completely unfounded accusation.

&gt;Remember how Galileo recanted his preaching about the earth revolving around the sun? He, of course, was about to be barbecued by his leaders.

Galileo had to recant because of religious pressure which refuses to change with new incoming evidence.  In the scientific community someone who proves everyone else wrong gets our highest honor (Nobel Prize)

&gt;In 2002 I stood in a room of the Smithsonian. One entire wall charted the cooling of our globe over the last 60 million years. 

Of course the earth is cooling over time it started as a giant ball of molten lava!  That has nothing to do with short term trends which are affected by many more variables.

&gt;Their growth rings show what's happened no matter which philosophy is in power. Tree rings show a mini ice age in Europe about the time Stradivarius crafted his violins.

Those variations were caused by solar forcing, the Earth's orbital wobbles or continental configurations; but none of those factors is significant today compared with greenhouse warming. Evidence for a Medieval Warm Period outside Europe is patchy at best, and is often not contemporary with the warmth in Europe. As the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) puts it: ""The idea of a global or hemispheric Medieval Warm Period that was warmer than today has turned out to be incorrect."" Additionally, although the Arctic was warmer in the 1930s than in the following few decades, it is now warmer still. One recent analysis showed it is warmer now than at any time in the last 2,000 years.

&gt;To be fair, those reports are short-term swings. But the longer term changes are no more compelling, unless you include the ice ages, and then, perhaps, the panic attempts of the 1970s were right. Is it possible that if we put more CO2 in the air, we'd forestall the next ice age?

There are many various and independently verified lines of evidence suggesting global warming.  Ocean measurements, decreases in snow cover, reductions in Arctic sea ice, longer growing seasons, balloon measurements, boreholes and satellites all show results consistent with records from surface weather stations.

This article does not actually make *any* sound argument that global warming is not occurring.  It is full of anecdote, logical fallacies, and unsubstantiated claims.  It is frustrating because all someone needs to do is be skeptical, think critically, and look at all the available evidence being put forward by *both* sides before coming to their conclusion.

She infamously conducted a massive fundraiser for the poor in Haiti, then spent the money in Europe.

Third, she inflated the numbers of poor people she claimed to serve; while her soup kitchens could only feed a few hundred people a day, she was claiming numbers in the thousands. Fourth, the shelters she had suffered from water quality and bedding issues, which could have been fixed if she'd spent her donation money on the poor instead of constructing new missions.

Pronunciation just takes time. Again, it's not particularly difficult. I've been learning Icelandic for 2 years and my accent is barely recognizable as foreign. 

Speakers of many languages are bound to switch to English if your skills aren't up to par, don't blame them. Learning through immersion (from the beginning) is much more effective in places where there is no intermediary language (countries or areas where few people speak English). 

If you ""get a vowel wrong"", your Icelandic clearly isn't up to par. To effectively learn Icelandic through immersion would first require at least a year of intense study on your own or with a teacher. Only then would most Icelanders be comfortable speaking ""normally"" with you and not correcting your every word.

**HOWEVER** i will say that there are Muslims who do tolerate things which the Quran and Islam may not explicitly agree with, and know when it is irrational to cling to what faith says. For example, in Turkey, where the population is overwhelmingly Muslim(&gt;99%), you will see that they have an officially secular government, which makes decisions based the secular logic rather than what is necessarily tolerated in the Quran. For example, Turkey was one of the first countries in the world to elect females to parliament (before women even had the right to vote in various European countries). The Quran says that women should not have political power due to hormonal imbalances that happen once a month(yes, you know what i'm talking about). Yet, Turkey, despite having an overwhelmingly Muslim population, when creating their government realized how illogical the notion that women should not hold public office was, and when creating their republic in 1923, made sure that women were allowed to hold public office

Thus, in this example Turkey has put Islam(or faith in general) in its place. As a personal moral and belief system that should not interfere with public policy especially when it it outright illogical. This similar to what The United States has done with Christianity.


Another example, when i used to be a Muslim (technically i am an atheist now, however my personality, lifestyle, and political beliefs have not changed the slightest) i still believed that homosexuals should have the right to marry, for the way i saw it(and still do) marriage in a legal sense is a contract recognized by the state and it is inherently unjust for the state to deny a personal contract between two people because of their lifestyle or how they were born(and for the record civil unions =! marriage). The same way how the government should not prevent me from marrying due to my (now former) lifestyle as a Muslim or the fact i was born with a certain type of skin color. I should also mention that i had no personal objection to homosexuality in general regardless of what my religion said, the same way i wouldn't have personal objection of someone of a different skin tone of me or a different religion(in fact, most of my friends through out my life have been of different skin tone or religion)

even while i was a practicing Muslim, while i still believed in Allah(or God, they're the same thing) and heaven and hell and what not, i still had these exact same personal beliefs.

I've talked to people that kept insisting they paid some ridiculous rate of tax that isn't even possible to achieve, and where they only yielded when I showed them the calculations and demonstrated for them that they paid half of what they thought it was...

I'm sure there are people that mess this up in both directions, but I've yet to see someone underestimate it personally.

&gt; You may be right about that. And since you seem like a pretty smart guy, would a side-by-side comparison of government spending vs. GDP give an accurate representation of tax rates?

I think it's exceedingly hard to make meaningful comparisons of tax rates, especially since if you even compare the same salaries, or median salaries, you may be comparing rates that reflect very different levels of wealth. I suppose it depends on what your goal is with a comparison. If it's just a straight up percentage game, then it's not hard. If it's supposed to have any real meaning, it gets complicated.

&gt; But I'm still not convinced with regards to your explanation of sales tax. I teach and ESL course in NYC, which basically amounts to a course that gives rich Europeans and some Asians an excuse to come to New York and dick around for a bit. They're always talking about how cheap they bought this and that for.

Well, it *is* cheap, but the sales tax isn't nearly the only factor there.

Norwegians even go to Sweden to buy cheap stuff, for example - even though the sales tax is the same. 

The bigger factor is relative wealth.

Norway in particular has a very flat salary curve, where most people lie in a region very close to the median salary. And the average salary is very high.

As a result prices *are* very high, and would remain so regardless of sales tax, because the cost base for Norwegian businesses is very high. Getting low paid shop staff or warehouse staff, for example is near impossible (Norway imports ""low paid"" Swedes to cover a lot of shop jobs that Norwegians simply aren't interested in taking any more, and the Swedes aren't exactly doing badly themselves). 

This is a cost of equality.

So the margin required is high to be able to meet fixed costs.

But so is peoples spending power - if you take purchasing power into account, Norway is ""cheap"" in terms of how much of an average salary is spent on various things.

On one hand this is a negative for us in terms of supporting export businesses, or competing against foreign imports. On the other hand it means going abroad for shopping seems ridiculously cheap to us - many Norwegians do their christmas shopping in London, for example, because if your gift budget is reasonably high, you can finance a nice trip almost entirely from the savings.

Overall, it's a big negative for people who earn substantially above average - they could make even more money elsewhere and pay less, but a big positive for most people, who tend to make more than equivalent positions elsewhere, and more than enough to offset the higher living costs.

Note that I'm not advocating a high sales tax - in many ways it runs contrary to the spirit of Scandinavian tax law, which generally has been focused on redistribution, while sales tax goes counter to that by being flat rate and hitting poorer people (who spend a greater percentage of their money, and spend most of it in Norway) harder than wealthy people. 

It works reasonably well in Scandinavia mostly *because* wealth is distributed as evenly as it is already, so the regressive nature of sales tax doesn't undo all of the progressive bits of the rest of the tax system.

(unsurprisingly some right wing politicians want to replace income tax entirely with sales tax..)

&gt; Plus, what about taxes on luxury items like cars? It's well known that many Europeans can pay 100-200 % tax on buying a new automobile...your thoughts?

That's true. Cars, alcohol, tobacco are all extremely expensive. But it doesn't add enough to drag the total tax percentage up very far for most people. It does make people whine a lot, though, even though they keep voting mainly for the parties that have set those rates at the current levels.

The Belgian method, if applied to the U.S., would lack common sense.

What happens if an immigrant wants to move?  Would they have to get approval for the rest of their life from every municipality in which they wish to live?  You would doubtless decry that as an infringement of freedom.  What sort of country requires _papers_ to move about freely?  

Well then, perhaps we would use some sort of national oversight to certify someone as a citizen of the country itself, instead of just being allowed in a specific local jurisdiction- but of course that's just what we have now, and that's bad because someone ""very afar"" is making the decision.

And without national oversight then you end up with a patchwork of different standards in each community, so if Chicago won't let you in, maybe Springfield will, and then you move to Chicago anyway.  

What happens if they want to take a road trip?  Do they now need permission from both parties?  What happens when they cross state lines?  That would fall under the ICC, and then become a federal issue- so di they also need federal approval?  Hell, now we've involved three different beauracracies just to take your kids to Disney World.

What about a company's permission to hire you?   Do they still need federal identification and work permits like they do now?  Do they need permits from the municipality certifying the immigrant's legality and permission to work on top of the federal requirements, or instead of them?  Do they need permission from the municipality where the office the immigrant would work in is located?  Do they need the permission of the municipality in which the HQ of the company is located?

What about taxes?  If the immigrants pays all taxes, then wouldn't municipalities desperate for funds be more likely to relax standards compared to their more wealthy neighbor cities?  This would doubtless cause tension as immigrants flood one town, because the next town over has ""higher"" standards.

Is the immigrant free to obtain a driver's license if they meet a local municipal standard, or do they have to obtain state permission as well?

And the list goes on and on.  

The key issue you're forgetting is that in many European countries the government is unitary.  This means that all power is derived solely from the central government and is delegated as thought appropriate to more local authorities.  At any time it's possible for the central government to overrule the decision of any office of lesser scope than them.  In this system, municipal approval _is_ a function of the central government, it's just been delegated to a local official.

In contrast to that, the U.S. system is a federal system, which means we have different spheres of influence (state and federal) and each form of government has supremecy in its own sphere of influence.  This means that a local approval process could function as a delegation of state authority, but would not function as a delegatation federal function.  In our government, this system would remove _all_ control of immigration from the federal government; this issue does not occur in a unitary system.

It sounds like a simple enough plan, but any attempt to make some sort of cross-generalization in which one applies the policies and procedures from one country to another is doomed to be wildly incorrect if that generalization fails to take into account relevant differences in the very heart and structure of the governments involved.

This systemic difference in the type of government makes this system illogical and unfeasible in America.  Of course, I've also left out the fact that using this system would require a constitutional amendment.",False

no propaganda could shake their popularity. Since time immemorial in the realm
of Western civilization liberty has been considered as the most precious good.
What gave to the West its eminence was precisely its concern about liberty, a
social ideal foreign to the oriental peoples. The social philosophy of the Occident
is essentially a philosophy of freedom. The main content of the history of Europe
and the communities founded by European emigrants and their descendants in
other parts of the world was the struggle for liberty. “Rugged” individualism is
the signature of our civilization. No open attack upon the freedom of the
individual had any prospect of success.
Thus the advocates of totalitarianism chose other tactics. They reversed
the meaning of words. They call true or genuine liberty the condition of the
individuals under a system in which they have no right other than to obey
orders. In the United States, they call themselves true *liberals* because they
strive after such a social order. They call democracy the Russian methods
of dictatorial government. They call the labor union methods of violence
and coercion “industrial democracy.” They call freedom of the press a state
of affairs in which only the government is free to publish books and
newspapers. They define liberty as the opportunity to do the “right” things,
and, of course, they arrogate to themselves the determination of what is right
and what is not. In their eyes government omnipotence means full liberty.
To free the police power from all restraints is the true meaning of their
struggle for freedom."" 

""No government and no civil law can guarantee and bring about freedom
otherwise than by supporting and defending the fundamental institutions of
the market economy. Government means always coercion and compulsion
and is by necessity the opposite of liberty. Government is a guarantor of
liberty and is compatible with liberty only if its range is adequately restricted
to the preservation of what is called economic freedom. Where there is no
market economy, the best-intentioned provisions of constitutions and laws
remain a dead letter."" - Ludwig Von Mises",False

&gt; Blacks, on the other hand, are much more racially mixed than whites, although Shriver's study indicates that blacks are less white European than other popular race studies indicate; (studies that indicate blacks being around 25-30% white on average). Taking into consideration that Shriver's study is still not yet complete, results already in indicate that on the whole blacks are around 18% white; which is the equivalent of having 22 white ancestors among those 128. About 10% of blacks are over 50% white. Shriver also points out that the admixture rates also vary by region. For example, the black populations with the highest average white ancestry discovered at this time are those in California and Seattle, with blacks in those two locations being a little over 25% white European on average.",False

Here's a well informed opinion piece from someone who has forty years experience in the health care industry, and it gets ripped to shreds by two people (husband and wife) who have never worked in the industry.  One of them even said it had no facts and was all rhetoric, which seems a bit silly since it's an *opinion* piece.

I don't even respond to their arguments anymore.  It's not worth my time.  But I will share one of them with you now.  Please tear apart at your leisure, Reddit:

&gt;Um- few problems with this. [You so must have known I'd have them. ;) ] This guy, while more articulate and thoughtful than Krugman, is little better. That isn't to say he doesn't have good points- he does. The Socialization he refers to in the insurance industry is right and wrong. That is to say- he's right in how it works but is not using the term quite accurately and thus doesn't reflect the real fear dogging people.

&gt;Ex. If the government controls it completely (Socialism), instead of just dealing with a company, you have very real limitations upon care. Ones which you can not negotiate your way out of as you can now (payment plans, debt, clinics). To understand this fear one should not look to the EU, for our govt doesn't run like that- ours is closer to Bolshevik Russia in premise and ideology. Also along these lines- elitism would still happen; either through political clout or financial gains.

&gt;Yes, insurance is part of the problem (not the profit), but it is such because of something else he doesn't mention- the government's creation of insurance to begin with. Profit is a clear and quantifiable motive and before insurance was used widespread there were (still are as well) physicians out there who volunteer/ed at clinics worked on barter, etc. Physicians rates are not flexible in many ways because of insurance (they can't charge less for people with no insurance because of govt regulation), costly malpractice insurance as well as all the staff necessary to deal with insurance companies. Why not advocate getting rid of insurance altogether? It is that safety belt effect which is aiding in the cost of they system?... See More

&gt;To say all physicians should get a commensurate salary from the same guy who says those specialized physicians have ""similar training/requirements"" as general surgeons/physicians and yet a ""scale"" should be employed... well, cardio-thoracic surgeons deal in a different realm entirely than those others, same goes for neurosurgeons- who then decides what physician makes what? Who decides the scale? Who pays them if they are to be salaried? In a Capitalist system (a true one- not ours since it isn't) people would shop for physicians- there's no need right now. If there ere rates would be more competitive as they would have to be in order to survive.

&gt;Many people arguing against this reform aren't saying none is needed- they're saying this proposal will not fix the problem. Based upon this guy's proposal I can say only one aspect of it would at least help- torte reform. 

&gt;His whole statement about end of life care are crafted in such a way which leads me to think longingly of the clear-cut words of Palin (who I thought was an ass) ""death panel"". Planning ahead, based upon his other proposals indicates to me he believes someone should be enforcing this before it comes to pass- who? It also, imo, implies a potential for rationing in the ways people are actually afraid of- not the manner which he selectively crafts his argument around.

That is why I think they're socially irrelevant--as you pointed out, times have indeed changed. However, these writings do still influence, consciously or subconsciously, a lot of opinions about how women should be treated, how they should behave, etc. In my personal experience (anecdotal evidence, of course, but I think it's relevant in a way), it leads to a generational perpetuation of sexist attitudes--""keep away from sexual immorality"" can be turned into so many unhealthy prescriptives for behavior, from forbidding masturbation and/or premarital sex to complete shame for one's body image and sexuality, or acceptance of assault or abuse (""I do have sexual thoughts sometimes, so I was asking for it, and deserve to be punished""). In that sense, I find the attitude particularly dangerous. 

As for the words and actions of Jesus, I would have to say that I don't feel I'm fully informed enough to give a complete answer on that; my experience has been entirely with the Protestant selections of the Bible, and while it has been in my reading project list to study the Catholic Bible, gnostic texts, and other writings that were ""edited out,"" I haven't gotten around to it yet. I will say that, based upon my readings to date, I find Jesus a little mercurial in general; I was surprised at how many times he straight-up lost his temper with people, and while that has been chalked up to righteous indignation, I'm still not quite sure how to interpret it, nor how to synthesize it into a complete picture of a personality. Also, some of his commands about leaving one's family to become a follower particularly trouble me, and I think that goes rather far in informing attitudes of divisiveness that plague the religious community, particularly the more fundamentalist ones, leading to, say, a homosexual child being turned out of the household with no assistance. Granted, that doesn't quite address the question of Jesus' treatment of women, I think it's relevant to the larger question of the timelessness of his messages. 

As to the second question, I have to say that I'm torn in the interpretation. I think that Paul was writing to specific groups of people about their specific situations, but probably also thought that his ideas applied in a broader philosophical sense as well. I don't know that I can say that he would have had an accurate concept of thousands of years in the future; I'm sure he wouldn't have anticipated the kinds of changes that led to the society we've built now. I think that we *have* gone through a lot of steps from that point to this, and refined our philosophical sense; as history has gone on, we've built on those concepts and others--from the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Arabs who preserved their writings, the Europeans who began to frame our philosophy of rulership, and to integrate religion wholly into government, the Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers, the Deists and economists and so forth who framed the beginnings of America; we've come a long way. 

I do think it's time for a broad rethinking; lots of social progress and change have taken place at an exponentially-growing pace in the last hundred years or so. There are a lot of questions of social equality and justice facing America (which I mention specifically only because it's where I live), and as a society we have to decide how to frame ourselves going forward. A great deal of that debate does involve the adherents to this more ancient set of principles, and I think that their involvement has demonstrated the fallacy of trying to appropriate those values into a modern, diverse society. Also, our advances in science have re-positioned the locus of authority. Appropriating some of the ""universal"" principles wouldn't be a terrible idea--loving others, treating people well, bending one's actions to the greater good--but these are very broad and, again, not exclusively Christian. It's a lot to think about, as an individual, and as a society as large and diverse as ours, but I do think it is time to begin overhauling our national and international philosophy.",False

Many of their practice &amp; nature are far different from the original European religion. On the other hand the English word religion are having a paradigm shift to enrich its meanings &amp; make itself compatible with various spiritual &amp; social operations thought out each civilization. It's viewed that, from some perspective the Chinese abandoned the original primitive religions since Shang dynasty and are transforming to more and more *civil*. The hard core religion for the Chinese are actually ancestor worship and history worship which can hardly be called a religion. 

Historically, religions serves as a shelter for the civilization during wars, because temples and monks are exempt from fatigues. e.g. Buddhism during Southern and Northern Dynasties and Taoism during the Mongolian conquest. Taoism preserved many essence of the East Asian civilization from war, Joseph Needham quotes heavily from Daozang. Taoists actually invented at least two out of the Four Great Inventions: gunpowder and compass.

Every time after China was united again the religious form were quickly abandoned by everyone and religious organizations were suppressed by the nation. Like the Ming dynasty rose from Manichaeism and banned Manichaeism after taken power.

I think the main reason Chinese are not religious is because Chinese are really *smart* and would not buy the BS in religions easily. They do not fear the unknown and instead they are willing to explore them. Back in my home town there are some underground Christian churches, and I can tell you the **real** reason why joining them: They are after the free education, food, drinks and free medical care.

Oriental religion are more about spirituals than gods. Taoism &amp; Confucianism are actually atheist. The Confucianist are all about *public service*. Buddhism on the other hand serves as some sort of spiritual guidance. The title Dalai Lama means 上师, *teacher* or mentor. But in a modern society you can easily find alternatives, you learn a lot from books, life, nature, etc.

&gt;Except the Middle East isn't Islam? As a matter of fact, Islam as practiced in the Middle East varies widely from country to country. Even though many of them pretend to be Islamic states, they all have different ideas of what it means to be Muslim or Islamic. Kuwait and Jordan for example are very progressive Middle Eastern states; Turkey has arguably swung too far in the opposite direction (wearing a hijab there is extremely verboten -- there's immense social and legal pressure on women to not wear it).

Israel is one country. How many Islamic theocracies are in the middle east? How many governments, while not theocracies, are driven primarily by Islam?

&gt; I could replace Islam and Muslim with communist in that sentence, and it would still ring true. Assuming these statements are true, what is the next step? Hopefully not a 1950s-style witch hunt. If all you want to talk about is how messed up a bunch of backward developing societies are and how it's horrid that the West is dealing with them, without offering alternative solutions, then I don't think there's much more to be discussed.

When did I ever discuss alternatives? I was talking about Islam and Islamic culture. **You** started arguing these points.

&gt; [citation needed]

What do you think ""Islam"" means?

&gt; So what if Islam is dangerous because of this? How do you propose to solve that? I'm not here to join the anti-Islam/-theist circlejerk where we all talk about how messed up religions are and how they've ruined the world. I'm interested in fixing said mess.

I never made a point to argue for solutions, but liberalism/secularism would do it.

&gt; There is a very diverse body of opinion on Islamic law and Islamic ethics, and constantly treating it as some sort of monolithic faith is stupid.

Which is generally why religions are not seen for what they really are; people calling themselves the same thing while holding completely different views.

&gt;That's a ridiculous analogy. Why should banning an architectural feature reduce criminal acts?

When did I say it would decrease crime? I think it's just a way to show that they're not going to put up with their bullshit. Go look up the massive Islamic protests on Youtube where the Muslims are holding signs like ""death to Europe"" and ""Sharia is on its way"".

As far as extra-judicial killings, you can see numerous examples of this carried out against the Black Panthers, though rather than complete secrecy, the conspirators in the US often uses legal legitimization of their murders (filing false reports on the circumstances of the police killings, etc.), except in the highest profile cases which are usually ""lone nuts"".

I agree with Xander that there are strong ties to *Ancien Regime* types in Europe, but I suspect there is a fairly fundamental (though always disguised) divide between the English speaking world and mainland European forces.  One could view this split as based on the divergence of interests between European bankers (primarily Rothschild) and American bankers (Morgan, Rockefeller etc.), leading to subtly different geopolitical and domestic goals (observe the universal opposition in Europe to the Iraq War, but their complete agreement on Afghanistan and the first Iraq War).  Alternatively you could see the split as arising from Cecil Rhodes (originally financed by Rothschilds) and his amassing of a huge fortune which he left to the cause of Anglo domination of the world, a goal at odds with the mostly non-English Rothschilds, royals and others.  Last, one could view it as a split effecting only US policy and based on a divergence of aims among US bankers (also sometimes characterized as a split in the Rockefeller family itself).  In any case, the Caucasian world is utterly infested with these actors who cooperate on the most basic tenets of emerging world government.

I'm not sure about what Xander says about infiltration of oriental governments, though it's certainly possible.  The Chinese have a long, little known history of secret societies and conspiracies.  Aside from the Ming loyalist 'Red and Green Societies' (about 400 years old), there are many interconnected clan-based societies that extend into academia, politics and organized crime (both Triad and Yakuza).  Interestingly much of the wiki article on Ergenekon, sounded as if it were describing pre-war Japan, with military and police controlling the state through violence; while we dismantled the entire formal system in Japan after the war (except the Emperor, long just a figure-head), it seems reasonable that some of these militarist societies remained.

Bill Gates' wealth is a good example of somebody who could not have done it without government granted monopoly. Warren Buffett is a market manipulator extraordinaire (contrary to popular libertarian belief it's not just governments who can corrupt markets for personal gain) and Sam Walton's wealth was created primarily through the exploitation of a large worker underclass in the United States - a class created indirectly by the state, as well as market manipulation (especially with regards to land).

Yeah, none of them are *that* legitimate. Sorry. That's not to say they weren't all incredibly innovative at one point (Walmart's satellite network was smart), or that they haven't created a lot of wealth, but NONE of them have earned all their wealth without a bit of what you call ""glomming"". None would be *close* to as wealth as they are in a free market, put it that way.

Oh fucking great. Instead of one man with $100 billion it's 10 family members with $10 billion.

It also takes an incredible amount of luck to be up with an emergent industry at the right time, and in his case, an incredible amount of market manipulation that is ultimately what led to the popular movement to disband Standard Oil. When somebody gets that powerful they often have approaching the amount of power to corrupt markets that a state does.

&gt;There were dozens of 'robber barons' whose wealth seemed permanent at the time but who aren't remembered at all today. Who remembers Cooke, Crocker, Drew, Dwyer, and many of the others?

Doesn't matter if people remember them. Their descendants are the aristocracy of America today - on corporate boards, in congress, etc. Even though many don't have the same surnames.

They were called robber barons for a reason, also. Because it was a popular, and NOT a misguided notion, that excessive market manipulation and abuse of monopoly power was a different kind of robbery.

&gt;Yes, a lot of mining is done by small companies but what I am saying is that 'Exxon' and 'Schlumberger' are that size for a reason -- it takes huge resources to be able to do the sort of exploration, extraction, and other things they do.

They are large for the same reason that Boeing is large or Airbus is large - because they are granted so many state subsidies (either indirect or direct) and economies of scale (not through use of resources, but through the ability to negotiate on state granted drilling rights).

It takes huge resources to explore, extract, drill and refine, but those functions do not have to be tightly coupled into a single company. They could (and would, in a free market) be broken up into a network of far smaller companies which specialized in exploration, drilling, refinery, etc. 

To see what it would be like - look to the Japanese method of supply chain management in automotive and electronics industries - a large number of integrated small businesses (sometimes as small as workshops) which perform functions all the way up the supply chain. The American equivalents are mostly oil-company sized. There is a reason why one is a network of small businesses and the other is a small number of big businesses and it has more to do with the market conditions in those countries and, crucially, their respective *states* than it does the inherent nature of the electronics and automotive markets.

&gt;A free for all is exactly what you get when no one owns what falls under the commons otherwise.

A free for all is exactly NOT what you get when the commons are *leased* and the money is ploughed back into the community. If you are granted a right to farm ""the commons"" you have the right to kick somebody else off your land - hence the tragedy of the commons is averted. But, you have to *pay* the community for that right.

&gt;Leasing land is not an answer, look at how rental cars and other such properties are abused, despite the fact there may be a penalty for damage.

If it worked that badly Hertz would cease to exist. As would every other car rental company in what is apparently a thriving market. As would every landlord in the world. As these markets appear to exist despite your protestations we can only assume that leasing IS sometimes the answer.

&gt;People take much better care of things they own and expect to perhaps sell some day.

People also don't tend to crash rental cars if they know there will be penalties. I don't think that is justification for owning land.

Renting your home for your entire life was actually the norm before massive market manipulation by the state because of some misguided notion that homeownership was ""good"" and ""very American"", incidentally.

Unfortunately, a side effect of the increase of guys like myself who get their asses out of military service is that not many young men get into organized shooting any more, compared to around 50 years ago.

(Side note, the Swiss militia system was one of the pillars of keeping society fairly well integrated; it's fairly pointless right now, because mass infantry armies are obsolete and expensive, and because it tends to keep people away from work and school for a long time, so there's something like a 30% ""medical"" drop-out rate now.  Nobody has come up with a workable alternative.)

A recent development has been the requirement to register antique military weapons (dating back to the 1870s), although these can be kept at home and fired at government-sponsored ranges.  These also use the GP11; I have a Karabiner 31 and a Gewehr 11, both of them beautifully made and accurate weapons -- highly recommended.  Historically you've been able to pick these up for peanuts, and can still find decent ones for about 200 CHF (about $220.)

Global warming may 'stop', scientists predict

This would mean that the 0.3°C global average temperature rise which has been predicted for the next decade by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may not happen, according to the paper published in the scientific journal Nature.

However, the effect of rising fossil fuel emissions will mean that warming will accelerate again after 2015 when natural trends in the oceans veer back towards warming, according to the computer model.

Noel Keenlyside of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences, Kiel, Germany, said: ""The IPCC would predict a 0.3°C warming over the next decade. Our prediction is that there will be no warming until 2015 but it will pick up after that.""

He stressed that the results were just the initial findings from a new computer model of how the oceans behave over decades and it would be wholly misleading to infer that global warming, in the sense of the enhanced greenhouse effect from increased carbon emissions, had gone away.

The IPCC currently does not include in its models actual records of such events as the strength of the Gulf Stream and the El Nino cyclical warming event in the Pacific, which are known to have been behind the warmest year ever recorded in 1998.

Today's paper in Nature tries to simulate the variability of these events and longer cycles, such as the giant ocean ""conveyor belt"" known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), which brings warm water north into the North East Atlantic.

This has a 70 to 80-year cycle and when the circulation is strong, it creates warmer temperatures in Europe. When it is weak, as it will be over the next decade, temperatures fall. Scientists think that variations of this kind could partly explain the cooling of global average temperatures between the 1940s and 1970s after which temperatures rose again.

    * Global warming forecast predicts rise in 2014

Writing in Nature, the scientists said: ""Our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade, as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic [manmade] warming.""

The study shows a more pronounced weakening effect than the Met Office's Hadley Centre, which last year predicted that global warming would slow until 2009 and pick up after that, with half the years after 2009 being warmer than the warmest year on record, 1998.",False

You put yourself into the debate taking a side.  You can't blame me for assuming that you believe in what you are defending.  In all honesty, that is what honest people do.  They only defend that which they believe in.

&gt;My interest is in keeping people honest and raising the level of the discourse. The article you linked fails in honesty and it fails in intelligent discourse. (Getting to that.)

Oh, so you don't want to take part in the debate, you want to be the facilitator?  Well, shouldn't you be invited to do that rather than invite yourself?  You are putting yourself into a hierarchical position without the support of those supposedly debating underneath your majesty.

&gt;Unjustified assumption or red herring or something. When did 'standard of living' become the goal? 

Since human action was based on acting for the purpose of improving one's situation, which is since forever.

&gt;Why is that the focus?

You mean why does human nature have the nature it does?  Evolution.

&gt;The reason it's not justified is that the mechanics of a system don't justify those system's results, they merely explain it.

Capitalism isn't a ""system"" that is controlled or designed.  It is a spontaneous society that emerges when individuals are free to trade with each other and there is no theft or violence.

&gt;Putting the focus on the consumer is taking the focus from something else, and not acknowledging power disparities. 

Putting the focus on the individual company and the relationships therein is taking the focus away from all relationship between individuals in society, who may or may not be working at the same company.

&gt;Any inequality isn't inherently evil. But power inequalities, and gross disparities of them, are, and I think you would agree. 

What exactly do you mean by ""power""?  Do you mean power in the sense of someone having weapons and being able to threaten and coerce other individuals, or do you mean power in the sense of someone being able to influence other individuals because they have specialized abilities that others voluntarily look up to and try to emulate?  Or do you define power in another way?

&gt;Actually, I'm almost completely sure you agree in the case of governments. 

Oh, so it looks like you mean the ability to use weapons and threaten people with violence in order to influence their behavior.  If that is what you mean by power, then you and I agree that such power is immoral.  But such power is not inherent in the market economy.  The market economy is about free trade.  Government power is external to the market.  Sure, many market participants are affected by that power and some are even able to convince the government to wield their power over some people rather than others.  But in all cases, the problem is the government power itself, not who uses it.

&gt;But you have to understand that in a market-based society, of any variety, money is power. It's coercive power, whether you disagree with this or that form of coercion (i.e. controlling the behavior of people by individual actors or small groups such as oligarchies).

Oh, so now we are back to non-violence based power.  You keep switching back and forth between the two as if they were equal when in reality they are not at all equal.  One is based on initiating force, and the other is based on voluntary consent.

Money is not power.  Money is a tremendous influence for sure, but it is not power in the sense of initiating force, which is what government power is all about.

You do not have to solicit the business of wealthy companies if you don't want to.  At the individual level, you are free to not engage with these people if you don't like them for whatever reason.  Money is not power.  Only those who don't understand the true nature of money and what it represents would confuse it with physical power.  Those people who confuse money with power actually want physical violence to usurp and replace intellectual and voluntary cooperation.  Money is based on voluntary cooperation and free trade.  That's how it came into existence in the first place.  The fact that some people use money for nefarious purposes does not mean that money is the problem.  It means that the person is the problem.

&gt;In a place like the United States, or any place with a government, large amounts of wealth disparity mean large amounts of power disparity, and the holding group will use that power to benefit themselves at the cost of everyone else. 

What power are you talking about exactly?  Since you keep bouncing back and forth between weapons and peace I am not sure what you are talking about at any one time.

&gt;A Constitution won't stop this, and there's not a State in the world with good enough people to prevent it from happening, and it will happen, once the power disparity gets over a certain amount. (To get standards on this, study Shapley-Shubik power indices. I'm not merely handwaving.)

Shapley-Shubik power index only reveals the problems in government voting processes.  This has nothing to do with capitalism proper.

&gt;In the case of the United States, the 'unions' here don't resemble worker's unions in almost any sense, being led by co-opting profit-seeking representatives. You're absolutely right in that unions will shoot themselves and their company in the foot in an effort to fight the 'class warfare' battle, at least in the United States. Elsewhere (such as Europe), you see unions working with 'managers' more often, taking pay cuts to increase long-term profitability, and generally not being the greedy asshats they accuse the owners of being.

This is a criticism of the US government versus European government, not of capitalism versus syndicalism.  

&gt;In a situation where the workers own the company and don't have managers, there's no 'class' fight to justify foot-shooting, and increase in technology doesn't mean people get laid off 

Actually it does, because with technological advances occurring at the individual syndicalist company, the productivity of that firm will rise.  Since the productivity will rise, there will come a point at which the consumers don't want anymore product at that new lower price, which means eventually workers are going to have to be idle.  In that case, the money that these workers earn will be a cost that does not justify their continued employment.  If the company continues to employ them anyway, then such a company will become bankrupt.

&gt;(which is a virtual guarantee under pure management-controlled companies), while still getting the benefits of decreased costs to consumers.

You are making promises that economic law cannot keep.

&gt;Your mistake here is the same mistake American liberals (contemporary strain) make when talking about corporations: Both corporations and groups of people are made up of people. They're not these buildings that walk around doing shit. 

Your mistake here is the same mistake that Chomsky makes.  Corporations *are* made up of people.  They are voluntary collections of individuals who contract with each other in order to make gains.  These gains can only be made if the customers of the corporation gain.  So there is a harmony of gains across the board.

&gt;A syndicalist is supporting individuals and individuality by protesting what they see as a form of indentured servitude in some (if not all) cases of employment. 

Wage earners are not in ""indentured servitude"".  They don't have to work for wages if they don't want to.  They can work for themselves.  If they can't find a decent job, if the problem is widespread, then the fault is with the government of that country, not with capitalism and free trade.  

&gt;The power disparity between prospective employee and prospective employer ensures that the market is never really 'free'.

There is no ""power"" disparity.  Such disparity is a product of one's ideology and philosophy, not anything in the real world.  It is hatred based.  It is based on hating bourgeoisie individuals.  The fact is that the Waltons have no power over me.  They provide me with low prices goods.  Katsuaki Watanabe has no power over me.  He provides me with affordable automobiles.

The market is free, in the real world sense.

The kind of freedom that you are talking about is not real world freedom.  It is some other kind of freedom, and my guess is that it is freedom from the burdens of physical reality and the existence of self-interested individuals who will not cater to your self-interest that demands their sacrifice.  This is a guess.",False

Obviously, Canada has a history before the Europeans came. Since that history was never recorded anywhere, and modern history is based on the written word, most of what we know starts when the Europeans arrived.

The Vikings were first. They settled in Newfoundland, but didn't stay.

Later, the French set up a colony, called New France. New France was quite large at one time (stretching all the way to Louisiana), but was sparsely populated. The region that is now Quebec and The Maritimes is where most settled. The rest of Canada, from Ontario to the Pacific coast, was not settled until much later. Something interesting to note about the French was that more than any other colonizing power from Europe, they were more inclined to form treaties and cooperate with the natives, rather than try and conquer them.

Many of the wars that Britain fought with France carried over to this side of the pond. France finally ceded New France to Britain in 1763, less than 15 years prior to the American revolution. The soul of New France, however, did not die, and today Quebec remains in many ways a separate Nation within Canada, with their own language, laws and culture; distinct even from France. Much of Canada's tolerance for other cultures stems from the fact that from our very early history, we had to find a balance between the goals and desires of French and English Canada. This has not been easy, and perhaps never will be, and yet we have somehow managed to keep it from descending into mindless violence (the FLQ notwithstanding). French Canada is still very much their own nation, however the rest of Canada is not really English anymore, as we are now made up of immigrants from around the world. English just happens to be the language that we speak to each other (for the most part).

The American revolution had a major impact on Canada. Loyalists who were no longer welcome in what was the 13 Colonies, due to their loyalty to the British crown, left and settled in what was left of the British colonies in North America, in a sparsely populated region that was to become Ontario. This is a very important event for any American to understand if they want to understand English-speaking Canadians. The area of Canada that was to become Ontario was founded by those who remained loyal to England following the American Revolution, and that resentment and mistrust formed a large part of our early culture (the Loyalists were not treated well by the Revolutionaries).

In the early 1800s, the Americans and British went to war. The war of 1812 never had a victor, but several bloody battles were fought along the Niagara river, and more around Detroit. Americans even attacked what is now Toronto, and captured Fort York (the fort still stands today; the oldest buildings in Toronto). That war forged the beginning of the soul of what is now English Canada. The Americans attacked us, and did not prevail.

Americans often don't understand why Canadians ""don't like them"". In reality, we do like Americans. We have family and friends who are American, and we feel welcome there. But we also know what they are capable of; our history has taught us that. America has given Canada a lot of trouble. I don't mean that as an indictment; America has also given a lot to Canada. We're family, and we know it, but family doesn't mean there's no trouble ever.

I have come to believe that the tension between Britain and America found something useful in Canada. The American Revolution forced Britain to re-think their entire policy regarding the rest of their colonies; The entire British Empire benefited. America had to carefully forge a nation that was truly better than what came before it, because there was British North America (not yet named Canada), right next door, and Britain was quite willing to take back any American colony that wanted to return to Britain; America benefited. Canada benefited from the American Revolution because Britain tested out many of it's new policies here; many of which would then subsequently be applied to the rest of the empire.

This summary is probably going to horrify many historians. I'm sure I've made some mistakes, both in facts and in analysis, however that's the best I can do without writing a whole book on the matter (which I should note I am not at all qualified to do).

Read up on New France, Louisbourg, United Empire Loyalists, Upper Canada, Lower Canada, North-West Mounted Police, Louis Riel, Vimy Ridge, Pierre Elliot Trudeau. That'll give you a good starting point for understanding Canadian History. There's more, of course, much more, but that'll get you started.

You may point to socialistic european countries, but I can prove to you that they are sustained by exploitation as well. The only difference is that the exploitation occurs out of state, in the third world where resources are bought and cheap goods are assembled and transferred to ""knowledge worker"" economies sustained by powerful armies and governments that will overthrow any leftist revolt in aforementioned third world countries.

I would like to point out some things you should know about our country.
You may disagree or agree it depends on how you look at it.

Let me tell you about me first so you would know about my background.

I've traveled across Mexico and I come from one of the northern state of Chihuahua.

I've lived for a long time abroad (Europe) and I come from a very humble background. 

I've gone from rags to riches then to rags then to meh... not bad, so I've been on both sides of the economic divide.

I would like to divide my opinions in 5 topics being: History, Race, Culture, Politics and Education.

First our history, one sad truth about Mexicans is that we for the most part, do not know our history, not fully not accurately, not with precise dates or names. Few are the ones that know where things come from or why they are they way they are. It happens so in most countries where the economy is not that good, yes, education suffers, anyway here it goes...

Our current territory, roughly 2.000.000 square Km. is what's left of the war with the US where we lost Utah, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and the Central American part that was once with us in a crazy adventure called the Mexican Empire (by a crazy man called Agustín de Iturbide) they, (the central American states) in the end decided to secede.

We the Mexicans are a mix of cultures and races, our population ranges from European immigrants, to indigenous people to mixed people or ""mestizo"".

We are now a federation of sovereign Mexican states each with their own constitution and police force.

We are in a sense the result of a continuous mixing and remixing of cultures.

Like the French who in school are taught that they ALL descend from the Franks and the Gauls  we are wrongly taught that our ancestors are all Aztec, which may not be true for all.

We are a territory of a country that has been conforming to the invention of the ""Mexican"" culture, because it is just that, an invention.

What did the Tarahumara people from Sonora and Chihuahua have to do with the Mayans, yeah, nothing. Some Spaniards decided that the whole territory be called New Spain, then the whole territory after 300 years of Spanish rule became independent.

The main proponents of our independence from Spain were not the indigenous people nor the mestizo people, like the US, they were rich white people of power who wanted more power (remember the US was founded by white slave owners who couldn't get what they wanted, if you see Washington for example, he was pissed because he couldn't make it into the British Army and wear a red coat, yes it is true look it up and read about how much he wanted that in life).

These rich folks wanted more money for themselves and couldn't have it as the Spaniards had instituted a caste system. The Spaniards born in Mexican territory were not to have the highest ranking positions reserved for the ""peninsular"" Spaniards, that pissed them off a lot.

Other proponents of our independence were people who (although we were taught they were heroes) were ambitious and thought that they would have a better chance and achievements in life if they were the commanders and not the Spaniards, they were either mixed people or even peninsular Spaniards who wanted to rank higher in the army.

Others were crazy foreigners who came to help just because they were mercenaries against monarchies and wanted free republics across the world, like Giuseppe Garibaldi.

When we had our independence (because Spain was too busy being invaded by Napoleon) we fought many civil wars, a lot of infighting took place. The country was weak and poor and under the threat of secession of the territories. Chiapas was not part of our current union and the Yucatan peninsula wanted to form their own country.

Then this very nice and charming fellow named Santa Ana came along and became president many times. He was like your typical Nicholas Cage character, charming but dangerously crazy. He fell in the trap set by the US *yeah the US was tricking countries into war since then* with the Texas settlers. We lost half our territory.

**Ah crap... gotta take care of something... I'll be back with episode 2.**

Ok I'm back...

The greatest hero for most in Mexico is Benito Juarez, who was a Zapotec indian from the state of Oaxaca.
When he was a kid he did not speak Spanish, and he wanted to speak it and learn to read and speak Latin (which was the relevant language of academics and religion and the educated), when he managed to do so he became a lawyer and then a congressman of his state then a governor then the president of Mexico.

The problem is that by the time he became president we still had infighting and the olden people the ones who grew up with some kind of nostalgic remembrance of a time they never lived (Mexico before the 1810s when it was under a Spanish monarchy) yeah, these people wanted order and a monarchy to back it up.

Some crazy Mexican kid who was living in Paris convinced the wife of Napoleon III (yeah, that Napoleon wanabe) to make a colony out of Mexico. Napoleon III owed some money to the Hapsburg family and he tells Maximilian of Hapsburg ... hey... you want to be the king of Mexico? ""wtf really?"" yeah... come on you'll like it and they'll love you.

He tricked Maximilian to get rid of him (and his debt) and he sent him to Mexico with the French army.

Benito Juarez (our hero) had a very tragic life, when he was young he was imprisoned for defending the poor against unfair rulings of the church (yeah the Catholic church had juridic powers much) and when he was trying to make a country out of Mexico all the infighting spilled his soup more than once. 

We have to note that French intellectuals of the time (1860s here) were opposed to the invasion of Mexico.
Benito Juarez believed in the separation of church and state, in his fate as a president and the will to make a republic out of this territory, a republic of citizens not subjects of any crown.

He was persecuted all across the territory by forces both French and Mexican who wanted to get rid of him to form this colony or the new Mexican empire.

One of his children died in a very hard winter in NY where he sent his wife and kids to hide in the Mexican embassy.

He lost his wife also but never gave up the hope of forming a republic, when I think of how brave he was because he faced near death many times and never gave up his fight against all odds he finally succeeded and had Maximilian executed as an example to any European power of what will happen to any foreign ruler who would want to make a colony of us once again.

Then came the time of one of his generals in his fight against the French, Porfirio Diaz, who ruled for 30 years. (also a Zapotec indian like Juarez). This man learned to love French culture by getting to know the soldiers he fought against in the war, once many of the French soldiers were abandoned to their own luck in Mexico, Mr. Diaz tells them, ok, I need architects, engineers, bakers and as many hands as you can lend me to rebuild this wreak of a country.

He setup the rail network and the telegraph and an infrastructure for development. It was in his time when the central American states (like Guatemala) left our union, the Americans told him many times.. Hey Porfirio... we'll give you weapons, gratis brother, if you invade Guatemala, look at how they left Mexico just like that, come on go and invade them...

So Porfirio tells them... are you nuts? haven't we just signed a Pan American agreement that any American country that invades another American country will feel the wrath of the USA? what the heck are you planning? hey, hey I'm talking to you gringo...

He never raised a hand against any central American country, he let them be.

The problem with Porfirio was that while he developed the country's infrastructure he neglected the poor, and was taking long to leave office, social unrest grew and he was perceived as a dictator, he ruthlessly crushed rebellions like the one in Cuchillo Parado and Cananea in Sonora.

A civil war which we so fuckingly wrongly &lt; yeah they can be adverbs &gt; call Revolución Mexicana exploded and seemed never ending. 

Many factions and armies fought in it, and many Mexican generals killed each other to gain power. 

What we got out of that war was:

1. the 1917 Constitution

2. A single, state party

3. The incorporation of work unions into an unholy marriage with the government

4. The bases for our finally federalized education system


Then we had (hey remember I'm skipping many episodes) our own Tiananmen massacre in Tlatelolco in 1968. the birth of our middle class (which didn't even last 35 years) and now a multi-party democratic system.

We are currently the 12th world economy with more than 50% percent of our people below the poverty line.

One time Billy Idol was playing on the main stage, and I swear, up until the moment he stepped out on stage and started to sing, I honestly believed we were there to see David Bowie. I don't know how I got those wires crossed...but even leading up to the show, I would say Billy Idol, and think David Bowie.

Another time me and a friend were at the third stage (read: a shack like 1.5 km from everything else) to see In Flames. The weird thing is that at concerts the Germans were always very docile. I mean, I'm not one of those swing my arms violently, trying to punch people moshers...but I like jumping up and down and pushing people and letting out some aggression. So In Flames comes on and it's ridiculous, they have pyro, PYRO in an indoor show. Me and my friend go nuts. The whole show is just a blur of jumping up and down and awesomeness. So finally the show ends and this huge German dude comes up to the two of us and is like ""You two need to calm down"". It was my proudest moment (when I was in the Army I was 6'0 ~130 lbs).

Oh, and my all time favorite concert moment was watching Slipknot. I'm not a huge Slipknot fan, but they have awesome energy and put on a hell of a show. So at one point the singer tells everyone to shut the fuck up. He then proceeds to tell the entire crowd (this is at Rock Im Park, the biggest annual open air festival in Europe) to sit down on the ground with their hands under their butts. He then tells us that we **cannot** get up until he says to, and when he does we are to go fucking nuts. They then proceed to play...I don't know what song, but for like 90 seconds it just builds and builds and builds and the tension is getting thick. Then all at once the music pauses for a split second and he screams **""Get the fuck up""** and all at once thousands of people jump up into the air at the same time and just go fucking crazy.

The Scandinavian welfare states are tightening citizenship requirements and trying to get more people into the workforce as opposed to having people rely on the passive benefits offered to them by the government.

&gt;Si en algún lugar del país se puede hablar de Estado fallido es en Cancún, el polo turístico erigido hace 40 años que hoy está en manos de las mafias del narcotráfico. Los cárteles se disputan la plaza ante la parálisis de las autoridades y la complicidad pasiva, en algunos casos activa, de empresarios. Cancún anticipó lo que sucedería en muchas ciudades, que hasta hace poco no estaban “contaminadas” por el crimen organizado. Pero en Quintana Roo, a diferencia de otras entidades, el narco no “llegó”, sino fue prohijado conscientemente desde el poder.

&gt;Mario Villanueva gobernó el estado de 1993 a 1999. Es el paradigma del gobernador priísta que abrió las puertas a los narcos colombianos y colaboró en la construcción y fortalecimiento de grupos que desangran hoy a México. Desde entonces hablábamos de las pistas donde aterrizaban avionetas con cocaína, de los millones para permitir su libre paso. Directores de medios le temían, censuraban a sus colaboradores y reporteras para evitar la ira de Mario. Cuando La Crónica de Cancún, un diario local, se atrevió a reportar los vínculos de Villanueva con el narco, el gobernador llamó a los dueños y les sentó junto a Fernando Martí entonces director. Con amenazas y dinero se apropió del diario dando una lección a las y los reporteros que en aquellos tiempos ante las evidencias, intuían el daño que le haría al país  el libre paso de los cárteles.

&gt;Hoteleros mexicanos y extranjeros le entregaban sumas multimillonarias para recibir su aval en la destrucción del ambiente y se sometían al desprecio de su reconocido talante agrio. Escuchamos historias sobre supuestos asesinatos y vimos cómo hoteleros, políticos y policías tejían redes de complicidad y silencio. Toda persona que revelara la realidad era acallada, amenazada y aislada. Los más ricos y poderosos empresarios de Cancún y Cozumel departían con Villanueva a sabiendas de su narcoalianza; se creían en el círculo dorado de los intocables (como los empresarios cómplices de Tijuana, Durango y Chihuahua) y ahora a ellos también les tocan las extorsiones, las amenazas y los secuestros.

&gt;El 4 de junio de 2008 el ex gobernador Mario Villanueva fue sentenciado a 36 años y 9 meses de prisión por su complicidad con el trasiego de drogas de Colombia a los EU. El gobierno estadounidense lo considera responsable de abrir las puertas a la globalización del narcotráfico con el Cártel de Juárez cuando Amado Carrillo El señor de los cielos era el jefe criminal en mi ciudad. A pesar de la clara evidencia cientos de personas de todos los estratos sociales le defienden; hoteleros y empresarios, políticos y gente común consideran que “fue un buen gobernador”.

&gt;La extradición despierta viejos fantasmas. Aunque Villanueva purgue una pena merecida por gestar el monstruo de la impunidad y el fortalecimiento de los cárteles, quedan cientos de hombres de poder que fueron cómplices silenciosos, que callaron cuando debieron hablar, que festejaron la corrupción, que compraron su entrada con dinero sucio; esos que aún gobiernan Quintana Roo y controlan parte de su economía.

&gt;Ahora Los Zetas controlan la cárcel y mantienen enormes galerones en la salida a la carretera a Mérida con productos piratas que distribuyen en el sureste. Los Beltrán Leyva pelean el control del tráfico de drogas con El Chapo Guzmán que ahora tiene más poder que nunca en el Sureste mexicano. Durante 2007 hubo 34 ejecuciones en Cancún y en aras de proteger el turismo el gobierno gasta millones en acallar a la prensa.

&gt;Mario Villanueva es quien es y su herencia pervive aunque sea extraditado. La sociedad entera paga las consecuencias.

&gt;Genocidio: recientemente en España hablé sobre la responsabilidad del Estado en los casos de feminicidios (tipo penal aceptado en la Ley federal).

CP Exposed Takedown

Please spread the word as fast as possible:

cpexposed.com has been taken down by the web hosting company, Hostgator, as the result of a complaint by Common Purpose alleging copyright infringement.

The notice from Common Purpose can be downloaded from here: http://dmca.hgfix.net/cpexposed.com/cpexposed.com.pdf

We are puzzled since all the documentation is in the public domain, and has been for some considerable time.

Maybe this has happened because we recently posted information from Common Purpose’s own website showing the links between the Scottish paedophile James Rennie and the Common Purpose organisation. Are we getting too close to the truth? How many other paedophiles are protected by Common Purpose networks and their secretive Chatham House confidentiality rules?

Spread the word. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible.

Which emblems will you be grinding? I assume you don't mean triumph since you've had over 4 months to ""grind"" those and if you mean ""grinding emblems"" for new gear in a new instance, well what else do you expect?

As for those unneccessary rebalancing patches, the vast majority of them are far from unnneccessary. Some classes scale better with gear than others and need a good hit with the nerf bat once in a while to stop them getting overpowered. In an ideal world you never get to see any class become vastly over powered either, as Blizzard funnily enough implement changes based on what they're working on right now. So if you class gets nerfed but it doesn't seem neccessary, then it was probably to do with how powerful your character will be in full tier 10.

While Blizz may have admitted they make mistakes, I'm sure they mean mistakes in the sense they'd have done something similar but naturally in a different way.

Harking again to the Prohibition analogy, it's plausible because the illegal trade in drugs has allowed them to build a durable infrastructure, and has put them in positions that will allow them to transition into other realms of criminal activity.  That seems to have been the real effect of Prohibition -- it didn't foster the creation of the criminal organizations, but it did allow them to nationalize, a process that would have taken much longer otherwise.

&gt; In a drug deal, nobody calls the cops and their is no victim and is thus much harder to enforce and more profitable for the cartels.

Which is very big part of the reason why I think legalization is unlikely to halt the violence coming out of these cartels.  It isn't the fact of the drug deal that precipitates the violence -- it's the motive to make more profit than is allowed by social restrictions.  Making it legal to buy and sell drugs isn't going to remove the motivation to profit above and beyond what's possible legally.  What the drug war really shows is that these cartels are full of people psychologically invested in the process of defending their profit margin at the cost of lives.  If they can move to a different product and still retain that profit margin, they'll do it.

&gt; How do you explain the sharp increase in homicides at the start of alcohol prohibition and sharp decrease following it's repeal?

The chart on that page is interesting, but not necessarily conclusive.  For one thing, the homicides peak in the 30s -- that is to say, during the Great Depression.  The increase in the rate of homicides also seems to correspond with the end of WWI, which would have seen the return and reintegration (with varying degrees of success) of American GIs from Europe.  Likewise, the later decline in homicides could be explained just as easily by WWII as it could be by appeal -- particularly given that the end of that decline also roughly corresponds with the end of the War.  I'd need to see more data before I could be sure that duress from sudden economic stress and the oscillations of war didn't play bigger roles.  Either way, the growth in homicides during that period is nowhere near as steep as the growth during the latter half of the first decade nor that of the 1960s.",False

I now live in Europe, and have had to adjust my theories a bit to fit the evidence I've been presented with.  I'm living in a place with gobs of retarded British (Amsterdam).  The level of stupidity is the same, just the way it is expressed is different.  Things actually overheard on the tram in the past week:

**Americans:** ""Do you think we can drink the water here?""  ""Lonely Planet didn't mention it, and it would have said so if we could.""  ""Yeah, we should just be safe about it, plus, the guy said he didn't have any tap water at the Italian restaurant"" ""Yeah, it must be unsafe, which is why he was giving us bottled water"" ""Yeah""

**British:** ""Did we see this part already?""  ""I'll get the map"" ::opens gigantic map in crowded tram, apologizes to several people individually, but continues to unfold map::  ""This map is useless, look at this word.  *eerste leidsedwarsstraat*.  Why don't they have sensible names?""  ""Well, it's in Dutch, dear""  ""Yes, but everyone speaks English, they should translate the maps and signs for tourists.""

Thing is, I now speak Dutch pretty well, and went for a short vacation to Portugal.  On the trams there I had a similar experience with a Dutch family.  Totally lost, saying the stupidest things, absolutely culturally insensitive, and some quite disrespectful.  They went much farther than your average 'American tourist' would go, presumably because they thought nobody could understand them.

Anyhow, all of this evidence points to the fact that: Tourists are stupid.  Everywhere.  The main reasons Americans are singled out: there's a lot of us, everyone can understand what we're saying, people see what they're looking for, and you don't notice the smart ones.  I started to pick up on British-tourist-idiocy after a while of being exposed to it, Dutch tourists later, and I'm sure if I learned Japanese, Italian, or French it'd be the same.

As to your points, Mein Kempf did directly influence his policy. He DID dream of conquering western Europe. Yes it wasn't something he wanted to do right away but when the opportunity presented itself (ie France wouldn't sign a peace with him) he very readily conquered France anyway. 

And regarding the crimes that we committed, no I have to disagree with you there. First of all, it is incorrect to consider the German and Japan civilians as totally innocent, as both fully and enthusiastically supported their country in their acts of war, and were vital to the industrial infrastructure. Second, yeah we probably could have won the war without targeting their cities, but I think neither of us can dispute that it did speed along significantly the conclusion of the war. It is on record that the nuclear bombs were a critical piece that forced the hand of the emperor of Japan. Even despite that the military tried to squelch him. 

These wars aren't happening in vacuums, every month prolongation of the war means thousands more deaths from the conquered countries. Chinese and Eastern Europeans (who I guess you could call ""innocent"") were dying by the hundreds and thousands every day that the war dragged on. Every month of fighting also contributes to more and more military dying on the lines. 

Wars make all sides guilty and sure it was somewhat hypocritical on the war trials at the end while everyone on the victor's side got off (victor's justice) but that's minor compared to what was acheived.

Bottom line - you can't know for certain what would have happened if we didn't bomb the factories and cities to force the surrender. Even you will agree this war HAD to be won by the Allies, the suffering of the conquered peoples mandated it in my opinion. We look back and realize that the Allies had this in the bag, but being part of the moment I don't think it was at all obvious, and that the possibility for defeat was very real. Had USSR lost Stalingrad and the oil fields, or had Germany actually conquered Moscow, who knows? And if Japan managed to hold out, because we didn't touch their shipping or bomb their cities, perhaps a negotiated surrender where they keep Manchuria and south east asia would have been a very likely outcome. So yeah, perhaps the bombings weren't as unjustified as you think they were. We had to win, period, and if bombing the industrial capacity helps improve those odds (which they do, significantly), then perhaps that is what you have to do. It isn't an absolute, and discretion is required, but saying ""it's always wrong to do something like that"" is I think incorrect too unless you want to admit that winning the war against Germany / Japan wasn't necessary, and that China, Eastern Europe, Jews, Asians, etc can just go die as it isn't our problem.

&gt;Kosovo was actually a decent example of where directed force saved lives and promoted the freedom of the citizens who were otherwise being oppressed in Sarajevo. Some of them are my friends, and they're very grateful for what happened (as opposed to some of my Iraqi friends.... but that's another matter).

Moreover, it gets on the nerves of neighbors especially stronger neightbors.  We specifically told the former soviets.  Gave our word for the most part that we wouldnt go east of  Germany.

Also, Saddam Hussein was guilty of more murder and repression than occurred in Kosovo, consequentialist.

For a simple rise in the tensions with the russians see:


&gt;The legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign in Kosovo has been the subject of much debate. NATO did not have the backing of the United Nations Security Council because the war was opposed by permanent members with ties to Yugoslavia, in particular Russia, who had threatened to veto any resolution authorizing force. NATO argued that their defiance of the Security Council was justified based on the claims of an ""international humanitarian emergency"". Criticism was also drawn by the fact that the NATO charter specifies that NATO is an organization created for defence of its members, but in this case it was used to attack a non-NATO country which was not directly threatening any NATO member. NATO claimed that instability in the Balkans was a direct threat to the security interests of NATO members, and military action was therefore justified by the NATO charter; however, the only NATO member country to which the instability was a direct threat was Greece.

&gt;REUTERS
&gt;A Latvian army soldier during a military exercise near Riga.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German reunification. ***Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the Russian position.***

&gt;No one in Russia can vent his anger over NATO's eastward expansion quite as vehemently as Viktor Baranez. The popular columnist with the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda (""Komsomol Truth""), which has a readership of millions, is fond of railing against the ""insidious and reckless"" Western military alliance. Russia, Baranez writes, must finally stop treating NATO as a partner.

http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,663315,00.html

So, the consequences of the Kosovo misadventure may still be in the offing, like Afghanistan. 

Also note what happened during the war as another unfortunate side effect of attacking and the possibility of escalation with another great power:

&gt;After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of ***naked aggression***, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war that groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of ***a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.***[48]

We will not know the result of the Kosovo war maybe for decades and we were lucky not to spark a great international incident immediately.

Kind  of like also those color revolutions and the recent aggression in Georgia that have led to brinkmanship with the Russians again.

Also:

&gt;As a result of their inability to locate mobile or concealed military targets, NATO forces increasingly turned to bombing infrastructure such as power stations, bridges and roads. This increasingly became the case during the latter stages of the bombing campaign

Good stuff, huh?

Your claim that you wouldnt oust Saddam Hussein but would have stopped Kosovo is again consequentialist.

Saddam Hussein was far more lethal and a client state armed by the U.S.


&gt;In another book, The New Military Humanism, Noam Chomsky, who at times writes collaboratively with Herman, disagrees with Johnstone's views on Milošević, the Serbs, and Srebrenica in particular. While Chomsky believes that the massacres at Srebrenica did occur, he does not believe that Milošević was involved, pointing to the Dutch report that claimed that he was horrified to hear of it.[91] He has described Milošević as a ""terrible person"", but still believes that he was not a dictator and that his crimes have been exaggerated while the crimes of the Kosovo Liberation Army have been ignored.[92] In a 1999 interview, Chomsky sparked controversy with his view that to call the deaths in Kosovo a ""genocide"" was ""an insult to the victims of Hitler"".[93]

The Chomsker.  Find me the number of deaths.  I see Clinton ranting.  But I see no proof of hundreds of thousands, etc.  Many refugees, yes.

As far as providing liberty,

&gt;and political outcome. The status of ***Kosovo remains unresolved***; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine the ***level of autonomy Kosovo would have, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, but failed***. The province is administered by the United Nations ***despite its unilateral declaration of independence on February 17, 2008.***

So, they are still stuck there after 8 years.  Antagonizing neighbor states and helping potentially some people with ideologies that hate western values.

You can never tell how things will turn out.  How hurting the Soviets in Afghanistan would turn out to be integral in hurting the U.S..

So without perfect knowledge, it is better to stay out.

Of course, you, YOU, can go in and intervene with your buddies or mercenaries.   Just dont make me or my property a slave to your statist and consequentialist ""just"" causes. 

Lastly, why do you support standard majoritarian democracy as an objective value ?  I mean seriously. The people elected sometimes are worse than the worst scoundrels and hate the U.S. regardless of what it has done for them.  Why do you presume democracy will lead to friendly states?  Look at British (democracy) vis a vis the Irish or look at Palestine's democracy backfiring on the U.S..

The Taliban within their framework were elected, I believe. =(  Nazi rulers were elected, I believe. =(
