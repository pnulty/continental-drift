For starters, computation doesn't have to mean ""number crunching"". The simplest definition of it that I've ever read comes from mathematician, computer programming professor and computational theorist Rudy Rucker: ""A computation is a nonrandom process that obeys finitely describable rules... the rules act as a kind of recipe for generating future states of computation.""

By this definition, a computation takes place at every synaptic vesicle of every synapse of a nerve cell. Additionally, computations take place within cell organs. 

On a functional level, we don't know enough about how the activity of our nerve cells leads to the phenomenon of consciousness to rule out anything as ""noise"". Hell, we don't even have a consensus on whether or not there even is such a thing as consciousness. As long as our best and brightest are in the business of offering educated guesses on the subject, it is plain old bad science to assume that we can ignore vast swaths of brain activity as insignificant to the problem's solution.

&gt;... science is full of extremely useful simplifications that make the work doable rather than fanciful nonsense like a head full of trillions of modern desktops worth of processing power. What use would it all be? 

Yes, and science also has found that modeling some kinds of dynamic systems accurately is a devilishly difficult if not impossible task, because simplifications don't always do the trick.

What use would it all be?  How about support and infrastructure for the most complex object know to man, for starters? 

Fanciful? Did you follow my above link to [this story](http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/smart-takes/scientists-build-biggest-artificial-brain-of-all-time-16-billion-neurons-as-smart-as-a-cat/2135/)?

excerpt:

*""Scientists have built the biggest artificial brain of all time using a supercomputer powered by ... millions of watts of electricity that's about as smart as a house cat.""*

*""Don't believe in nature's awesome power? Consider that it took Dawn's acre-size footprint packed with 147,456 processors, 147,000 gigabytes of memory, 10 rows of racks, miles of cable, a million watts of electricity and 6,675 tons of air-conditioning equipment spouting 2.7 million cubic feet of chilled air to simulate the biological wiring found in your 10 lb. pet cat. And that's still one-eighty-third the amount of power your own brain can muster.""*

**""The simulation ran 100 to 1,000 times slower than real-time.""**

All that firepower, and the ""about as smart as a cat"" simulation still runs up to 1,000 X's slower than real-time. Where I come from, that's a verrrrry sloooowwww cat.

&gt;Do you honestly expect neurons to be so optimized that every structure that could carry out coherent calculation does? What pressure could possibly result in such an impossibly over-engineered biological system?

Who said that every structure has to play a role in everything that goes on all the time? Your home computer doesn't devote every ounce of its power to the solution of each problem you give it.

Nature has had billions of years to over-engineer the hell out of all sorts of biological systems. Ever hear of ""junk DNA""? 

&gt;... to suggest that an individual neuron (all by itself) is crunching away at whether this line I'm looking at is foreground or background or whatever is just goofy as hell.

That *is* a goofy suggestion. I didn't make it. You did.

&gt;.. to just throw out there in this very dismissive and arrogant way that the brain has this i-just-pulled-some insane-stat-out-of-my-ass-and-refuse-to-show-my-work capacity is question begging in the extreme.

Maybe you skipped over the 10-day old comment above where I cited my original source for my original comment. If so, here it is again:

My original claim comes from a book by Dr. Charles Jonscher called ""The Evolution of Wired Life"". 

Jonscher doesn't have a PhD in neural science, granted, but he's a bonafide expert in computation [President of CET and leader, technology practice. Head of European Telecoms, Media &amp; Technology, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton (1987-90). Formerly with IBM and BT research labs. Co-director of Telecommunications Research Program, MIT (1981-84). Lecturer Sloan School of Management and Faculty of Economics, Harvard University (1977-84).Extensive writing on business and technology. Education Cambridge (BA) and Harvard (MA, PhD).]

My original statement isn't a controversial one among people who have a competent understanding of nonlinear dynamics, cognitive science and computational science. Only among people who want to imagine that we're *like, totally a hairsbreadth away from the singularity, dude. Shit's gonna be like The Matrix in our lifetime!* get depressed when confronted with the reality that we've got mountains of work and a certain amount of good luck ahead of us before we even have a cat brain simulation that isn't functionally retarded.

Aside from that, this isn't some prestigious journal like *Nature* where you need to ""show your work"". It's a fucking comment thread in a subreddit. The 'nets are so cramful of ignorant bastards, it would be countless lifetimes' worth of work to educate all of them. 

You need me to elaborate more?

Sorry. Not my job.

The question is certainly not would or could this be an inside job
just simply was it. For the record I don't know, in many ways I don't care. There is enough public information to know how power operates to lead me the conclusion that all these things are inside jobs whether planned directly or not. A relatively small group of people hold sway over huge resources militarily, economically, culturally and create an environment that maintains the status quo - a status quo of hopelessness, environmental destruction and human misery. Power is not passive in this it continually lobbies for it and against any challenge to this status quo by 'pretty much' all means necessary.

When you learn a new language -- especially one that is quite different from your native tongue -- the edge cases jump out at you and frustrate your efforts to achieve real fluency.  This is true of any language.

Well, I guess it comes from experience really.  I've had habits of avoiding rent for most of my twenties.  I got out of school without a degree and with 20K in school loan debt and 3K in credit card debt.  So I decided, hey, better get a job and launch 1000 dollars a month towards my creditors.  Did this by having a girlfriend and a buddy whose then-fiance was off in grad school so he welcomed the 2-3x a night company.  I had all my clothes and shit in my then-car and would drive home (50 miles) to do laundry and chill with my mom and watch football with my friends at home for a night every couple Sundays or so.

I got out of all that debt (in 2.5 years) and then saved another 20K and I moved 'cross country (east to west) and didn't work for a while, and loved it, but lived beyond my means because I had no desire to do anything except read, hang out, ride my bike, and go to shows.  It was fun.  I lived in a driveway for a year but it was harder to get a girlfriend so I moved into a cheap room and found it much easier to have a girlfriend, even though they never would come over to stay anyway.

I moved to Europe this last year and blew the rest of my money.  I only came back because she cheated and I think once a cheater always a cheater.

I haven't worked in a few years and my resume has nothing on it in that time so I don't want to be a wage slave; I'd rather just save up another 10 grand and go out west again and repeat until my hair starts to fall out.  I found it's the only way I can feel alive.  Living in a van is an enabling experience.  Before I had the luxury of an adjacent house, but I want to do more travelling and staying in a city for a few months sort of thing and moving along.  I like to make a lot of friends from all over the place.

I obviously don't think thieves and homosexuals are in the same position morally, or that you think that, as I don't know you, but in a conservative Christian worldview, as both are banned Biblically, both are sinful behaviors which should be corrected. 

In a secular state, however, definitions of behaviors which merit punishment, correction, or withholding of equal protection are generally based on a perception of harm to self, others, or society. Though the argument can be made that homosexual behavior is harmful on one or more of these scales, the argument would generally be based on religious assumptions, at least in my experience, and thus be of limited value to secular public policy. 

This is where opposition to homosexual behaviors becomes seen by many as hateful and bigoted. Vocal opponents of gay marriage, and of gay rights in general, generally want, and vote for candidates who support, the status quo of denying certain rights to gay couples, which is seen by some as bigoted because it is, in their view, a misuse of the instruments of secular governance, and an unwanted incursion into this sphere based on beliefs with which they also disagree, namely that homosexuality is a choice.",False

No, and nor is the US a Christian country.  It's a country where freedom of religion still prevails, and where Islam, among other religions, is practiced in the presence of free choice and without coercion, contrary to what you wrote earlier.

&gt; Without the Crusades we would probably all be moslem today and I'd be dead or locked up in a jail for rebelling against my masters.

That's a false dilemma.  One missing alternative is that if Europe hadn't had a single religion so widely imposed, we might now be living in a less religious world with a stronger bias towards rationality - one which would be less inclined to accept the current attempts at Islamic influence on laws and society, much the way that Sweden has [banned the teaching of religious texts as though they were true](http://frethink.com/2008/08/25/swedish-government-its-illegal-for-schools-to-teach-religious-doctrine-as-if-it-were-true/).  Sweden has a high proportion of atheists, and that's not a coincidence.

To me, you're espousing one side of a battle of two roughly equally unpleasant alternatives.

The sanctions were terrible, but I don't think you can simply blame the U.S. for international sanctions on behalf, again, of Kuwait and Saudi. Nor am I confident that there was a better way. Meanwhile they ignore the deaths of Iraqi Shiites at the hand of Saddam.

Then they talk about the deaths in Somalia because some Somalis decided that it was far better than Somalis starve than Europeans feed them.

For the current Afghan and Iraq wars they do seem to ignore deaths at the hands of Muslims and seem to put all of the responsibility on the U.S.



FTA:

&gt;Similarly, the United States is not solely to blame for the sectarian violence that engulfed Iraq after the 2003 invasion.

Solely? It is hard to see how it has more than a minor responsibility. Saddam was massacring Shiites and the U.S. shamefully did nothing. 

I have an idea, why don't Muslims start taking some responsibility for their decisions and their actions. Yes, the U.S. has been a murderous bully. Yet Iran and Iraq sent their teenagers to their deaths because of their own moral failings. 

FTA:

&gt;Americans should also bear in mind that the figures reported above omit the Arabs and Muslims killed by Israel in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank. 

I suspect that a big part of the reason they left the numbers off is because they would be so much smaller than people expect. Instead they can use vague comments as a substitute. 

And somehow they left off the numbers of dead in the various Kurdish revolts over that period, the number of dead in the Yemeni civil wars, the number of dead in Algeria and Morocco, the number of dead by Khaddafi's adventures, the number dead in Sudan and Somalia. Somehow the millions upon millions of dead Muslims at the hands of Muslims are ignored and Israel and the U.S. are blamed for all of the problems. The article is accurate in that the Muslim world does this, but that is the problem. Friedman is right in part: the narrative in the Muslim world is that the U.S. is the aggressor and the killer. The true story is that it is a violent unjust world and the sooner they recognize their role and the roles of their various leaders in this violence and death, the sooner they can make things better.

In regards to Native Americans - Edwards' family was key in mission work to Native Americans. I know that a lot of mission work then also tried to European-ize the native people, which is sad. And it seems like you dislike the claim of Christianity as truth to the exclusion of other beliefs - so I get that as a starting point. But for those missionaries, believing that the native Americans would go to hell without hearing about Jesus, going and telling them was one of the most loving things they could have done (I also understand that sometimes that mission work manifested itself in bad ways as well)

So, I think to lump Edwards into some larger ""Puritan"" label, and then bringing up all the crimes of Congregational churches from 1650-1800 is unfair.

As far as the sermon, it was a fire and brimstone sermon that was trying to encourage people to not trust in their own goodness and to trust in Christ. Worded very strongly, and given with all sorts of emotion drawing metaphors. The people in your quote thought they didn't deserve God's wrath, and they (like, according to Edwards, all mankind) absolutely did deserver God's wrath.

Anne Hutchinson is a lamentable case - she did say in her trial (which is where, from what I have read, wikipedia got off track from the historical record) that she received direct revelation from God, which is why they charged her of heresy. Her being a woman had a bunch to do with it, no doubt. But again, she died 60 years before Edwards was born. 60 years is a long time for the shape of faith to change. Edwards even strongly disagreed with the practice of his grandfather who pastored his church just before he did. 

Salem also had nothing to do with Edwards. 

The continuity of ""Puritans"" is not what you make it out to be. It is certainly not big enough to blame Edwards for the faults of every other Congregationalist Christian in the area in the century. In fact, Congregationalist church government is based on individual congregations having the right to govern themselves, without any sort of strong centralized hierarchy.

Again, I am not saying Edwards was perfect, but it seems like your problems are mostly with 1) Christianity in any form or time claiming exclusive rights to truth or 2) bad deeds done by some people who are lumped together with Edwards because we have to make some sort of categories in history to create some sort of narrative.

The first thing I said to the wonderful woman who is now my wife was nothing. It’s rather a long story...

My family is Dublin Irish; far back as we can trace. But my parents moved to England in the early 60s and I grew up outside Birmingham.  Years ago, they got an idea to have a traditional Irish family Christmas back in Dublin.  After a bunch of searching and figuring stuff out, we found a house to rent and, in short,  had a terrific time that year. Loved it so much we rented the same place again the following year and did it all over again.

This second time, I convinced my best friend to come with us - mainly so I'd have someone other than my Dad to go out drinking with. I love my Dad, but figured he's not the ideal wing man to help with the beautiful Dublin girls.

We took the night boat from Holyhead, arrived in Dublin in the wee hours of a Saturday morning, dog tired.  Hit the hay for a few hours, then up, showered, dressed, and off into town for a day of showing my best buddy around my beloved home town.  We started in one of my favourite Dublin pubs - McDaid's of Harry Street. A couple of gorgeous pints of the finest velvet Guinness.

We figured we couldn't prop up the bar for the entire day – tempting though it was. So I dragged my mate out for a walk down Grafton Street, through Trinity College, and across into the National Gallery - one of my favourite art galleries in the world. 

After a couple of hours of culture, we decided it was high time we got some more booze into us.  Wandering back down Kildare Street, we spotted a sign outside a bar (the old Pink Elephant, if memory serves - gone now, I think) advertising ""Happy hour 5pm - 7pm"".  That sounds like a bloody good hour, we agreed, and in we went.

This swanky, night-clubbish place wasn't really our kind of watering hole, but what the heck. They had about ten different cocktails on the little menu card at the bar.  We had one of each.  Finished the happy ""hour"" with a large shared [Flaming Lamborghini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY2pwNYaVHc).  Hic!

From there, we staggered off into The Bailey on Duke Street for a ""proper drink"".  It was jammed to the rafters, sweaty and noisy.  Squeezed into a corner and sucked down a couple of slow pints, checking out the talent. 

At some point, while generally minding our own business, this weird bloke kind of glommed onto us. You know - one of those strange, older guys you find in a bar full of 20-somethings. Awkwardly out of place, but eagerly chatting up anything that moves. Eek.  The kind of bloke who spews a steady stream of sexist remarks and all-round obnoxious comments; pretty much guaranteed to scare off any and all eligible young ladies in a 20 yard radius. 

After what may have been an hour of putting up with this, we announced we were off to ""find a real pub"".  Dammit, our unwanted gnome followed us.

Heading back across Grafton Street, I made a bee-line for me darling McDaid's.  It’s a different pub at night, compared to the lunchtime scene. Utterly heaving with lithe and delightful young bodies, all out for the craic and revelling in the sheer joy of being young, healthy, single, and just vibrantly alive in one of the most glorious cities in Europe.

Squeezing between the tight-packed crowd in the main downstairs bar, my mate and I somehow – without really trying – managed to lose our klingon in the melee.  We weaved our way through the bodies lining the stairs, into the equally noisy upstairs room, and managed to negotiate a free spot right at the bar, where we could lean back, pints in hand, and survey the room.

Now – as you can well imagine, by this time in the evening I was in what I think you could call a fairly advanced state of inebriation.  Pickled.  Bubbling quietly behind the ears.  

But I was young, fit, and full of vim.  The astonishing thing, when I think back now, is that I could still see straight, somehow, and had been holding (what seemed to be) perfectly coherent conversations. I do remember smiling a lot, though. Really. A lot.  

In one of these extended bouts of heavy smiling, it came to my attention that my pal had somehow managed to get deep into conversation with a really rather attractive person of the opposite sex.  Yay!

Pulling focus to the space in front of my own nose, I realised something even more interesting: she had a friend.  A stunningly lovely and well-dressed blonde friend. And said friend was smiling very warmly back at me.

Slowly, I leaned forward in the noise of that smoky bar, intending to introduce myself. She leaned in too.

So I kissed her.

We’ve been married now for 16 years and have three kids.  I love her even more now than I did that first moment we met.

Oh – and we have spoken now, btw, in case you were wondering.  Can’t remember what the first words we spoke after that special, perfect nothing were.

As far as I know, Cyprus is occupied mostly by Greek Cypriots and some Turkish Cypriots who were pretty much transported from Turkey to create the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, who is only recognized by Turkey (yeah, open up a Turkish map.

Turkey says that they used their guaranteer rights (or something like that) granted by the 1960 agreements to occupy the island for the safety of its citizens.

Also, there was the Annan plan which, according to what I have heard, would have helped a lot and was supposedly not very biased as it was put together by UN (hence the name) that was accepted by Turks but not the Greeks.

So given all that, I think Turkey gets too much heat for what's happening.

But then there's the current situation. Cyprus is a member of EU that Turkey is essentially not recognizing. And there's the whole world not recognizing TRNC. And there's the fact that the island is mostly occupied by Greeks, not Turks. I think Turkey needs to reconsider its' stance on some of the issues.

One reason for the muted celebrations of 20 years after the revolutions in Eastern Europe is that many people aren't sure they have that much to celebrate.

Last week, it was the Czech Republic's turn to mark 20 years of freedom, and they've broken records for being subdued. One Czech cabinet minister was quoted as saying, ""We focused on low-key events, including a small conference of historians."" They know how to swing, don't they? When this was announced, he probably added, ""I know what some of you are thinking--that maybe we could let go a little and hold a medium-sized conference of historians, but think of all the clearing up.""

According to a poll, 80 percent of Czechs are dissatisfied with the country, and according to Focus magazine, ""Many of those attending the anniversary events held anti-corruption placards,"" aimed at the current government.

This must have entailed quite a change of mind on his part, where he suddenly announced, ""I'm big enough to admit I made a mistake. Up until a few weeks ago, I thought it was my duty to uphold the ideals of freedom through communism, which happened to grant me a life of privilege and luxury while most of my country went short. Now it is clear to me I must promote the values of free-market capitalism, which happen to grant me..."" (I imagine you can see where this is going).

it could be that both systems were driven by the same ambition, to make as much profit as possible--the detail being that in Eastern Europe this was organized by the state instead of private companies.

The value of money MUST exist outside of the government.  Pretty much all of the wars of the 20th century were only able to be funded because the government could artificially increase the currency.

Another terrible example?  Before World War 1, most Europeans kept their savings in the form of gold.  During the war, most European nations basically just took all of the gold out of everyone's bank accounts in order to fund their fighting, essentially, everyone in Europe lent money to the governments.  Then when the war ended and the governments realized that they could not pay back all the citizens that they had taken gold from, they switched their countries off of the gold standard and ""repaid"" everyone with paper.

The religion enforces the culture. As religious influence recedes, so does the cultural restrictions. I believe you provided a reference, catholic women covering their hair.

Nobody is claiming that historically European or north American countries weren't just as backward and appallingly cruel in the application of superstitious belief and subjugation of women. The point is these cultures evolved past such disgusting behavior. The middle east cannot, religion is too influential in all parts of life. There are many articles about Saudi Arabia, one for example about the new university where they wanted to allow the genders to mix. There is a tremendous amount of religious opposition.

99% of women could successfully have an abortion and not be blown up. 99% of Muslim women in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Saudi Arabia would be beaten or jailed if they wore a t-shirt and jeans.

Since you are so fond of statistics how about this. Over 90% of women are victims of domestic violence in Pakistan.

These days your milk is coming from a cow pumped full of hormones and antibiotics. It's then processed with preservatives, and other chemicals. Dairy products you consume today are about the most processed foods around. Meanwhile these products contain a lot of fats.

As for Corn, it was actually cultivated from teosinte and doesn't even originate in the wild. It dates back about only 7000 years, and was only consumed by those indigenous to Mexico, and parts of North and South America. The European's didn't even know corn existed until the discovery of the ""new world"" (the America's). It later became one of the most profitable crops for the US alongside cotton. The reason corn is in everything is because the US placed a tariff on sugar imports (which I believe still exists) as they were unable to grow sugar on US soil. It's why we wanted Hawaii so badly, as it is the US's primary source of sugar. Anyhow, this is why US processed foods use corn syrup rather than real sugar as it is much more cost effective to use corn syrup in the United States. It's also why if you drink soda outside the US it usually contains just sugar, and no corn syrup. 

Previous to this no major Euro-Asian / African population consumed corn, and today the US consumes 300% more corn than any other country. In most countries corn is considered pretty much animal feed, and was not readily consumed until after the industrial revolution.

Are people who get degrees in various theology-related fields in secular universities known as scholars of Christianity or Judaism? I've never heard that used. But then again, graduates of Jewish seminaries for instance, might be called Rabbis. But in Islam, we call the scholars 'Ulema', and an individual an 'Alim'. Perhaps that's a better word? It means 'scholars' and 'scholar' respectively, but the Arabic word obviously denotes the Sunni/Shi'a context when Muslims hear it.


&gt; I don't have to be accredited in order to study Islam and be called a scholar.


Thank God Western civilization doesn't follow the same principles otherwise Europe would still be in the dark ages. Imagine the chaos that would reign if all fields of learning were dominated by unaccredited institutions.

Muslims started the Bimaristans (medical schools and hospitals) following the model of their legal institutions, which is the same model followed today all over the world (re: the Wiki link I pasted about 'ijazah'). Imagine if medicine were still practiced in the old manner.


&gt; Unbiassed study is essential for honest reflection, and for that to happen, I believe outside scholars should be free to study Islam while retaining the title of ""scholar"".


That's why Sunni Islam arose in the first place. It's called 'orthodox' Islam because the methodology was designed to root out personal bias and get to the truth (historical and scientific) of what Islam actually is, as laid out by Muhammad and his companions. It was born out of necessity. This is precisely the issue with 'scholars' like Dr. Naik. They let personal bias creep into their 'scholarly' opinions. Muhammad has repeatedly denounced people who issue personal opinions about religion as rulings or fatawa. The point is to issue a ruling that reflects the truth of what Muhammad actually said and did as well as the spirit of Islamic law. You need to be educated to do that. You don't have a sufficient education unless you've mastered all the material available under proficient teachers. Thus the Islamic idea of universities and academic degrees. It's usually a 4-5 year course to be an 'Alim', an 8-year course to be equivalent to a 'Mawlana' (title usually used in South Asia though), and the equivalent of a Ph.D. makes one a Mufti (Shi'a call it Ayatollah and their total run is 12 years I believe).

10 years of professional education in the most competitive atmosphere where all your work is reviewed and critiqued versus someone who's self-taught. Yeah... right.

It's not even a huge deal because most (but not all) of the time, Dr. Naik just regurgitates the rulings of actual Muftis. Even he acknowledges the difference.",False

Slowing down the economy until the elite
concede is indeed a wonderful strategy.

this strategy is indeed a 
very powerful trueleft idea.

This particular strategy is how the
 truly democratic nations of western europe
were able to get concessions from the
elite. For example, denmark citizens, who
represent perhaps the most leftist group
of citizens on earth, were able to wrest
enormous concessions from the elite
using nationwide strikes.

Yes, they put the elite on their asses and the 
workers were in control of denmark.
This happened roughly twenty years ago.


The trick is to extort the elite by slowing
down the economy.

Now, since that time, the workers have lost some control of denmark in the last  few years because
the elite have used mass immigration
of nonwhites to fragment the populace 
and thus break the will of the people using the
classic divide et impera. But the denmark
citizenry are fighting back by stopping 
mass immgration.

This same thing happened all over europe.

The workers back in the 80s and early
90s were in control of their own 
nations in w euro, at least to a great extent.

THen the elite broke that control
using mass immigration to bring in 
nonwhites. 

Thus the elite gained a lot of control.
And the citizens of western europe
lost some of their power they had gainsed.

But the point still remains that slowing
down the economy and extorting the 
elite, which is the point of this 
particular reddit article, is actually 
a powerful trueleftist strategy. 


Slowing down in our cars until we get 
universal healthcare is a great idea.

It would work.

Now of course america is undoubtedly
far too diverse to ever agree and get 
together, unite, to ever accomplish
something like this. We could never
agree to do this because 1) we are too
large a nation to ever unite enough
to do this. The elite know this. That is 
why they created the federal union of 
the states. THey knew that a large
federalist union would keep
the citizens from uniting against the elite

Of course you know nothing of this becasue
the elite would never tell you. And you
will not believe me now. 
that is the nature
of homo sapiens. 

Nevertheless, it is
true. 

2) there are too many different races
and cultures to allow american citizens
to unite thusly and slow down our economy
by driving slowly. The elites know this.

that is why they love mass immigration
of different races. They know it prevents
us from uniting against them.


So, it's a great to slow down the 
economy by driving slowly.

But we are too fragmented to ever
implement this strategy.

The elite know this. And you do not.

Even though I just told you. Because
you are a homo sapiens and are therefore
a meat receptacle for whatever ideology
the elite pour into your brains. And of
course they would never tell you what I
told you.

A graduate of the Pakistan School of Fashion Design, Maria launched her label ‘Maria B’ in Lahore back in March 99. Right after the fashion show, she opened the doors to her new boutique located in the Defence residential area. Her cotton shalwar kameez and embroidered evening wear, all meticulously cut and stitched, were quickly snapped up by trendy Lahoris. 

During her four years at the Fashion School, Maria learnt to make patterns, drape and stitch by hand – all that hard work has obviously paid off. Maria’s clothes can be described as chic and modern – they are wearable, well-cut and neatly finished. For the shoot with Meera, she selected outfits off the rack. “I wanted a glamourous look – to depict a lifestyle with a certain image. These are clothes for every occasion; they are laid back and eccentric.” The outfits she has selected – from a cotton sleeveless shalwar kameez to black net culottes to a chiffon sari – embody her look for the modern Pakistani woman in the late 90s.

Unlike other aspiring designers in Pakistan, Maria has been exposed to the international fashion scene early in her career. While still a student, in 1997 she participated in Forcea, a competition in for young designers, in Belgium and walked away with the “Les Etoiles De La Mode” Award. “I had designed some modern, futuristic pieces, but I had used traditional embroideries and indigenous materials. I didn’t expect much, but I did try my best – after all, we were the first batch from Pakistan to participate in this event, she recalls. Maria went home with an award and there was no turning back. She learnt that there was tremendous scope for Pakistani fabrics in the international market and was determined to make her mark globally.

That really is the core philosophy of my business. We want to go into the international market and prove ourselves as a Pakistani brand name.” 

Maria’s main goal is to export her outfits abroad – “I want to send haute-couture items such as evening wear, bridal wear etc. to Europe and then eventually to the US.” She knows it is difficult to break into the international market and has given herself ten years to do so. “That is how long it takes for most designers – so it is good that I am starting so young!” She remains undaunted by the global competition and says “you have to aim high – and I do want to get to New York, Milan and Paris one day.”

Okay - from the article:

&gt; A report specifically commissioned four years ago by Congress, the Wegman Report, identified many of the failings discussed in the past week.

The Wegman report was itself strongly criticised as partisan, and non-peer reviewed - and it'd be interesting to see which Wegman findings supposedly match which actual email content.

&gt; the man-made greenhouse gas theory is a recent development

If the mid 1800's is a recent development, then yes.


&gt; Until around 1980, solar modulation was believed to be the driving factor in climatic variation.

Hard to know where to begin with this - Milankovich cycles are generally accepted to be drivers of interglacials if that's what he's referring to, but that's more oribtal than solar. Solar variation has a profound effect on our climate, but solar variation is cyclic and does not account for an increase. This is a huge over simplification of the history of this field.

&gt; ""speculative meteorology""

Loaded language that conflates the huge uncertainty with near-term forecasting and extending that to imply far more uncertainty in long-term climate studies, when the reverse is true. Of course, The Register is a sarcastic news source, which is why articles like this neeed to essentially be treated very very cautiously indeed.

&gt; The gas theory is based on an elegant 'energy budget' model, but it leans heavily on positive feedbacks resulting from greenhouse gases such as CO2 in order to produce the warming CO2 cannot do by itself. 

This sentence really doesn't parse well. CO2-induced warming is predicted by physics, the rate and extent comes from modelling the behaviour of the atmosphere, energy budget etc. Positive feedbacks amplify, but are not a prerequisite.

&gt; Yet no simple empirical laboratory tests are of use here. 

Untrue - any schoolchild can repeat the simple validation of CO2-indecued warming of the atmosphere, using a volume of air and a light bulb.

&gt; Nor is there a ‘fingerprint’ or tell-tale signal that anthropogenically produced gases are the primary forcing factor. 

Of course there is - eg. the already detected cooling of the stratosphere, the alteration to the isotopic makeup of CO2 in the atmosphere etc. The fact is - physics predicted it, we looked for it, we found it, we validated it, its accelerating.

&gt; Hence climatology's increasing reliance, since 1980, on a range of anecdotal evidence and computer modelling.

Anecdotal? This is a casual smear. And what's wrong with computer modelling? Isn't El Reg an IT journal? Don't we use that to model nuclear tests, aerodynamics, etc etc? 

&gt; The result of this was the blurring of the line between correlation and causation

Pure assertion.

Then (and this is important) look at the graphs on page 2 - note carefully that the first is *clearly labelled EUROPE* while the second is global. The MWP was a phenomenon affecting the Northern hemisphere. Is it not dishonest of Orlowski to mislead by not making this distinction abundently clear?

Seriously - that's just halfway down page 2. I could go on, do you want me to?

It's a known fact that VPS instances have a shared i/o path, which means that both swapping and a lack of sufficient space for filesystem/block caches can hurt a lot. People tend to make tight memory configurations for their specific set-up, leaving just enough room for a bit of cache during normal operation, but at the slightest hint of a traffic peak, when extra apache processes are being started, their server will keel over swapping itself to certain death.

Okay, you can live off $1.5k travelling for Europe in months if you decide to sleep outside and walk everywhere. Some people do this, so fine.

But, if you're not used to that or don't like that idea then yes $10k is what you would need. 

Rail pass = $1,500 -- unlimited ride
Plane tickets to/from Europe = $1,600 -- I bought when airfares were high (2003)

$3,100 just on travel expenses so far. I'm sure you could reduce it, but that's what I spent.

Lodging = $30 / night -- Which I think is being VERY conservative. Remember $30usd != 30 euro. Three months = 90 days * $30 / night = $2,700. Round up to $3,000 for good measure. Even still, that's a conservative estimate but completely do-able.

$6,100 so far. And that doesn't include food, entertainment, gifts, or miscellaneous expenses. 

Food = $20 / day. Depends on the city really and what you get. Some cities are more expensive than others. $1,800 total.

That leaves $2,100 for other expenses. It isn't hard to see how you could spend $10k traveling through Europe for three months. ",False

WE had the Black Plague (estimated 100 million killed) THEY have AIDS (estimated 22 million killed).  Europe IS hell.

2) So any conflict that had major powers involved counts for ""our side"" does it?  Remember how we were involved in Rwanda? .  We (via the UN) got involved in Rwanda too (or at least tried to).  So, by your metric, Rwanda 'counts' for us.

3) 15 other countries had SARS (as I wrote), but then again, most all other countries have AIDS so if SARS doesn't 'count' for China and Hong Cong because 15 percent of cases were outside of those areas, then AIDS certainly should not 'count' for Africa as 35% of aids cases are outside of Africa.  

4) You clearly can’t read (or look things up for yourself).  “The United States has more people with AIDS than all but 8 of the 53 countries in Africa”   I.E. the USA has more people with AIDS than 45 of the countries in Africa.

A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution. A wise nation will combine all these considerations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties.

&gt; The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment.

&gt;The study of mathematics appears to slow down after the onslaught of the Islamic invasions and the conversion of colleges and universities to madrasahs.

Although Arab scholars relied on a variety of sources including Babylonian, Syriac, Greek and some Chinese texts, Indian mathematical texts played a particularly important role... eventually, Indian algebra and trigonometry reached Europe through a cycle of translations, traveling from the Arab world to Spain and Sicily, and eventually penetrating all of Europe...it appears that original work in mathematics ceased in much of Northern India after the Islamic conquests. http://india_resource.tripod.com/mathematics.htm

Al-Biruni was a case in point: his scientific celerity in the Arab world would owe much to his mastery of Sanskrit and access to Indian scholarship.”  http://islamicexpansionanddecline.blogspot.com/

It matters if you are purposefully trying to insert space between graphs in order to make one appear more antiquated.  If that was not your intent, then no, it doesn't matter.

&gt;According to the studies in the 2007 report, it started around the year 800 and peaked in the year 1000 or so. Since Mann's 98/99 studies start in 1000, you don't see a bump, but later studies do.

&gt;The terms ""Little Ice Age"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" have been used to describe two past climate epochs in Europe and neighbouring regions during roughly the 17th to 19th and 11th to 14th centuries, respectively.

Regarding the effort to ""get rid"" of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), if Mann's graph isn't enough to demonstrate it, consider the huge effort to downplay the maximum temperature from that epoch, and the silly red herring of trying to claim it was only regional.  Consider the propaganda from the alarmists: http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2006/02/medieval-warm-period-was-just-as-warm.php

You will note the following quote, supposedly from a NOAA website:

""The idea of a global or hemispheric ""Medieval Warm Period"" that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.""

Firstly, thank you for acknowledging that, while you said the IPCC dropped it without a word of explanation, this was not in fact the case and you simply hadn't bothered to check.

Secondly, the answer to your question comes in the very next sentence:

&gt; The timing, however, of these cold and warm periods has recently been demonstrated to vary geographically over the globe in a considerable way.

So: something was previously believed to be true, was subjected to increasingly more accurate forms of scientific study, and as a result our understanding was changed somewhat. To you, this appears to be evidence of fraud. I would argue it's pretty standard scientific work.

&gt; Prophetically, the world government is linked to previous world empires, and particularly to the Roman Empire:

&gt;    * A seven-headed beast (Rev 13.1) implies that the final world system or government (the 'seventh') embodies the royalty, learning, brutality, godlessness, and corruption of the six previous world systems, from Egypt to historic Rome. In particular, the fourth beast 'speaks like a lion' (Babylon), tramples with 'the feet of a bear' (Medo-Persia) and moves fast 'like a leopard' (Greece) - see Rev 13.2.

&gt;    * Prophetically, the world government is tightly linked to historic Rome. This implies it will have the strength and brutality of Rome, as symbolised by the crushing and shattering 'iron' of Dan 2 and Dan 7. It is interesting to observe that the **EU Constitution claims 'absolute power' over member states**, and that the **EU is creating a European army**. The Roman Empire was also known for its strongly centralized government and massive public works, such as roads.

&gt;    * Whilst having the strength of iron, the world government will also have great weakness. This is symbolised by the 'feet of iron and clay' (Dan 2.41-43). Just as iron does not combine with clay, the member states of this government will never readily combine with each other. **Such disunity is apparent between member states of the EU.**

&gt;    * The Roman Empire adopted Christianity under Constantine in the early 4th century. Prophecy indicates that the coming world government will also embrace a form of Christianity. A Roman revival and 'Christianised' empire (the Holy Roman Empire) has been at the heart of Europe's leaders and aristocracy for well over 1,000 years. However, this religious system will be a corrupt (apostate) church (Rev 17).

&gt;    * Roman society was organised on a strict hierarchy; citizens, provincials and slaves. Full citizenship was granted to provincials en masse as a way of securing their loyalty to Rome. It is interesting to note that the **1992 EU Maastricht Treaty forced all citizens of member states to become citizens of the EU**.

&gt;**Signs of the coming World Government**

&gt; The move to create a New World Order (NWO) probably started in America during the early 1900's. Significant milestones are:

&gt;   * 1935: a NWO symbol appears on the back of the US dollar bill

&gt;   * 1940: H. G. Wells publishes a book entitled 'The New World Order'

&gt;   * 1945: UN is founded

&gt;   * 1948: World Council of Churches (WCC) is formed

&gt;   * 1954: Bilderberg Group is formed

&gt;   * 1957: EEC is formed under 'The Treaties of Rome'

&gt;   * 1973: Trilateral Commission is formed

&gt;Other major players in the NWO are international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Illuminati and NATO. At present there are three major economic areas in the world: Europe, North America and the 'Pacific Rim' nations (Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan etc.). An objective of the Trilateral Commission is to harmonize these three regions. In turn, each region is being harmonized by merging nations into a superstate. This process is virtually complete in Europe and economic union is being pursued in the Americas. Who will lead this World Government? Prophecy points to ten world leaders and a world dictator associated with the fourth beast of Dan 7. This beast is strongly linked to Rome, suggesting that world leadership comes from **Europe**, ***not*** **America**.

&gt;**World government is clearly happening**. Outwardly it may seem to be beneficial, but according to prophecy it will exercise the control, intolerance and brutality of ancient Rome. Other events that characterise the end of this age are the emergence of a world dictator, the emergence of Israel, world-wide persecution of the true church, the emergence of an apostate church, forced electronic ID of individuals, and God's judgements upon the earth.

&gt;**The good news is that you can escape God's judgements by putting your trust in Jesus Christ.**

As (s)he says v/u were interchangeable and were essentially the same letter until the 17th century. When the convention to use 'u' for the vowel and 'v' for the consonant became entrenched. Previous to that the usage had been based primarily on word position (as for s/long s) it's worth noting that English did not have the 'v' sound until the middle English period (when it emerged from Scandinavian loan words like 'viking' and 'valley'. I don't know whether Latin had the 'v' sound, but it makes sense that it wouldn't be necessary to distinguish 'v' and 'u' if they represented the same sound. 

'j' was also used as a numeral in Latin at the end of a number in place of 'i' e.g xxiii (23) could be written xiij I don't know enough about Latin spelling to be specific about how it was used in words but I would hazard a guess that there was some similar pattern at work. (As you may have guessed I've never learnt Latin.)

In terms of the English alphabet the 'j' that we know and love today is a johnny-come-lately letter. Whereas 'a', 'h', 'k' and many others can be traced back to the earliest Semitic alphabets which were formed from their hieroglyph ancestors and have pedigrees going back three millennia, (eg 'A' was the 'ox' symbol) 'j' used to represent consonant sounds /dʒ/ (the J in Jar or James and the dg in bridge or wedge') and occasionally /j/ as in 'Jung' 'Jacques' (i.e where the 'j' is pronounced like 'y')  only dates from medieval times. It was an innovation of the post-invasion Normans who were wrestling with transcribing Middle-English with their own alphabet. They made lots of changes to make this easier for them like throwing out a few old English letters like 'ash' æ and 'wyn'  þ and making 'Q' a standard replacement of 'cw' or 'kw'. These changes go along way to explaining why English spelling is so idiosyncratic compared to other European languages. When you see modern transliterations of Arabic words like qua'ran or al'Qaeda it's usually a close but not quite right approximation of the word in question, the same would have been true of the Norman-French scribes writing down the Old-English words they heard in their own alphabet. 

The relative recentness of 'j' is evidenced by its varying usage across languages. English uses it differently to how Latin used it and Spanish, German, Albanian, Basque etc use it different to how English uses it.

SCENIHR examined whether three lamp characteristics (flicker, electromagnetic fields,

data on CFLs, existing data on traditional fluorescent tubes were extrapolated to
situations when compact fluorescent lamps may be used.

**there is no reliable evidence that the use of fluorescent tubes was a significant
contributor**. Of all compact fluorescent lamps properties, only UV/blue light radiation was
identified as a potential risk factor for the aggravation of the light-sensitive symptoms in
some patients with such diseases as chronic actinic dermatitis and solar urticaria.

An example of the opposite that I know of first hand is the deregulation of electricity in Maryland. Prices went up so much that there are [now calls to re-regulate](http://www.theenergydaily.com/hottopics/electricity_dereg/2132.html).

* Day n: Banks are completely deregulated.
* Day n+1: An orgy of consolidation and deal-making ensues, leaving the US with only a handful of consumer banks.
* Day n+30: That handful of banks, realizing that their customers are captive, raise rates and fees on all products and services by hundreds of percent.
* Day n+60: Filling the need for low-cost banking hundreds of fly-by-night operations open banks with no backing, taking deposits and disappearing overnight when they can't meet their obligations.

The concept of Wahhabism came prior to major imperialist action in the region (though it should be noted that it did not precede enlightened European excursions into the area), but did not gain steam until the 1970s.

Salafism, as per Wikipedia:

&gt;In modern times the word has come to have two sometimes dissimilar definitions. The first, used by academics and historians, refers to denote ""a school of thought which surfaced in the second half of the nineteenth century as a reaction to the spread of European ideas,"" and ""sought to expose the roots of modernity within Muslim civilization.""

Sounds to me like a conservative reaction to new, liberal ideas.  This isn't a phenomenon.

It should also be noted that English imperialism in the region goes all the way back to 1815.  Following World War I, America was extremely popular amongst Arabs simply because they believed that America's Western ideals of self determination were worth believing in, and that we'd exercise influence on Britain and France in order to allow for the Middle Eastern countries to control their own outcomes.  Obviously this never came to be, since as it turns out we don't always follow our own ideals when it comes to non-Western countries.

&gt;But what do you propose as a solution? We have already seen what the Arab street will do when left to it's own devices (i.e. the Taliban, Iran and the election in Algeria).

The Taliban emerged following the drawn out Soviet invasion that destabilized the region.  Iran was backlash for a US backed dictatorship, which resulted in extreme religious backlash (an example of what happens when an ulema has the real power in the region).  Algeria I'm not well informed enough about to argue.

I propose we leave countries to their own devices, perhaps suggest our own methods in terms of equality, but not by force, and allow them to move towards what we view as progressivism on their own.  Countries naturally trend towards this on their own when there is no outside interference, but nothing makes a person cling to archaic values more than an outside power telling them they are wrong for what they believe in. Social justice is an internal process.  It wasn't that long ago that America had prayer in public schools and segregation.  We didn't make these changes because an outside group told us what to do.

I'd remind you that initial US interest in the region was oil.  Then it was installing ""Democracy friendly dictators"" (always a hilarious term) when we were worried about Soviet incursion, and to an extent the wellbeing of Israel (though typically the motivation behind installing a certain leader was first and foremost being opposed to Communist powers).  Arabs have reacted negatively to being constantly invaded and interfered with for almost 200 years.  Wouldn't you?  Doesn't it seem logical that they'd probably stop being a threat if we didn't do that all the time?

Furthermore, why do we call Muslims the problem when they potentially pose a danger to US soil, but consider it a matter of justice and doing what is right when we intervene on foreign soil?  I'd love to do a comparison of how many civilian women died at the hands of the Taliban and how many died at the hands of US collateral damage in Afghanistan.

People keep forgetting just how long it took us to get to where we are as a culture.  We didn't do it by having an outside power tell us what to do.  We changed internally with a lot of kicking and screaming along the way, and we're still doing it.  America fought it's bloodiest war over whether or not it's acceptable to keep other human beings as property.  What makes you think that other social justice issues will come so quickly in the Middle East, with or without religion involved?  Wasn't the mainstream Civil Rights movement based largely in black churches?  Why can't it be the same way for Islam?  Progressive ideas don't just spring from nowhere.  It's an ongoing process.  After all, you may have just forgotten about it or not considered it, but you neglected to include sexual identity in your list of necessary equalities.  Maybe you think that it fits in with sexual identity or gender, but transgendered individuals certainly think their problems are unique.  We've not yet reached the pinnacle of equality, because once again it is a process.  Why is it not a process for them?  We can encourage change, but why do we need to force their hand?

I also happen to think that spending all our time pointing our fingers at how awful Muslims are detracts from race, gender, and sexuality based issues in our own country, but that's another issue entirely.",False

Lovelace, however, proves himself to be an untrustworthy rake whose vague promises of marriage are accompanied by unwelcome and increasingly brutal sexual advances. And yet, Clarissa finds his charm alluring, her scrupulous sense of virtue tinged with unconfessed desire. Told through a complex series of interweaving letters, ""Clarissa"" is a richly ambiguous study of a fatally attracted couple and a work of astonishing power and immediacy. A huge success when it first appeared in 1747, and translated into French and German, it remains one of the greatest of all European novels.""

I was planning a 3 month backpacking trip through Europe after graduating from college. I had never even traveled outside of California up to that point. Everything was on track and ready to go. Plane flights booked, hostels reserved, everything. I checked on the status of my passport, which was due to arrive about a month before my plane trip. It still had not arrived at my house.

Another couple of weeks go by. Still no passport in the mail. I try calling the federal bureau of beaurocracy from work. Their phone lines are jammed. Now I'm starting to get really worried. A week before my trip, I find out that there is a website I can track the status of my passport on. It says that my expected date of arrival has been changed to a MONTH after my plane takes off due to an increase in volume of applications! (I later found out that this was due to a new law that required a passport to travel to Mexico.)

I freak the fuck out. My boss tells me to forget about it, there's no hope; so I quit my dinky job at Borders and drive to LA from Santa Barbara to go straight to the federal building itself and get answers.

I stood in line for three days straight to appeal to a human being. I kept getting denied. I was told life or death situations only. Come back with a doctor's note. Come back with an itinerary. Wrong window, go to window 7. Finally I'm told they can only help me if my plane is leaving within *24 hours.* That's cutting it pretty close.

I show up a day before my plane takes off. It's 4:30 in the morning. There's already a line 50 people long to speak to a single person at a window outside the building. I show them my itinerary, they direct me to another line to get into the building. I stand in that line for a few hours. I get into a line to take a number to wait to speak to a person at another window. 

There's an older Chinese lady who looks at me like it's my fault she's stuck in this shit job. She says she can't help me without a copy of my birth certificate. I tell her my original birth certificate is with my original application, which they have. She says she can't help me without it. I ask her why I would even be standing here if it wasn't for the fact that they botched my application? She gets really pissy, tells me not to yell at her, and I'm afraid I may have fucked myself over. I apologize profusely. I ask her to find it in her heart to help me. She says I can go to another building downtown where they produce official copies of birth certificates. It's already about 11am now, I've been waiting this long just to get to her - what hope do I have of getting back here before they close?

She writes me a note and says to show it to the security guy in the front to get back to her.

I'm a blur for the next hour. I run to my car, call my brother for directions to this building. Drive. Park. Elevator. Line. I remember the lady at the window is Jamaican. A few minutes later, I can't believe my eyes as I'm watching a copy of my birth certificate being printed out before me. Running. Driving. Park. More running. Back in line.

I tell the security guy I've got an urgent appointment with miss Le. He says to get into the ""urgent appointment line."" It's 50 feet long and not moving. I wait for twenty minutes, very little movement. I call the security guy over. I say I think I'm in the wrong place. I show him the note from miss Le, tell him she told me to go in ASAP. Holy fucking shit, it works. 

It's 3pm. Through security, past 2 more windows flashing smiles along the way hoping the people on the other side remember me. Miss Le beckons me over when she's done with her customer. She puts my application on top of the ""urgent"" stack and tells me to wait for my name.

After waiting all day in that stuffy building full of sad, desperate people, I didn't hear one name being called over the loud speakers. I felt like the fuckin' king of the world when they called my name to the window where they hand me my brand new passport.

I vividly remember walking back to my car with my passport in hand, not believing that I got it. I sat in my car and started laughing out loud. It wasn't until then that I could actually see myself in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Istanbul... I thought that fate had screwed me over, and I could have accepted it, but through a combination of perseverance, charm, luck, whatever, I pulled through. I'm pretty sure that's the happiest I've ever felt in my life.

I still can't think of that moment without getting choked up and laughing out loud.

Look at all these stories in this thread about racist juries coming down on minorities.  Civil systems are aware of the potential problems and have built in checks, just as our common law system has done with juries.

It's another system, not necessarily better or worse, but people who think there isn't an alternative, or at least a fair alternative, to juries just don't know about other legal systems.  It would be good to learn about the alternatives before commenting on them, because civil law countries (most of Europe) are not cesspools of crime and corruption.  Quite the opposite, in fact.

One problem when Americans discuss jury trials (I am American) is, on top of this ignorance of other systems, the sort of mythic quality juries are given in our society.  They're constantly elevated as this ultimate foundation of justice and democracy, almost a holy institution, but as a law student who has worked in many courts I can tell you this is far, far from the truth.  Not that non-jury systems are therefore better, I just think people need to keep in mind that juries are just one possible mechanism rather than some kind of divine institution.

EDIT: I wanted to give an example about juries.  A few weeks ago a friend had a final in his Trial Advocacy class, where he and a partner had to go against another student team in a fake trial conducted as a real one, in a real court with a real judge and a real jury.  What was interesting was that, as this wasn't a real trial, we got to watch the jury deliberate.  Even the judge said this was a new experience to her because of course she never gets to see it.  The jurors clearly didn't fully understand the laws, or the various requirements given to them about distinguishing between first and second degree murder.  They got facts wrong, and argued things completely irrelevant to the trial.  It was interesting, but a little disheartening.  In our system where we believe that it's better for [X] guilty men to go free than one innocent man to be punished, I suppose this is a good thing as it makes the prosecution's burden that much higher, but if real juries are like this behind their closed doors...it's a little frightening.",False

He can turn a good phrase and present that famed starched British elegance to the world, but cannot really hide his anti-Euro fanaticism. To wit, he has Godwinned the Europarliament multiple times, comparing acts of legislation to the Ermächtigungsgesetz, for example. For further reference he went on Glenn Beck's show and told him he wished Britain had its own Glenn Beck (Goddess help them if that should ever happen) as well as essentially agreeing with most of Beck's asinine assertions about the coming new world order and long march of socialism, etc. etc.

Some of his criticisms of Gordon Brown are correct but to praise him for this is like calling someone who hits the broad side of a barn with a beachball an expert marksman. Brown is the captain of a sinking ship and an incredibly easy target. One does not get very many points for biting, accurate criticism of him. Hannan isn't exactly alone in pillorying the Prime Minister. Mocking Gordon Brown has become something of a national past time in the UK. Everyone, across the spectrum, hates him, and Labour never seemed too keen to say they're *proud* of him.

Of more concern is the fact that Hannan, short of vaguely nationalist statements, has never really illustrated how the European Union can better operate within its mandate. It's patently obvious he hates the institution, and moreover he even hates the values of his own country. He's out of step with the crushing majority of the British people on the NHS, to name just one example.

For him, the optimal solution is to dissolve the EU. To achieve this goal he routinely scaremongers about 'loss of sovereignty' and the 'Euro superstate', yet never really is able to illustrate how the EU plans to be *more* intrusive than the sovereign British state is at present- a condition the Tories will not reverse come the next election, I assure you. He does not explain how freedoms are being taken away, other than to occasionally quote some of the more superfluous and useless votes the EU has taken on fluff issues.

In short, he never explicates how the EU is anything worse than a slightly more efficacious UN.

Her father was not an alcoholic, but he was emotionally cold and demanding beyond limit. She had a friend, a slow, simple country boy with a pumpkin-like head. He was always there for her, loyal like a dog, handy like a box of tissues. He would patiently step out of the way while she slept with another men, only to rush in when she craved an act of kindness or needed to take out her anger on something, until she decided he was the best and kindest man and let him into her bed.

Only now her friends were too intimidating for him, so she started seeing them less. Europe was out of the question, as he didn't speak any foreign languages and that made him uncomfortable. So, she found herself queuing with teenagers for trash metal gigs in school gyms and carrying his drunk friends home from bars. She picked up his accent and lost a great deal of her vocabulary; eventually, she dropped medicine for agronomy, which she hated. She wasn't happy. But he was so NICE, so she stayed.

But, she started blaming him for her unhappiness. She became cruel towards him. She would ridicule him in public or flirt behind his back. Then she would feel guilt and run back to him, gentle and sweet for the evening.

The last time I met her for coffee, her eyes were dull and she had nothing to talk about. I wasn't even jealous. The girl I once loved was gone. She was never bitter and cynical. She would have been happy for me if it was her I told I traveled through Europe.

I'm genuinely interested in your point of view, not least of all because it seems you're willing to lay it out intelligently and nicely. That was a long post — thanks! It means a lot to get a real look at ""the view from the outside"".

&gt; Drums are the least lyrical instrument, so it makes the least sense for them to solo for any more than a few beats. […] A two minute solo is usually not. After a certain point, it just breaks down into something ""other"" than the song.  I don't think the guitar, piano, sax, bass guitar, etc, etc have the same limitation.

Ouch.

I would say that most &gt; 2 minute guitar solos also end up ""something other than the song"", in the sense that the tune or ostinato is lost and/or mangled. I've had plenty of time to listen, too — those jerks have to be comped! Then again, the freedom of it is part of what makes it so interesting c.f. The (Greatful) Dead.

I think generally what you're looking at, and generally why i'd continue to encourage you to spend a couple weeks filling your ears with drum music, especially from other cultures, is that whereas your sense that drums are less ""lyrical"" than other instruments can really only be defended in terms of pitch variation and many-pitched polyphony. If you aren't sensitive to ""rhythmic lyricism"", you're really missing out!

Obviously, the pitch range, in the sense of the number of unique pitches that can be produced, if not the difference between lowest and highest, of any decent guitar is many times that of a standard drum kit. That being said, the most gifted guitarist or even pianist can in no way reach the kind of rhythmic depth and layering that a half-decent drummer can, or in many cases the independence of parts (e.g. [a samba](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb54uNm2qDU)). This is probably partly why drummers are often called upon to play so simply, and why quick prog rock guitar riffs tend to follow a number of relatively limited rhythmic patterns when the drummers are aloud to break out. Anything else would bury the rest of the parts. It probably also explains why drumming seems ""flat"" in comparison to the other parts to a listener accustomed to listening to, e.g., rock music on rock music's current terms.

There is also something to be said here about the development of western music: not all cultures got around to producing precision instruments like violins, clarinets, and guitars (many-stringed chordophones) as quickly as the Europeans. In many cases those musics don't lack anything in variation or ""lyricism"". In many cases that variation was achieved by percussive means, e.g. by employing mallet instruments, which were far easier to play many pitches on quickly than massive rows of tuned tom-toms (which, coincidentally, thanks to modern rack and mounting systems, have become a possibility for modern musicians).

&gt; But for all their popularity and influence, they can hardly be compared to Berry or Hendrix/etc and the way that they completely changed the sound of their instrument.

I will let you know now that from the point of view of this trained percussionist, this couldn't be further from the truth, in the sense that the greats generally have effected massive changes in what is ""standard"" in the popular drumming world. Kits from the old days are so completely different, and the way we play them — techniques, approaches, etc. — have also widely developed in the past 50 years alone.

&gt; If every drummer played like Buddy Rich, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Buddy Rich, by the way, is universally considered as an icon, but not everyone would agree with the above. I personally think it would have behooved him to ""leave a few more spaces"". Then again, he was top billing.

&gt; Like contemporary painters who are scared to death of painting anything realistic because they'll never compare to Rembrant. So they add more cymbals.

Everybody likes to buy cool shiny stuff, especially when you're touring with a drum tech who does all the lifting.

The situation is not nearly as simple as you see it. Sure, there is plenty of pressure from the Sabians and Paistes of the world to build yourself a small fallout shelter of hand-hammered special edition effect cymbals, but the truth is that cymbals do differ in sound, and developed ears can readily hear the difference. Here's an example I dug up in a few minutes:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmc8cXuwMy4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmc8cXuwMy4)

It's a Rush tribute, because someone mentioned Neil Peart, and i could quibble with a few bits, but the videos is HD and all the cymbals are visible. Numbering the cymbals at the top from left to right, we have (1) what i think is a flat-ish flanged china, (2) a medium-ish crash, (3) a medium splash, (4) a small-ish crash, (5) a ride, (6) a small splash, (7) a crash, which seems to me is larger than (2), and (8) a flat-edged china. I didn't watch the whole video from start to finish, but i saw and heard him hit everything but (3). Sometimes players put cymbals (especially crashes) where they perhaps could do without for convenience's sake, but in this case I would feel comfortable taking everything this guy has set up with me for a gig covering Limelight.

&gt; It's mostly that drummers (like upright bass players) need to be more generous than a typical guitarist.

I can't help myself: MINGUS!

&gt; I think your point about ""dynamics control"" is the most important. Where has that gone?

[There's a guy for that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_board).

To be honest, I'm not against it. Crazy stuff is possible in the studio. My personal belief is that musicians should play like there will never be a studio. If you need it, it is a crutch. If you don't, it is another chance to get someone brilliant working on your sound.",False

Well that's easy, you know exactly what he'd say.

&gt; Obama's escalation in Afghanistan is the last in a string of disappointments. His flip-flopping acceptance of the military coup in Honduras has squandered the trust of Latin America. His Wall Street bailout leaves the poor, the unemployed, minorities, and college students on their own. And now comes the Afghanistan-Pakistan decision to escalate the stalemate, which risks his domestic agenda, his Democratic base, and possibly even his presidency.

* Obama said he would escalate the war in Afghanistan during his campaign. That is what you voted for in 2008. 

* As I remember, nobody seemed mad at all about the bailouts when they happened. Most of the left was all for them and the right was against them. Funny how different it is just a year later, eh?

* The Democratic base will vote for Obama in 2012 no matter what he does. This is because the other choice is the Republican candidate. A vote against the Republican is as good as a vote for the Democrat. 

* I don't know enough about the Honduran coup to comment on it, but I have to say, support for Obama in his own country seems much more important than support for Obama in Latin America.  

Obama has done pretty much what he said he would do during his campaign (although there are a few exceptions). You can't just assume the Democratic candidate is anti-war. This is not always so. You have to think critically before you vote and make sure you are voting for the candidate who you actually agree with. You can't really vote someone into office and then complain that they are doing what they promised you they would do during the campaign. 

As for the peace prize, I have no idea why it was given to Obama. I lost a lot of respect for the peace prize and the Nobel Institute that day.

If we accept that humans will most likely not devolve in intelligence (and don't go extinct), the first rise of civilization proves that there is a certain probability that civilization will arise again (after all, once an area becomes overly populated, as some place eventually would, it becomes highly advantageous to cooperate and form larger groups), making it virtually inevitable.  Writing would certainly arise again (if we don't lose it--but with writing, lengthy discourse and thus, eventually, science arise, and with science naturally implements would be invented to make man master of the land).  Anyways, if you suggest a return to wandering hunter-gatherer, people will still always tend towards the desire to better their lives--to be warmer, safer, to raise more children to adulthood--which inevitably points us towards domesticating plants and animals, leading to where we were before.

Conversely, some argue that the elimination of major (or all) beasts of burden, in particular the horse and the ox, would prevent the rise of much of civilization (after all, the best that North and South America had before the arrival of the Europeans was the llama).  Perhaps that is also true, but I am not entirely certain--perhaps it is enough to settle into stable villages and towns.

I would also posit, just for the sake of it, that you could view humans as the sort of scions of the Earth, as its first beings capable of complex inventions and the development of civilization.  Perhaps this is the point of the universe, and we should respect the Earth as our home but we should not deny our ability to reach outwards.

I posted this in my personal blog
*******Warning its HELLA long********

So I was reading reddit today (reddit is a new forum/news aggregate website filled with smart people) and well emotions are complicated thing. I was reading through a thread called ""What was the single most memorable event in your life thus far."" I read a few things people wrote and a lot of the things people go through it really made me think of the humanity that even the strongest people (or seemingly strongest) people can have. Like a story how a strong/smart man was going through life having absolutely no control over his happiness commit suicide. Or a small girl getting raped. This one especially touched me was a story about a guy/girl chose to become a doctor because his mom was about to have a stroke.

Obviously I had my own contributions to the thread albiet a very small one because I thought of it this morning when I just skimmed through it. ""Attending the Burning Man festival by far."" Tonight, after reading all the entries people have I didn't really say why attending the festival left such a big impact for me. One of the entries in the thread described a guy's backpacking trip through Europe and how seeing and meeting so many amazing people that it transitioned him from being a boy to a man. Then it hit me, I made a similar transition at burning man! It seems like I was just running around in confusion trying to get there but going to burning man solo, alone and meeting all the amazing people that I did metaphorically transitioned myself from being a boy to a man. I no longer cared about trivial things such as girls, games or wasting my life doing trivial things. I wanted to become someone in life, be an inspiration to my kids and make my family/siblings proud. Yeesh kind of cheesy, funny how traveling can leave such a print on you. I just wish some of my friends could go through such a transition.

It wouldn't be fair if I didn't describe the thing that changed me would it? At Burning Man, there are two major events that happen: The Burning of the Man which is suppose to be one huge spectacle and The Burning of the Temple of Forgiveness. After the burning of the man, I was about to leave the playa because of the traffic however An older man that I met there who lost his wife by the name of John said that if there is anything that I should stay for is for the burning of the temple because it such a moving event.

I have to describe this temple because it is unlike anything I have ever experienced before in my life. There is a huge wooden temple that is centered at the center of the playa. This wooden temple is symbolically called the Temple of Forgiveness. Attendees of Burning Man, are welcome to write anything on the temple walls, steps and everything. At the end of the event, the temple is ""burned"" and metaphorically anything that was written on the temple walls are burned as well. Burning Man is suppose to be a very uplifting place and to have this place to exist on the playa is just incredibly... surreal. As I was walking through the temple, it was pure silence. I could hear people crying as they wrote things on the walls. I read a lot of the things that they wrote and it was some heavy shit. Loved ones dying. Tales of Rape. A Gay Guy's battle through his own sexuality. Attacks to people who have wronged them in the past. I even saw a Ph.D dissertation getting burned and the writer stating the temple as his inspiration. Being around these writings and feeling everybody's emotions it was very very moving. I'm usually a tough kind of guy that doesn't like to cry but out of no where I just started bawling and wrote my own little thank you to all the people that influenced me in my life. I sat there and wrote whatever came to mind. When I wrote everything down I just sat there for a while thinking... and got up then took a picture of a friend write down his message to his passed friend. It was very moving for the both of us so we hugged.

When it came for the actual burning of the temple. John was right, it was so incredibly powerful. As it was about to start, it went from idle chatter and more loud idle chatter to complete silence...... It was eerie, not one person spoke a word. As the temple burned, I could feel all the burdens and sorrows of everyone in the audience lift from the temple and vaporized into the atmosphere. And for me, I was with a couple that I met from England and was holding the hand of the wife. I just looked at the temple burned and breathed out a sigh. Everything just seemed content and something in my mind made me think everything was going to be alright and all the decisions I made were right.

I reflected that week on what opportunities were given me in my life. The ability to work hard, persevere, commit to a difficult tasks, my math and problem solving abilities even pondered the statistical improbability of my existence. I decided then and there that I will make something out of myself so I can create meaning. The thing I been chasing (getting girls) suddenly became meaningless now. It was then I wanted to get a Ph.D similar to the doctor that burned his dissertation. I want my dissertation to be burned when I get it as well. I made that promise here on my blog to all those who read it lol.

Ever since that week, life was never the same. My perception on everything did a complete 180. Funny how something like that can change you so much.

&gt;Before the glory that was Greece and Rome, even before the first cities of Mesopotamia or temples along the Nile, there lived in the Lower Danube Valley and the Balkan foothills people who were ahead of their time in art, technology and long-distance trade.

&gt;For 1,500 years, starting earlier than 5000 B.C., they farmed and built sizable towns, a few with as many as 2,000 dwellings. They mastered large-scale copper smelting, the new technology of the age. Their graves held an impressive array of exquisite headdresses and necklaces and, in one cemetery, the earliest major assemblage of gold artifacts to be found anywhere in the world.

&gt;At its peak, around 4500 B.C., said David W. Anthony, the exhibition’s guest curator, “Old Europe was among the most sophisticated and technologically advanced places in the world”

I'm not sure what you're getting at there. That completely dismissed what I just said. The way the economy runs in those nations is largely irrelevant. Hybrid economies are a *very* recent invention, and even then, ""hybrid"" is the wrong term to use. The reality is that the economies of the nations you're referring too merely have a well developed nationalisation of portions of industry while maintaining Capitalism's mode of production.

The reason for the hefty nationalisation, public welfare etc, is as I stated before, due to the struggles of the people against the interests of Capital. Europe is a great testament to that. 1860-1890 in most developed western nations, 1900 - 1930, 1940-1980. These brackets are where the biggest blows were struck (the exact dates depend on the country, obviously.) Capitalist society didn't hand us anything, and it didn't just decide to be a hybrid, nor did any of its parliamentary leaders make that decision of their own accord. The gains we have made were made with our own hands, resisting Capitalism's logic, and demanding what they have taken from our labour back. And even today, even in places with high quality welfare, Capital and its Parliaments still seek, rather viciously in places like Australia and the U.S. in the past 30 years, to revoke those victories.

The ""hybrid"" economies had *nothing* to do with higher standards of living for those of the working class. I would say it is more the *fear* of Capital that those national working classes would fight back if they rock the boat *too* much.

As for the trickling up schtick, that brief ""sounds like a bit of a wank"" was a stab at the fact that for a very long time now many people have toted that line about. But the fact remains that these people do not say these things out of some genuine belief that it is possible, at least not at first. These things are said because they either refuse to admit (out of class interests usually - most reformists are middle class nowadays) that people, working people, could decide their own fate, and create a better world with their own hands, or because they have vested interests in maintaining an already degenerate, brutal social order.

It is a matter of refusing people the right to fight of their own will. It is a claim that restricts this struggle to the current social order. Work within the limits of Capitalism, do not dare question *their* world.

It's subordination, its a naive at best. And most certainly, no change is possible via Parliamentarism when the parliament itself is an institution of Capital for the purpose of protecting Capitalism.

HARADHEERE, Somalia (Reuters) - In Somalia's main pirate lair of Haradheere, the sea gangs have set up a cooperative to fund their hijackings offshore, a sort of stock exchange meets criminal syndicate.

Heavily armed pirates from the lawless Horn of Africa nation have terrorized shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean and strategic Gulf of Aden, which links Europe to Asia through the Red Sea.

The gangs have made tens of millions of dollars from ransoms and a deployment by foreign navies in the area has only appeared to drive the attackers to hunt further from shore.

It is a lucrative business that has drawn financiers from the Somali diaspora and other nations -- and now the gangs in Haradheere have set up an exchange to manage their investments.

One wealthy former pirate named Mohammed took Reuters around the small facility and said it had proved to be an important way for the pirates to win support from the local community for their operations, despite the dangers involved.

""Four months ago, during the monsoon rains, we decided to set up this stock exchange. We started with 15 'maritime companies' and now we are hosting 72. Ten of them have so far been successful at hijacking,"" Mohammed said.

""The shares are open to all and everybody can take part, whether personally at sea or on land by providing cash, weapons or useful materials ... we've made piracy a community activity.""

Haradheere, 400 km (250 miles) northeast of Mogadishu, used to be a small fishing village. Now it is a bustling town where luxury 4x4 cars owned by the pirates and those who bankroll them create honking traffic jams along its pot-holed, dusty streets.

Somalia's Western-backed government of President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed is pinned down battling hard-line Islamist rebels, and controls little more than a few streets of the capital.

The administration has no influence in Haradheere -- where a senior local official said piracy paid for almost everything.

""Piracy-related business has become the main profitable economic activity in our area and as locals we depend on their output,"" said Mohamed Adam, the town's deputy security officer.

""The district gets a percentage of every ransom from ships that have been released, and that goes on public infrastructure, including our hospital and our public schools.""

RISK VS REWARDS

In a drought-ravaged country that provides almost no employment opportunities for fit young men, many are been drawn to the allure of the riches they see being earned at sea.

Abdirahman Ali was a secondary school student in Mogadishu until three months ago when his family fled the fighting there.

Given the choice of moving with his parents to Lego, their ancestral home in Middle Shabelle where strict Islamist rebels have banned most entertainment including watching sport, or joining the pirates, he opted to head for Haradheere.

Now he guards a Thai fishing boat held just offshore.

""First I decided to leave the country and migrate, but then I remembered my late colleagues who died at sea while trying to migrate to Italy,"" he told Reuters. ""So I chose this option, instead of dying in the desert or from mortars in Mogadishu.""

Haradheere's ""stock exchange"" is open 24 hours a day and serves as a bustling focal point for the town. As well as investors, sobbing wives and mothers often turn up there seeking news of male relatives missing in action.

Every week, Mohammed said, gang members and equipment were lost to the sea. But he said the pirates were not deterred.

""Ransoms have even increased in recent months from between $2-3 million to $4 million because of the increased number of shareholders and the risks,"" he said.

""Let the anti-piracy navies continue their search for us. We have no worries because our motto for the job is 'do or die'.""

Piracy investor Sahra Ibrahim, a 22-year-old divorcee, was lined up with others waiting for her cut of a ransom pay-out after one of the gangs freed a Spanish tuna fishing vessel.

""I am waiting for my share after I contributed a rocket-propelled grenade for the operation,"" she said, adding that she got the weapon from her ex-husband in alimony.

There's a clear tie between colonialism and the political turmoil in places like India, 1950s and 60s Vietnam, Africa and parts of South America.  The problems in the Middle East are related, but colonialism is a phenomenon that can be defined rather narrowly.  What has taken place in the Middle East is a bit more complicated.  We can skip, for the moment, the background from the Crusades to Napolean.  As early as World War I, Western nations have felt justified in arbitrarily redrawing the political boundaries of the Middle East, without regard to the political allegiances or divides that grew organically from events and peoples in that region.  Iraq, for example, was a creation of Western intrusion, as was Israel.  Those same nations would install and support their favored political leaders -- again, without any particular concern for the political will of the local population.  The Middle East was used as a theater of war for both WWI, WWII and the Cold War, despite the relative lack of incentive Middle Easterners had for entering those conflicts.  And with the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia, the pattern of European and American intrusion into local politics and economics only intensified.  Against the (largely unsubstantiated) threat of Communist expansion into the Middle East, we've propped up theocratic autocracies like those in Saudi Arabia, and where other such theocracies have blossomed without our aid, they've done so largely in response to our interference.

That's the general picture, but it's possible to back my claims with far more precise examples.  Though a Yemeni by birth, Osama bin Laden grew up in Saudi Arabia where his father built a business out of high profile construction contracts for the Royal House of Saud.  Bin Laden's radicalization took part largely as the result of his resentment at the influence the West maintained over Middle Eastern politics through its military protections of, and financial ties to, Saud.  He and many other Islamicist radicals cut their teeth in the Feyadeen ranks, which were trained and supported by the Americans to help keep the Soviets at bay in Afghanistan.  Al Qaeda was formed largely from the alliance of these former Feyadeen with Islamicist radicals from the Egyptian milieu.  Those radicals, al-Zawayiri among them, mostly started off as youth study groups, but were radicalized in Egyptian prisons, where they were cast by the government of Anwar Sadat, who had strong ties to the U.S.  And so on, and so forth, ad nauseam.

There's hardly been a radical political change in the last 100 years of Middle Eastern history that can't be traced back within a step or two to Euro-American interference.  All of that interference has lent a precariousness to Middle Eastern politics, and the resulting instability makes it a dangerous place to live.",False

We've known about these cultures for a long time.  While research is obviously on-going, what's new is the exhibit and in relative terms, the amount of detail that is emerging.  I also object to the statement that Old Europe predated ancient classical civilizations in that it implies an equivalence that simply isn't there.  Old Europe was advanced, but it was nowhere near as advanced or complex as were the state-level societies that arose a bit later in Mesopotamia and along the Nile and in fact, it almost certainly was no more advanced than many other contemporary civilizations in the region.  Ultimately what I'm against is the notion that there's anything particularly earth-shattering about Old Europe.  There isn't.  It fits in perfectly with what we already know and really doesn't significantly alter our understanding of the area's prehistory.  Finally, I object to the romanticization of Old Europe.  They didn't have writing so we don't actually know all that much about their social organization and definitely do not want to jump to any conclusions.  In the case of slave labor for example, it's kind of moot because Old Europe never reached the level of organization at which massive slavery becomes practical.

Iraq. From your own link: 

&gt;But even the handful of British troops -- some 150 -- who were to remain behind to train the Iraqi Navy -- has had to leave the country temporarily and are now based in Kuwait. 

They now are waiting for the Iraqi parliament to approve a new agreement that will allow them to work following the current mandate's end.

The new agreement, already signed by Iraqi and British government officials, awaits a final reading and expected passage in the Iraqi parliament in the coming weeks.

There are no British troops left in Iraq, which I've already stated I wouldn't even try to defend as I was against it all along. You really need to keep up... I've clearly shown that Iran does everything you've said the UK does and you've shown fuck all to the contrary.

The Iranian government is the among the biggest bunch of cunts on the planet and I've lost interest trying to argue otherwise because clearly you're too stupid to see any sense or make a rational arguement. So go on living in your dreamworld with all your hate and bullshit and I'll go on my merry way knowing that I'm not a stupid, hateful, vengeful cunt like you are and much happier for it. It's been a real eye-opener into the mind of a person with no morals whatsoever, so thanks for that.

This contains no arguments. It's just nothing. Well, there's also a bunch of logical fallacies, but that amounts to nothing.

A lot of Americans really didn't associate the historical origin of the term and how it was being used then.

Today, that is no longer the case.  It was in the 50s.  The name was not deliberately chosen to be offensive or to bring up the conflict between Christianity and Islam.

If it's too long for you and you're *genuinely* interested, [this](http://www.beliefnet.com/resourcelib/docs/53/Letter_from_Thomas_Jefferson_to_John_Adams_1.html) is what Thomas Jefferson wrote about the same problem with fundamentalist Protestantism (in his time, this most often came in the form of Calvinism). Orthodox Christianity (Eastern Church) has rarely ever believed in the superhuman-demon archetype that arose in the West.

**Edit:** Also, the Eastern Church never led a Crusade; it had good relations with the Jews with only minor exceptions (and anti-Semitism was always condemned) and also maintained a peaceful coexistence with Muslims and *continues* to do so. One excellent example is Turkey, where the Turks invaded and killed many of the Christians, fleeing to Europe. Although Turkey is something like 98% Muslim, the Orthodox Christians are perfectly happy to exist alongside their Muslim brethren even in a place that was traditionally the center of the Eastern Church (Constantinople).

It is a book written by God, after all so you would think that in the western marketplace of ideas it would do well. So why isn't Quran doing well on the western reading list?

first, I think the tendency of a book to be accepted in the western ""marketplace of ideas"" is hardly an indication of its greatness. What is ""popular"" is often not the most deserving of being popular, even among western works. Foucault might  be the most overrated and undeserving of his popularity. Second, even when a book is popular, it is often misunderstood anyway - people are more influenced by the idea they think the book portrays than the book itself. Consider that people assume Adam Smith's wealth of nations outlines unregulated free markets and Hobbes' Leviathan prescribes tyranny - of course, both assumptions are laughably incorrect. Third, there are many glaring absences from the western marketplace of ideas, like the Tao Te Ching, Baghavad Gita, the writings of Confucius that all have tremendous wisdom and deserve to be studied. Their absence from western marketplaces of ideas should not discredit their greatness. 



That being said, early translations of the Quran were meant to discredit Islam. Consider the first latin one was titled, ""Law of the pseudo-prophet and the second was entitled ""Refutation of the Quran"" [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an_translations#History) - further translations into other european languages were often based off of those. Then there were several centuries of oriental scholarship especially in French and German also dedicated to discrediting Islam. It's fair to say that Muslims did not speak up for their own religion in the western world until recently, less than 100 years ago. Even still, the loudest voices speaking in the name of Islam are people dedicated to smearing Islam. Robert Spencer's books are decidedly anti-intellectual and frankly they are quite stupid, yet they sell dramatically more copies than any intelligent work either for or against islam. The majority of western society is Christian and they tend to be more interested in what supports Christianity (refutations of other religions) than what does not. I think with time you'll see that the more Muslims are given an opportunity to speak on behalf of their own religion, the more the positive aspects of Islam will be highlighted in the public eye. Note the main historical example we have of a prominent Muslim preacher in the Christian west is Malcolm X in America - through him and W.D., *hundreds of thousands* of people converted to Islam. 

Also, to be fair,, I think the Quran is doing better on the western reading list than you'd think. I meet converts all the time and meet a new convert at least once a month it seems like. Still, I've met people that have read the Quran and admired it without becoming Muslim. Thomas Jefferson was especially known for studying the Quran - he even tried teaching himself arabic in his lifetime - although he is a rare exception because he was incredibly well learned and was interested in the origins of natural law - he studied all the foreign law he could. Even the OP of this thread wrote ""I have come to respect, admire and revere in how the Qur'an and what it is about."" I've never particularly cared what compliments non-muslims have paid to Islam and Mohammad so that I don't really care about these kinds of quotes that I've read in the past, but I thought you might enjoy reading these as they might demonstrate to you that within the marketplace of ideas, some have responded favorably to Islam:

The US dollar is highly inflated above the true value it represents - world reserve currency status is part of it, post-WWII faux-productivity momentum, but also due to moving to knowledge-service with no major or leading edge manufacturing - a low productivity and low scalability choice with dismal long term potential: it looks very good to a short-term quarter view but that's really the problem.  

US economy as knowledge/service makes the US economy highly inefficient in absolute terms - most productivity came not from work performed but leveraged technology productivity changes and scaling.  The value is owning and creating the technology that provides that leverage more than the people exploiting it.  That's no longer the US in most cases of leading edge technologies (part of why I live in Taiwan now).

The above are painfully illustrated by traveling outside the US and seeing the exact same products made in a 3rd country selling for far less (2x-10x higher in US) compared to the 2nd country.  Cost of Goods are the same for both cases so it's entirely GS&amp;A costs that are tacked on that explain the differences in price.

Specifically, someone who says our commitment to education should be bottomless, like our commitment to national defense.


Dumb thing #1:
He starts by saying that defense spending is mandatory and more important than education.  After all, what sense is having a good education system if you can't defend your country.


Well Glenn, what sense is protecting a nation full of uneducated idiots.  And we don't need to hand the military a bottomless coffer for them to effectively protect us.


Dumb Thing #2: 
He goes on to complain that education spending has quadrupled since the 1950's, and that our test scores have gone down (in relation to other countries) in that time, and not up.  


My first thought was inflation.  Were these numbers accounting for it?  Well, it's kind of hard to tell, because they weren't cited.  There was nothing saying where he got his ""we spend 4 times as much"" statistic from.  (he goes on to say that ""**some**"" people say education spending has increased much more, he fails to mention who).


Additionally, he failed to take into consideration the fact that kids in schools today need more than books and abacuses.  Calculators, projectors, computers, more expensive scientific lab equipment, more sports safety equipment, etc.  These all contribute to rising education costs.


And he fails to account for the education systems in other countries.  Perhaps it's not that we've gotten so much worse, but that they've gotten markedly better since the 50's.  (Wasn't Europe in ruins from WW2? Wouldn't we expect their education system to suffer?)


Dumb thing #3:
He goes on to blame the high cost of schools on politicians and lobbyists who ""stick their fingers in"" to our kids education.

You know, as opposed to national defense, which politicians/lobbyists don't muck with.


There were several others on the page that were off.  There was an unfair comparison between the spending of two school districts (rural and urban).  But I can't really remember.  And I can't look them up, because I refused to buy the book.


And the whole book seemed to be written to the lowest common denominator.  There were lots of crudely drawn diagrams that were nice to look at, and the writing was very easily accessible for someone who was easily distracted.  No dense text.  No professional-looking charts/tables, a dearth of citations.

1) Allies: A good point of reference would be Iraq and Afghanistan. Allies who supported the US there will probably do the same against China. NATO is kind of unpredictable. After the cold war many member countries view it as outdated, or an American security blanket. In theory they would all support the US. India would almost certainly ally with the US, as it views China as a dangerous competitor for power in the East. Taiwan would immediately side with the US for protection. China would probably pressure North Korea to launch a preemptive strike on South Korea (ally of US, obviously). 

2)  EU and Russia would probably too wary to take directly takes sides, but Russia would certainly aid and support China, while the EU did the same for the USA. It would depend on how the war is going for China, but I'm sure Russia would love to get some of their former soviet territories back.

3) Other smaller nations will certainly be rooting for one side or the other, but won't take risks until its clear who will come out on top. Nations like Iran would love to side with China, but would probably be too afraid of getting steam rolled by US forces launching from Iraq.

The outcome... Most likely, America would win due to technological superiority, and its experience in several recent wars. The Chinese economy is dependent on the US and would nearly collapse at the outbreak of war. US business would simply find cheap labor elsewhere, also a great way for the US to wipe out tons of debt. The most important is logistics. Amateurs talk strategy, pros talk logistics. America has bases everywhere.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news.""

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

""If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer.""

""Heavens! what a virulent attack!"" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

""First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest,"" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.

""Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?"" said Anna Pavlovna. ""You are staying the whole evening, I hope?""

""And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,"" said the prince. ""My daughter is coming for me to take me there.""

""I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.""

""If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,"" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.

""Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know everything.""

""What can one say about it?"" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. ""What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.""

Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.

In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:

""Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!""

She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.

""I think,"" said the prince with a smile, ""that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?""

""In a moment. A propos,"" she added, becoming calm again, ""I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?""

""I shall be delighted to meet them,"" said the prince. ""But tell me,"" he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, ""is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.""

Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the baron.

Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.

""Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,"" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.",False

I don't think you'll get anywhere by attacking anyone else's beliefs, many Christians (and religious people more generally, but esp. American Christians today) thrive on a persecution complex.  It certainly drives Fox News and talk radio quite successfully.  (For instance, it's about time to roll out the annual War-on-Christmas outrage, isn't it?)

I think you will be most persuasive if you simply speak from your own feelings, and then follow that with reasons.  You want to respond to these emails because the are 1) offensive and 2) wrong, correct?  So lead with ""I'm replying to all because I am very offended by this email, which I find quite frankly pretty ignorant and hateful.""   

And then continue by calmly (bland language is actually your friend in this) explaining why you are offended and what you find incorrect.  Try to do all of this without attacking Christianity or the Christian faith, because that will put your relatives on the defensive emotionally.  In fact, cite Christian principles as the basis for why you are offended if you wish.

When they are on the defensive emotionally, people are not open to persuasion, and they view you as an adversary not an ally.  With contemporary American Christianity, they are also on comfortable, familiar ground.  Being on the defensive changes the whole conversation (as your uncle did) to disowning the hate so obvious in the original email because it's not how ""they personally really feel.""  

(I would reply to your uncle: ""if you find hate so despicable, why have you not spoken up about this email as well?  Surely it also offends you since you clearly espouse Christian love for all people, including poor European Muslims?  Will you help me speak up within our family against this mindless kind of hate and dismissal of fellow human beings?""  You know, just take him at his word and hold him to it.)

============

I'm not sure if a minaret really has to do anything with freedom of religion. Mosques yes. Praying yes. But minarets? There are islamic countries that don't have minarets. And even if there wasn't a ban, then they still coiuldn't construct many minarets as we have pretty strict laws regarding construction. They would have a hard time findind places where it would be okey to build a minaret. But the important thing here, not for me but for the Swiss people, is, that many people seem to fear Islam in general, Minarets in particular. If they starte building them it won't get any better - it'll become worse. There needs to be a dialog and better integration. Many people don't know how the moslems live, what they think and if they are bad (which they are certainly not). That's because many moslems don't integrate. Yeah, that's an immigration priblem, but you got to solve that one first before you build minarets. You cannot scare half of the population and hope that they will just shupt up and tolerate islam. This will become very dangerous and probably end in lots of hate and fear and even violence.

Eventough that was not the reason I originally voted for the ban, I now think that with all that fear there is and the islamophobs, it's important to solve that first before building any more visible and obvious symbols of islam. Ignorant, scared &amp; hating people can become dangerous if there are enough of them. Ignoring their fears that obviously exist in the Swiss population (and many other european countries) would be the wrong thing to do.

============

So basically you're right, it's probably discriminating against one single religious group, it's not really about the minarets and not really a good thing to do BUT it is probably for the better as this particular vote and it's outcome have shown very clearly that there is a HUGE amount of fear and resentment among Swiss people (57% is a mindblowing high number if you think about it) and it would most certainly lead to lots of hate and violence if any more symbolsof islam were to be uilt right now. I'm not an agressive person and I don't have anything against moslems and would never harm nobody, but unfortunately there are still many idiots on this world and those idiots could become a real problem for moslemes in Switzerlans / Europe (The whole Islam-problem-thing is not only in Switzerland; many European countries struggle with the same problems. No minarets banned there though, but just wait a few months. They are planning to do the same thing in a few other countries...).  I think it VERY important not to ignore those fears and not to ignore the fact that still many moslems don't integrate or only intergate very little. This vote has shown clearly how critical the situation right now is and it should be everyones priority to fix the immigration problem right now. Before it starts to escalate. 

After the immigration problem has been fixed just make sure that muezzins won't make (much) noise and then away with the ban. But right now the ban is needed so it doesn't get worse. (And there doens't need to be a ban on churches or synagoges or whatever - no immigration problem there. It's mostly only with Islam (and gypsis, but we barely have any of those here...)

The graphics couldn't be better (for a competitive FPS) and the engine itself is a solid masterpiece. I never did understand why anyone would want to make another FPS for competition. If mainstream-sports had such balance and maturity they sure as hell wouldn't ""improve"" them would they?

I still find something mesmerizing about skillfully executed Q3 moves. Watching the top 2-3 players in the world competing was awe inspiring and really struck me as an artform. There is no feeling like when your autonomous nervous system kicks in and you feel as if you are watching yourself from the outside doing super human things. If only I had the 8 hours a day needed to keep in shape I would still be playing.

Quitting wasn't hard at all since it is a strain, physically and mentally, to be a competitive player. Mind you, I wasn't one of the top players when it came to skill and practice, I couldn't touch the best 1v1 players in skill. But I was in the first team for one of the best European CTF-clans and fought against, and alongside, some of the most gifted players around (some of who turned pro or semi-pro).  When you started to slow down and take things a bit less seriously you felt there was something missing, so quitting was natural - I guess it's the same with sports in general (or music or whatever).

Now what I value most about Quake 3 is that the skills I took from it keep with me to this day. Although each FPS is different (most of which suck) my aim and reflexes are quite good still. I have had situations were people who were not competitive Q3 players have challenged me to matches. Some knew who I was and some didn't I love the feeling of royally kicking people's ass with a vengeance, especially if they think they are any good.

The keyboard is going to be a matter of personal preference.  I have thick enough fingers that playing guitar takes extra practice to keep them from being a problem.  That said, After a couple of weeks, I'm very comfortable with the Droid keyboard.  I have an  LG V and a Voyager.  They both have much easier to use keyboards, with much more unorthodox layouts.  I find the little bulges of the Droid keys give me plenty of feedback, and I'm having no trouble getting up to speed.  I found that using a hard case with the Droid made the keyboard seem a lot worse than it is.  Once I stopped using it, I had much better access to the top row of keys.  

The camera got a whole lot better when the datestamp bug stopped screwing with the focus.  I think they have a lot of work to do, but the camera is not horrible.  If you turn the quality down to 3 megapixels, it speeds up a lot, so there's plenty of wiggle room until they get the software just right.  

I haven't had any stuttering problems, so I can't speak to that.  I find things here and there that I downloaded that fail from time to time, but that's not the phone's fault.  I think the android app situation is good and only going to get much, much better. 

The hardware supports multitouch.  I have a photo editor, PicSay that uses pinch zoom.  Other apps make use of it.  It's probably just a matter of time until the browser takes advantage of it.  I heard somewhere that the browser on another Android phone already does.  (European Droid maybe?)  

I do think most of the things you mentioned will be worked out in updates.  The keyboard is a personal preference, but you might want to drop by a Verizon store and see for yourself.  I am very happy with my decision.  ",False

Bad reporting about the Northwest Passage issue.

There is nothing that that spreads faster than a global warming scare story even when it is false. I’ve investigated several of the bogus claims here over the last year or so. Those can be found here, here, here, here and here. Now for the newest story. The famed Northwest Passage is now open, supposedly for the first time, so that a ship can actually make the journey.

The BBC dramatically reported on September 14 that: “The most direct shipping route from Europe to Asia is fully clear of ice for the first time since records began.” They are a bit dicey about when those records began or what records they are referring to. In fact it is satellite records of the passage that were started in 1978. So they mean for the first time since 1978. They leave out the date for the start of the records. Note: The report now mentions 1978, if it was there when I read it two days ago I didn't see it. However, many, many other reports have left the date out.

The first time!!!! Really? How can they say that? They actually reported on September 10, 2000 that: “A Canadian police patrol boat has completed a voyage through the fabled Northwest Passage without encountering any pack ice.”

How many “first times” are there at the BBC? Is this the environmental equivalent being a virgin, again?

National Geographic reports the Passage “is ice free for the first time since satellite records began in 1978”. Alas, the 2000 report from the BBC reports a previous first time. But at least National Geographic mentioned that the records in question only began in 1978, unlike the BBC which carefully excluded that key fact.

Slashdot announced “Impassable Northwest Passage Opens For First Time in History”. Canada.com referred to the Passage as the “historically impassable maritime shortcut”. Associated Press reported that the ice melt is “raising the possibility that the Northwest Passage that eluded famous explorers will become an open shipping lane.” Saying it eluded them is pretty clear. No one has ever been through the Northwest Passage because of heavy ice.

The Melbourne Herald-Sun called the Passage “the dreamed of yet historically impassable maritime shortcut...” The environmental site Environmental Graffiti reports that “Explorers have searched for it for centuries and failed.” The it being the Northwest Passage. But they report that now it has been discovered thanks to “our malignant little friend: global warming.” The New York Post has also told the world that until now, the Northwest Passage has “eluded explorers”. And Scientific American has called this a “historically impassable route”.

You get the drift. The world’s media is saying variations on the same theme. Google news shows almost 1,300 outlets reporting this story. The basic claim is that the Passage is passable today and this is the first time in recorded history. Some mention that the recorded history is since 1978, while others make it sound like this is the first since human history began, a much longer period and a far more dramatic claim. Either claim is false. As noted the BBC reported the exact same story in 2000.

We should also look at the claim that the ice has always been so thick that the Northwest Passage has been “historically impassable”. Most attempts by explorers to find this passage happened during the Little Ice Age. I would think they would have had great difficulty making it through the Passage under ice age conditions. But are they saying that after the Little Ice Age ended that no one has made it through the Passage? They seem to be.

The problem is that ships have sailed through the Northwest Passage before today and long before a police patrol did it in 2000. It has happened several times. The historically impassable route has been passed through numerous times for over a century now.

Here is a photo of the St. Roch. It’s a wooden ship, not some massive, metallic icebreaker. According to the Vancouver Maritime Museum web site, this 104 foot wooden ship sailed through the Northwest Passage from 1940 to 1942, that was from west to east. In 1944 it did it again from from east to west. King George VI awarded Captain Henry Larsen, and the crew, the Polar Medal for making the 1944 voyage.

The Maritime Museum also includes a little information about the Northwest Passage as well. And they specifically mention that the famed Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen “became the first person to sail the entire Passage from east to west” and that was in 1906.

Remember that police patrol boat that went through the Passage on the other “first” time in 2000? It was actually named the St. Roch II. It sailed the same route as the first St. Roch as a fund raiser to help preserve the original ship. They were re-enacting the previous voyage from 60 years earlier.",False

The many forces interacting creat all the events of the world, certain things could be done to help certain things happen - sacrifice being the most commonly talked about of course and most likely the lest practiced form of nature worship - ritualistic planting behavior, complex fertility practices and narcotic experimentation were of course the more common 'religious' experiences within the pagan world.  In todays world we plant crops in very ritualistic ways, perform complex 'alchemical magic' for both the fertility of ourselves and the soil and then in our free time we engage in narcotic or televisual stimulation.

We can't even say that we as a secular portion of society don't still rely on the pagan religious myths today; 'love' describes a concept we can't easily express as does 'anger' and 'fate'.  To some degree we're still anthropomorphizing geopolitical events such as 'war' using the same kind of dialog Homer might have, most of the pagan systems in pre-christian europe (upto approx 500ad ish) are simple attempts to understand complex events or to observe important natural events i.e. the winter solstice.

(Issue of March 3, 2007)

I wouldn't say that I hold exclusively anti-American sentiment. After all, the plurality of English-language natives are American, so much of the television that I watch is generated Stateside. It is understandable, however, that far, far older cultures view countries like yours and mine through a particular lens, and their view is not wholly unjustified. The contrast is sharp, and the focus is very different.

It's like you taking issue over someone choosing to be called Nick, or Mike, or Sam, rather than their full name.  Don't be an asshole, call people what they want to be called.  What difference should make to you, it's not your label.  Should we apologize to you for the inconvenience of having to take the time/trouble/. . . whatever your issue is . . . with saying African-American.  Get over yourself.  It's not your call. 

That said, I personally, prefer to be called Black.  Any time I hear a friend, politician, teacher, . . . say ""African-American"" it seems like they are only saying because they feel like they need to be politically correct.  And in general, I feel more connected to my race than my ethnicity.  Those ties were abruptly severed a long time ago.  To me (that is to me as an individual, not ""to me"" as a representative of the Black/AA race/ethnicity) . . .

I don't know much about being African in America. ***

&gt; European men are confused


Please realize that the effeminate style is mostly a subculture consisting of a minority of the population. Overall however, I think Europeans do indeed care more about fahsion and looking good in general than Americans.




&gt; The dense population and strong culture


City population density is pretty much equal everywhere, and Amsterdam, our capital, has less than one million inhabitants. With strong culture, I think you could better describe it as strong cultural differences with America. As when traveling in California some months ago, I found a lot of culture as well. Culture's is just a set of values you share with the people around you. Every group has it, you just don't see your own because you've gotten used to it. Europe has a longer cultural history but I don't think that has too much to do with dressing well.




&gt; they straighten their hair and they just look ridiculous

Can't help people who try but don't succeed. Dressing well doesn't mean that you should stand out. You should just be dressed *well*. The right fit, good quality material and colors that don't contrast in a bad way, that's pretty much all there is to it. Ofcourse, if you belong to a certain subculture, you can dress like that subculture because you want to be associated with it. For example, I associate Radcliffe's clothing with young partygoers into techno or rock, using drugs and getting girls. I don't think it would make much sense for him to walk around like that in the US, or maybe if he wanted to pick up European girls.




&gt; the neanderthals would not pleased with our cultural evolution

I don't know if it's our duty as men to please the neanderthals, but if it is indeed, I'd say you're completely correct in that looking effeminate is wrong. Wearing a sturdy overall would probably be best. You should realize however that pretty much every piece of clothing has cultural annotation to it, otherwise a suit for example wouldn't make any sense at all.




&gt; Are they not for comfort and protection?

That's indeed their basic function, but all jeans fulfill that purpose. It conveys creativity and interest in fashion to dress well. Not all people care to convey that. A construction worker wouldn't have any idea about all this, and he doesn't need a girl who posesses such values either. 




&gt; Let women worry about clothing trends.

So why should women care about them and men shouldn't? I think that in accordance to your theory, noone should care at all. Also, do you consider a girl to be more attractive when she dresses in a certain sense (i.e. not wearing the sturdy overall)? Girls have the same with guys, it's very easy to be a hundred times more attractive to a girl just by wearing cloths that convey you know what you're doing.",False

Well, many anarchists through history have been concerned about building an advanced industrial society, but one where power flows bottom-up, rather than top-down. Where people can participate in the decisionmaking which affects them.

I think anarchists are often highly political, but in a different way. They see presidential campaigns as pageants put on by the same people who sell us toothpaste (PR firms), full of imagery for public consumption, staying far away from the concrete policies the candidates plan to implement. Our participation in the whole process is supposed to be limited to pulling a lever for some candidate; then we're supposed to go home. (Or maybe be part of ""Obama's Army"", as they called it in the press, where you're supposed to take instructions rather than implement or shape programs.) That's called ""participating in politics.""

And in the workplace, most of us spend about half our waking hours under the command of some ""boss"". Throughout US history, this has been referred to as [""wage slavery""](http://books.google.com/books?id=nTMEirKUw-QC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false):

&gt; At one time in the United States, in the mid-ninetheenth century, working for wage labor was considered not very different from chattel slavery. That was not an unusual position. That was the slogan of the Republican Party, the banner under which Northern workers fought in the Civil War. We're against chattel slavery and wage slavery. Free people do not rent themselves to others. Maybe you're forced to do it temporarily, but that's only on the way to becoming a free person, or ""free man,"" to put it in the rhetoric of the day. You become a free man when you're not compelled to take orders from others. That's an Enlightenment ideal.
&gt; 
&gt; Incidentally, this was not coming from European radicalism. These were workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, a couple of miles from where we are. You could even read editorials in the New York Times saying this around that time. It took a long time to drive into people's heads the idea that it is legitimate to rent yourself. Now that's pretty much accepted. So that's internalizing oppression. Anyone who thinks it's legitimate to be a wage laborer is internalizing oppression in a way which would have seemed intolerable to people in the mills, let's say, 150 years ago. So that's again internalizing oppression, and it's an achievement.

Anarchists often believe in ""building the new society in the shell of the old."" So for example, many are active in unionizing with an eye towards participatory, democratic control over the workplace.

If you're interested in long-term visions, there's things like [Participatory Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), or parecon for short. (Many understandably ask the question, ""You're full of criticisms, but what will take capitalism/communism's place? Sure, our system's got problems, but maybe it's the best we can do."" Parecon was developed to embody principles like worker self-management, solidarity, diversity and equity. As well as ""efficiency,"" which simply means not wasting what we value.)

If you're interested in learning more about anarchism, I think Chomsky provides [good introductions](http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19961223.htm).

Yes. The most viable alternative currently is the religious fundamentalists. It's hard to say what political process Saudi will develop into but it'll be slow and gradual from the current status quo.

&gt; What would happen if you were to advocate for democracy?

If you advocate for democracy too loudly you'll be arrested. This is a monarchy after all!

&gt;It seems as if Saudi Arabia is very often on the same side as Israel in disputes, for example both oppose Hezbollah and support Hariri in Lebanon - they are also on the same side regarding Hamas vs. Fatah. How do you explain this?

You make a good point. I think the Saudi population are more averse to Israel than the gov. Saudi gov wants peace in Palestine, so they've suggested the Arab peace plan, etc. Saudi population see Israel as an aggressor and an occupier, period. I don't know what will eventually pan out. It's sad. The situation in Palestine is tragic on so many levels.

&gt; Do you believe the Saudis manage oil prices at a lower level than they otherwise would because of the Saudi relationship with the United States?

The relationship with the US is def there but it doesn't drive Saudi oil policy. If one thing because clear over the last decade or so it's that no one really knows how to control the oil market, even OPEC. They basically just pretend to and the world believes it. Don't get me wrong, they do have some influence, but it's very minimal.

&gt; Why is monarchy so prevalent in your region when it has died almost everywhere else in the world? Do you think there may be a religious connection?

In the Gulf it's probably more a result of oil being found in a rather primitive culture, so democracy never really had a chance to develop. I don't think religion per se is responsible, but honestly I don't know... This is a complex question. 

&gt; Are you ever embarrassed by your government, its backwardness?

Yes in some ways. It bugs me that some idiots at the top don't see how ridiculous it is that women can't drive, for example. But every country has its hangups I guess. Saudis (or Muslims more generally) didn't become the 'bad guys' till 911 even though we were the same before and after. Politics and public opinion are shifty and often illogical.

&gt; How do you feel when you see pictures of the King? Does he look respectable to you, not at all like a moron playing dress-up?

I actually really like and respect him. He's old, but he is genuine and a progressive reformer. I'm pretty sure it's the other vested interests and his influential half brothers that stymie efforts at reform. I hope he outlives them.

&gt; Saud is the name of a family. An Iraqi parliamentarian once mocked the fact that an entire country is named after one family. Do you have feelings about that?

Some do but I don't. They unified a country the a third the size of continental US. There were also other examples of this in history like the Hapsburg Dynasty in Europe. The official name of Jordan today is also the Hashimite kingdom of Jordan. To me there are many more important issues to think about than the name.

&gt; Have you come across the idea that America favors your country having a backwards political system because a modern leadership system would pose a more effective threat to Israel? Do you have any thoughts about that idea?

I think Saudi Arabia is rather primitive on the political development scale. It will be more representative but I see that happening gradually. I don't think that has anything to do with Israel... This suggestion strikes me as rather conspiratorial. I do believe though that the current alternative is much worse (the religious zealots).",False

To read some of the press accounts of these gifts—amounting to about 0.00027% of Exxon's 2008 profits of $45 billion—you might think you'd hit upon the scandal of the age. But thanks to what now goes by the name of climategate, it turns out the real scandal lies elsewhere.

Climategate, as readers of these pages know, concerns some of the world's leading climate scientists working in tandem to block freedom of information requests, blackball dissenting scientists, manipulate the peer-review process, and obscure, destroy or massage inconvenient temperature data—facts that were laid bare by last week's disclosure of thousands of emails from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, or CRU.

But the deeper question is why the scientists behaved this way to begin with, especially since the science behind man-made global warming is said to be firmly settled. To answer the question, it helps to turn the alarmists' follow-the-money methods right back at them.

Consider the case of Phil Jones, the director of the CRU and the man at the heart of climategate. According to one of the documents hacked from his center, between 2000 and 2006 Mr. Jones was the recipient (or co-recipient) of some $19 million worth of research grants, a sixfold increase over what he'd been awarded in the 1990s.

Why did the money pour in so quickly? Because the climate alarm kept ringing so loudly: The louder the alarm, the greater the sums. And who better to ring it than people like Mr. Jones, one of its likeliest beneficiaries?

Thus, the European Commission's most recent appropriation for climate research comes to nearly $3 billion, and that's not counting funds from the EU's member governments. In the U.S., the House intends to spend $1.3 billion on NASA's climate efforts, $400 million on NOAA's, and another $300 million for the National Science Foundation. The states also have a piece of the action, with California—apparently not feeling bankrupt enough—devoting $600 million to their own climate initiative. In Australia, alarmists have their own Department of Climate Change at their funding disposal.

And all this is only a fraction of the $94 billion that HSBC Bank estimates has been spent globally this year on what it calls ""green stimulus""—largely ethanol and other alternative energy schemes—of the kind from which Al Gore and his partners at Kleiner Perkins hope to profit handsomely.

Supply, as we know, creates its own demand. So for every additional billion in government-funded grants (or the tens of millions supplied by foundations like the Pew Charitable Trusts), universities, research institutes, advocacy groups and their various spin-offs and dependents have emerged from the woodwork to receive them.

The Economics of Climate Change
Rigging a Climate 'Consensus'
Global Warming With the Lid Off
Climate Science and Candor

Today these groups form a kind of ecosystem of their own. They include not just old standbys like the Sierra Club or Greenpeace, but also Ozone Action, Clean Air Cool Planet, Americans for Equitable Climate Change Solutions, the Alternative Energy Resources Association, the California Climate Action Registry and so on and on. All of them have been on the receiving end of climate change-related funding, so all of them must believe in the reality (and catastrophic imminence) of global warming just as a priest must believe in the existence of God.

None of these outfits is per se corrupt, in the sense that the monies they get are spent on something other than their intended purposes. But they depend on an inherently corrupting premise, namely that the hypothesis on which their livelihood depends has in fact been proved. Absent that proof, everything they represent—including the thousands of jobs they provide—vanishes. This is what's known as a vested interest, and vested interests are an enemy of sound science.

Which brings us back to the climategate scientists, the keepers of the keys to the global warming cathedral. In one of the more telling disclosures from last week, a computer programmer writes of the CRU's temperature database: ""I am very sorry to report that the rest of the databases seems to be in nearly as poor a state as Australia was. . . . Aarrggghhh! There truly is no end in sight. . . . We can have a proper result, but only by including a load of garbage!""

This is not the sound of settled science, but of a cracking empirical foundation. And however many billion-dollar edifices may be built on it, sooner or later it is bound to crumble.

Also, my career path was a bit different to most - I started on the factory floor of a manufacturer, doing temp work to help out a mate, then moved to tech support when they discovered I knew about computers. After that, I moved to Europe and got a job with a distributor.


That said, there's almost always a need for IT savvy folks in the smaller ag companies. The work can be regional and seasonal, depending on the company. Some go full bore all year, some have five permanent employees but hire 100 temps for 3 months every year.  
There's a couple of things you might do to find something.  
First, if you can, visit one of the bigger Agricultural Expos. Wander around, chat to the folk at the smaller stands with high-tech gear on display. They may not be looking for people, but they might know of someone who is. Plus, you'll get an idea of what's around, what interests you, and what knowledge you might need to gain.  
(Also, Ag Expos are pretty cool to visit even if you're not looking for something specific. If you can, get into the cabin of one of the really new giant harvesters. Feels like the cockpit of a Mech. Modern farmers get some awesome toys.)


Another thing to try is to check the websites of the various manufacturers, and see if they have a distributor in your area (the distibutors, more than the manufacturers, are the ones who tend to travel and work outdoors). Here's a few I work with or know of: [Spectrum](http://www.specmeters.com/), [Adcon](http://adcon.at/english/vertrieb_nordamerika_en.html), [Sentek](http://www.sentek.com.au/dist/distributors.asp?lang=en), [Rain Bird](http://www.rainbird.com/DealMain.asp), [Netafim](http://www.netafimusa.com/), [John Deere Water](http://www.deere.com/en_US/water/index.html).


Last, some useful knowledge, skills and the like (most of these aren't necessarily required, but all help):  
 - A rural background helps - farmers are more likely to trust you if you can prove you're proper country folk. But as long as you're not the sort to freak out about mud and that sort of thing, you should be okay.  
 - Familiarity with Windows in its various incarnations.  
 - Some knowledge of networking, modem commands, batch scripting and so on.  
 - Basic electronics, soldering.  
 - A bit of knowlege about various communications protocols is good. SDI-12 and Modbus are the two main digital protocols in use.  
 - The ability to explain technical things in ways that make sense to non-techies. Lots of patience for when you have to troubleshoot for said non-techies.  
 - Willingness and ability to learn new things. This is pretty much essential. Every company has its own weird proprietary hardware and software, and some of them can be fairly obtuse.  


Like I said, there's hundreds of small companies in this field, most with highly specialised services, all overlapping and trying to balance their growth versus their availability. Jobs pop up all the time. You might have to start with a small distributor or farmer, doing part time tech support, and gain the knowledge to move up to a bigger company, or you might get lucky and land a job you're happy with first time.  It took me ten years of trying different things before I got this job. 


Hope that's of some help. Good luck!

There are a lot of people who have the same opinion (and even stronger ones) but shut their mouths because it is a huge Taboo.

I think the problems can be summed up as:

- Many immigrants do not try to integrate at all. Don't try to learn the language. Don't try to learn or understand the culture. Even in some cases repudiate and are against the culture of their host country. This of course applies mostly to immigrants with conservative Muslim cultures. I think this is a reality that needs to get off the Taboo list, and people should be able to talk and discuss this without being called racists.

- Immigrants on the other hand also face strong personal, cultural and language barriers when they immigrate. I don't think the ""native"" people have an *obligation* to teach immigrants or be over-helpful with them. But I do feel that they have to be open towards immigrants and understand their situation.

- Socialism: I like to draw the difference between Europe and the US. Why are the immigration issues so different between the US and Europe? I think the answer is Socialism. Europe is too much of a nanny state in comparison to the US, and it is true that many immigrants do abuse the system knowingly. If you have confidence with for example a Turk, ask him or her and you'll be amazed at the answer. Many immigrants who abuse know very well what they are doing and don't care much.

- Strong Culture: The host country's culture is an important factor as well. Take the US. I really think that one of the reasons immigrants fit better in the US is precisely because of lack of a strong historic culture (sorry, but this is true). So in essence immigrants enrich the US more so than Europe.

- Racism: Generalizing, I think racism is pretty much mutual, there really is racism on both sides. The racism card should not be applied only to the host country, but also to the immigrants. Spec¡ally people from muslim backgrounds.

Having said all of the above, I do believe that the ball is in the court of the immigrants and NOT the host country. So people like OP should not be in a position as they are now, even afraid of talking about real issues. So kudos to you Swede and hope one day all of this somehow works out.

Sell that to Ayn Rand, I hear she's buying. ;-)

Michael Jordan is rich and he played a game.  Alexander Fleming revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives and lived in a small house in London until he died, on a professor's salary.  Who was more productive?  Who's more productive, the executive who invests in a lab, or the lab rat who actually makes the discovery that generates all that income?  One's the enabler, the other one is the producer.

&gt; You can't sacrifice everyone's well-being just to stop the rich from being really rich. That's horrible.

It's not a binary.  You stop on the continuum at a point where you get the best value for your populace.  If Europeans can live longer, live healthier, live happier, and do it all on lower GDP than we produce here in work 'til you drop Alberta, who's really the ""winner""?

Even if you want to maintain this massive GDP ... can we use that generated wealth more efficiently?  Compare Alberta to Norway or Alaska and clearly we can.  Compare Alberta to the other Canadian provinces and that GDP hasn't translated to much at all.  Sure, we make more, but we pay inflated costs as a result.  Every oil boom sees Albertans employed in other industries flee for other provinces because the cost of living outstrips their income.  My rent over doubled between 2003 and 2006 in Edmonton until I bought my condo, all because of the boom.

&gt; In any case, why would Alberta not pursue economic freedom when it does enrich everyone? To spite the rich?

As I said, it's not a binary.  You pursue wealth to a point.  You go pro-business to a point.  Policy has to be smart, not ideological, and part of what makes it smart is asking the tough questions and looking for the real value and not just assuming its there.  You can't make the assumption that a high GDP equals ""good"" without looking at the costs associated with the pursuit of that production.",False

That is very far away from the real problem. The issue Europeans have isn't with immigrant stores or restaurants, there are plenty of those from the immigrants that do contribute, the problem is the people that don't. In a lot of European cities there are entire neighborhoods, usually ones made up of government subsidized apartment buildings, that are self-segregated Muslim communities with little contact with the rest of society. It has never been about the culture difference, but the tendency of a lot of refugees seeking asylum to make these ghettos where they don't contribute anything but take advantage of the money thrown their way by the European governments. 

Some countries are different, like Switzerland, apparently, is more xenophobic, but as far the ""holidays will be taught in your schools"" comment, I think Norway probably has the most comprehensive non-biased religious education anywhere and a third of the curriculum is Islam.

No, it isn't. Not at all, when compared to the *world* and not only Europe.

&gt;The integration of the immigrants have failed completely. Tax money is being spent on giving the immigrants a good start and having them integrated in society. For example, they are given social subsidies for as long they are studying swedish. There has recently been exposed that some are exploting the system and keeps on studying Swedish for years, faling tests deliberately, taking advantage of the social benefits given to them.

Sure, some people take advantage of social benefits (what do you mean, by the way, by ""taking advantage""? Isn't that what social benefits are for?) but does that invalidate the system? Do you have any statistics on how many cheaters there are out there? Are we talking one out of 1,000? One out of 10,000? You have no idea, right? You're just making (racist) groundless assumptions, right? Thought so.

&gt;Another case is that there has recently been a large increase in ""Alone refugee children"". These are ""children"" that have no identification when they come to Sweden and claim that they are under 18 years old. As they can't be proven to be older than 18, they must be accepted and given residence permits.

Again, do you have any proof here (more that the odd case), or are yyou just working from yoiur own fantasies? Also, if someone who is older than 18 feels the need to lie in order to get to stay in Sweden, doesn't that say more about the harsh Swedish immigration laws than anything else?

&gt;To speak against immigration in Sweden is also taboo and you will be called a racist or islamophobic. One popular argument is that people generalize and blame their real problems on minorities (the immigrants) as Hitler did. No large newspapers are writing about the over-representation of non-western perpetrators in rape cases the last couple of years. And only this year there has been an ongoing rampage of over three hundred cases of lighting cars on fire in highly immigrant-populated areas in Malmö and Gothenburg. Firefighters are required police escort when going inside these areas.

""Talking against immigration"", when basing yourself on your own racist fantasies, will get you called out for being a racist. 'Cause you are one. Obviously the arsons in the suburbs are problematic, but why do they happen? Is it because the youth aren't Aryan, or could there be a more complex explanation? What about unemployment, isolation, social destruction, cuts in the welfare state? Nha, it's probably because of the Arabs' inherent arsonist genes!

&gt;In some of these areas, like Tensta and Rinkeby in Stockholm, the population is 95% immigrants from either Somalia, Iraq, Iran etc.

True. Segregation is a problem that needs to be worked on. But is this not more a question of class rather than race? And what about ""some areas"" such as Lidingö or Danderyd where 95% are ethnic Swedes? Is that not a problem?

&gt;There are now plans of a building a Islamic Center in Helsingborg. Which will cover 10,000Sqm and will have it's own mosque, stores, swimming pools, sports center and so on.
&gt;If you dare to critize the building of these kind of projects you are called a racist and islamophobic and are said to respect the freedom of religion. But what I think is that that they are contributing to a more segregated society by isolating themselves and are given their own special places. Another example has been the recent controversy regarding the ban against Minaretes in Switzerland.

Yes, if you ""dare"" (brave man) to criticize people building a place of worship ONLY because you don't like them, be it Muslims or Jews or Buddhists, you are a racist. Why is building a Synagouge or a Mosque, or even a Christian church ""isolating yourself from society""? Does this apply to all religions?

&gt;Like another recent problem has been that children from tradional Muslim families forces their children to stay out of school becuase they find that educating children in music, religion, physical excersise (because the teacher was a woman), home education (because boys should not cook food) and sexual education is offensive.

That's right, and it's totally wrong. Just as wrong as when Christian families who put their children in schools where they are taught equally sexist and anti-scientific religious myths from the Bible.

&gt;As a finishing touch the swedish nationalparty (Sverigedemokraterna) have recently gained a massive upswing in recent polls and is now the 4th largest party with over 5% in votes. But as they are gaining power, the social democrats would want to consider a majority government to close out Sverigedemokraterna to gain a place in the parliament (Riksdag).

It is true that the deeply racist, xenophobic Sweden Democrat party are gaining in the polls. This, remember, is a party that was founded out of the neo-Nazi ""Keep Sweden Swedish"" group in 1988, that used to consist of skinheads and neo-Nazis well into the '90s, and that today again and again proves to be extremely racist against Muslims.

&gt;EDIT: Why is this getting down voted so much? Yes it's a controversial subject, I know, but it's still worth debating

Replace ""islamification"" with ""jewification"", ""Muslims"" with ""Jews"" and ""Mosques"" with ""synagogues"" and you'll see exactly how filthy this racist crap is.

The minarets are on mosques not because Allah demands a certain architectural style for mosques, they are there because they are a part of traditional Muslim culture.

Your adolescent anti-religion rage is cute, but Muslims don't really care whether you think what they believe is false or not and the minaret ban has nothing to do with stamping out religion, it is purely a move to marginalize the culture of Muslim immigrants and, by proxy, to marginalize those immigrants themselves.",False

Riots? People breaking the law? Lock them up, fine them, put them in retraining programmes, whatever. When there are riots in towns and suburbs mostly populated by migrants, whose cars do you think are being put on fire? Hint: People tend to park their vehicles near their homes. 

You are not a racist? Yes you are, substituting 'culture' for 'race' is just cosmetics. Saying you're fine with Arabs but you don't want any immigrants from places with a dominant culture based on Islam and that happens to just include all Arabs ....... what a lucky coincidence, eh?

Crime? Wwhen crime is an issue in immigrant communities, the victims are mostly immigrants themselves. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to be robbed by some guy AND to be blamed for all robberies in your neighborhood due to your ethnicity or religion? 

Enforce laws equally without regard for religion. Kids need to go to school, no matter what Mohammed or Jesus have to say about it.

No bringing up Sharia Law which has absolutely nothing to do with banning Minaret in the Swiss Constitution is the red herring. 

That was one of the propaganda tricks used during the campaign for the ban (""minaret today, people stoned in the streets tomorrow"") and you're playing the same card in your attempt to rationalize the unacceptable so it I'm not really surprised that you bring up the islamophobic trash site Frontpagemag as a source. BTW it's been a while since Canada (Ontario) has abolished all religious courts (Beth Din, Aboriginals, Christians) ,which were operating forever until the Muslims asked for the same rights as the others. In the end religious freedom was the primary victim. 

So besides the UK where are these ""many"" countries you were referring to?

&gt;we're not talking about jews 

why not? that's the topic of the post. Are you afraid this would expose the double standard in this whole debate? Or if we were to replace ""Muslim"" by ""Jew"" this would sound anti-Semite?
So a religious minority is an OK target because they have a PR problem? Isn't it the very thing that what was exploited and escalated against the Jews in the 1930's?

The Swiss Consitution is showing how weak it is in regards to fondamental individual rights and if this law is not overruled at the European level it will be even weaker.

It's basically the same situation here with Muslim or Arab immigrants like it was portrait by hemling and by that french redditor who shared his views (sorry, I'm to lazy to scroll for the name :P).


I think there are a lot of problems specifically with Muslim immigrants.
There was a study recently in Germany that showed that Turkish immigrants (even in the 3rd or 4th generation) do a lot worse than other immigrant groups.
(east)-Asian immigrants did even better than Germans in some aspects.

I think that the world-view of a lot of Turkish/Arab immigrants is simply not compatible with the ""classical"" modern European world-view. Their view on women is often just terrible. My mother was sexually harassed in the subway 4 times in Berlin and it was always a (young) man with Turkish/Arabic descent. Now she simply get's up and goes somewhere else when a Turkish man is about to sit next to her.

She knows that this seems racist (it maybe is), but her fear of being harassed again is simply stronger and I don't fault her for it.

A lot of girls I know can share similar stories about Turkish men in Berlin . I know: anecdotal knowledge, but the percentage is just so high, that I doubt that this is simply a function of poverty.

Young Turkish men get often taught that every girl who's not a virgin before marriage is a slut, so they view most German girls as sluts and treat them rude and badly.

There are many more problems that I feel are specifically large with Muslim immigrants and that can not be explained just with discrimination (why do other immigrant-groups do much better?). So yeah, I feel that the Islam could be one of the reason why Muslim immigrants are hard to integrate throughout Europe.

And again: I know there are also a lot of muslim immigrants who integrated themselves well and cause no trouble.

If by ""larger"" you mean fatter, then you are probably right.

However, the height/bulk of humans has by no means followed some linear trend which you could extrapolate to the past and conclude that people were smaller then.

For example, Cro Magnon man 30,000 years ago was about as tall as humans are today, as we can tell from skeletal remains. People grow taller and shorter based on a number of factors, among which nutrition, climate, and life style are some of the more important. As these factors change, human height also goes through periodic cycles of growing taller and shorter.

There are dips and peaks through history. The average European a thousand years ago was almost 3 inches taller than the average European 700 years later, at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Only in the last 50 years have we caught up with people who lived a thousand years ago, and slightly exceeded them.

Bulk is another matter. Neanderthals, for example, may have been shorter than modern humans, but they were much bulkier, with heavier skeletons and much more muscle mass than modern humans. So I really doubt that humans today are ""much larger"" than they were in the past, unless you specifically pick some point in the past when they were known to be smaller.

Interestingly, in the German study that most raw food dieters point to when showing the efficacy of their diet, the raw dieters claimed pretty much the same benefit you do: they simply _felt better_ and that many of the health problems they suffered from had disappeared.

Oddly, however, that same study found that fertility rates among both men and women on raw diets were _disastrous,_ with women on the diet losing their menstrual cycle at a rate that can only be described as alarming.

That alone should tell you something. Modern Europeans with the knowledge and technology to get every last nutrient and calorie out of their raw food diet in ways that were utterly beyond the reach of primitive man, suffered from malnutrition to the point of undeniable reproductive _death._ In a primitive society, this would have been beyond disastrous, and a tribe wouldn't have dwindled away under selective pressure but would have been utterly wiped out within a small number of generations simply because they lacked the capacity to _breed._

&gt; which is essentially like slow-cooking in the way the food changes, except without removing valuable nutrients

If you think about the logic behind this one sentence, it belies the utter fallacy of the raw food diet.

What you're admitting here is that getting the proper nutrients out of raw food requires far more effort, preparation, and _energy_ than getting a lesser amount out of cooked foods. Many of the nutrients destroyed by cooking (chiefly vitamins, really) are actually only required in fairly small amounts. Some vitamins are needed by humans in such small quantities that, when compared to our needs for carbs, proteins, and fats, they're damned near statistically insignificant. 

As an example, the RDA for Vitamin B12 (the leading candidate for destruction during cooking) for an adult male is 2.4 _micrograms,_ while the RDA for proteins is around 60 _grams._

Think about the orders of magnitudes in play here. By eating raw instead of cooked, you're shorting yourself in some cases more than 50% in digestive efficiency on the compounds that are bar none the biggest bulk and most important component of your diet... in exchange for gaining a benefit on a compound that you can meet your RDA for by licking the back of a dirty spoon.

Oh, and you're having to work harder to do that.

How does that make any sense at all?

EDIT: also, some of the data in your links is just flat out wrong. As for one example, the ""comparative anatomy of eating"" is simply _wrong._ Compared to the other apes and most other primates, our facial muscles are woefully underdeveloped, not ""well developed."" Most ape jaw muscles are pretty freaking giant, often attaching to points on the top or back of the head. Our are _much_ smaller, by body weight ratio and raw measurement, and attach nearer our ears.

Every single immigrant group that has ever come to America has run into these same issues - The assimilation problem, the language problem, the criminal element problem, the racism directed in both directions.   Eventually, after a generation or so, people learn English, intermarry, start participating as full citizens after injecting their own piece of culture into the mosaic of what it is to be American.   

Before you toss out the ""at least my ancestors came over legally!' argument, be sure you vet your own background.   I know that my family was surprised to learn through some ancestry research that the ""cousins"" that all came over from Poland back in the 1800s weren't really cousins at all but a whole village of people, some related, some not.   I'm pretty sure that was common practice back then, before birth certificates and good record keeping became common practice.   It was also common practice for people to ""visit"" relatives in the states and never return to the homeland.   My grandmother was born here on a family visit from Poland that looks to have been deliberately timed for her birth.   Chances are, if you're an American of Polish/Irish/Italian/German descent whose relatives came over from Europe in the late 1800s/early 1900s, your family may not have done it legally.   You or one of your relatives may have been an ""anchor baby"" or may not really have been aunt or uncle or cousin to people you thought were related.     Did you ever notice how Italian, Polish, Chinese immigrants all have very loose definitions of ""aunt"", ""uncle"", ""cousin"", ""brother"", ""sister""?   Now you know why.

All that said, I think we have to have good immigration law to ensure that the US continues to be a viable country.  We don't want to ever bar immigration, that would be a disaster.   But it makes sense to have reasonably controlled paths to citizenship.   I have mixed emotions about citizenship by birth.    That particular law was designed so that African Americans who were born into slavery could be citizens.    In a day and age when air travel is fairly common, I think we might want to rethink that particular right.   I'm not saying it's wrong to allow citizenship by birth, just that I think we need to look at it from a practical perspective.

To conclude, immigration by any one group isn't what I fear.  Democracy is fragile.  So what I really fear is that someday, the US could become such a hostile place that it becomes a net loser of population.   I can imagine scenarios where ""Americans"" feel so threatened by one another that laws become draconian and emigrants decide to take their skills, talents, ambition and culture elsewhere giving some other place the economic engine that we currently have.

#3.  Combine the more cuddly system with a large group of people that are dead-set in their beliefs, and you end up with a huge group of separatists with a lot of time on their hands, most of whom haven't had the tempering experience of education.

In the U.S., immigration is largely a scapegoat, as we only really have two kinds of immigrants here:  Immigrants that want to integrate, and immigrants that do not want to integrate and instead live quietly in their own communities. 

Europe has a third group that would not be tolerated in the U.S.:  Immigrants that do not want to integrate, and want to impose their beliefs on the mainstream society of their host.  No, this is not the same fucking thing as some street signs in Spanish.  This would be more like hispanic immigrants constantly rioting and abusing the system with the end goal of taking over the U.S. culturally an economically.  We just don't have this here.  

Also, the United States is a melting pot, we don't have a lot of room for xenophobia.... But what about countries that don't want to be a melting pot?  What about countries that even though they are populated by the dreaded white people, still have culture and history that goes back millenia?  Are they supposed to just bend over and sacrifice their culture at the altar of evangelical Islam?

Also, toleration of 'non-standard' behavior is par for the course in the U.S. Not only would an immigrant not need english to make it day to day, but they could live almost exactly as they did in their home countries with little variation. The only breaking point is violent or harmful behavior.

The United States doesn't even have an official language. 4% don't even speak english ""well"". Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish, and Korean are used in public elections in several states.

The reason the u.s. does ok with immigration/immigrants is that we don't require that they integrate. As long as they don't practice customs our society views as harmful (normally physically harmful is the key here) or discriminatory, they can do whatever and live wherever they wish.

Integration is a gradual and generational thing. I think that Europe is just finding out that when it comes right down to it it's a lot easier to talk the talk then to walk the walk when it comes to tolerance.

First of all are you referring to Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland? Which are two different countries as rsynnott already pointed out.

&gt; Ireland has fuck all immigration compared to Sweden, especially not of the shit poor, uneducated kind we get in Sweden, but it's still a violent shithole where fire brigades need police in certain areas and ambulances get called out to phantom accidents and then get set on fire.

Secondly in the Republic of Ireland there has had a large amount of immigration from eastern-European countries such as Poland, maybe as many as [200,000](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/23/AR2007102302162_pf.html) according to some sources. When you consider the population of the Republic of Ireland is around 4 million, that is quite a lot of people. (Think around 1 in 7 people in the Republic were born abroad according to the last census)

There has been very little trouble due to these immigrants and as a whole they have been beneficial to the Republic of Ireland. I would say one of the main factors of this is that the general population of the eastern-European community is Roman Catholic, the same as in the Republic of Ireland, so this is a bad example to use when comparing to issues of the OP in Sweden.

Lastly the violence you refer to in your post is mainly located in Northern Ireland and this **is** due to religious differences (Catholic vs Protestant), so again a very bad idea to use Northern Ireland as an example for your points.

Overall I'm trying to say do your research before you try to slander a country :)

I don't know enough about Islam to really say if it is absolutely true or not. Honor killing is not tied directly to the religion (AFAIK). The only evidence of negative teachings is purely anecdotal.

&gt;Have any of you good folks read George Weigel's, ""The Cube and the Cathedral""? I think he gives us the key to understanding this culture and religious conundrum. First by pointing to the changing demographics of Europe with a Christian birthrate that is insufficient to maintain a significant role within the social and political countries of the near future; certainly insufficient in the face of the of high birth rates of Islamic immigrants. (Please spare me the migrant worker/immigrant name game. The difference does little more than point out the prejudices of the proponents of the word game).

&gt;That is a demographic fact.

&gt;Further, there is a subset within Islam which Weigel refers to as ""Islamists"" or ""Islamic fascists"" which does recruit within the Islamic community. In the great clash of cultures that is happening all around us, these people are truly our enemies for they would deny us our right to live and believe as we do now as Christians and secularists.

&gt;Yet this danger must be measured against the majority of the Islamic faith whose understanding of the rights of religious thought, belief and expression are compatible with western societal convictions.

&gt;The Swiss Catholic Bishops have expressed immense disappointment with the results of the referendum. A media campaign of a right wing party in the final two weeks of the campaign strongly swung the vote; a media campaign that used the worst images of Islamist extremism to play to the fears within the small and relatively homogenious society of Switzerland.  Their complaint with the result is its blatant attack upon the freedom of expression of an individual or a communities faith in the public square.

&gt;Those who have previously posted that we should practice a ""tit for tat"" policy with Islamic countries are neglecting to consider the example of Jerusalem. Here the three faiths that claim Abrahamic and Mosaic roots, have churches, mosques and synagogues co-existing within the old city for thousands of years. To those who would demand a right to open a Christian church on the Temple Mount or within the al-Aqsa grounds would blanch with indignation of a Muslim community demanded to set up a mosque in the Vatican!

&gt;While there are legitimate restrictions the are required of any religious community (we don't allow for human sacrifice no matter whatever claim of religious rights), there must be sufficient room offered within our present and future society to allow for freedom of religion, and public religious expression.

&gt;We can use noise legislation to control any public calls to prayer, just as bells are controlled now within Christian bell towers, but we must not let the illegitimate suppression of religious expression stand unchallenged, lest we become the ""baby"" that gets thrown out with the ""bath water"".

&gt;Instead of playing to societal unease in the face of the demographic crisis (at least from a Christian perspective) Christian's must be engaging honestly and openly with the various Islamic communities (Sunni, Shia, etc.) in helping them to develop the arguments of faith such as Christian walked as we transitioned from Christendom through to our modern western societies of today.

&gt;Actions that threaten their rights of expression such as this vote has brought before the Muslims of Switzerland serve only to make the task of their scholars to bring about an Islamic ""enlightenment"" to their faith communities that much harder.

Turkey has really shown a great example of European Islam, both with Bosnia as a fragment of Ottoman Empire and it's recent policies within Turkey, for instance Kemal Ataturk really pushed the Empire out of it's dying and disintegrating state by bringing reforms that modernized it on par with European standards such as; secularism, equal rights for women, tolerance for other religions, sound economic policies. All those things are still unheard of in the middle east and much of Asia. I believe that Islam just like many other religions share a common root and grand idea, but religion should go only so far into the lives of people and not transgress it's own limitation. We have to be realistic in terms of religion, those texts and beliefs were invented during a very dark time of our history. Much of what was important for religious people back then is less important today. That's why secularism is so important today, when so much is happening at a pace that is hard to keep up with, we have the technology to share information more than ever before, to educate ourselves in everything we want. It should be our goal to strive for more understanding and more progress, stressing less what's different about us and bringing forth more of what we share in common with each other. Secularism is more important today than ever before, people who are deeply religious would argue that even the slightest deviation from religion would give grounds to much criticism or even death in some parts of the world, but those people don't realize that they are pushing their societies further down into an evil cycle of poverty, ignorance and destruction. Had it not been for Oil, the whole of middle east would be a desert wasteland, one big ghetto (even if the situation isn't much different today).For instance an Imam can't be a Politician if not for other reasons than his lack of understanding of Political Sciences or Social Sciences such as Economics, yet they try to manipulate people into believing that they know all that's important in life. Islam has the unfortunate fate to be a religion of much oppression, not to say that other religions don't have that (Catholicism for instance, or any other Christian denomination) but those religions had people that opposed the religious oppression and brought forward secularism and scientific progress in spite of religion not because religion allowed such advances. So being a European and of a Muslim background (Atheist now) I wouldn't tolerate Islamic fantasies either, but good luck with bringing progress and prosperity into the Islamic world, that at this point is impossible, change has to come from within the people which clearly won't come from the Islamic community.          
As for Bosnia and the Ottoman times I really wont go into much detail because every history book concerning the Ottoman Empire has a much deeper explanation than that I can give here in a short few sentences. But some of the most important aspects is that Bosnia was the Ottoman Empires western most territory and a buffer zone against Austria, Hungary and other European powers. It was a military zone and it kept the western nations at bay, which resulted in major raidings of the country and a lot of agony for it's people. Bosnia produced many important figures in the Ottoman Empire, such as Grand Viziers, Statesmen, Politicians and most importantly loyal Soldiers.

I think that this is a bit of a special case. Immigrants usually try to cling as much as possible to their existing values, if only to make themselves feel more at home. The next generation is less inclined to be traditional, and so on until integration is complete. However, in this case there are two things that could skew this. The first is the scale of immigration. Not a problem in and of itself, but paired with the intolerant customs and religion of the immigrants this is a recipe for... something different anyway.

Remember that the attitude in Islamic countries is to not permit the building of other religious structures and so on. These migrants basically have cultural and official backing to not assimilate to their host country, but to change their host country to suit themselves: A proposition that the native people do not agree with.

On the other hand, the same intolerance that you see in Islamic countries appears to be the only thing helping them keep their own culture in said countries. A lot of people have this view of places like Iran as being very camel-tenty, which is not true. There's a reason they basically have religious police there, and it's because they feel their own way of life is threatened.

Given that this is the case, I think it would not be unreasonable for countries such as Sweden to limit their intake of immigrants until such time as things have settled down and their current batch has integrated a bit better. One thing the OP did not mention (if I remember correctly) is that the immigrants are bringing a lot of crime with them.",False

From MIT climate researcher and IPCC contributor Richard Lindzen:

&gt;... At this point there is no basis for alarm regardless of whether any relation between the observed warming and the observed increase in minor greenhouse gases can be established. Nevertheless, the most publicized claims of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deal exactly with whether any relation can be discerned. The failure of the attempts to link the two over the past 20 years bespeaks the weakness of any case for concern.

Why is the euro experience of immigration so different from US? I think its the fact that integration was a process that began as soon as they arrived in the US.

Even if the school isn't exclusively Muslim students are allowed to take Muslim classes and the schools provide some aspects of Islamic culture (Halal lunches, curriculum is tailored to not offend, etc). 

The public schools I attended were mostly non-muslim and the curriculum not religious in any way. IMO it was mostly the immersion in this environment that allowed quick integration.

there was a [study commissioned back in 2004](http://www.thelocal.se/19102/20090427/) that concluded the higher incidences of rape have a lot to do with women being more encouraged to report it. It found that the increase was more in connection with nightlife / alcohol / date rape by acquaintances rather than anonymous assault by immigrants.  

&gt;Rape simply appears to be a more common occurrence in Sweden than in the other EU countries studied, the researchers argue.

&gt;Over 5,000 rapes are reported in Sweden per annum while reports in other countries of a comparable size amounted to only a few hundred.

&gt;The figures can however be somewhat distorted as it is often only assault rapes by strangers and aggravated acquaintance rapes that are reported in many of these countries - as was the case in Sweden 40 years ago.

&gt;The high incidence of rape in Sweden has a strong connection to nightlife and partying, specifically after-club parties in private homes.

&gt;Early sexual debuts, high alcohol consumption, ""free sexuality"" and the ""right to say no"" quite simply results in more rapes, the study concludes.


[This article](http://www.thelocal.se/19124/20090428/) also says that the majority of reported rape cases in sweden are not prosecuted because of many biases in the attitudes regarding rape, that certain types of women don't fit the bill as typical victims, certain perpetrators don't fit what we expect from rapists (we expect them to be non-western, etc.), and also fear of smearing the reputation as the capital of gender equality in the world. We can see this bias pretty easily as the OP claims it's the immigrants that are responsible for the higher rape stats. I'm sure he or she would be reluctant to accept that 'ordinary' swedes are much more responsible for the higher incidences of rape:

&gt;In addition to challenging victim and crime stereotypes, perceptions surrounding ‘typical’ perpetrators must also be considered. The UN Special Report discusses how there is a widespread belief that the type of men who commit intimate-partner violence are not typical, ‘normal’ Swedes.

&gt;They are usually imagined as somewhat ‘deviant’ - unemployed, uneducated, alcoholic or from non-Western backgrounds, and so on. However, as Ertürk challenges: “In absolute numbers, the vast majority of the perpetrators of intimate-partner violence are ‘ordinary’ Swedish men.”",False

That link you cited is not a study that shows that mankind is warming the planet.  It is an IPCC summary of various *computer models* and predictions and, incidentally, it contains the work of members of the CRU, including Phil Jones, who is a fraud.  Since the IPCC is driven by politics and not science, that bureaucratic ""summary"" simply is not credible.

The IPCC 2007 report, chapter 6, even recanted their own prior assessments:

""Palaeoclimate science has made significant advances since the 1970s, when a primary focus was on the origin of the ice ages, the possibility of an imminent future ice age, and the first explorations of the so-called Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period. *Even in the first IPCC assessment (IPCC, 1990), many climatic variations prior to the instrumental record were not that well known or understood.* Fifteen years later, understanding is much improved, more quantitative and better integrated with respect to observations and modelling.""

Meaning all of the earlier IPCC predictions were wrong because they really didn't know what they were doing. Of course that didn't prevent them from predicting a coming climate catastrophe with great confidence. The thing that they don't tell us is that their current “improved” predictions, which are also based on computer models, simply can not be considered accurate either.

&gt;Also, here's a satellite study showing global warming: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=more-proof-of-global-warm

Where is the data to support the finding that, ""long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2, ozone (O3) and CFC 11 and 12 concentrations and, consequently, a significant increase in the earth's greenhouse effect""? 

Have these results been independently verified by other climate scientists?

Where is the data that shows that the warming is due to CO2?

The crucial point of contention is not whether or not the Earth is warming up.  The crucial point of contention is whether or not mankind is the reason.  Neither of your two links show anything to do with that crucial point.

&gt;And Watts is? 

He is more credible than the CRU or realclimate.org because Watts doesn't fudge data, ignore data, or deny FOI requests, all to fit a clear political agenda.

&gt;You still haven't replied to the argument that the so-called Medieval Warm Period wasn't as warm globally as the current anthroprogenic warm period. 

That argument requires no reply because it simply isn't true.  The medieval warm period was much warmer than it is today.

&gt;Neither have you given your source on the temperatures of that period. It was unusually warm in Europe coming off the Little Ice Age, but you can't just focus on one region. It seems you'd rather make a hasty generalization that anyone who agrees with CRU (or disagrees with you) is automatically corrupt.

The medieval warm period, or MWP, is well known by paleoclimatologists, to have been a global phenomena.

I totally disagree. On one hand you have punishment for crimes and on the other you have the *prevention* of crimes. This is an issue that can be tackled at the source.

The fact is we can cherry pick extreme examples from either side all night. Both sides of the equation require more education and acceptance.

The point we differ on is which side is making (or should be making) more of an effort. My argument has been and will be that the immigrants need to make much more of an effort than the locals - and especially now in Europe much more of an effort than they have. Claiming discrimination, rioting or making threats of violence over cultural differences is not acceptable. There is this idea that the burden of integration is on the countries accepting the immigrants.

Depending on what you plan to do in Rome and how jet lag affects you and your wife you might want to add another day there. You may be pretty beat when you arrive though. The important thing to remember about Rome is you’ll spend an entire day doing the Vatican Museum (Sistine Chapel) if you chose to visit that. Get there super early otherwise you’ll wait forever in line. Pope Benedict XVI does his Papal audiences on Weds and that’s free if you have any interest in it, if not, then Weds is the best time to visit the Vatican Museum as a great deal of people will be at the audience. Check the audience’s time and plan accordingly. The rest of Rome: St Peter’s, Coliseum, Forum, Spanish Steps and other churches could be crammed into one ambitious day though I’d recommend 2.

Venice is much smaller and could be done in 2 days. You’ll likely spend a bit of time getting into the Doge’s palace and, depending on where you start from and if you walk, making your way/getting lost finding St Mark’s Square. If you find you’ve exhausted Venice proper then I’d visit Lido which is where a lot of Italian’s vacation during the summer months.

Hitting the road after Venice is a really good idea and a car will allow you a ton of freedom and the ability to see way more than otherwise would. Finding accommodations won’t be too hard. Hostelworld.com has listings for a lot of B&amp;B’s and smaller hotels. Since you are interested in the country you can also stay on working farms, agriturismo I believe it’s called. Ask about these wherever you stay in Rome or Venice or check it out online beforehand.

Tracking down good food is easy, it’s everywhere. Great food however can be found by avoiding places in areas with tons of tourists. Tourist restaurants can be broken into 2 types: the ludicrously expensive fine dinning with the view of *insert sight here*, or the prix fix tourist menu with good but not great food with the view of *insert sight here*.  If it has a tourist menu/special then I’d recommend eating elsewhere. If you venture into the country you likely won’t be able to go wrong. Many tiny restaurants won’t have a printed menu, it’ll just be whatever they feel like making that day and they’ll verbally share the menu with you, which brings me to your final question.

Language: While a non issue in the bigger cities it will be beneficial if you hit smaller towns. Grab a tourist language book and you’ll be fine. Really learn: numbers, time, directions ( can’t stress this enough since you’ll be driving) and food (very important if you hit the countryside). I’d actually recommend you try using as much Italian as you can as it’s a fun and beautiful language. The Italians LOVE it when someone makes an effort to speak their language and aren’t as judgmental about butchering it as other European peoples are.

I was reminded just now of my friends in London. A group of girls were all school teachers and they always had funny stories. One girl was a teacher at an inner London school that was mostly immigrant. Many of the kids had difficulty speaking English since it wasn't what they spoke at home. She told me about one boy she had in her class that was a real problem. She said he looked right through her in a way she had never felt before. He used to refuse when she asked him to do something because a woman was not allowed to order around a man. She had to ask his parents to come in and they didn't see anything wrong with their sons behaviour. They refused to correct him.

Now, this stirring bit of rhetoric aside, I very much doubt this young man will ever murder anyone. He was one of 100 kids she taught and the only one to exhibit this behaviour.

But he exhibited behaviour that would be acceptable (or expected) in his native culture but is not acceptable in our own. Your idea that *all* Muslims know a particular thing is totally irrelevant. Some cultural differences are small (e.g. how we treat women) some are big (e.g. honor killings).

These are all based on ideas and beliefs. Our culture isn't perfect (we still have gender issues of our own) but that doesn't mean we just accept the issues of another culture under a banner of ignorant tolerance.

Work (temporary or not) was what attracted many immigrants into the US as well.

2. Most of the Muslim immigrants into countries like the Netherlands and Germany came here to earn money by work. That includes Turkish people and Moroccans. The notion that Europe gets dregs forced out by war or oppression is not historically true at all. Don't confuse immigration with refugees.

3. We're dealing with second or third generation immigrants here, born and raised in our countries. The muslim youths that people complain about aren't immigrants. 

The whole notion that Europe's situation is unique and has a large group of people that doesn't want to integrate and impose their own system on Europe is frankly bullshit not born out by the facts. Yes, there are bad apples. Yes, there's tension. Yes, there are integration problems (just like, say, the Irish had a hard time integrating in the US). But the doom scenario where evangelical Islam will destroy European culture is about as believable as the 2012 stuff.

Even if we reduce the list to just include the EU this is simply not true. Of course the numbers of immigrants to large countries like Germany, France, the UK and Spain are much higher. Several countries also take in more immigrants per capita. Also keep in mind that the largest group that immigrates to Sweden is Swedes, coming home - since we are so awesome. Also remember that the largest immigrant group in Sweden is Finns, for instance they outnumber the Iranians by 10 to 1.

&gt;The integration of the immigrants have failed completely. Tax money is being spent on giving the immigrants a good start and having them integrated in society. For example, they are given social subsidies for as long they are studying swedish. There has recently been exposed that some are exploting the system and keeps on studying Swedish for years, faling tests deliberately, taking advantage of the social benefits given to them.

Agreed, this problem with a small part of the students was exposed recently. The system is now thankfully being reformed.

&gt; Another case is that there has recently been a large increase in ""Alone refugee children"". These are ""children"" that have no identification when they come to Sweden and claim that they are under 18 years old. As they can't be proven to be older than 18, they must be accepted and given residence permits.

Not true, in case of no identity papers being present, the migration bureau determines their age. Also, their refugee status is tested as with any other person seeking asylum. Many are sent back.

&gt;To speak against immigration in Sweden is also taboo and you will be called a racist or islamophobic. One popular argument is that people generalize and blame their real problems on minorities (the immigrants) as Hitler did. 

That is because you make stuff up. Take things out of context and above all over-simplify things all the time, like populists always does.

&gt;No large newspapers are writing about the over-representation of non-western perpetrators in rape cases the last couple of years. And only this year there has been an ongoing rampage of over three hundred cases of lighting cars on fire in highly immigrant-populated areas in Malmö and Gothenburg. Firefighters are required police escort when going inside these areas.

Research has time and time again proven that there is no link between ethnicity and crime. There is however a clear link between crime and poverty. Also if you look at the riots and car arsons they are, in Malmö at least partly committed by people tied to groups on the fringe left. That is middle class Swedish kids.

&gt;In some of these areas, like Tensta and Rinkeby in Stockholm, the population is 95% immigrants from either Somalia, Iraq, Iran etc.

Rinkeby has 89% people with foreign background. What is a bigger concern is that it is one of the poorest areas in Sweden.

&gt; There are now plans of a building a Islamic Center in Helsingborg. Which will cover 10,000Sqm and will have it's own mosque, stores, swimming pools, sports center and so on.

Sounds like great fun! It's not as if you will have to pay for it.

&gt; If you dare to critize the building of these kind of projects you are called a racist and islamophobic and are said to respect the freedom of religion. But what I think is that that they are contributing to a more segregated society by isolating themselves and are given their own special places.

If I moved to another country I certainly wouldn't turn catholic, hindu, moslem or whatever. If you want to look at poor integration - Look to the Swedish colonies in Spain or Thailand. Or the Danes in Malmö for that matter.

&gt; Another example has been the recent controversy regarding the ban against Minaretes in Switzerland.

Remember if you outlaws mosques, only criminals will go to them.

&gt; Like another recent problem has been that children from tradional Muslim families forces their children to stay out of school becuase they find that educating children in music, religion, physical excersise (because the teacher was a woman), home education (because boys should not cook food) and sexual education is offensive.

Thankfully Sweden has a great law that first of all forbids home schooling but also regulates that all schools must follow the curriculum. Even schools with christian or moslem founders must teach evolution and the practice of safe sex. Another good thing is that its getting harder to start religious schools altogether.

&gt; It always seems like the tolerant and open-minded Swedish people that should adapt to more intolerant and ignorant muslim families.

The Iraqis and Palestinians I know are actually a lot more tolerant than most Swedes I know.

&gt; As a finishing touch the swedish nationalistparty (Sverigedemokraterna) have recently gained a massive upswing in recent polls and is now the 4th largest party with over 5% in votes. But as they are gaining power, the social democrats would want to consider a majority government to close out Sverigedemokraterna to gain a place in the parliament (Riksdag).

Not true, they are the sixth largest in the lates SIFO poll (Social democrats, conservatives, greens, the liberals and the left are all larger). Also you can't make a deal with another party to force a third party out of the parliament. What the Social democrats are proposing is to form a broad government with liberal and centre parties to keep the racists from influencing the government. Which sounds like a good plan.

&gt;I'm sorry if I only took some extreme examples, but this how I feel what is going on in Sweden right now. All these claims can be found on newsblogs or sites. I'm not against etnological backgrounds, therefore I cannot be called a racist. I'm however against all religions and some cultures that have questionable morals and values.

I am sorry for you. We certainly don't share the same morals and value you and I. Would people like me be welcome in your Sweden?

Is this the model for Sweden?  I don't think so.  The Swedish country before the recent immigrant wave from these muslim countries was...what?...99% Swedish?  And had been for millenia?  

You seem to be going about this the wrong way - on the one hand you welcome immigrants, particularly poor refugees from muslim countries who admittedly have very strong religious belief systems in sometimes conflict with yours - and on the other you are rigidly encouraging them to adapt into your Swedish social model and culture.

&gt; To speak against immigration in Sweden is also taboo and you will be called a racist or islamophobic.

This might, I say *might*, have something, I say *something*, to do with characterizing Islamic immigrants as a monolithic bloc.

&gt; But what I think is that that they are contributing to a more segregated society by isolating themselves and are given their own special places.

How do you feel about synagogues and Jewish community centers?

No, really.  The hand-wringing about Muslim self-segregation is really not different in kind from earlier hand-wringing about Jews failing to assimilate.  

I'm not saying, ""Therefore, you're a racist and an anti-Semite and you're wrong.""  What I'm saying is that there's a difference between ""These people are not becoming Swedish at the pace and in the manner I'm comfortable with"" and ""These people intend to remain different forever.""

Also:  Is it *possible* to become Swedish?  What does it mean to be ""Swedish""?  Like most European countries, Sweden doesn't have a whole lot of experience with ethnic identity and national identity being at variance.  This is absolutely a social problem, but it's not a social problem whose responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders of immigrants.

&gt; Like another recent problem has been that children from tradional Muslim families forces their children to stay out of school becuase they find that educating children in music, religion, physical excersise (because the teacher was a woman), home education (because boys should not cook food) and sexual education is offensive.

Living in a country where teaching evolution in school biology classes and providing education in contraception to teenagers is a subject of heated controversy, I have sympathy for your concerns here.  It's called ""pluralism,"" and it's a complicated social problem that your country doesn't have very much experience with.  It's really not obvious what the right response to it is.  The Dutch model of tolerance clearly has its limits - if we were tolerant (in that manner) in the US, teaching evolution in Kansas would be not only difficult but illegal.  But there are solutions.

&gt; I'm not against etnological backgrounds, therefore I cannot be called a racist. I'm however against all religions and some cultures that have questionable morals and values.

Um, I hate to break it to you, sport, but that's a distinction without a difference.  Very few racists say, ""I hate the niggers because they're an inferior race.""  They mostly say, ""Niggers are lazy thieving complainers who don't believe in hard work like normal people do.""  Or they speak in code, saying things like, ""I think African-American cultural norms are at variance with American middle-class values,"" which is not really fundamentally different.

&gt; It always seems like the tolerant and open-minded Swedish people that should adapt to more intolerant and ignorant muslim families.

Yes, I can see the beacon of Swedish open-mindedness shining out from the words of that very sentence.

It's not actually impossible to learn what kinds of cultural conflicts someone who grew up in the Rif Valley of Morocco is having now that he's trying to raise his kids in Slotervaart.  It does require that you go outside the circle of complacency and trouble yourself to try to understand how other people think.  It's hard work, but it's a necessary first step.  It's the difference between coming up with a rational and compassionate social policy and running around with your hair on fire going ""OMG MUSLIMS!  THEY BUILD MOSQUES!""

&gt; I'm sure this is not only a problem in Sweden, but in all of Europe.

There is no question that cultural pluralism is a relatively novel problem that wealthy nations in Western Europe are beginning to encounter.  There are basically two different perspectives that you can take.  

One of them is to say that ""we"" are being overrun by ""them.""  That would be the Swiss perspective:  let's ban minarets, because they're not Swiss.  That's a pretty appropriately Swiss response.  But the Swiss national identity is one of cultural isolation - the Swiss, a fantastically smug people, are basically hillbillies with a banking system.  It's probably not the model that a cosmopolitan country ought to adopt.

The other approach is to say, ""This is what we are becoming.""  The ""we"" *includes* your new ""ignorant and intolerant"" Swedes.  You need to help them become more Swedish, sure.  But you also have to recognize that the social benefits that come from admitting a large number of impoverished immigrant workers are attained at the social cost of incorporating their way of life into yours.  You have to forge a way of life that encourages interconnection between ""native"" and ""immigrant"" cultures.  And no, that doesn't mean coming up with ways to punish them if they're not sufficiently Swedish, which is the platform nationalist parties come to power on.

They're not leaving.  They're going to be in Sweden for generations.  Their grandkids are going to go to the same schools that yours will.  If you think about the problem this way, you stand some chance of developing approaches to it that aren't fundamentally cruel and counterproductive.",False

Ethnicity doesn't have any bearing on the person's quality of character. Ethnic minorities in any country tend to be oppressed, and they have different standards and values than the mainstream society - and so there can be friction, and ill will when people don't understand where others are coming from. For instance, I went to secondary school in a mostly african american usa inner city school. And going back twenty years later, it stuns me that the city still has this tension between beige people and brown people. I figured out what the solutions would be to that city's problems decades ago. But they still seem to be mired. I see that african americans are more gregarious and socially outgoing - and this grates on the nerves of european americans who like a close-knit small circle of friends. This is an example of how a difference in social standards can cause angst between groups.

There are many factors which go into the upbringing of children in any society. And poverty can create a situation where children are not taken care of as well as they ought to be. And those children will grow up to have social adjustment problems. In what kind of home do you think Timothy McVeigh grew up? And the effects of poor upbringing can be compounded by enlistment in the military at a very sensitive point in a young person's maturation into adulthood.

One has to peg cause and effect accurately, if you want to act with discretion. In countries like the Usa, we are seeing that immigrants are oftentimes much more driven in their academic and professional careers. East indians are in high demand within high tech companies, for example. And I remember in highschool, that asian kids were always at the top of the class, academically.

Sweet. I agree.

The argument wasn't over hierarchy in general, but a specific form of hierarchy. [sighs]

&gt; My undergrad was in history (pre-christian/pre-medieval Europe actually), so your accusation is a little amusing.

I don't care what your background is in--I can only go on what you say in this thread of discussion.

&gt; I'd counter that my view of history is academic rather than idealistic/simplistic.

Great for you. Maybe it is. I don't know. I can only tell you that your view that you expressed in your prior comment was rather simplistic. (I said nothing of ""idealistic."")

&gt; To say that we're somehow 'meant' or 'naturally' supposed to live in cooperative groups with no hierarchy is absurd - nature and history contradict that statement.

Once again, I agree. (Traditionally, anarchy as defined by Proudhon has been about abolishing hierarchy ipso facto. I disagree with this form of anarchy, and I think that's been clear. A manager in a firm directing employees is obviously some sort of hierarchy that is justified provided all relationships are voluntary--this is the kind of hierarchy that leftist anarchist want to abolish. The hierarchy in a family is somewhat more complex to deal with in the libertarian philosophy, but is a hierarchy that cannot be extinguished unless under perfect rule of Marxism or some related philosophy that specifically seeks to abolish family--which I agree is patently absurd.)

&gt; Rather, a better way to approach the issue, for you, would be to argue that our natural inclination isn't 'good' and that we ought to strive for some idealistic cooperative/anti-authoritarian existence. I'd disagree with you, but at least you wouldn't be guilty of attempting to read your ideal back into history.

I never read anything back into history. Your insinuation was pointed directly towards wealth--this is but one form of hierarchy, and one that I explained my position on quite well. (Actually, I am wearing of even calling this a hierarchy. Just because one has more money than someone else doesn't mean a hierarchal relationship exists between them. More is required.) Nothing of what I said implied or even insinuated that I was against hierarchy in general. Hierarchy can be voluntary, and is therefore something that is okay within the libertarian ethic.

First, it seems to me that in the states, immigrants don't cluster together as much. Perhaps this is wrong or it has changed, but I often saw a situation where immigrants didn't really want to be associated necessarily with other immigrants from their own country. Instead everyone did his or her own thing. I am thinking of a Turkish Kebap shop owner who was happy that he was the only one in town and he saw himself as a new American rather than as turkish.

Second, at least concerning Turkey, there are two types of Turks. The urban, secular Turks and the Turks from the country side who are more conservative, less educated, working class, etc. To the horrification of a lot of urban, secular Turks most of the people who flood Western Europe seem to be the country folk and that's the image people have of immigrants. Let me put it this way, most of the immigrants you see would be lost in modern Istanbul, much more so in a modern northern European city!!! That's a huge clash of cultures and norms right there. 

So, what I am saying is that there are two problems. The attitudes of the immigrants, the types of people they are, the sheer number of them flooding in and also to some extent the attitudes of the host country population. No, I don't mean the official integration and welfare programs. Northern European countries are legendary for their very generous support programs. No I mean the very subtle attitudes and mentalities of the host country population when it comes to integrating people. You see, in the states immigrants get much, much less official support. Much less social aid. Yet, at least in the recent past, it was easier to integrate because as the French thinker Tocqueville recognized in the early 19th century when he toured America, it is the *customs* of the people that are even more important than rules and regulations when it comes to democracy. The customs of openness to new things and flexibility, for instance. I think the same can be said of integration. You can have all the integration programs you want. No matter ho much money you spend, you will still have the problem of the individual customs of people in the host country and the clash of norms described above. I think policy makers in northern Europe would be wise to really manage immigration better, because northern Europeans just simply are not accustomed (there is that customs word again) to integrate people, especially when these immigrants come from a non-urban, insular backgrounds to begin with. That's just the reality and something has to give.

The best thing a northern European can do on an individual basis is to reach out. Even if you reach out to just one person. They key is you already have these immigrants in your midst. We either make them part of society on an individual basis and all pull on the same rope or we won't. Simple choice. There has to be a new attitude that everyone is important and that everyone can contribute to the country's wealth, because that is reality. All these millions of immigrants, you don't think they work? You don't think they can contribute to economic growth and make Sweden more powerful? Of course, they can.

p.s.: Its also interesting that none of these problems seem to be apparent or noticed in the large clusters of Asian immigrants in Europe. Why is that? For example, there are some Chinatowns in Europe and you rarely hear anyone complaining about them. In fact, people like them. ",False

I really want to believe it, but a simple review of the facts kills that sentiment. Most of the non-European immigrants in Europe are lowly skilled, lowly educated and have little to contribute in assets and knowledge. Due do the tiered and non-mobile nature of the European society it is also hard for the second generation immigrants to escape their underpriviliged upbringing and they continue to show high levels of unemployment, criminal involvement and low education. As a consequence their best option to further their standing in society is to marry someone from the homeland, which once again brings in a partner with on average little change of being able to fill a position that adds substantial economic value.

Some friends of mine who were artists and in their early thirties had figured out a while back how to screenprint their art onto t-shirts and then tie-dye the shirt. The Dead were playing nearby and one of them asked me if I wanted to help guerrilla sell shirts in the parking lot for $200 cash a show. 


I went to the show and noticed all the hippies making and selling jewelry made from homemade fimo and got an idea that if I could source the components cheap and come up with some new designs out of pewter (suns, moons, yin-yangs, Grateful Bear etctera) I could come up with designs that would have mass appeal and sell the jewelry alongside the shirts. I had wax castings made and then had those mass produced in Cranston, RI. I found a company overseas that was making fimo beads that mimicked venetian glass and then I sourced all the findings wholesale for the jewelry. 

Next I put up a notice on the bulletin board at school looking for people to assemble the jewelry and I paid them by the piece so I knew exactly how much each piece cost. If they were fast they could make 50-60 an hour and earn about 10-12 bucks an hour. I had the people assembling dropship more jewelry to the Fed Ex office in the next town I would visit on the tour.

I found I was able to make a piece of jewelry with parts and labor for an average of fifty cents and sell it on the lot for five dollars. Not a bad markup. Soon I had multiple spots on the lot and had other vendors buying wholesale from me and I was still making anywhere from double to five times my cost of goods from the wholesale. I would earn 1k-2k on an average day, 3k-5k on a sick day, and the tours would last a few weeks, with a day off every 10 days or so. I had 7 people full time at home assembling at the peak and anywhere from 5-25 who I would hire on the tours if they were running concurrently.

Then I discovered the fashion and gift tradeshows and started selling to boutiques and chain stores. Within a year I got an 800 number and had jewelry in hundreds of stores in the US, Japan and Europe and the orders kept coming in. There were two other guys doing similar stuff who I met at the tradeshows and we kicked ass for while as we were the only ones supplying this type of jewelry. I also booked the Lollapalooza and Horde tours as a vendor and continued to guerrilla sell on Dead tour.

After awhile more and more people started catching on and then the Chinese and Indians started full on knocking off my pendants and designs as well and started undercutting me and the other guys. 

The peak was Woodstock '94 where I grossed about 50k in three days. Jerry Garcia died the next summer and as I said the market was becoming over saturated and the fad had run its course.

I had a brief resurgence selling rave style jewelry after that but the internet was born and I moved on. Hmm. I never actually wrote that out before and kind of forgot what a long strange trip, pardon the expression, it was.

tl;dr: I made a bunch of money designing and selling jewelry to hippies and stores in the early 1990's.

In Europe, the state actively tries to help you out - building community centers and such.  The problem is, the values of that community are so radically different from Western values.  I'm not talking ""head covering"" kind of different; I'm talking ""beating your wife"" and ""honor killing"" kind of different.  I'm talking about religious dogma on a level that has not been seen in the West since the 16th Century.   These are core differences in values.  And in a socialized country, the state ends up actively reinforcing those values.

To take the example of Holland - they found they were in real trouble a few years ago.  Public education funds help support religious schools.  But in some (many? I'm not Dutch) of the Muslim schools, the immigrants' culture really took dominance over the erstwhile-prevailing integrationist culture.  Classrooms were segregated, children were taught all their lessons from the Koran, and patterns of what Westerners call physical or emotional abuse became rampant.  And all of this was on the government's dime.  

To make matters worse, immigrant communities DO tend to weigh heavily on the social services budget.  And there IS a real culture of people who would rather live on the state subsidies than meet the language and civic knowledge requirements of a normal work visa - or a job.  When a community gets insular, these traits get reinforced, too.  And in this case, the reinforcement is happening on the people's dime.

You need to have a system in place to stop democracy becoming bureaucratic mob rule.

The western European nations (and Australia where I am) have a Prime Minister or equivalent to govern the country, but they also have a completely separate Head of State with the power to dissolve the government if it behaves unconstitutionally, abuses it's power, or simply fucks things up really badly. In Australia, the Whitlam government was dismissed when it fucked up the budget in 1975.

It's safe to vote in your own self interest in most democracies because laws are there to stop rampant self interest from undermining society.

The US is a major exception, where the head of state actually runs the country, too. They don't have a government like us, they have an administration, elected in a ""first past the post"" or ""winner takes it all"" style system. In other democracies, if 49% vote for one party, and 51% vote for another, the 49% are still represented in the House of Representatives or House of Commons or whatever. The US doesn't have this, they vote for a four year dictatorship that is limited by (or *was* limited by) the constitution.

(And yes, I know the US has a Congress. We have something similar too in the Senate, and the UK has it's House of Lords. That's different from the House of Reps.)

The US is also an exception in that they don't have the laws to handle rampant self interest, and they accuse anyone of trying to stabilise the system as being ""commies"" or ""socialists"".

First, for those who say that the type of immigrant is fundamentally different in Europe than it is in the US, I would say that this is partially true but also partially a misconception. For example, I live in Minneapolis, which has large immigrant populations composed mostly of refugees. Minnesota has over 35,000 Somalis compared with less than 20,000 each in Norway and Denmark which have roughly the same size populations as Minnesota. The UK has only 45,000 Somalis and is more than 10x the population of Minnesota. The point being that Minnesota has a huge Somali population most of which is concentrated in my city. 

I have no problems with them. At all.  I'm sure there are some who are bigoted against the Somalis and other immigrants, probably more so outside of the city, but I'm telling the truth when I say I haven't met a single person like that. Not one. I value the friendships that I've made with my Somali-American neighbors and feel that their culture has brought a lot to my city, and on a personal level has also taught me a lot. 

So the idea that immigrants do better in the US than Europe simply because the immigrants themselves are different is bunk.

Secondly, I have seen a lot of people agree with the idea that the welfare state makes immigrants not want to ""integrate"". I really don't understand the logic behind this, let alone having seen any evidence to support it. I think people are just angry with immigrants to begin with and accuse them of being lazy and stealing from the government to justify their xenophobia. 

Lastly, and on a somewhat related note, I have also seen a lot of people posting who are apparently very concerned about ""integration"". How fast people do it, to what degree, etc. It has basically been taken for granted here that this idea of ""integration"" is an absolute good. Using the example that I used before of the Somali community in Minneapolis, I would say that they are still heavily grouped in a few neighborhoods, many older folks still speak Somali more than they speak English, and almost all of the Somalis are observant Muslims. 

What's the problem with any of that? Immigrant groups always cluster together, at least initially, and besides you can already start to see the Somalis disperse here in Minneapolis. I can understand wanting to hang on to your mother tongue, and if your English is so bad that it hinders you in your day-to-day life then that's your problem. And regarding the practice of Islam I believe unequivocally in freedom of religion. So yeah, that one is pretty simple. 

And on top of all that, I would be pretty disappointed if i woke up one day and all of the ethnic minorities in my city started all acting just like white people. That might sound silly but I honestly think that's what a lot of these right-wing Europeans want. ",False

**Steps to do it with USB stick in Ubuntu:**

1. Install Unetbootin if you have not.

2. Run Unetbootin and select Freedos as distro.  Select your USB stick.  WARNING, if you select your hdd, your bad!

3. After flashing your USB stick, copy the latest MSI BIOS (meant for MSI Wind U100+) into the flash drive and unzip it.

4. Dismount your USB stick, reboot your MSI u100+ with the usb stick.

5. Select one of the FreeDOS LiveCD boot which should get you to an A:&gt; prompt in a few secs time.

6. Your flash files are in C:&gt;

7. Goto the directory you unzipped earlier.

8. Make sure your AC power is in, and your usb stick is stable.  Run flash.

**WARNING**
The batch file has not further prompts.  Once you start it, it erases the existing flash and updates your BIOS with the latest one.

Unlike Christianity which contemplates a marked distinction between God and Caesar, Islam is the seamless union of religion and politics.

In Islam, religious communities always have political goals. This doesn't imply an attempt to overthrow their host government. In (long) past history, muslims have been pretty good at giving significant freedom to non-muslim guests and at not bothering their hosts. The political ambitions of muslim communities are expressed in the continued attempt of muslims to regulate life for muslims in ways that is independent from secular law.

In general, muslims don't give a shit about what non-muslims do. In Malaysia, Chinese locals and Western expats get drunk every day but 'Bumiputera' Malays can get caned for the same offence. On the other hand, they recognise no authority for any code of law other than their own, and will seldom accept or respect those of their hosts, hence the animosity that many Europeans understandably but mistakenly see as a deliberate attempt to take over.

In Christianity, the center of religious life is the individual and his own hard-saved soul. In Islam, religion resembles more an individual struggle which resonates in the collective effort of an extended community.
For Muslim communities worldwide, as soon as the size of a community reaches a certain point and allows for a certain degree of separation and self-determination, this self-determination is always looked for and through different avenues.

It is what happened in the '90s with Albanians in Kosovo, what happens in England with the establishment of Sharia courts, in Southern Thailand where the muslim minorities attempt to secede etc.
It's the reason why muslims tend to live in ghettos more than other communities, why they are especially keen to establish their own schools and their own malls (as from OP's example).",False

Anyone of any ethnicity can be “Australian” — despite what John Howard would have liked you to believe, it doesn’t require being of Anglo-Saxon extraction and playing cricket.

The proposition that Australia is a racist country is an interesting one. The White Australia Policy certainly was, and it was brought in by our first PM, who was pretty racist by modern standards.

But we’re speaking in a social context many decades after its end. Penny Wong may have been called an “Asian wh*re” growing up in Corromandel Valley, but the fact is that Australia has relied on an influx of migrants for a very long time, and that’s no less true now than ever.

So in the sense that Australia is a “melting pot”, or a “multiculturalism”, I think there is a lot of *hysteria* about racism. What happened to the Indian international students in backwater suburbs of Melbourne was awful, but it was overblown. What occurred was a criminal offence; it’s not condoned or encouraged by the vast majority. The PM isn’t morally obliged to apologise, though the local authorities may be.

Having said that, I’ve lived in Adelaide all my life. Maybe tensions are higher in Sydney and Melbourne.

&gt;Are you saying that it's not possible to be both Muslim and Swiss?

When did I say that. You are putting words in my mouth to suit your argument. Nobody is infringing upon a muslim citizens right to practice their religion. 

&gt;Baha'is have no association historically with Israel at all, and yet one of their most important temples is there. 

Bullshit. The history of the Shrine of the Bab is linked with the history of the middle east and predates Israel by 60 years. It is part of the of the land and its people. Not to mention the many links between the cultural history of the faiths of the book and Baha'i .

&gt;But here in Australia we're happy to have buildings from any religious group here's a Buddhist Stupa near me, here's a local mosque and a Hindu temple to round things out.

Australia != Europe . Australia, like the US is a former colony and does not have millennia of established culture. I have no problem with minarets in the US. I live by one and it doesn't bother me in the least.

Ancient muslim incursions into swiss alps hardly qualify. The first mosque wasn't built until 1963. It is quite obvious that this law is an attempt to maintain an ascetic of swiss culture while continuing to allow the inevitable influx of immigrant populations.

It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.

im now 29 and have progressivly watched the change as immigrants entered into these countries, graffittied ancient churches, castles, landmarks and so forth. i have gone to malls in st germain en laye in the most beautiful part of paris imaginable. right next to versailles castle. and i have witnessed a group of burka wearing teens torching cars and throwing bottles at french nationals trying to enter the mall.

i have stood in bars with my freinds in paris, when one said "" oh fuck we have to go"" at which point 3 turkish men came over and decided that it was their job to teach people a lesson for ""saying the fuck"" minutes later he grabbed his girlfreind by her hair and slapped the fucking piss out of her when she tried to tell him they were outnumbered and being fucking dicks. you can visit this bar in paris near the opera, its an irish pub, i think it was called mcfinnigans.

i sat in exon provence and watched children playing happily when i was an 8 year old on the french riviera, you could go out at night at any time. now it is north africans on the beach fist fighting all night and stabbing people. fucking shame i cant take my son there now. they came, set up a hash trading cartel out of marseille and now the whole place is a warzone at night.

i used to go to Oslo a lot with my freind gyum to see the swedish hardcore bands shred with the most brutal guitar chords imaginable,(by the way, americans ideals of music are pretty lame too). last time i went 2 people got stabbed at the show and guess who the fucking perps werids from the wrong side of town that goddamn didnt want hardcore in this hood. because its close to the local islamic school. 

when my wife was 15 had her virginity taken from by being raped by a spanish migrant worker here in DC. im sure reddit will try to pin it on my wife and call me mr

we have no real ethnic ties back home to whatever fucking country we're from, we dont even know how to practice whatever culural beliefs our ancestors instilled in us.

i cant tell you how many german americans i know dont know what the fasching holiday is, or how many french americans dont even know what the bastille is. but these are the same people that say, "" im smart cuz im german"" or, ""i would know, my great grandmother is half french""

ive read both sides of this arguement. The Eu has evvery right to be fucking concerned just like these dumb dipshit americans are worried about when the cable is gonna come back online, or if daddy will put the rent on his credit card. germany is the size of oregon. there is not a lot of room for expansion. 

in my town if you killed a cow, you beter have a good fucking reason. that cow is the towns milk source, fertilizer,farm field manicurist and many times part of a local event. thats why you cant go to germany and get a 22 ounce teabone steak. theres not enough reesource to feed people like that, theres not enough real estate to maintain that kind of lifestyle. so how do theyfeed evveryone a good meal? grind the whole fucking cow up, put it in a sleevve, call it a bratwurst and that is how you order a steak in germany.. 

americans have a culture of around 300 years. i live , currently, in one of the oldest cities in america, fairfax va, its been here since 1750 or something. how cute.... my town in germany was founded by druids in 600 bc. was finally recognized as a township in 1132 AD and to this day only has 400 people in it. americans feel everything is theirs and not much is sacred. even thoguh the housing merket is bottoming out, i just saw several thousand acres of forest cleared and a bunch  more cookie cutter homes thrown up on them. no one has ever bought those houses and are still on the market empty a year and a half later. americans feel its their right to just continuosly build and build and build and thats fine, but its way beyond necessity.

and empty houses are great for people to smoke crack in. the cops are over there every night. 

most americans have never been told to stay at home because angry muslim youths had quite literally started a riot because chirac would not put into law the necessity for girls to wear burkhs in school. most americans have never had their cars torched or even seen a riot.

at the same time, reddit is right, this gonna get better but the EU has to be more firm and decide to take an active role in HOW THE IMIGRANTS  ARE INTEGRATING! That means a ""good ole fashion"" pie to your neighbor hospitality and letting them know its ok to integrate. 

my neighbor from egypt attempts once a month to cook a pie for my son my wife and I. he fails, but when he gets here with his lopsided shit with apples and shit hanging out everywhere, it doesnt matter. he comes in, we chat about cairo, airplanes, anything. that is integrating him. 

again a man i know in florida from sierra leone, an ex child soldier the victim of ""one love"" where they cut all your fingers but your thumbs off. (thumbs up, ONE LOOOOOVE, ITS FUCKING HORRIFYING). dude can cut grass better and faster than anyone.  hes awesome. he was a burden of sierra leone, a killer of many many innocents, and now, he is a contributor to ours. 

i luvthe shit out of everyone. but i will be damned to watch a place as beautiful europe or america for that matter just simply be whitewashed of its identity, when its been standing just fucking fine without a bunch of dumb fucking americans or religous zealots deciding its their turn to own this or that.

[Pardon my MS paint skills (or lack of).](http://imgur.com/Tb7E2.png)

Something about aquariums puts me in a trance, and I've always thought it would be pretty fun to turn one into the site of a rave. Ideally, I'd host it in an indoor octagon-shaped structure that's surrounded on all sides (barring entrances of course) by a domed saltwater fish tank. In the centre, a cylindrical tank serves as the post to erect all staff quarters around.

The big draw here would be the potential for unique lighting arrangements. There wouldn't be lights or laser arrangements affixed to the ceiling, but rather all lighting would be shone through the surrounding water. As a bonus, the central tank would have an arrangement of lights that would be synced to the beat of the bass, effectively bathing the entire structure in a rainbow from all sides.

This would be a relatively small rave by my standards, 2000-2500 tickets given out at most because I can't fucking *stand* trying to organise anything larger (it stops being about music and starts being about trying to manage a small city). 

Staff would be handpicked, and I'd make a point to include a lot of Eastern Europeans that I can trust to *do their job.* Many of these people were around for the original scenes, Chicago/Detroit/M25 Orbital, and are the best at what they do. 

Drugs would be limited to MDMA, possibly mushrooms and LSD if we could find a way to capitalise on them. No liquid E, no ket, nothing that involves fire (marijuana/salvia), and no alcohol. Liquids are only allowed if purchased on site to further profits and keep out banned substances. 

Music would have to maintain a steady and strong beat: a mix of Chicago/Deep House, Hard/Jumpstyle, maybe a bit of Baltimore Club. I'd really want to keep things on the slow side so that the central lights gently pulse rather than imitate a strobe light. 

We'd also have proper medical facilities on-site. Only being able to find one or two EMTs willing to work with you is frustrating, and the term ""hospital drop"" makes me cringe. Likewise, I'd try and keep it at least quasi-legal.

Weather-wise, pouring rain and a mid 30's-40's Celsius night, wind blowing. Indoors, AC would be set to 20c max, and I'd really strive to keep it that chilly (that would probably be the biggest challenge).

Last but not least, it would be a private event to ensure quality control as far as patrons are concerned. This is a rave, not a nightclub, and anyone wishing to treat it as such will be promptly fed to the fish in the massive tanks that surround it.  

edit: And as for atmosphere, the venue itself serves as atmosphere. With pulsing multi-coloured lighting beamed in from all sides, synced to a central control panel to remain consistent, and the fishy fishersons, it's basically like a massive kaleidoscope.

You say Sweden takes in the most number of immigrants per year in Europe. That does not tell us a thing about how everyday Swedish society treats these people. All you've done is update us on Swedish **government** policy.

As an African who lived in Germany for almost a decade, and heard these same vapid talking points, I can tell you, no one who is not an immigrant ever considers that there might be a problem with the host society.

The mindset that it is purely the fault of the immigrant for not integrating or for exploiting the system, is quite telling. And very unsurprising for someone like me: born in the 1st world, raised in the 3rd, educated in the 1st world system.

It never ceases to amaze me how similar in their perspectives both the immigrants and their host societies are: both feel ""our culture is the right one, why won't they see that. These fidiots!!""

What most people here in this thread are asking for is not integration. Integration is a mutual process. It requires change in **both** elements that are to be integrated with each other. And when you look at how many people get an aneurysm whenever someone tries to build a mosque in downtown Europe, or a Muslima wants to go to her job wearing a headscarf, you can see that it is **not** integration that is being asked for.

No, you're asking for the other thing: Assimilation. ""Abandon all your cultural values, because we are the ubermensch, you woman-defiling Muslim scum!""

There is a lot of subliminal/subconscious xenophobia in this thread. I'd like to say most of it is based on ignorance, not on intentional malice/hostility. Most of your European/American views on immigrants are formed by your mainstream mass media. And in Europe, you will admit, harping on those evil immigrants, will still win you votes on election day.

Integration. Most European countries, given their colonial past, would not even begin to know how to go about this. In everyday European society, the children of the 1st world are raised in the firm belief, that theirs is the superior culture, the superior form of government, the superior language etc. Such a perspective does not lend itself at all to an accomodating society, a society eager or at least not hellbent against evolving. 

Islamification. What does this buzzword mean? Saladin's hordes pouring into Europe on horseback, knocking your XBox controllers out of your kids' hands, beheading your fathers and abducting your mothers and sisters? Sharia? Armies of burka-clad women? Public whippings? 

Someone believes in a certain religion, and would find it neat if they had an appropriate house of worship to go with it, in their neighbourhood in Stockholm. Suddenly Sweden fears the Matrix is about to happen. ""Agent Ahmed is going to hook up good Swedish society into the mosque. The minarets are going to make the skyline ugly ..... because ..... well, we've never seen anything like it, and even though we pride ourselves at being the voice of reason, rationality and enlightenment .... we are not willing to broaden our horizon by learning about new things. After all, we already know everything there is to know.""

There are a huge number of European, American, Asian, Middle Eastern immigrants right here in Africa, believe it or not. I've lived both here and in Europe. I'll tell you this, we 3rd worlders are **A LOT** better at ""integrating"" into your shiny supreme ubersocieties.",False

If I *insert your name here* was moving to a different country, with a different culture, language, history, etc.  *I* would attempt to respect the different culture I found there *even if I didn't agree with the things they did*.  I may choose to abstain from certain customs that either made me uncomfortable, or which I could not reconcile with my own belief system, but I would *certainly not* attempt to make the people living around me change their own customs, and I would not attempt to have *my* beliefs written *their* code of law.  I would make a concerted effort to learn the language, understand their culture, make friends with the native people living around me, and would not sequester myself into an exclusively ex-patriot community.  I would *not* take advantage of their social system, and would not exploit loopholes in their legal system.  I would not instigate riots, or rape, or murder, or rob people there.  If I had moved there as part of escaping oppression, poverty, war, famine, etc. I would feel a debt of gratitude to this nation that had welcomed me into it's arms when I was in need.

I happen to think that these are perfectly reasonable things to do.  Furthermore, I think these are sufficient conditions for everyone getting along just fine (immigrants and natives).  

If I was moving into a new land, I would happily *SIGN A CONTRACT* to this effect, as it was what I already intended to do.  

I support the step that certain European nations are taking, which is to draft a contract for immigrants to sign.  Citizenship is a privilege.  If immigrants are unwilling to sign a contract that lined out the above points, they should not be allowed into the country.  If they are found to have violated this contract, they should be ejected from the country.

BTW - These images seem to not be loading right now, but one of them is an X-Ray of a woman who had what looks like a can of spray paint rammed all the way up her vagina into her stomach.  Usually, they impale the vaginas of women and the asses of men with broom handles though.  The genitals of farmers are usually burned.  I wouldn't be surprised if they rape the women before AND AFTER burning their vaginas with irons.

The scariest of the links above is the one where white gunshot victims are reported to have died from ""natural causes"".  The South African government does this to hide statistics and piss of white farmers.

Europe would turn into South Africa if it were not for the Arabs.  I think as long as white people obey the Arabs, then they don't have to worry about their genitals being burned.  This would not be the case under Black rule.  The only reason a Rwandan style genocide hasn't happened in South Africa is because the ANC knows white countries will be watching them.  What if their are no more white countries to watch South Africa?...  or the UK?...  or Romania?

The Europeans NEED the Arabs to save them from themselves.  The Arabs don't have the flaw of being overly tolerant like Whites.  It has nothing to do with religion, it has to do with genetics.  And White people definitely have a fucked up flaw.

Arabs and Blacks DO NOT get along.  The Middle East received as many salves as the America's, so why aren't their black people in the Middle East today?  Because the Arabs castrated their slaves.  Arabs were not tolerant like whites in the 1700's, and they won't be in the future either.

Really? While looking for their dataset, I found this statement from [their website](http://www.uah.edu/News/climatebackground.php) says:

""From Nov. 16, 1978, through June 30, 2007, the global lower troposphere has warmed about 0.4 Celsius (about 0.72° Fahrenheit), or global warming at the rate of approximately 1.4 C (about 2.52° Fahrenheit) per century.

**Most of the warming that accounts for that trend, however, has happened since January 1998 in the northernmost third of the globe.** "" (emphasis added)

And from [another UAH page](http://urnet.uah.edu/tempnews/climate.html)


""In a recent scientific comparison, the UAH team found that the UAH satellite dataset agreed exceptionally well with several long-term temperature datasets prepared by NOAA, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the Hadley Centre of the British Meteorology Office, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts.""

Which seems to indicate that it would agree well with the datasets used by NOAA and the Hadley Centre (respectively, I believe the GISS dataset and the CRU dataset, which agree very closely except that the GISS set shows a little more warming, due to including the arctic, which CRU excludes).

Furthermore, I actually found the [UAH dataset](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/msu.html), and graphed it a bit. I tried a few options, but not being a professional, and not having a huge amount of time to spend on the subject, the main things I tried were as follows;

1) graphing monthly trends by year for 1997-2008
2) averaging monthly data for each year, graphing this average for the above years
3) taking the previous averages, and creating 5 year running averages, and graphing these for the same years.

For the lower troposphere:

The first of these showed that nearly all but 2 months had an upward trend over time, but it was very noisy; 5 year averages of the monthly trends probably would have resolved the noise from unusually warm or cold years, but this would have been a lot more work, and the results should be similar to the results from (3).

(2) showed exactly what Lindzen claimed - noisy data with little overall trend. A linear trendline had an r-squared of .0067! However, this data suffers from the previously-discussed problem of being unduly affected by single exceptional years. Therefore, (3) should give us a picture which gets rid of some of the noise from years which are not representative of other years around the same time.

And, when (3) is graphed, it shows a very similar picture to what the CRU dataset did. Every year after 2004 has a higher 5 year average than any year prior to that time period. 2002 had a higher 5 year average than any year prior to it, as did 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005, and 2006. The 5-year average anomaly in 1997 was 0.00483, and the 5-year average in 2008 was .226. A linear* trendline had an r-squared of .7476, which isn't entirely stellar, although both endpoints were exceptionally cold - removing those two years increases the r-squared to .85. The coefficient of the trendline is .0185, indicating a .185 degree increase per decade - very similar to the 1.9 degrees per century long-term warming estimate from temperature records, and faster than the 1.4 degrees per century rate estimated by UAH using UAH data from 11/16/78 through 6/30/07.

For the upper troposphere, I decided to only repeat (2) and (3);

(2) again showed a noisy signal, similar to what Lindzen claimed

(3) showed a somewhat different picture, although less substantial than in the lower troposphere. In this region of the atmosphere, 2005, 2006, and 2007 were still the warmest years, but the difference between them and earlier years was smaller. Meanwhile, 2008 was substantially cooler in the upper troposphere than the lower troposphere, making it cooler than 2002 and 2004, and only slightly warmer than 2001. 1997 is still the coolest year on the chart by a substantial margin. A linear trendline had an r-squared value of only .4863, so it's not very helpful here. Removing 1997 and 2008 increases the r-squared to .6232, which is still not very impressive. However, even if a trendline here isn't very accurate, it's clear that there's an overall increase.


&gt; Further, either data set show very little change compared to the two major multi-decade warming periods of last century. Your disagreement here may be something of a nit-pick.

Except that, as I showed above, the UAH data from the lower troposphere (the area closest to the surface, and therefore most relevant here) shows an *above-average* warming trend over the last 12 years. Especially given the fact that *he* pointed out the problem with using anomalous years as reference points, one would expect that he would be familiar with the techniques for dealing with such problems. Yet in order to make his point, he completely ignored such solutions and instead made the same mistake he claims others made. Does this seem honest to you?

&gt; You are assuming he is reference the same dataset as you.

Well, it is possible he is using a different dataset. There are only a few major instrumental records from this time that I know of, though. Satellite data wasn't collected until the late 1970s, and radiosonde data from that time is widely considered dubious. This leaves the ground station records like CRU and GISS, which agree closely. I can't imagine what dataset he could be using that would show such wildly different results.

&gt; I guess I don't follow. The way I read his statement is that the models included all natural forcings the scientists were aware of and came up short. They there for concluded that human activity accounted for the rest.

This is only part of it, though. It is true that they did that. However, they also did things like modeling the expected forcing due to manmade factors, and found that these could more than account for the difference (just to name an example off the top of my head). They also used models to predict the *pattern* of warming which would occur due to various forcings, and found that predictions of greenhouse gas forcing closely matched the observations. Predictive success is a hallmark of a good theory. If his complaint is that, no matter how closely the data matches what we would expect if it were true, it *could* be some unidentified, unobserved alternate explanation, well, yes, that could be the case, if something else unidentified were counteracting the vast majority of anthropogenic forcings, but postulating an unidentified alternate explanation in place of something known and sufficient to explain the phenomenon is not a very good scientific practice. If he personally believes it to be the case, he should continue doing research to falsify the current model, and demonstrate a better explanation. Until he has done so, the science doesn't support his position, and he shouldn't claim that it does.

&gt; In other words, I read the sentence as saying that the modelling centers have since included natural cycles such as oceanic (multi)decadal warming that were not included when the models first appeared, and that is why the models back then predicted warming through the last decade that has not occurred.

Well, first of all, warming has occurred, according to the data I showed above. But, even if it hadn't, I do not know of a single model which *ever* failed to include such things. Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of the IPCC first assessment report, so I cannot confirm that their range of predictions included zero increase in temperatures for 10 years, but everything I have ever heard from atmospheric scientists about modeling (and I've been hearing this for more than 10 years) indicates that they were well aware of the possibility of annual variability due to natural cycles temporarily overcoming warming due to human influences. I would be surprised if the majority of the models used even in AR1 would fail to include such common knowledge, and if they didn't, I would be shocked if there wasn't a disclaimer in the text acknowledging the uncertainty on the subject.

&gt; I see no problem with your logic except that you are assuming a static air mass as opposed to a moving air mass. I see no reason he chose to include what he said since it doesn't seem to add anything to the discussion.

Well, I'm not assuming a static air mass - obviously, clouds move over time. When I said that clouds are a local phenomenon, I was referring specifically to how cloud formation is highly dependent on local conditions (such as presence of particulate matter to form the nucleus of the cloud). But we don't seem to particularly disagree on this topic, I just wanted to clarify what I meant a little better.

Magnetic heat shield test could use Russian launcher

By Rob Coppinger

European researchers developing a magnetic heat shield that could augment or replace the traditional ablative materials hope to make a test flight in the next decade.

Under development by EADS Astrium, with support from German aerospace centre DLR and the European Space Agency, the magnetic field-protected vehicle will be launched from a submarine on a suborbital trajectory to land in the Russian Kamchatka region.

As a capsule re-enters the atmosphere the air heats up around it due to friction and usually a high-temperature-resistant material is needed to absorb that. A magnetic field is able to deflect the hot atmospheric air away from the vehicle's surface, reducing or eliminating the need for a heat-absorbing material.

A super-conducting coil will generate the magnetic field that would extend out beyond the leading edge of the vehicle. Assessment of the coil is ongoing.

Magnetic heat shield test vehicle
 

""We are gaining more momentum. The DLR is on board. The plan is [to launch] three years after [approval],"" Astrim's Detlev Konigorski, said at the European air and space conference 2009 in Manchester in October.

The flight test would use a Russian Volna rocket, which is able to launch a 650kg (1,430lb) payload. The Volan capsule will be the payload for the flight test.

I disagree. A good ""civic culture"" policy should ensure that their populace is tolerant of other cultures in general, not that they can pick and choose particular groups.

In addition, there are groups who migrated centuries ago that still are discriminated against (see African descendants in the Americas). The same usually does not happen against European descendants (maybe against Italians in the Bronx, but not against British or German descendants).

&gt; *making policy that encourages/allows large amount of a particular immigrant group in immigrate to an area*

That policy is called **economic growth** -- compare the inflow of Latin American immigrants into the US with the economic cycle of the source and target countries. Does that mean government officials shouldn't encourage economic growth while their populace is intolerant?

But if by *making policy* you mean immigration control, what you are referring to is actually the ratio between legal and illegal immigration, not gross immigration.

If you want to stop immigration altogether, you need to make your country a really *sucky* place to be living in (like mine).

Oh, *The Onion* also offers [some cool tips](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/48729 ""Preventing Illegal Immigration"") on preventing immigration.

I fully support the notion of immigration, but it has to be done in such a way so to prevent the majority of fraud that seems to be occurring, whether it's in Sweden, the US, the UK, or wherever.  

For mainstream politicians to avoid this issue for fear of being labeled racist or xenophobic will simply allow hate groups to seize the initiative and take advantage of the anger over taxpayer money being wasted.  This is part of the reason the BNP is winning seats in the EU parliament, because the other parties are too concerned about image to deal with it, leaving the extremist groups to be the only ones ""representing the people"" on the issue. 

I'm not quite willing to buy into the whole ""blame the poor"" aspect of it.  The fact they *are* poor is one of the motivating factors for them immigrating, legally or illegally.  There's plenty of success stories of poor immigrants coming to the US and becoming doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.  There's also plenty of poor people who become criminals.  In between those two, you have those who may not have great success financially, but are happy with their lives.

I'm happy to welcome anyone into my country (US) who is honest, hardworking, and willing to obey it's laws and enjoy it's freedoms, whether as a resident alien or someone seeking citizenship, but nobody wants anyone else's criminals (not talking about genuine asylum seekers), nor should any country have to.

Smaller countries such as the UK and Sweden need to be careful about the numbers they let in though, not out of racial or religious fears, but by simple economics.  The UK is an island, and there's only so much space for living, only so many jobs, and so much money to go around.  The US, being larger, has a little more room to maneuver, but even its resources are not inexhaustible.

I'm from Texas, I'm 21, and my semester abroad in Prague comes to an end at the end of December. Housing cost me $500 for the entire semester. Couchsurfing.org + hitchhiking/cheap train tickets got me all over Europe for cheap. Round trip plane ticket cost me $650 which is two weeks of summer work or one month of rent where I would have lived in Austin, TX. I grew up in Texas as a triplet (two sisters my age). When college age came around for the three of us, my father refused to take out loans. I applied for as many scholarships as I felt like writing essays for and got my UT education OVERfunded. 

If you don't want to sit in a cubicle and shuffle papers for 70 hours a week, don't get a job where you sit in an office and shuffle papers for 70 hours a week. If you like programming/tech, move to Austin and take part in one of the ludicrous amounts of tech startups/businesses.

Make your life happen, man. You aren't exactly pioneering some sort of crossroads the rest of the world hasn't had to deal with.

Why is everything so instantly unattainable in your head? Have you ever actually looked into the possibility of traveling Europe for less than your spring rent in America? Have you actually looked into buying your own log cabin, living minimally and self-sufficiently? When I was 19, I went on a trip to Thailand with some graduating UT seniors. We went to Thailand and lived like millionaires for $8/night rent. One week of summer work paid for a month of rent.

If you do try that route go Navy. #1 if you are as intelligent as you seem by your note, you will be over qualified and to smart for any enlistment you take. So with that knowledge just know you will probably spend a lot of time getting your hands dirty or standing very long watches no matter your choice in branch of service. This brings me to my #2 free travel! If you want to see the world you can do more in a four year tour stationed over seas in the Navy than you will in a career in any other branch. In the four years I served I saw Perth, Freemantle, and Sydney Australia; Seoul, S. Korea; Singapore , Malaysia; Hong Kong, China; Phuket, and Pattaya Thialand; Dubai, and Jubal Ali, United Arab Emirates; all while living in Yokosuka Japan 80 miles from Tokyo. Needless to say I had a blast, I worked my ass off, but I had a lot of fun and made some great friends I still keep in touch with. So IF you want to go the military way, that's the one. Plus you can earn money for school. 

My advice though is to slow down and take your time. Keep in school and just enjoy life. Forget Europe go backpacking through the U.S. You'd be surprised how much you can see and do for free here in the states with just a will and motivation. Sure you may have to wash a dish or two to get a little pocket money or a meal, but if it is adventure you want, there is plenty to be had here in the States. Then after a few years after you've seen and done all you want, you go back to school and finish up there and find your way in this crazy world. At 19 you have your whole life ahead of you. I got my degree at 27, and I'm now doing very well for myself only 2 years later. I'm just glad I did the Navy thing first to appreciate the world and see that education is VERY important. Sure it may be easy for you because you are very smart, but how else do you prove how smart you are to everyone else without a piece of paper to break that ice? Hell if you really want to do something, find a need in your market and start your own business. Why work for someone else when you can be your own boss. No matter what you choose, good luck to you.

My name is Mr.Moses Odiaka.I work in the credit and accounts department of 
Union Bank of NigeriaPlc,Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a 
foreign customer with a Domicilliary account. His name is Engineer Manfred 
Becker. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria 
during the reign of late General Sani Abacha.

Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Manfred Becker, who was an 
oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records 
and accounts and since then nobody has come to claim the money in this a/c 
as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $18.5mllion in his a/c 
and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or 
password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now,there is nobody in 
that position to produce the needed information other than my very self 
considering my position in the bank.

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as 
next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the 
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore 
bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the 
only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from 
the safe.By so doing, what is required is to send an aplication laying 
claims of the deposit on your name as next of kin to the late Engineer. I 
will need your full name and address telephone/fax number,company or 
residential, also your bank name and account,where the money will be 
transfer into.

Finally i want you to understand that the request for a foreigner as the 
next of kin is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When 
you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split 
between us and others we shall also speak in details.I am currently in

**JUSTIFYING MARITAL VIOLENCE**

*A German Judge Cites Koran in Divorce Case*

By Veit Medick and Anna Reimann

He beat her and threatened her with murder. But because husband and wife were both from Morocco, a German divorce court judge saw no cause for alarm. It's a religion thing, she argued.

The case seems simply too strange to be true. A 26-year-old mother of two wanted to free herself from what had become a miserable and abusive marriage. The police had even been called to their apartment to separate the two -- both of Moroccan origin -- after her husband got violent in May 2006. The husband was forced to move out, but the terror continued: Even after they separated, the spurned husband threatened to kill his wife.

A quick divorce seemed to be the only solution -- the 26-year-old was unwilling to wait the year between separation and divorce mandated by German law. She hoped that as soon as they were no longer married, her husband would leave her alone. Her lawyer, Barbara Becker-Rojczyk agreed and she filed for immediate divorce with a Frankfurt court last October. They both felt that the domestic violence and death threats easily fulfilled the ""hardship"" criteria necessary for such an accelerated split.

In January, though, a letter arrived from the judge adjudicating the case. **The judge rejected the application for a speedy divorce by referring to a passage in the Koran that some have controversially interpreted to mean that a husband can beat his wife. It's a supposed right which is the subject of intense debate among Muslim scholars and clerics alike.""The exercise of the right to castigate does not fulfill the hardship criteria as defined by Paragraph 1565 (of German federal law),"" the daily Frankfurter Rundschau quoted the judge's letter as saying. It must be taken into account, the judge argued, that both man and wife have Moroccan backgrounds.**

**""The husband can beat his wife""**

""The right to castigate means for me: the husband can beat his wife,"" Becker-Rojczyk said, interpreting the judge's verdict.

In an interview with SPIEGEL ONLINE, Becker-Rojczyk said the judge indicated to her that it makes no sense to insist on an accelerated divorce. The judge's advice? Wait for the year-long waiting period to elapse.

The lawyer and her client were shocked. Immediately, they filed a claim alleging that the judge should have recused herself due to a conflict of interest. They felt that, because of the point of view presented by the judge, she was unable to reach an objective verdict. In the reply sent to Becker-Rojczyk, the judge expressly referred to a Koran verse -- or sura -- which indicates that a man's honor is injured when his wife behaves in an unchaste manner. ""Apparently the judge deems it unchaste when my client adapts a Western lifestyle,"" Becker-Rojczyk said.

On Tuesday evening, Becker-Rojczyk expressed amazement that the judge was still on the bench, given that the controversial verdict was handed down weeks ago. Becker-Rojczyk had elected to go public with the case to attract attention to the judge's conduct. It seems to have worked. On Wednesday, after the Tuesday evening publication of the story on SPIEGEL ONLINE, the attorney received a fax from the Frankfurt court granting the conflict of interest claim and excusing the judge from the case.

Still, it is unlikely that the case will be heard again before the mandated year of separation expires in May. But the judge who heard the case may have to face further consequences for her decision. On Wednesday, numerous politicians in Berlin voiced their horror at the verdict -- and demanded disciplinary action against the judge.

""In my opinion, this is a case of extreme violation of the rule of law that can't be solved with a mere conflict of interest ruling,"" Social Democrat parliamentarian Dieter Wiefelspütz told SPIEGEL ONLINE. ""There have to be further consequences. This is a case for judicial supervision -- this case needs to be further investigated.""

The deputy floor leader for the Christian Democrats, Wolfgang Bosbach, agreed. ""This is a sad example of how the conception of the law from another legal and cultural environment is taken as the basis for our own notion of law,"" he said on Wednesday.

This isn't the first time that German courts have used cultural background to inform their verdicts. Christa Stolle of the women's rights organization Terre des Femmes said that in cases of marital violence, there have been a number of cases where the perpetrator's culture of origin has been considered as a mitigating circumstance -- although such verdicts have become seldom in recent years.

But there remains quite a bit of work to do. ""In my work educating sexist and short-sighted Muslim men,"" asked Michaela Sulaika Kaiser of the Network for Muslim Women, ""do I now have to convince German courts that women are also people on the same level with men and that they, like any other human, have the right to be protected from physical and psychological violence?""

Historically, Christianity (as was practiced in Europe) was all about ownership of women. Just look at the wedding ceremony - the ownership of the female passed from the father to the husband. That her presence in the church was sinful enough that when the priest kissed the husband (to confer the blessing of the church), the husband was to transfer some of that to the female with the magic phrase ""you may now kiss the bride."" All women had to be owned: by their fathers, husbands, brothers or sons. And those without worldly men to own them, they were to be owned by the church (as nuns or beguines), and for the remainder, the only male left to own the remaining (unowned) women was satan.   

Alternatively, the reason for the tight control over women was to ensure that the children produced were indeed the offspring of the male. Which is why we're still so obsessed with the ""legitimacy"" of children. ",False

No, the problem is the new legal body formed under the treaty of Lisbon puts no EU member first, instead it puts a collective EU state legal body first.  What you arguably have there is something that will benefit a hierarchy but in doing so may malign the majority within it - and *all* at the whim of non-elected officials.

&gt;Perhaps the number one point which illustrates this best is the adoption of the Euro. WHY haven't we adopted it?

Talk to Spain!  The one thing that is harming them now as a net contributor is that they no longer control their own mechanisms to encourage investment.  They've lost control of their own currency.  What Spain is crying out for can't be given because it is contrary to what other EU states need.  They've pretty much been told to muddle through.  Irish businesses have expressed the same concerns.  That's not to say that a middle ground couldn't be found for the UK - but the idea of killing the pound isn't an argument that makes too much sense right now.

&gt;Newsflash: we don't have an empire any more. 

Good.  I don't see the need to join one either!  And that is the pro-EU argument at the moment that Europe needs a united voice to compete on the global market in making it more relevant to the other world powers.

I'd quite happily see the UK as a outsider but within the EEA - best of both worlds.

&gt;We expect the EU to bend to our every whim, and then when it doesn't (i.e: most of the time) the anti-EU people get all stroppy.

Yet nobody said that.  What you did do is make an argument against people anti-EU without addressing either what has been said or arguing something pro-EU.  In short: spin.  A pro-EU argument can be made, you're not making it.

&gt;We are a tiny group of islands with a government who would rather be closer to America than the European mainland. 

Again, false argument.  We just ratified Lisbon.  We just ignored the multi-platform call for referendum.  It's not an either or argument either.  You can be both, or neither.  What you have just acknowledged indirectly is that most people would prefer agreements with the US than common governance with another power - the new legal personhood of the EU state.  Why not have the same relationship with both?

&gt;If we ACTIVELY TOOK PART in the EU rather than sitting around moaning about it, people would be a lot more pro-Europe

That's not an argument, that's subjection.  We do take part in Europe.  The people moaning are the ones who point out that they're having their democracy and representation stolen.  And on paper they're right - it is unarguably less representative.  I've just to see an argument justifying it for being so.

&gt;Just take a holiday on the European mainland or something - they have been served well by Europe because they don't sit around whining about losing their sovereignty.

&gt;Ordinarily the cattle would be killed humanely with an electric bolt, but for months the abattoir had been on a special kosher order for America. By rabbinical law the animals had to have their throats slit and then be hung upside down to bleed to death. The tubes twisted so the animals were turned on their backs. As they reached the end, chains were wrapped around their hind legs. A crane shot the cattle into the air one by one and snapped their back legs. Then a fork was inserted into each beast's nose as one of two Jewish butchers blessed the long knife in his hand, said a short prayer and slit the throat of the animal which was then pulled higher into the air, the blood pouring in sheets from its neck and its front legs kicking wildly. We would sometimes watch in horrified fascination from a window above the killing box as the creatures were hauled along the bleeding trough in their final throes. Once a thrashing cow hurled itself against the window where we stood, shattering the glass and spattering us with gore. You could not watch for long.  Bob Geldof, *Is That It?*

You say Israel gave out visas to whole families, because one Russian grandparent belongs there.

They should be considerate about the Israelian way of life, even if it's only for an economic step up. That's common courtesy and it's lacking, just as our Muslim immigrants. If it doesn't dissappear after several generations, it's a problem and will cause a stir in any country.

I agree with your lesson, unfortunately immigration can come without invitation, as in our case.

The judge incorrectly took it upon herself to apply an ""Islamic"" bent to her ruling because the parties involved were Muslims. It is indeed racist, paternalistic and inappropriate, but it's relevant to my point because it demonstrates that:

1. It is **not always** a good idea to bow to the customs/law of other cultures out of a sense of cultural sensitivity.
2. There are indeed examples of extreme Islamic law influencing and operating within the legal system of European countries.

Spiegel ALSO published an article that is critical of a [""chain"" of recent rulings that have taken aspects of Sharia law into secular courtrooms](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,474629,00.html), so not only is this not an isolated case but it's an example of what I was saying - an improper infringement of religious thought on explicitly non-religious sectors. 

I think it's even more dangerous that in this woman's case, she was looking for help from what should have been an entirely secular entity (the court). Instead, out of a sense of misguided and extreme cultural relativism, the judge applied the law of the victim's home country/religion. This is the so-called ""line in the sand"" that I'm talking about. As in the Spiegel article I linked, it's clear that the cases with the halal butcher and employee who was barred from praying were correctly decided in their favor. But these rulings relied on the promise of freedom of religion/expression - a foundation of secular law - and NOT on Islamic law, as the example of the divorce did. I strongly believe that cultural liberties end firmly at the doorstep of secular law. 

It's really simple: Islamic law, Judeo-Christian law, NONE of it should influence the way a country is presently run. This separation should not be compromised in an effort to respect other cultures or religions. 

Do you disagree? Do you believe that culture trumps all and that there should be a limitless acceptance of the beliefs and practices of an immigrant group by the native population?

What did Andrew do?

In 1837, a little known scientist named Andrew Crosse created life in his personal laboratory.  Although it was accomplished entirely by accident, Andrew carefully documented his procedures and several members of the London Electrical Society were able to duplicate the incident including the infamous Michael Faraday.

The Experiments

In Crosse's electrical experiments, he was supposedly attempting to create glass crystals.  As Colin Wilson explains in his book The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries

    He made glass out of grounded flint and potassium carbonate, and dissolved it in hydrochloric acid.  His idea was then to allow this fluid to dry, little by little, through a lump of porous stone which had been 'electrified' by a battery, and to see whether it formed crystals.

Crystals were not formed but Crosse noticed a curious side effect.  On the porous stone he noticed many small white lumps.  He then decided to let the experiment continue.  After a week he noted hand like extensions growing out of the white lumps.   Later he could tell that they were legs.  After four weeks the creatures could easily been seen under a magnifying glass walking around.  They appeared to be small insect like creatures.  Thinking that possibly insect eggs had contaminated his controlled experiment, he decided to give it another shot and this time carefully control the influence of outside variables.

This time Crosse use air tight containers.  Beforehand, all the components were completely sterilized using hot alcohol.  The electrical wire entered the sealed container through a glass stopper.  The glass was made at a temperature that would melt iron and distilled water was used to mix the concoction, consisting of iron sulfate, copper sulfate, and copper nitrate.  Finally, the battery was connected and the slow dripping process began.  After a few months Crosse once again noticed the insect like creatures crawling around inside the controlled environment.  He was then certain that he had indeed created life.

Ecstatic with his discovery, he immediately documented the results and quickly sent them to the London Electrical Society.  Other engineers repeated the experiment with similar success.  Soon the entire world was aware of Crosse's experiments and his personal living hell began...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Crosse

Controversy

A few months after the 1836 Bristol meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Crosse had been conducting another electrocrystallization experiment when, on the 26th day of the experiment he saw what he described as ""the perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its tail."" More creatures appeared and two days later they moved their legs. Over the next few weeks, hundreds more appeared. They crawled around the table and hid themselves when they could find a shelter. Crosse identified them as being part of genus acarus.

Puzzled by the results, Crosse mentioned the incident to a couple of friends.[2] He also sent the results to the London Electrical Society.[citation needed] A local newspaper learned of the incident and published an article about the ""extraordinary experiment"" and named the insects Acarus crossii. The article was subsequently picked up elsewhere across the country and in Europe. Some of the readers apparently gained the impression that Crosse had somehow ""created"" the insects or at least claimed to have done so.[2] He received angry letters in which he was accused of blasphemy[2] and trying to take God's place as a creator. Some of them included death threats. Local farmers blamed him for the blight of the wheat crop and commissioned an exorcism in the nearby hills.[citation needed] Opposition to Crosse was so fanatical and visceral that he had to withdraw to the solitude of his mansion Fyne Court.[citation needed]

Other scientists tried to repeat the experiment. W. H. Weeks took extensive measures to assure a sealed environment for his experiment by placing it inside a bell jar. He obtained the same results as Crosse, but due to the controversy that Crosse's experiment had sparked his work was never published. In February 1837 many newspapers reported that Michael Faraday had also replicated Crosse's results. However, this was not true. Faraday had not even attempted the experiment. Later researchers, such as Henry Noad and Alfred Smee, were unable to replicate Crosse's results. Crosse did not claim that he created the insects; he instead assumed that there were embedded insect eggs in his samples. Later commentators agreed that the insects were probably cheese or dust mites that had contaminated Crosse's instruments.

There is some speculation that this was the inspiration for Frankenstein,[6][7] despite his most notorious experiments coming almost 20 years after the novel’s publication.[8] Mary Shelley knew Crosse, through a common friend, the poet Robert Southey.[citation needed] Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin attended a lecture by Crosse in December 1814 in London, in which he explained his experiments with atmospheric electricity. Edward W. Cox wote a report of their visits to Fyne Court to see Crosse's work in the Taunton Courier in Autumn 1836.[9] This speculation may have arisen after the 1998 publication of the book Frankenstein's Children: Electricity, Exhibition, and Experiment in Early-Nineteenth- Century London.[10]",False

NASA Astronaut Harrison Schmitt: Man-Made Global Warming Hoax!

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-ambler/mr-gore-apology-accepted_b_154982.html

Mr. Gore: Apology Accepted

You are probably wondering whether President-elect Obama owes the world an apology for his actions regarding global warming. The answer is, not yet. There is one person, however, who does. You have probably guessed his name: Al Gore.

Mr. Gore has stated, regarding climate change, that ""the science is in."" Well, he is absolutely right about that, except for one tiny thing. It is the biggest whopper ever sold to the public in the history of humankind.

What is wrong with the statement? A brief list:

1. First, the expression ""climate change"" itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will. There has been no stable period of climate during the Holocene, our own climatic era, which began with the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago. During the Holocene there have been numerous sub-periods with dramatically varied climate, such as the warm Holocene Optimum (7,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C., during which humanity began to flourish, and advance technologically), the warm Roman Optimum (200 B.C. to 400 A.D., a time of abundant crops that promoted the empire), the cold Dark Ages (400 A.D. to 900 A.D., during which the Nile River froze, major cities were abandoned, the Roman Empire fell apart, and pestilence and famine were widespread), the Medieval Warm Period (900 A.D. to 1300 A.D., during which agriculture flourished, wealth increased, and dozens of lavish examples of Gothic architecture were created), the Little Ice Age (1300 to 1850, during much of which plague, crop failures, witch burnings, food riots -- and even revolutions, including the French Revolution -- were the rule of thumb), followed by our own time of relative warmth (1850 to present, during which population has increased, technology and medical advances have been astonishing, and agriculture has flourished).

So, no one needs to say the words ""climate"" and ""change"" in the same breath -- it is assumed, by anyone with any level of knowledge, that climate changes. That is the redundancy to which I alluded. The lie is the suggestion that climate has ever been stable. Mr. Gore has used a famously inaccurate graph, known as the ""Mann Hockey Stick,"" created by the scientist Michael Mann, showing that the modern rise in temperatures is unprecedented, and that the dramatic changes in climate just described did not take place. They did. One last thought on the expression ""climate change"": It is a retreat from the earlier expression used by alarmists, ""manmade global warming,"" which was more easily debunked. There are people in Mr. Gore's camp who now use instances of cold temperatures to prove the existence of ""climate change,"" which is absurd, obscene, even.

2. Mr. Gore has gone so far to discourage debate on climate as to refer to those who question his simplistic view of the atmosphere as ""flat-Earthers."" This, too, is right on target, except for one tiny detail. It is exactly the opposite of the truth.

Indeed, it is Mr. Gore and his brethren who are flat-Earthers. Mr. Gore states, ad nauseum, that carbon dioxide rules climate in frightening and unpredictable, and new, ways. When he shows the hockey stick graph of temperature and plots it against reconstructed C02 levels in An Inconvenient Truth, he says that the two clearly have an obvious correlation. ""Their relationship is actually very complicated,"" he says, ""but there is one relationship that is far more powerful than all the others, and it is this: When there is more carbon dioxide, the temperature gets warmer."" The word ""complicated"" here is among the most significant Mr. Gore has uttered on the subject of climate and is, at best, a deliberate act of obfuscation. Why? Because it turns out that there is an 800-year lag between temperature and carbon dioxide, unlike the sense conveyed by Mr. Gore's graph. You are probably wondering by now -- and if you are not, you should be -- which rises first, carbon dioxide or temperature. The answer? Temperature. In every case, the ice-core data shows that temperature rises precede rises in carbon dioxide by, on average, 800 years. In fact, the relationship is not ""complicated."" When the ocean-atmosphere system warms, the oceans discharge vast quantities of carbon dioxide in a process known as de-gassing. For this reason, warm and cold years show up on the Mauna Loa C02 measurements even in the short term. For instance, the post-Pinatubo-eruption year of 1993 shows the lowest C02 increase since measurements have been kept. When did the highest C02 increase take place? During the super El Niño year of 1998.

3. What the alarmists now state is that past episodes of warming were not caused by C02 but amplified by it, which is debatable, for many reasons, but, more important, is a far cry from the version of events sold to the public by Mr. Gore.

Meanwhile, the theory that carbon dioxide ""drives"" climate in any meaningful way is simply wrong and, again, evidence of a ""flat-Earth"" mentality. Carbon dioxide cannot absorb an unlimited amount of infrared radiation. Why not? Because it only absorbs heat along limited bandwidths, and is already absorbing just about everything it can. That is why plotted on a graph, C02's ability to capture heat follows a logarithmic curve. We are already very near the maximum absorption level. Further, the IPCC Fourth Assessment, like all the ones before it, is based on computer models that presume a positive feedback of atmospheric warming via increased water vapor.

4. This mechanism has never been shown to exist. Indeed, increased temperature leads to increased evaporation of the oceans, which leads to increased cloud cover (one cooling effect) and increased precipitation (a bigger cooling effect). Within certain bounds, in other words, the ocean-atmosphere system has a very effective self-regulating tendency. By the way, water vapor is far more prevalent, and relevant, in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide -- a trace gas. Water vapor's absorption spectrum also overlays that of carbon dioxide. They cannot both absorb the same energy! The relative might of water vapor and relative weakness of carbon dioxide is exemplified by the extraordinary cooling experienced each night in desert regions, where water in the atmosphere is nearly non-existent.

If not carbon dioxide, what does ""drive"" climate? I am glad you are wondering about that. In the short term, it is ocean cycles, principally the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the ""super cycle"" of which cooling La Niñas and warming El Niños are parts. Having been in its warm phase, in which El Niños predominate, for the 30 years ending in late 2006, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation switched to its cool phase, in which La Niñas predominate.
Since that time, already, a number of interesting things have taken place. One La Niña lowered temperatures around the globe for about half of the year just ended, and another La Niña shows evidence of beginning in the equatorial Pacific waters. During the last twelve months, many interesting cold-weather events happened to occur: record snow in the European Alps, China, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, the Rockies, the upper Midwest, Las Vegas, Houston, and New Orleans. There was also, for the first time in at least 100 years, snow in Baghdad.

Concurrent with the switchover of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation to its cool phase the Sun has entered a period of deep slumber. The number of sunspots for 2008 was the second lowest of any year since 1901. That matters less because of fluctuations in the amount of heat generated by the massive star in our near proximity (although there are some fluctuations that may have some measurable effect on global temperatures) and more because of a process best described by the Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark in his complex, but elegant, work The Chilling Stars. In the book, the modern Galileo, for he is nothing less, establishes that cosmic rays from deep space seed clouds over Earth's oceans. Regulating the number of cosmic rays reaching Earth's atmosphere is the solar wind; when it is strong, we get fewer cosmic rays. When it is weak, we get more. As NASA has corroborated, the number of cosmic rays passing through our atmosphere is at the maximum level since measurements have been taken, and show no signs of diminishing. The result: the seeding of what some have taken to calling ""Svensmark clouds,"" low dense clouds, principally over the oceans, that reflect sunlight back to space before it can have its warming effect on whatever is below.

Svensmark has proven, in the minds of most who have given his work a full hearing, that it is this very process that produced the episodes of cooling (and, inversely, warming) of our own era and past eras. The clearest instance of the process, by far, is that of the Maunder Minimum, which refers to a period from 1650 to 1700, during which the Sun had not a single spot on its face. Temperatures around the globe plummeted, with quite adverse effects: crop failures (remember the witch burnings in Europe and Massachusetts?), famine, and societal stress.

There are also small budget airlines you can use if you'd rather visit cities at a long distance - say Rome to Berlin. www.whichbudget.com and www.flycheapo.com can show you which airlines fly into / out of specific cities. 

Europe is a big place. We can probably give better recommendations if we had a better idea of what you want to see or do, when you want to go, what kind of budget you have (hostels or hotels, backpack or suitcase). Although 2 weeks may sound like a long time, there is no way to see everything in such a short amount of time. 

Best recommendation I have is to travel as though you'll be returning. Don't try to do everything. If you miss something, just tell yourself that you'll catch it on the next trip. This allows you to be a bit more free and you can stumble onto some great things that way. If you're rushing to check things off of your list of tourist attractions, you'll miss out on the slower pace and hidden gems. Just repeat: ""It may be my first time here, but it won't be my last."" 

Second recommendation is pack light. This goes for a traveler on any budget.

Went to uni, avoided a near pregnancy from a marriage-obsessed girl, got my degree and a good job. Left the job after 8 years and retired because I knew how to manage my money and didn't waste it on women, toys, a house, some snot-nosed little shits, or all the other social-seeking consumerist crap.

Yesterday I'm flipping through the channels and I see that Tara has a show on ""How To Trap A Man Into Marriage."" Thanks Tara, I wrote them all down and am immune to them now too. In every relationship I've been in the woman falls hard and then all this pressure is put on her by her family to get married and ""settle down."" It doesn't come from within.

All you men posting that you couldn't be happier...I question your imagination, or mourn the manipulation that you've suffered which told you to simply resign yourself that you **can't** be happier, because it's easier to live someone else's dream than living an authentic life. Maybe you were a dateless loser, or maybe you dated so many women that the one who knew how to use her pinky during blowjobs became The One. Or she liked video games and you figured that`s a decent enough reason to spend the rest of your life with someone.

I understand. Life is hard. Enjoy your tv, your beer, and your golden ball and chain. I'm happy you found something that made you think you're happy, and that's all that matters in the long run. 

An awakened life takes effort. It takes drive. If you can't be alone without being lonely, you're doing it wrong. It's too bad you had to pay through the nose on the way in (and even more on the way out) to recognize that. And my bitterness stems from the predominantly-fascist reaction to my refusal to play this game, further entrenching me in my position that marriage and kids are a lower-to-middle-class tradition -- that keeps you there for life.

Here was the trip: Landed in **Rome**. It was great, but expensive. Even if you are not religious, the Vatican and Sistine Chapel are totally worth it.

Then I took the train to **Venice**. That was enough train for me. It was nice, easy to use, etc, but planes are still faster and better if you have a lot of luggage. Trains are only good if you don't have a lot of luggage.

Venice was worth a stay, but even more expensive than Rome. You can walk everywhere, and taxi's are actually extremely expensive boats. Cost me a $100 just to get to the airport.

Next stop: **Poland** (Warsaw). Warsaw is ok, but Krakow is a better place for a tourist. Prices are great, but they don't use Euros yet (can get good exchange easily, though).

**Berlin:** After speaking at a conference (my reason for being in Europe) I did sight seeing. Berlin wall has only a small part left. Germans eat flavorless hotdogs and call them food, but the beer is great. Don't buy a piece of the Berlin wall unless it has a certificate - Germans have sold enough ""pieces of the Berlin wall"" by now to rebuild the wall 3 times over.

Next stop was **Amsterdam**. The red light district was very interesting, and when your hotel says ""No Smoking"" they really mean ""No smoking pot"" because it stinks up the rooms. Huge fines for this. The Ann Frank house made me sad, but was totally a must see. Home of Heineken beer

Next, **Belgium**. EU Headquarters, NATO Headquarters, and fine lace. But I really liked the chocolate. More than 400 different types of beer.

**Spain**. Mmmm. Tapas. And swords. Lot's of swords. Take a day trip to **Toledo** - totally worth it. Great shopping. Not so good for English speakers, but I had a great time.

**Overall**: it's an expensive trip, but fun. That second toilet beside the main one is not a European urinal - it's a bidet. You wash your butt with it. I'm worried that I feel a need to mention this...

tl;dr - Europe is cool, but expensive. Beer good. Trains only if you have little or no luggage, but they save you a lot of money.

It's good to be there for a few days and hit all the sights like the Collosseum, the palace, pantheon and the Vatican, but the people were rude, the city was covered in graffiti, broken windows and things were way overpriced.  It was also not safe.  I was glad I stayed right in the center of things, although I was still followed into my hotel with my wife and sister by some creep.  (I took August off and went to London, drove to Sherwood Forest, took the Euro*star* to Paris, then flew to Rome and drove from Rome through Piza to Florence to Venice)

I'd recommend going to Paris.  The City is BEAUTIFUL, there are so many things to see and the history is also amazing.  The people are also VERY friendly and willing to assist you and the weather is better than in Rome, and they have the best food and wine that I have had in as long as I can remember.  It did take 4 hours to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the view was beautiful.  The Louvre is literally an ALL DAY event.  We got a map, found the things we wanted to see and then mapped out a route that was the most time savvy, and we were still there a good 8 hours.  You also have the Palace of Versalles and the Catacombs, and the history of the French Revolution, the Moulin Rouge...

London was also very nice, people were polite and the city was CLEAN.  The Tube is MUCH nicer than the NYC MTA, but don't expect to eat too much meat.  You'll be lucky to find a hamburger.  Most likely you'll get fish-n-chips or some type of carbohydrate.

Going back to Italy, Florence was AWESOME.  It has enough to see in a few days, but it is totally laid back and the people were some of the most friendly I had met on my trip.  Piza is the same way, but the only real tourist attraction is the Leaning Tower.  The rest is as normal as a regular town in CA, except there are very little waves at their beach.
Venice is also nice, but you can really do everything in 2 days.  It's mostly just trinket shops EVERYWHERE with gondolas, which will cost about 100 euro, but are worth it.  We took a night ride.

I would definitely recommend an EYE WITNESS travel book on where you are going.  It tells you the history and significance of everything, translation pages self guides with maps and points of interest.  You can also get the Rick Steve's books or Europe on a Shoestring.  We took all of these and had a great time. As far as travel goes, STAY AWAY FROM RYAN AIR!  The airports they fly to are about an hours travel from any major city and you'll most likely have to take an expensive cab or commuter bus to the city.  

**I would highly recommend going to only 2 places in 2 weeks.  There is a lot to see and you don't want to spend many days traveling.**  This was the mistake we made.

My grandmother starts freaking out, but he quickly knocked a chunk out about the size of a fist, pocketed it, and then returned to the tour. It may not be as valuable as a piece of the wall from when it was officially torn down, but the story is infinitely more awesome.",False

In Europe, where carbon trading has been under way since 2005, energy corporations were asked how many permits they needed and were given that amount for free.

Solution: 

1) Determine the amount of carbon emitted by a company in the previous year.

2) Give that company enough permits to allow them to maintain this level of carbon emissions.

&gt;Here's the second problem. Cap and trade includes offsets -- a kind of carbon trading that allows polluters to finance projects outside the cap that purport to cut emissions, and then claim the cuts for their own. Even in theory, offsets don't lower emissions -- they simply move reductions from one place to another. In reality, offsets are rarely ""additional"" -- meaning that the cleaner projects were going to happen anyway. 

Solution: Do not include offsets in cap and trade, or ensure that such offsets are ""additional"".

You can easily indicate you are an English speaker simply by greeting someone with ""Hello"" and a smile.

Poland would be an obvious choice to ship Jews to since Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe.  They also exterminated most of the Jews very close to the end of the war when the work force was unnecessary because of limited supplies and the obvious impending loss of the war.

It was also around the time that the Soviet Union was retaking lost territory so yes it was either front lines or about to be front lines and the Nazis weren't about to let millions of Jews who they were treating like shit fall behind enemy lines to help fight against them.

Keep in mind I'm not even talking about any order to exterminate 6 million Jews or that 6 million Jews were exterminated, but those are both common strategies of people who try to deny a genocide and I'm afraid you've fallen for it.  

I debated Turks over both many times and two of their main points were that there was no explicit order saying ""we're committing genocide now"" and that there wasn't actually a million to a million and a half Armenians killed, but instead three hundred thousand.  They also claimed that it wasn't purposely a genocide, but instead all those Armenians died from a lack of supplies just like you're saying all those Jews died from a lack of supplies.  Genocide denial follows a pattern which is why I think a country should be forced to deal with a genocide they committed because there's strong pressure to pretend it never happened otherwise.

Getting to a place immediately, getting a shower, leaving your bag and exploring to find a better place for the rest of your stay is much better. 

I went travelling around more than 10 years ago and stayed for either 2 or 3 nights in each place. We hit Amsterdam, Brussells, Paris, Nice, Munich, Venice, Marseilles, Barcelona - not in that order. We had a very limited budget and decided not to have too much of an agenda so we weren't stressing about seeing things just to tick off some kind of list. We saw what we saw as we felt like it... but we're all from Europe so we knew it wasn't going to be hard to get back to somewhere if we really wanted to. If you're travelling with friends, make sure you all sit down at least once to be open about what you want from the trip - you don't want to get there and realise this person wants a fast, feature-filled trip while you want a chilled-out strollabout, whatever happens happens.

I highly recommend going to Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Florence. I've been to Rome and it is amazing and worth a visit but I put Florence above it. It's much more like walking around a live-in art gallery. Barcelona is one of the coolest places I've ever been, particularly the graffitti and really chilled out bars. Paris is gorgeous with amazing architecture and Amsterdam is just obvious really.

I also highly recommend learning at least the fundamentals of the languages, people really do appreciate that and it's only fair to try. At least be able to greet and thank people and ask in their language if they speak yours.

I would definitely recommend more than 2 weeks, since you are coming all the way across the pond. When I was inter-railing, it was 5 weeks which was about right I think. It all depends on how long you want to stay in one place, how many places you want to see and how far apart they are because travelling by train, if you do, can take up a fair bit of time. 

Enjoy!

Edit: I just noticed someone was suggesting Florence.. and If I had had more time.. then I would have probably gone to Florence after that 1 hr stop in Pisa.. also.. Milan and Torino were an option too.. Torino has a very nice Egyptian Museum.. and Milan... well.. you must at least look at the Alps once right? so.. yeah.. also.. keep in mind, the northern part of Italy is full of castles.. I would suggest driving towards Milan from Genoa.. and making a few stops every time you saw a really nice castle at the top one of the Piemont hills.  ",False

Sometimes you'll see a guy standing in prayer with half a dozen toddlers sitting or standing around his feet. If one of the kids gets fussy, a handoff to another adult will often quiet her. If anybody graduates from generic quiet kid babble into actual crying, then whoever has the child can easily walk outside for a minute or two until the noise stops.

We have a room downstairs with a couple of rocking chairs and a speaker, so nursing moms can step out as needed. Otherwise, our kids are full members of the community so they learn to worship with us. I like when toddlers who can barely talk, can sing parts of the familiar hymns and prayers.

Consider the case of Phil Jones, the director of the CRU and the man at the heart of climategate. According to one of the documents leaked from his center, between 2000 and 2006 Mr. Jones was the recipient (or co-recipient) of some $19 million worth of research grants, a sixfold increase over what he'd been awarded in the 1990s.

Why did the money pour in so quickly? Because the climate alarm kept ringing so loudly: The louder the alarm, the greater the sums. And who better to ring it than people like Mr. Jones, one of its likeliest beneficiaries?

Thus, the European Commission's most recent appropriation for climate research comes to nearly $3 billion, and that's not counting funds from the EU's member governments. In the U.S., the House intends to spend $1.3 billion on NASA's climate efforts, $400 million on NOAA's, and another $300 million for the National Science Foundation. American states also have a piece of the action, with California—apparently not feeling bankrupt enough—devoting $600 million to their own climate initiative. In Australia, alarmists have their own Department of Climate Change at their funding disposal.

And all this is only a fraction of the $94 billion that HSBC estimates has been spent globally this year on what it calls ""green stimulus""—largely ethanol and other alternative energy schemes—of the kind from which Al Gore and his partners at Kleiner Perkins hope to profit handsomely.

What I'm asking is: what happens when one party wants a secular court and the other wants a religious court? Do you just drop the case all together? This is going to happen a lot if one party feels like a particular court will be more sympathetic to their case.

Furthermore, the article about talaq does not lay out the reasons why a divorce is considered allowable. It says you can't divorce without valid reason. Since wife abuse is both legal and common in many Muslim countries (Afghanistan has explicitly made spousal rape legal), it may not be considered a ""valid reason"". Furthermore, in countries such as Iran men are granted FULL custody of children, even when the proceedings are initiated *against them*. So these religious courts will be given the right to decide things like alimony/child support (not provided in most Muslim-majority countries), visitation, division of property and custody. Nine times out of ten women fare far worse than men in these areas when cases are tried in Islamic courts. 

Just so you know, you might want to fully read the articles you link. The article about domestic abuse and Islam explicitly states that there is still debate about whether/how much it's appropriate to beat your wife. In other words: RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS ARE STILL NOT SURE. These are the people *who will be deciding cases in a religious court*. It also says they can only be taken to court and be prosecuted if they do not respect ""the limits set down by the Qur'an and Hadith"". Those limits are laughable - you can only beat your wife if you fear ""rebellion"" (see the link you posted for reference). So if under Shariah law beatings are not necessarily grounds for divorce, the judge in question was acting appropriately in her ruling. 

Do you honestly think order will persist in a country that has one court that says spousal abuse is illegal and another says that it's not only okay, but it is prescribed in some cases by god himself? How can you say that this is not a perversion of the foundations of the countries where people have fought and died for freedom and self-determination? I'll say it again: if someone wants to live in a land dominated by fairy tale law, move to a country where it's already in place. One shouldn't try to change another nation to follow their regressive whims.

Now, I said read. READ. It has a lot to do with the Muslim influx that Europe is currently facing. Countries like England, France, Spain, and Italy are seeing huge booms in the population of foreign Muslims in their countries. Now, this wouldn't be a problem, except for that these Muslims don't integrate with the countries after they move in. They simply move into big Muslim communities, and practice their own Muslim law, and have even tried to have local law repealed and have it officially replaced with Muslim law in some places (what, you want a link or something? Looks like you're going to have to do some reading and finding!).

Which leads me to my next point.

Switzerland is a fairly homogenized, culture-clash-free people, and is one of the world's most desirable places to live (THE most desirable, depending on who you ask), and the Swiss are scared to death of letting the Muslim thing get out of control, which as other nations can tell you, is a very real situation. So they nip it in the bud; no minarets, no special Muslim laws, nothing of the sort. You can still be a Muslim, practice Islam as much as you want, but if you're an immigrant, you need to integrate, and need to be as Swiss as possible.

Also, many Swiss cities have construction laws prohibiting buildings that block views/historical areas/other culturally important things. This factors in, but not as much as the integration/community aspects.

I just wanted to expand the debate here, as I noticed that the pharmaceutical industry is being portrayed as 100% evil.

So first things first (full disclosure) I'm a biology and business major, and we have to take a class on the pharmaceutical industry. We learned that it costs about a billion dollars to create, develop, and test the new drug to match FDA standards. This Billion dollar R+D cost does not even show up on the Balance Sheets of the drug companies. The patent period, therefore, is a time when drug companies that actually create and develop the drug are free to recoup this enormous cost + profit that would incentivize the endeavor. Remember that after the patent period ends, generic companies will lower the price dramatically, and theoretically all the companies in that market will divide the profit. That is great for the consumer and the generic company, who will experience lower prices and profit in that order. However, after the patent period expires, the original company has no way of benefiting from actually developing the drug; they are the ones with the billion dollar cost on their hands.

   So with that background, it becomes clearer why cost to consumers is fairly high within the patent period. But why is it so much higher in America? 
   This is the curse of socialized medicine; the governments truly believe they are doing the world a service by negotiating lower drug costs for their constituents, but in actuality they work like a huge Wal-Mart. They say if you want the business in this country, you will need to supply huge margins for a low profit. The people in those countries are happy because they pay less (of course), but the actual company still needs to recoup costs. So, they charge much more in the U.S., where they still can. This is called cost shifting, and is a major problem with every socialized medicine program-for example, medicare allows for cheap healthcare, but since the actual compensation to doctors and hospitals is much lower than what they charge, patients with better healthcare end up paying higher premiums. The ultimate problem is that if the U.S. also socializes its medicine and negotiates with the drug companies, they will have no way of recouping the huge cost of development, and lose all incentive to develop at all.

tl;dr- Drug companies charge more in the U.S. to recoup the billion dollar cost per NDA (new drug application) because in Europe and Canada, the price is forced well below an equilibrium price.

They're from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia and poor Muslim African nations. This absolutely makes these despicable laws relevant to whether or not we should allow space for laws that appease recent immigrants and are diametrically opposed to the values of the European nation. 

Not only have I read the Qur'an, but I've also read the Bible. Neither of them form a legitimate basis for modern law. The Bible says you can sell your neighbors into slavery. It offers parables of men offering their daughters up as sexual sacrifices. The Qur'an has a passage in which Aisha is accused of adultery. Without much evidence to disprove the accusation, Mohammed dismisses this claim and orders those who accused her to be lashed. THESE are the things that modern democracies were founded to escape - this is what our current systems of law intended to avoid. They should not under any circumstance be allowed to seep back into our justice system.

I've seen quite a few of your responses in this thread and I think I am correct in assuming that you are or were formerly a Muslim or are from a Muslim country. If this is the case, there is not much I can say to change your mind. However please consider what you are advocating - if Muslims in England are allowed Shariah courts, then what is to stop Christians (and each of their individual sects) from having their own, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, Scientologists, etc. etc. etc.? It will create not just a two-tiered system but a multi-tiered one. This will result in an almost certain breakdown of law and order. What rules do you follow when there are ten different courts and only four of them consider something a crime?

This is exactly what I mean by the dangers of cultural relativism when dealing with the injection of new, powerful cultural influence. Why should Europeans have to sacrifice their laws, beliefs and cultural history to appease people who willingly move to countries that they know are incompatible with their own beliefs? Freedom for/from religion and an impartial system of law are paramount among what Westerners hold dear. Is there no respect for preserving those cultural values?

The media in the US, even the ""liberal"" parts of it, do a very poor job of explaining what socialism really is, and how anything Obama is proposing is quite far removed from it. Socialism ranges from the kind of soft socialism found in parts of western Europe to more hard-line interpretations like those in latin America. But the differences between those nations are VAST and how they use socialist concepts is as well.

If not taught in the mandatory military service, the minimum time being a member of a gun club for an application to be even considered is six months. This includes an exam and range courses. Even then you have to be approved by your gun club foreman, and stay as a member of the gun club. This provides a mandatory stable and social element that pick up on signals as to who are and are not suited to own a weapon. If you quit the gun club, you have to turn in your weapons to the police.

This is the most important difference between gun ownership in European countries which allow guns and the US (I am from the US)  
Any idiot can get a permit in most of this country. Gun safety is an afterthought for many. There are many (like myself) who think safety and adequate training is paramount, but it is utterly baffling how unsafe many gun owners are.   
As an example, I will never go wild turkey hunting again. Many people get together and get drunk, then go hide in the bushes and make turkey calls. You must shoot the turkey at the first sign of movement. It is a miracle more people are not killed every year. I have tried this in 4 states, and it has been the same every time.   
I actually use a Hoyt Matrix recurve bow (with a .50 cal Desert Eagle in case of bears, mountain lions, or boars) now. I have not used a rifle or black powder for years.

1) Negotiate ""removal"" contracts with transit countries

So if the transit country of an illegal immigrant can be determined, the person can be transported back to it without a big legal/beaurocratic business. There exists already an agreement with Marocco on that matter, Turkey and Lybia would be extremly important.

2) Negotiate contracts to move illegal immigrants back to their home countries, in the case that the immigrant does not have a valid passport. 

There exists hole towns (greece/italy/france), where people live  outside of the law, since they are not getting a residence permit but  on the other hand can not be send back to their home countries. This is due to the fact that they have destroyed their passports and legal issues prevent a transportation to the specific homecountries.

3) Define a universal immigration law/system for the EU-Area
This would allow:

- Support of legal immigration instead of legalising illegal imigration, which leads to pull effetcs with further low-education imigration.

- Introduction of a point-based imigration system, which would support the imigration of educated people.

- Stop of intra-european removals of immigrants

- A balanced and fair asylum system.

This is all about the history of respective countries. All countries have their own unique history and events from it shape each countries respective values. For example take a look at Germany or Australia and their downright silly rules regarding video games. I'm not sure what the current German law is now but previously you weren't even allowed any form of red blood. Both countries heavily censor and deny publishing rights to games based on things we Americans would consider insane infringements on free speech. Then you have countries like China who completely deny major events in their history even occurred at all. The US freaks the hell out over silly sexual issues - blood is fine, violence is fine, but a boob? Oh hell no, save the children!

All these opinions and traditions come from world history. The US was started AS a rebellion against oppressive government. The rights of the people being stronger than the rights of the government was one of our founding principles. Germany has the Holocaust in recent history, so does a unreasonable fear of violence really surprise anyone?

Have you taken a look at Europe lately? I don't know, maybe the Muslims refusing to integrate with the culture's they emigrated to and demanding ""respect"" for their made up man in the sky. They refuse to integrate and threaten anybody who criticizes their madness along with using empty words such as ""bigot"", ""racist"", ""Islamaphobe"". Just because we don't want to bow down to your idiotic religion. If you just kept to yourself and stopped all the violence and bitching no one would care. Really, they wouldn't. But you just can't seem to shut the fuck up about how important your religion is. Your religion demands you infringe on basic western freedom such as freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of religion. There's blasphemy laws all over Europe.

&gt;Me and others like me are living proof. You just want to be bigoted so you refuse to see that.

You should educate yourself about the word bigot and what it means. You can't be bigoted towards someone for their voluntary choices. For example, I'm willing to bet you are intolerant of murderers, you bigoted son of a bitch. Yeah, doesn't make much sense? If you have integrated into your respective culture and don't demand special treatment for being a Muslim, good for you. I have no problem with you.

&gt;Our military is the best for securing civil war peace agreements.

Aye, because civil wars should always be decided by foreign powers.  Imagine the UK stepping in and forcing peace during the US's civil war.  Doesn't look as peachy from the other side now, does it?

&gt;China is not tremendously satisfied with its position in the world system and could be very powerful indeed.

You mean the same China that stressed, shortly after Obama's visit, that it was still a developing nation.  And that it would not be taking a direct role in global leadership, despite Obama's encouragement to do so?

You seem to be making some rather large assertions based on a very shallow understanding of the world.

&gt;The longer China stays far below the US, the longer we can stave off war. 

*Facepakm.* 

Do broaden your media sources.  It is painfully obvious that you are spoon-fed by US media.

&gt;What you want is to have the most powerful and well funded military in human history, but NEVER to use have to use it. 

Madelaine Albright: """"What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?""

Sadly, that seems to be the consensus in Washington D.C.

&gt;However, because it does hold that position, it makes all the countries that basically agree with the system better off. Canada, Australia, Japan, the EU

All easily accomplished by the US's nuclear umbrella.  The rest, particularly the carrier groups, have gone far beyond a defensive posture to fulfill an aggressive tool for geopolitical maneuvering.  

The US military does have benefits.  But those benefits can be had without the excessive spending and war-mongering.  So long as the US has an over-sized military along with aggressive politicians in Washington, however, the US military will be doing more harm than good.",False

The [Saturday night special has been a particular target of gun control](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Saturday_night_special#History_of_regulation_attempts):

&gt;The earliest law prohibiting inexpensive handguns was enacted in Tennessee, in the form of the ""Army and Navy"" law, passed in 1879, shortly after the 14th amendment and Civil Rights Act of 1875; previous laws invalidated by the constitutional amendment had stated that black freedmen could not own or carry any manner of firearm. The Army and Navy law prohibited the sale of ""belt or pocket pistols, or revolvers, or any other kind of pistols, except army or navy pistols,"" which were prohibitively expensive for black freedmen and poor whites to purchase.[7] These were large pistols in .36 caliber (""Navy"") or .44 caliber (""Army""), and were the military issue cap and ball blackpowder revolvers used during the Civil War by both Union and Confederate ground troops. The effect of the Army and Navy law was to restrict handgun possession to the upper economic classes.[8]
&gt;
&gt;The next major attempt to regulate inexpensive firearms was the Gun Control Act of 1968, which used the ""sporting purposes"" test and a points system to exclude many small, inexpensive handguns which had been imported from European makers such as Röhm (RG).
&gt;
&gt;[clip]
&gt;
&gt;More recent legislation against ""junk guns"" has targeted the zinc frames used in construction by specifying a melting point; however, this backfired when police departments began adopting polymer framed guns such as those made by Glock, H&amp;K, and other manufacturers, which will burn at temperatures much lower than the commonly specified 800 °F. Legislators then changed the definitions to target size (barrel lengths under 3 inches), materials (such as zinc), low-cost manufacturing techniques (e.g., density requirements that exclude powder cast metals), redundant safety requirements (trigger and/or main-spring locks, sizes too large for a child to use, drop tests), and ""quality"", ""reliability"", and ""accuracy"" (which are often left undefined).

As demonstrated by Roman society, in the long run, those who have the ability to project force are those who tend to wind up with political power in society, be they males, the military, or what-have-you...an evenly-armed society has fundamental pressure for egalitarian political influence.",False

Like all other rent, I would say as long as we're living on their land.

&gt;Have you considered perhaps that it is this very ""rent"" that is causing the culture of self-entitlement and as a result, the disparity?

Yes, we considered that quite a bit during my studies. Those considerations were then quickly erased by the massive amount of work by social scientists showing how the plight of First Nations communities has come about as a direct result of the legacy created by their oppression under European settlers over the past 500 years.

It's all about money and power, not health care:  In Chicago, the Obama buddies keep the public housing a wreck to justify more money for public housing.  So, public housing remains a wreck, and the Obama buddies get more money and power.  Improving US health care?  Saving money?  Yes, there are opportunities, but these are mostly NOT being pursued.  Again, the ObamaCare goal is just money and power and not health care.

It's more clear when can see the pattern:  Consider Obama's efforts to 'fight climate change'.  Of course, stopping the climate from changing is hopeless.  And that humans are causing significant change is absurd.  But, Obama wants a non-stop excuse to get money and power to promise to take action.  E.g., in his 1/2008 SF Chron interview on YouTUBE, he explained how he plans to ""bankrupt"" the US coal plants, half of all our electric power.  Sooooo, if you were running a coal plant and Acorn came for a donation, what would you do?  Or if Obama's buddies in the Marxist SEIU showed up to unionize your plant?

Same for Obama's $2.4 billion for 'electric' cars and trucks and $3.4 billion for a 'smart' electric grid:  These projects are hopeless but do create some people dependent on Obama and, thus, eager to contribute to, say, Acorn, let in the Marxist SEIU, etc.

It's not about energy, climate, or health care:  It's JUST about money and power, FROM you and FOR Obama and his buddies.  It's Chicago style machine politics.  And with this approach, it is crucial NOT to solve the problem but to keep it going as a continuing source of money and power.  Understand now?

For Aetna, they are supposed to make money.  If they treat their customers badly, then you are supposed to go to another company.  That's part of your power in 'the market'.  Yes, one important way to help US health care would be to reverse the special anti-trust exemption that makes sure health care companies can't sell across state lines.  That exemption means that you have fewer choices and less power in the market and an insurance company can treat you less well.  But instead of reversing that anti-trust exemption, we are getting some 2000 page bill that really is just about a Fed takeover of 20% of our economy, NOT for better or less expensive health care but JUST for more money and power for Obama and buddies.  Trust me:  ObamaCare, straight out of Chicago style machine politics, will cost more and be worse.

ObamaCare wants to take what problems there are and what problems they can invent and use these as excuses to take over the whole system to get money and power from you for them.  It's like a small leak in one kitchen sink and responding by promising to MAKEover the whole kitchen, house, and neighborhood.  Net, give up the whole neighborhood and a LOT of money and power and get many, much worse leaks.  It's your money and power, and they are trying to take it.  Understand?

In particular, on this thread, the screams against Aetna and its ""profit"" smell like dead fish from the Chicago river:

So, the suggestion is that Aetna is supposed to 'take care' of people, that ""profit"" is evil, that the free enterprise system sucks, and that a Fed takeover, socialized, nationalized medicine ObamaCare would be better.

Broadly, for a long list of important reasons, mostly insurance needs to be a regulated industry.  Nationalized?  No.  Regulated?  Yes.

Still, the 'free enterprise' system can be a tough 'reality check'.  There is supposed to be freedom on both sides:  You are supposed to be free to shop for a better insurance company.  And anyone in business is supposed to be free to startup a competing insurance company and offer you a better deal.

Trust me:  Mostly business profits are small, well under 10% of what you pay, and a small price to pay to keep the business motivated and eager for your business.  It's tough to show a profit; occasionally a business gets really big profits, but that's rare and rarely lasts long.

Yes, one of the problems with health insurance is the current regulations:  Typically each of the 50 states has only a few health insurance companies heavily because of a law that keeps health insurance companies from competing across state lines.  Hmm ....  Guess why that law was passed!  Or, for an answer, ""follow the money""!

So, some of the free market is canceled:  You are less free to select a better insurance company.

So, one way to get you better deals on health insurance is to let the insurance companies sell across state lines.  And there are likely also other ways.

Broadly, though, nationalized or socialized medicine will be worse.  From ObamaCare, much worse.

Russia tried this socialized economic stuff for decades, killed millions of their own people, and finally gave it up for a more free economy.  The changeover was painful, with many more people killed.  Apparently now they believe that they are better off.

Europe keeps trying various socialistic approaches, can have 50% of the economy run by the central government, and generally has a lower standard of living than the US and MUCH less business innovation -- no Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  And much less in medicines, medical devices, etc.

Actually, generally, Europe is MUCH better at running effective, socialistic bureaucracies than the US is.  E.g., the bureaucracies in France have VERY high competence and educational standards nearly no one in the US could pass.  For another, the European countries are much more 'homogeneous'.  Socialism is on average less good in Europe than free enterprise in the US and mostly a disaster in the US.

Improve the US health care system with, say, better regulation, etc.?  Fine, but that is NOT what is in Congress now.  ObamaCare, nationalized, socialized medicine, unionized by the Marxist SEIU, just to get money and power via Chicago style machine politics?  Disaster.

Anyways, before that Europe always had man before woman mentality. If you want read ""The Wife of Bath"" by Geoffry Chaucer for a representation on what woman should not be in the 1300s.

So not only are the Puritans bat shit crazy against woman, it is just the way it has been globally since the planet was around. There are situations against it however such as ""gatherer"" tribes. Most of them had female leaders. If you truly want change read more on the humanistic perspective.

How would that happen? How could it be significantly warmer in but one part of the globe, yet not in others? The source of warmth is sunlight. The only natural way one discrete part of the planet could be warm while the rest was cold would have been if cloud cover had blanketed the earth everywhere except in one region, and if this peculiarity had lasted for 400 years (from 800 A.D. through 1300 A.D.) That is, of course, improbable in the extreme.

Here is a map showing the temperatures at various places around the world during the Medieval Warm Period:

You state that you don't see climate scientists ""vigorously opposing any mention of global warming."" I suggest that the reason you don't see them is because you must not be looking for them. They are there, presenting the evidence of their information for any to look at. However, their work is not reported in the Mainstream Media for the simple reason that it is being suppressed by special interests. In my post above, you can find a link to ""450 Peer-reviewed papers supporting skepticism of Man-Made Global Warming."" Click on the link, read the material, *then* decide.

You cite ExxonMobil as having spread disinformation about climate change. I haven't studied the issue but I would hardly be surprised to learn that a powerful special interest had distorted information in order to advance its agenda. However, please don't confuse the fact that because a corrupt industry makes a statement that the statement must therefore be false. It is important to seek out independent corroboration of facts to determine what the truth may be.

p.s. Just for clarity, climate scientists who are skeptical of Anthropogenic Global Warming (man-made) may not necessarily be saying that climate change is *not* happening. As the data shows, the climate of Earth is constantly changing. They just reject the idea that the cause of that change is significantly due to human activity.

The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America

Other Western countries offer no panacea for American woes.

****

The fact of the matter is that America's health care system is like a free market in the same way that Madonna is like a virgin--i.e. in fiction only.

***

But France is not doing a whole lot better. Its health care system is the third most expensive in the world with over 11% of its GDP going toward health care--nearly three times more than the amount in 1960.

***

But it is unclear how long this will last. Struggling with exploding costs, the French government has tried several times--only to back off in the face of a public outcry--to prod doctors into using only standardized treatments. In 1994, it started imposing fines of up to roughly $4,000 on doctors who deviated from ""mandatory practice guidelines."" It switched from this ""sticks"" to a ""carrots"" approach four years later, and tried handing bonuses to doctors who adhered to the guidelines.



I also advise you to learn about how Singapore does health care.

Singapore's health care system is one of the lowest cost in the developed world, and Singapore has a very high life expectancy (higher than every major European nation and only behind the principality of Andorra). The vast majority of health care spending in Singapore is private sector.

People in Singapore rely mostly on individual medical savings accounts. The thing is, Democrats HATE these things. They opposed it vigorously when it was created by Republicans:

http://thinkprogress.org/2006/01/30/the-truth-about-health-savings-accounts/

Here's more on Singapore's health care system:

http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/singapores_heal.html


In The Undercover Economist, Tim Harford highly praised the health care policies of Singapore. But it wasn't until I read the section on health care in Ghesquiere's Singapore's Success that I realized how amazing the official numbers are. If the following is true, all the comparisons showing that the U.S. greatly outspends Europe without getting better health are beside the point, because Singapore makes Europe look like the U.S.:

----
The Singapore government spent only 1.3 percent of GDP on healthcare in 2002, whereas the combined public and private expenditure on healthcare amounted to a low 4.3 percent of GDP. By contrast, the United States spent 14.6 percent of its GDP on healthcare that year, up from 7 percent in 1970... Yet, indicators such as infant mortality rates or years of average healthy life expectancy are slightly more favorable in Singapore than in the United States... It is true that such indicators are also related to the overall living environment and not only to healthcare spending. Nonetheless, international experts rank Singapore's healthcare system among the most successful in the world in terms of cost-effectiveness and community health results.
---

How does Singapore do it? Singapore is no libertarian health care paradise, but it does self-consciously try to maintain good incentives by narrowly tailoring its departures from laissez-faire:

----
The price mechanism and keen attention to incentives facing individuals are relied upon to discourage excessive consumption and to keep waste and costs in check by requiring co-payment by users.

[...]

The state recovers 20-100 percent of its public healthcare outlay through user fees. A patient in a government hospital who chooses the open ward is subsidized by the government at 80 percent. Better-off patients choose more comfortable wards with lower or no government subsidy, in a self-administered means test.
---

I've heard a lot of smart people warn that co-payments are penny-wise but pound-foolish, because people cut back on high-benefit preventive care. Unless someone is willing to dispute Singapore's budgetary and health data, it looks like we've got strong counter-evidence to this view: Either Singaporeans don't skimp on preventive care when you raise the price, or preventive care isn't all it's cracked up to be.

More details on how Singapore's system works:

* There are mandatory health savings accounts: ""Individuals pre-save for medical expenses through mandatory deductions from their paychecks and employer contributions... Only approved categories of medical treatment can be paid for by deducting one's Medisave account, for oneself, grandparents, parents, spouse or children: consultations with private practitioners for minor ailments must be paid from out-of-pocket cash...""
* ""The private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare, which helps contain prices in both directions. Private medical insurance is also available.""
* Private healthcare providers are required to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping.
* The government pays for ""basic healthcare services... subject to tight expenditure control."" Bottom line: The government pays 80% of ""basic public healthcare services.""
* Government plays a big role with contagious disease, and adds some paternalism on top: ""Preventing diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tobacco-related illnesses by ensuring good health conditions takes a high priority.""
* The government provides optional low-cost catatrophic health insurance, plus a safety net ""subject to stringent means-testing.""

Last year, Robin Hanson stuck his neck out and argued that we should cut health spending in half. If Singapore's numbers are right, Robin was being conservative. Singapore has achieved American health outcomes for about a quarter of the share of GDP the U.S. spends. Furthermore, if Canada shows that socialized medicine can save a few percent of GDP without hurting health, Singapore shows that the free lunch offered by greater government control is meager compared to the free lunch offered by old-fashioned individual incentives.",False

Your friend is probably encountering an intra-market issue.

Oh yeah and my original point, the Congressional push that was supposed to fix issues like your friend's jumped into the sewer and died somewhere.

The carriers would never willingly allow intra-market roaming - there's no profit - the European ones don't much like it either but they're legally bound to provide it, however if a cell customer roams on a competing carrier they do incur roaming charges.

Happens in europe reguarly. It's going to happen again. There is an immense wave of racism and supremacism sweeping through europe. We can see it everywhere from france, italy, denmark, switzerland, etc. There is  massive hatred of muslims, immigrants, and basically anybody who is not a white christian.

This is very similar to what happened before the rise of nazism and I predict a new wave of nazism will crest in less than a decade from now.

There is no doubt in my mind that immigrants will be rounded up, put on trains and either purged of killed.

You can see it today on reddit. You can tell a european redditor simply by looking at the vitriol they spew about muslims and immigrants here.

&gt;Name a secular, Western country in which mosques are banned.

That's the next step. The first step was banning the minarets. If this ban on minarets does not halt the building of mosques or prevent muslims from congregating the swiss will ban mosques. If that doesn't prevent muslims from congregating they will ban islam. If people still congregate they will round up the muslims and purge or kill them.

We are at the first step of a process that will take many years.

&gt;After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics, became possible.[82] The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty, individual rights, equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of republicanism to Americans. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the consent of the governed. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.[83]

This particular World Cup involves 32 countries. They are initially divided into 8 groups of four teams each. Out of these 32 teams, 16, the top 2 out of every group qualify for the knockout stages. So there is the round of 16, then the quarter-finals, then the semi-finals, and then the final, you get the idea. 

So how are these 32 teams chosen? By a planet-wide qualification tournament in each continent. The host team gets automatic qualification. But each continent gets its own set number of places, which is based on the strength of the sport of soccer in that continent. So Africa gets 5 teams, Asia gets 4.5 (will explain the 0.5 later), [Oceania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation) gets 0.5, South America gets 4.5, North America gets 3.5, Europe gets 13. 

So the 0.5, team that gets 5th position in Asian qualifying plays the team that topped the Oceania qualifying. So Bahrain, which ended up fifth in Asia played New Zealand, which ended up 1st in Oceania. So in the World Cup, they would have an amalgamated team of New Zealand and Bahrain. So out of a team of 11 players, 6 would be from New Zealand and 5 from Bahrain. Why does New Zealand get more players than Bahrain in the combined team? Well, it is because New Zealand beat Bahrain in a home-and-away series to decide who gets to field more players. The name of the combined team of is still in arbitration, with New Zealand wanting the team name New Zearain, while Bahrain wants the team name to be New Bahrain.

Same thing happened with Uruguay from South America beating Costa Rica from North America, although the forming of the team of Uruguarica is a lot easier due to both countries speaking Spanish.

It's absolutely amazing. I'm not even normally that outgoing of a person, but it is incredibly easy to meet people while traveling. I like the freedom of being able to do exactly what I want, without having to make any compromises. I think that when you travel alone, you really open yourself up to more new experiences and encounters.

I'm not sure what you mean about ingratiating, but it's so easy to start conversations with people, especially fellow travelers in hostels or next to you on the train. I always just started with ""where you're from"" and ""where have you been"". Everyone has such incredible stories. Talking to locals is great too, though I was able to do that more in South Africa than in Europe. Loneliness can be a factor when traveling alone if you don't make an extra effort to strike up conversations with strangers.

Activities - I like to have a general idea of what I'm doing each day even before I leave for the trip. This is gonna depend a lot on what your interests are... I'm an adrenaline junkie so I tend to jump off bridges, that kind of thing. I also definitely sign up for something if it's unique to that country or unlikely to be found elsewhere (like riding an ostrich in South Africa). I did the museums and stuff while in Europe...but that kind of stuff can get boring without anyone to discuss what you're looking at. I hit up bars once in a while but as a female traveling alone, it wasn't worth the risk to me. I would only go if I was with a large group that I met at my hostel. A lot of the hostels I stayed at have very social communal areas, which are fantastic for chilling at the end of the day and having a beer. Quite a few times I've ended up exploring or doing stuff with people from my hostels. It's especially great to get meals together. Eating alone (especially at a nice restaurant) is really boring. If you're planning on doing that a lot, bring something to read.

America, Australia and New Zealand are always split between their 'traditional' culture and the settled one.  At least, that's what I've noticed living in Australia and the US and visiting NZ, and being born in Eastern Europe. 
When a white person in a settled country complains about immigrants, they're being hypocritical because they stole the land from other people.  In Aus there was the whole Terra nullius deal, I'm guessing something similar elsewhere.
But Europeans are the traditional owners and settlers of the land.  Their culture is being compromised by the massive immigration.  The same way the Aboriginal culture was consumed by the British, Europeans are being overwhelmed by Middle Easterners and Asians and Africans.  
My personal opinion is that instead of taking up lots and lots of immigrants, the money should be spent on improving the impoverished countries so that there is no need to escape.  Nothing will be solved if people just move out of the troubled areas.  But I know it's not as simple as that, I'm tired and hope I made some sense.

As long as you have a system in place that makes sure there can't be a bill put before the house that says ""kill all of minority X"" you don't have to worry too much about people voting in their own self interest.

However, and I apologize for how pejorative this is going to sound, you don't have any idea what you're talking about when it comes to the US government.

First of all, the President of the United States is EXTREMELY different than the Prime Minister of a commonwealth country (like Australia, Britain, or Canada where I hail from). The President cannot create or pass, or vote on legislation. He is a member of the executive, much the same as Canada's Governor General, or your ""Head of State."" He does not have the same abilities as what is known as the Head of Government, equivalent to our Prime Ministers, who control their party and how they vote in the body that elects federal law.  

I have no idea what you're talking about in that the US ""[doesn't] have a government . . . they have an administration elected in a ""first past the post"" . . . style system"". They have a congress, made of two houses, The House of Representatives (much the same as our House of Commons) and a Senate (much the same as both of our Senates). These houses are elected in almost the exact same manner as yours and ours. Each riding elects a member to represent them on a national level. These members are sometimes part of a political party, sometimes not. They are in charge of all the legislation, and represent the US in the exact same way you think your government does.

The only person who serves a four year term is the President, who is in charge of signing bills into legislation (giving him the ability that your ""Head of State"" and Canada's Governor General both have, that is, to veto laws). Senators are elected to, I believe, nine-year terms, and a third of the senate is up for election every three years. And House of Representatives have a shorter term, but I am unsure of exactly what the nature of it is.

Either way, as it stands, the US has MORE protection against dictatorship, at least in principle, than most Commonwealth countries have. We only get to elect, one third of the state (the Legislative side) whereas they get to elect two thirds, and each part of the government is more heavily balanced out than either of our governments are. 

Also, your classification of ""Western European"" is also totally off. France has a way different government than either the US, or any of the Commonwealth countries. They invest a lot more power in their head of state (since the reforms of de Gaulle went through), and their senate is almost useless in its power.

2) Negotiate contracts to move illegal immigrants back to their home countries, in the case that the immigrant does not have a valid passport.

There exists hole towns (greece/italy/france), where people live outside of the law, since they are not getting a residence permit but on the other hand can not be send back to their home countries. This is due to the fact that they have destroyed their passports and legal issues prevent a transportation to the specific homecountries. Its a hopeless situation for the people and a good nutrition for extremism.

You definitely didn't sound very interested in dancing from the get-go, and she probably realized that (the first thing you did after going into the bar was lay on a couch, and that was only after wanting to go home at first).

Also, I'm not sure what kind of dancing was going on.  Grinding is one thing, but face-to-face with a little bit of room isn't too bad.

Her initial reaction was to apologize.  For one thing, that's a good sign that this hasn't happened much before, and also that she does still want you (otherwise, she would have blown it off or tried to defend herself).

Finally, here's my own story about that.  I'm studying abroad this semester in Europe.  When I've been on weekend trips with the school, dance bars are inevitable.  The first night, I wanted to dance (everyone else was) but wasn't sure how my girlfriend would handle it.  I danced a tiny bit very conservatively, and talked to her later that night about it.  I explained the situation, and told her that I'd never leave her because I enjoyed dancing with some other girl.  Really, the fact that she'd trust me that much and would be so understanding means a ton to me and would have MUCH more long-term benefits to our relationship than short-term harm (which would be next to nonexistent at worst).  I also made it clear that I wouldn't hold it against her if she didn't feel comfortable with it, but to just consider it ""extra credit"" so to speak.

She was fine with it, as long as there wasn't any grinding or feeling each other up or anything obvious like that.

The heavy hitting being stereotype threat, which has been illustrated repeatedly with race and IQ, and would effect even studies on twins of one race raised in two different environments. It could even account for some of the increase in heritabilitiy of IQ through aging since stereotypes are learned, and there is increased normative pressure as one ages (at least for heritability and matters of race).
The wikipedia page of the book you reference has a section of criticisms which make the author's data questionable, and suggest the author might be coming at it with a bias of his own. It's certainly not accepted as fact by the majority of the scientific community, at least according to the first wiki page you cited (since IQ heritability, if true, would indicate genetic populations with IQ trends keeping together on the aggregate with environment factors remaining constant).
So with the question still up in the air, why take a side so readily?

&gt; Winston Churchill, England’s wartime leader, wrote as the Allies were engaged in conquering Germany in 1944: ""Of all the neutrals Switzerland has the greatest right to distinction. . . . She has been a democratic State, standing for freedom in self-defence among her mountains, and in thought, in spite of race, largely on our side.""

&gt;By contrast, the year before, Adolf Hitler stated that ""all the rubbish of small nations still existing in Europe must be liquidated as fast as possible,"" and that if necessary he would become known as the ""Butcher of the Swiss.""

&gt;But Hitler knew that the Swiss were gun owners and that many Nazis would be butchered in the process. Located in Bern, American spy Allen Dulles, the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), explained: ""At the peak of its mobilization Switzerland had 850,000 men under arms or standing in reserve, a fifth of the total population. . . . That Switzerland did not have to fight was thanks to its will to resist and its large investment of men and equipment in its own defense. The cost to Germany of an invasion of Switzerland would certainly have been very high.""

&gt;Incidentally, Italian partisan leaders would slip over the border into Ticino, the Italian-speaking Swiss canton, and arrange with the OSS for air drops of supplies to their mountain bases.

&gt;STAGNARO: German generals studied several plans to invade Switzerland. All of them worried about the strength of the Swiss army, as well as about the ability of Swiss to make them pay a very high price. Let's play history-fiction: had the Germans really tried an invasion, what fate would they have been likely to find?

&gt;HALBROOK: When Hitler came to power in 1933, Nazi propaganda depicted Switzerland as one of several countries to be annexed as part of ""Greater Germany."" Unlike the other European neutrals, which spent money for the welfare state, the Swiss immediately began military preparations to repel an eventual German attack. In 1940, Switzerland was a potential southern invasion route to France, while Belgium and Holland were the northern invasion routes. The Germans avoided Switzerland, where every man was armed and the spirit of resistance predominated.

&gt;Just after the fall of France, the German forces devised several new invasion plans against Switzerland – the Nazis would occupy the German and French speaking areas, and Fascist Italy would occupy the Italian speaking area. These plans acknowledged that the Swiss were well-trained marksmen, and recommended considerable forces for the attack. While Hitler hated Switzerland – which he called a ""pimple"" on the face of Europe – for refusing to join the New Order, he was distracted by the Battle of Britain and then by Operation Barbarossa, the battle with the Soviet Union in 1941.

&gt;Yet just days before the assault on Russia, Hitler and Mussolini met on the Brenner. The record states: ""The Führer characterized Switzerland as the most despicable and wretched people and national entity. The Swiss were the mortal enemies of the new Germany."" The Duce called Switzerland ""an anachronism."" Attack plans against Switzerland continued to be made.

It's a semantic thought and obviously war will probably always be a mainstay of modern society, but still can't we just stop kidding ourselves about what war really entails?  

Also can PLEASE we stop the facade of karma warring?  We didn't catch Osama, there were no WMD's, and liberating a country is much different than simply occupying it.

""But what about Hitler and saving the world from the Nazis?""
While it's definitely undeniable that the Allies did the entire world a great deed in stopping Hitler, it's hard to imagine that being enough to sway the United States into a war.  Maybe not the only reason, but most likely the main proponent for going to war was the fact that Hitler had the ability and momentum to take over the rest of Europe and Asia.  And then there's those countries who were left to just deal with genocide like Darfur and Rwanda.

I mean, if she has coworkers as fat and stupid as Safety Orange Man, you *know* that place is surrounded by burger joints.  Or maybe a KFC.  *Everyone* likes fried chicken.

Anyway, regarding knives, forks, and spoons, yeah, white people get bored.  So we have to come up with all these rules.  They never matter unless you've been ingrained with them.  For example, I don't care much which fork you use for your salad and which one you use for your meal (some people do).  However, when my buddy (Chinese-American, coincidentally) starts sipping soup from his spoon with an overhand grip, man, that irks me.

To average Westerners, yeah, eating from a spoon probably seems a bit childish.  And eating off a knife seems brutish.  You just can't win!

To a Thai, eating from a fork seems similarly brutish as eating of a knife would seem to Americans and Europeans!

Also, we Westerners we care about whether or not you continue to hold your knife while you insert food into your mouth (still a bit brutish, I suppose, or maybe we think you won't like our pork roast and leap across the table to stab us with the knife you're holding).  We also care about the precise manner in which you hold your fork (tines curving up or down), but that seems to vary by specific subculture and -- amazingly -- the dish in question.

It's all relative.  In the end, none of it matters, except to those whom you wish to impress.  So, just mirror what the cute girl or guy across the table does.

For an approximation, we'll exclude anyone outside the USA. (Europe and Japan and Australia could presumably furnish a fair number of such women, though.) So that's 300 million people. Roughly half will be female. 150 million. https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States tells us that there are about 100 million women between 15 and 64.

But that's too broad; 15 is pushing it jailbait-wise, and we can probably exclude over 30 as not being hot enough. This means we can only look for females in the 'echo boomer' group (https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographic#U.S._Demographic_birth_cohorts) - past 1976. http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0101&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-state=st&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false tells us that women 15-29 make up 20.2% of the entire female population (152,981,937), so 152,981,937*0.202=30,902,351.274.

So in the right American female age group, there are 31 million targets. Now, I have heard that a reasonable guess at the commonness of 'truly stunning' or 'supermodel looks' is 1 in 100. So that cuts the group down from 31 million to 309,000. Now, the question is, how many of that 309,000 really hot young women are geeky enough to qualify? Unless it's more than 1/6th, then StaticSignal's upper bound is overly generous. Indeed, it could easily be off by an order of magnitude or more: if we guess that 1/10th of hot chicks are geeky, then that brings us down to 30k, nearly half 50k, and if we make the more reasonable assumption that 1/100th are this impressively geeky then we go down to 3k.

So of 300 million Americans, 3 thousand of them fit all the parameters. Now we can try to figure globally. Japan &amp; Europe &amp; Australia together have 880 million people. 880m is 2.9 * 300 million, so our global population of hot geeky chics becomes (3k + 2.9 * 3k), or 11,800.

Which is a factor of 5 less than StaticSignal's upper bound. For a subject this fuzzy, that doesn't seem to be too vast an overestimate, actually.",False

Poets are simply those who have made a profession and a lifestyle of being in touch with their bliss. Most people are concerned with other things. They get themselves involved in economic and political activities, or get drafted into a war that isn't the one they're interested in, and it may be difficult to hold to this umbilical under those circumstances. That is a technique each one has to work out for himself somehow.

But most **people living in that realm of what might be called occasional concerns have the capacity that is waiting to be awakened to move to this other field. I know it, I have seen it happen in students.**

When I taught in a boys' prep school, I used to talk to the boys who were trying to make up their minds as to what their careers were going to be. A boy would come to me and ask, ""Do you think I can do this? Do you think I can do that? Do you think I can be a writer?""

""Oh,"" I would say, ""I don't know. Can you endure ten years of disappointment with nobody responding to you, or are you thinking that you are going to write a best seller the first crack? If you have the guts to stay with the thing you really want, no matter what happens, well, go ahead.""

Then Dad would come along and say, ""No, you ought to study law because there is more money in that, you know."" Now, that is the rim of the wheel, not the hub, not following your bliss.

Are you going to think of fortune, or are you going to think of your bliss?

I came back from Europe as a student in 1929, just three weeks before the Wall Street crash, so **I didn't have a job for five years. There just wasn't a job. That was a great time for me.**

Stanley Kubrick is probably the greatest filmmaker in human history. He made Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001 Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. His final film was Eyes Wide Shut. It was released posthumously. And how did you guys honour one of the most influential, innovative filmmakers in history? You fucking censored him.


Eyes Wide Shut was shown in its original form in Australia and Europe. But in the US, the MPAA awarded it an NC-17 rating. That meant financial suicide. Warner Brothers decided to censor the film to conform to an R rating. 


I know it sucks that we censored a video game where you shoot zombies, but you guys fucking censored Stanley Kubrick. And you didn't do anything about it! You just let it happen! And why didn't you do anything about it? Because you can't. Because the MPAA isn't a government organisation that is appointed by politicians who are democratically elected. It's run by Disney, Viacom, News Corp, Warner Brothers, Universal Studios and Sony. So instead of government censorship, you have corporate censorship. You can't vote out your corporations, they're just there and you can't do anything about them. I know which country I'd rather live in. 


And this isn't an isolated case. Here are some other films that were censored in the US, yet shown in their original form in Australia:


American Pie, American Psycho, Boys Don't Cry, Bruno, Crash, Desperado, The Dreamers, Eyes Wide Shut, The Getaway, The Godfather III, Inside Deep Throat, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Natural Born Killers, Predator 2, Pulp Fiction, Requiem for a Dream, Romper Stomper, The Rules of Attraction, Saw, Saw III, South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, Team America: World Police, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NC-17_rated_films


The same is true of video games and the ESRB. Yes, nothing is banned, but it's almost impossible to release a game that is AO.  Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all prohibit the release and sale of AO games.  You won't have any luck trying to release an AO game on a major console. Manhunt 2 was censored for the US market and toned down to get an M rating, and GTA: San Andreas was taken off the shelves after it was given an AO rating. ",False

Yeah, I imagine that most people think that, if they even consider what kind of information they're exchanging for free services.  Based on [past evidence](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1F3FF93AA3575BC0A9609C8B63), I doubt that most Web users are aware that there's any sort of logging happening *at all*.

Anyway, no, that won't hide you. Google has engineers that specialize in data-mining and has moved into providing ""free"" services that are particularly useful in identifying someone.

Google also owns DoubleClick, so it can track activity on different sites, YouTube, which has accounts (and stores Flash shared objects, which act as a cookie but aren't cleared by cookie settings), Google Talk (which has accounts), and Gmail (which also has accounts).  They know which IP you were using at any given time, and they will never throw away their logs.  With a bit of correlation, they can associate IPs and account names on any other site that that know passwords with your identity when searching unless you clear all other identities at the same time.  Even if you do exactly that, they still have browser version string and the fact that Identity I at IP X suddenly vanished in all forms and was immediately replaced by Identity J at IP X, who follows similar search patterns.

If you ever do Google Maps directions from, say, a home address or to identical addresses, or search for the same (rare) keywords, Google has another point with which to correlate identities.

Plus, Google acquires people and does partnerships.  So, let's say that ten years down the road, Slashdot is purchased by or cuts a deal with Google so that Google gets their logs.  Google can trivially correlate a Slashdot username with Google activity.  So if you subsequently log in to Slashdot, you've identified your IP to Google.  Same is true for any other site with accounts.  Think about Amazon.com, for example, or Reddit.  Or let's say they purchase Kongregate.com or another Flash games site that people tend to maintain persistend cookies for (or just cut a deal with them for logging data).

Ever email gmail.com users?  You're providing your IP address attached to your email address every time you do so.  If you're a large enough ""free"" email provider, you can get a pretty solid picture of where people are online with this.

It's certainly in their *interest* to do so, even if just for internal use -- Google is the largest ad-display company online today, and specializes in doing profiling and displaying accurately-targeted ads.  The fact that they can sell profile data  to arbitrary other parties down the road (unlike Europe, the United States does not place restrictions on what companies do with user data) who might use it for other purposes is also of concern.

And once you obtain an extensive profile of someone (the above data, times they tend to operate, etc), it becomes ever more difficult to vanish off the profile radar, since similar searches or communication with the same IM or email contacts can allow re-correlation with your own profile.

Google has generally been investing in systems that allow it to gather *exactly* this type of data, and then providing the services for ""free"".  They've experimented with free wireless access in Mountain View, CA (and tried in San Francisco, CA).  They're now [providing it in airports](http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/10/technology/Google_free_wifi_airports/).  Whenever you log on, you send out a unique identifier that re-associates you -- your wireless NIC's MAC.  They just started providing [free DNS service](http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/), which allows monitoring what DNS queries you perform (e.g. what websites you visit, even if you block advertisements or don't visit sites that DoubleClick monitors), also very useful for profile-building.",False

Originally published June 12, 2007

Kilimanjaro not a victim of climate change, UW scientist says

Scientist Philip Mote says researchers may consider his finding an inconvenient truth: The mountain is losing its snowcap, but not because of global warming.

""Kilimanjaro is a grossly overused mis-example of the effects of climate change,"" said University of Washington climate scientist Philip Mote, co-author of an article in the July/August issue of American Scientist magazine. 

Also, recent data from Kilimanjaro show temperatures on the 19,340-foot volcano never rise above freezing. So melting triggered by a warmer atmosphere can't be the reason the small summit ice sheet is retreating about 3 feet a year, said Georg Kaser, co-author of the new article and a glaciologist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.

Most glaciers in temperate zones, like those on Mount Rainier, extend to lower elevations where their terminus is warmed to the melting point in summer.

On Kilimanjaro, ice loss seems to be driven by two factors: a lack of snowfall and sublimation, the same process that causes freezer burn by sucking moisture out of leftovers.

Researchers believe Kilimanjaro's glaciers formed about 11,000 years ago, when the region was undergoing a period of wet weather that allowed snow to accumulate. But even before the first Europeans reached the summit in 1889, the weather has been dry in Eastern Africa. There simply hasn't been enough snowfall to keep up with the loss of ice due to sublimation, Kaser explained.

Sublimation, caused by exposure to sunlight and dry air, occurs when ice essentially skips the melting step and evaporates.

Kaser, who climbs Kilimanjaro twice a year to gather data, says the ice topography shows little evidence that melting is anything but a minor force. Jagged spires and cliffs made of ice up to 120 feet tall are not softened around the edges.

The two types of grapevines were basically hybridized, as the weaker specie grafted onto the other for resilience.  

Chile, however, has these nifty things called the Andes mountains. The winemaking region in particular is surrounded by desert, mountains, and a rather large ocean, not to mention that the weather is quite nice for winemaking. More importantly, this means that Chilean grapevines were not affected by the bug, and are, in fact, the original Vitis vinifera.

I believe some immigrants should be taken by all countries that can, but only those that are in imminent, horrible danger.  I've seen immigrants lining up to get public housing, claiming they've been living on the street for months while flashing fancy watches and bling.  Then there's the whole Sri Lankan boat people saga in Australia.  They refuse to go to Indonesia where they will be given public housing and whatever because they paid to get to Australia.  The whole system is broken.

I just think it's hypocritical when Australians want a 'White Australia' when it wasn't white to begin with.  The argument is weaker, because Australia has maybe 200 years of European culture whereas Europe has 500, 1000+ years to protect.

I don't see how it's insulting.  On the most simple level the situations are similar.  Aboriginal culture was diluted, then decimated by Europeans.  European culture is being diluted, although not yet decimated.

It's not that European culture is weak, it's that culture is something inherited and depends on where a person grows up.  Migrants simply do not take it up.  The same way that a person from Europe will always keep some part of their Europe-ness if they move to Africa, an African will never completely meld to European values.
