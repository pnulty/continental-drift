Psychologically, well, that was up to them, and they dropped the ball. A generation later they were unwilling to lift a finger to stop Germany, and that's entirely their fault. This is where Keynes comes in; I didn't mean his economic policies (which I largely agree with), I meant his assault on Versailles that completely discredited the treaty as vicious and barbaric. This is a huge part of the reason why no one really cared when Germany started tearing up clause after clause. The truth is that Versailles really wasn't that bad; in fact, it was far too light, since it allowed the German 'stab-in-the-back legend' to grow. And the fact that Germany and Japan did great after WWII despite far worse war damage and treaty sanctions illustrates this. So in short, by failing to handle Germany both at the end of the war and in the following decades, which was absolutely their responsibility, Europe dropped the ball and enabled itself to be torn apart in a more lasting way from 1939 on, burying the notion that it was still a power center and catapulting the US to the front.

And secondly, Latin America has never been a powerhouse and it won't be for the foreseeable future. The only nation that even has long (*very* long)-term potential to be a global power is Brazil, and it's got a long way to go. Historically, Latin America has been an excellent example of what to avoid, and certainly never an alternative power center to Europe or the US.

Of course America is an imperialist power, and is very good at it, given that as you've pointed out, we defeated or outproduced every rival we've had. But in 1500, it was hardly obvious Europe would utterly dominate the world in a few centuries. And in 1800, it was probably even less obvious that America would rise to become the richest nation on earth in less than a century. These cultures succeeded because of their own merits, and also because competing cultures that might have been global powerhouses (China, Russia, India, the Ottoman Empire, etc) tried to succeed and failed. 

So my point is that, while the debt limit talks reveal some of the worst of American politics, the reason this is such a bad thing for the world is that America is the richest, most powerful, and generally greatest nation on earth. And that's true not only because of our own merits but because the very nations criticizing us fucked up their own chances to compete. (And this is an incidental point but probably still important: take the beam out of your own eye, citizens of the world. America hardly has a monopoly on political dysfunction.)

The original motivation for moving to gasoline was that with a spark plug doing the ignition you would use a lower compression ratio and therefore the rotating parts would sustain less stress and could be made lighter.  Lighter parts allow you to reach higher top RPMs, which generally leads to a more pleasant and sporty driving experience in an automobile.  But to make up for this lower compression ratio, these new engines needed special fuel (i.e. gasoline) that was more highly refined (and therefore more expensive) than diesel so that it burned faster.  At this point efficiency/mileage was not a concern in the slightest, it was all about making the driving experience most pleasant.

Since that time, various ways of compensating for the diesel engine's lack of high RPM capability were popularized, such as lighter alloys and turbochargers.  And modern diesel automobiles have mostly shrugged off that reputation of being sluggish to drive, at least in places like Europe where petrol is really expensive.  And its higher compression ratio means it's more efficient, and the fuel is less refined so it's a double win for overall mileage/fuel prices.

You could run a diesel engine on regular gasoline/petrol, I think.  There might be an issue with seals being degraded, but otherwise there's nothing stopping you.

The English league is definitely amongst the top leagues in the world (quite possibly the best, although different people with different criteria may feel otherwise). It's a good place to start, but give Spain, Italy and Germany a chance too - they're the other top leagues. There's plenty of good football in France, Holland and Brazil as well.

Nobody knows from whence he came, but he has been depicted in a particular German woodcutting, and is the subject of an old German superstition. That children that lie to their parents are stolen away in the night by the slender man, and neither man nor beast can stop him.

The slender man himself, however, is not so easily satisfied. The slenderman chooses his prey based on many a condition. Some, he hunts, for they fear him. Some, he hunts, for they seek to know more about him, some, he hunts, for sport.

The slender man is not a beast like any other, however, he has no great maw or slavering howl, no vicious claws or furred flesh, the slender man is...intelligent, cunning, ruthless.

Should you look upon the slender man, you would see a man with unnatural height, a featureless face that stares with quiet intensity, and an impeccable suit. No, do not laugh, do not giggle, the slender man is not mocked, not to be mocked, it is unwise to arouse his wrath.

The slender man is unique in the sense that he does not feed, not that we know of, he does not sleep in any way we would recognise, and he does not feel in any way we would comprehend. The slender man enjoys toying with the prey he has chosen, sometimes stalking for months, appearing in flashes in the corner of their eyes, or off in the distance, staring his usual, quiet, serene stare. The calmest stare in the world, the stare with no facial expression, for he has nothing to express with. Those that have seen him report a lack of eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or hair. Eyebrows and facial hair is alien to him, the colour of his flesh, if indeed it is flesh, is akin to that of an albino, and while he bears no marks, one symbol and one symbol alone expresses his influence, a single circle, with a great ""X"" scrawled through the centre. 

The slender man has been seen in many areas other than Europe, lately he seems to be on a spree in central America. Demonstrating his ability to disable or distort various types of electronics simply by being in their presence, oftentimes those in particular that seek to record his image. However, images of the slender man exist, and are freely available, online, scrawled on walls by his victims, but know this. When you gaze upon a likeness of the slender man, even a crude scrawl by a desperate victim breathing his last breath, the slender man knows you, and the slender man does not keep company.

The slender man seeks his prey relentlessly, but what is unclear is precisely what he chooses to do with them. One of his victims was discovered dead, yes, but the slender man has taken many victims, and has been walking this earth for, according to the German Woodcarvings, at least five centuries. Is it possible the slender man is an agent of heaven? Of hell? Of extraterrestrials? Or perhaps a combined force of damned spirits longing for life, for human contact. It is impossible to say.

Solid locks and walls do not seem to restrict him, and he has been known to travel on his own across countrysides and borders as quickly as his prey can in a car, on a train, or on a plane. The slender man has no fixed abode, no easily avoided cave or lair. The slender man is not a beast, the slender man is calculating and cold.

How do you avoid this monstrosity? He that inspires rampant coughing in those he is hunting, particularly when he is near? The simple answer is, you do not. Once the slender man has set his sightless sights upon you, it is only a matter of time. Some have come to survive by endlessly fleeing, but sooner or later they tire, or they make a mistake, or, worst yet, the slender man simply becomes bored with pretending to be outrun. Othertimes people attempt to take his likeness in the form of crude worship, perhaps the slender man has a sense of irony about him, that these people emulate what commands the fear of men and beasts alike? as these people do not seem to be struck down quite so frequently, and yet they are quite mad, I assure you.

This last part, my friends, is the part you should pay heed to. Even if you know nothing else, know this. The slender man has no fixed habitat, but the slender man was originally seen in forests, areas with dense trees, and even parks. The slender man seems to, in one way or another, be drawn to such places. 

Sleep soundly, sleep quietly, and should you hear footsteps, or feel eyes upon you, do not, whatever you do, open your eyes.

To give you an idea of my frame of reference: My mom immigrated to Canada from the US in the early '70's, My husband lives in Texas, I live in Ontario, and I hate immigration processes everywhere. In the last 4 months I've gone from filling out apps to have my husband move here, to filling out apps to move me down there. So I've got a pretty good idea on a ton of this stuff.

The nitty gritty: From what I understand, you don't need a visa to come from the US in order to study. Talk to the program administrators, as they're going to be your best sources of information on this - they've likely done it a LOT.  However: that doesn't address the issue of your fiancee. There's no such thing as a fiance visa anymore, so in order to bring your fiancee in, if she's not studying, you may have to jump through some hoops, depending on your entry circumstances. If you get in, and she doesn't have a similar opportunity to enter, you'd have to either marry her in advance, or apply as Common Law, wherein you'd've had to live together for a year, and prove it. Marriage is BY FAR the easiest way to do it - even if you do a quick &amp; dirty town hall ceremony, with a party later. If you don't want to be living apart - which, i can tell you from the experience of having spent 12 weeks of my 9 months of marriage actually in my husband's company, really fucking sucks - this may be your primary concern.

The social benefits are good. Health care coverage, at least in Ontario, kicks in after 3 months of legal permanent residency. If you're going to UBC, they'll probably help you with this. If you get in legally, and your partner doesn't, that can be a problem. When we were doing up the paperwork for my husband, I had to promise to cover all his expense for 3 years - so if he had to go on welfare for anything other than a health related concern, we were up shit creek and he'd be sent home. I don't know whether or how this applies if you do it via employment. 

Cost of living in Canada is VERY VERY HIGH. This is sometimes shocking to Americans. Not as high as Europe, but still. Milk in southern ontario is approaching $5/gal, and gas is about $5.50/gal. Fruits and vegetables, despite being trucked up from the US for the large part, are cheaper. Don't ask me why. You're also going to pay significantly higher taxes, both in the form of income tax and sales tax - sales tax in Ontario is 13%. ""Free"" health care is not, in fact, free. But the peace of mind it brings me, is, to my mind, quite worth it.

The difference in personalities is strong. Canadians tend to be a more quiet, reserved, and ""polite"" nice, rather than the US's gregarious ""bear hug"" variety of nice. If we know there's a need, or we know the individual, we're so happy to help out it's ridiculous. We tend to be more empathetic towards those less fortunate, be it health, race, or gender.  There's less overt patriotism, but what is there is *very* strong. Keep in mind, as well, that there is no legal free speech, in Canada. (He isn't racist, but he does say things for shock value that could, in theory, get him fined or arrested.) 

None of this is meant to put a damper on your view of Canada (and really, this post in general may get me downvoted all to hell.) I love Canada. I REALLY love Canada, and I'm at times very frustrated with the circumstances that are causing me to have to move. I love it for all that it is, and all that it isn't, but I think a lot of people have this perfectly rosy view of it, and then get here and are shocked that it isn't the way they imagined. I like both countries the same, really - there are things about the US that I love, as well. They're different - they each have pros and cons - but having grown up splitting my time between the two, I find crazies in each (more in texas, sorry), I find glorious people in each. I find tremendous natural beauty in each. But they are still very different in a lot of ways. If you've got any more specific questions, feel free to PM anytime.

They also take Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian last names, which makes it even more confusing, even though sometimes they have more special given names.

As for their origin, they came from India during the Middle Ages as a nomadic people and used to be slaves in the Romanian principates until the 19th century when they were emancipated. The Romanian people have evolved on Romania's territory for over 2000 years (Dacian and Roman substrate, heavy Slavic influence after the Romans left, some Magyar and Turkish/Ottoman influence - genetically, culturally and linguistically). Which is why I said we don't share much with the Gypsies apart from a territory.

They are Romanian in the sense that they possess Romanian citizenship, but they're not ethnically Romanian. For instance Hungarians and Russians are other recognized minorities in Romania - officially they're ""Romanian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity"", which grants them the right to study in their own language, use it in public administration and so on.

This is the real reason we don't see many small or medium displacement diesels in cars and trucks in the US.

The cost of the emissions systems needed to put them into compliance with US regulations far exceeds the money you would save over 10 years from increased fuel efficiency.  Furthermore these complex emissions control devices (such as urea injection, EGR coolers, and a diesel particulate filter) negate the mechanical advantages of a diesel engine in the first place and increase complexity (DPFs decrease fuel efficiency, EGRs increase soot in engine oil and combustion lowering longevity, and the urea injection will put the car or truck in limp mode or simply disable the truck if not filled regularly).  Finally these new emissions control devices actually prevent the usage of biodiesel, wvo, and other renewable diesel fuel substitutes (read attached)

If you want to change this bitch and moan to congress to have separate lower standards for diesel cars and trucks (like Europe) and get the California CARB board to go to hell and disappear (never going to happen).  From what I can see unfortunately we will keep having a de facto ban on most diesel cars and trucks except for the huge towing 3/4+ ton trucks from the big three which are way more than most of us need.  It's really ironic that more fuel efficient vehicles that could actually provide an immediate decrease in national oil consumption get excluded in the name of environmental protection.

Americans and Europeans are very much like each other in being rather unpredictable. You're as likely to find a well-educated, articulate person in each locale as the next, and even that has no bearing on whether they'd just be a fun chat. 

To the extent that I'd feel comfortable about generalizing on the two places at all, Americans are -- for lack of a better term -- much more diverse. The average western European nation has about as many people as a small U.S. state (or even a large U.S. city) and is generally more ethnically homogenous as well. While this was by no means universally true, there was more political and cultural consensus among the Europeans I met than there was among the Americans, and, to be blunt, that's pretty much what I'd expect of the two. America is a very large country with a lot of people who aren't very much like each other. Europe is comprised of a lot of small countries with a medium-to-small number of people who often share a common genetic, cultural, and historical legacy.

What about them? They take up maybe 15% of our current budget...if you shift some of those services to the states you could easily squeeze them and more into 10% of our current budget. Also, private sector healthcare is cheaper (when the government isn't collaborating with the industry...) than anything the government can provide, so I would certainly prefer that if given the choice. 

&gt;seem to be doing far better economically and have a happier populace

The operative word here is ""seem"". That just doesn't *seem* very convincing to me. To me, your statement is over-simplistic. If you're talking about Europe, which was already ""developed"" before the US was even conceived of, I'm not sure how a direct comparison is entirely relevant. In any case, European nations face entirely different obstacles than the US. Let me add, for example, that one country matching your description is Greece. Please note, as well, that I would love to reduce our military spending almost completely.

&gt;10% just isn't really enough to take full advantage of being a nation.

How do you know?

&gt;You're one group of united people

Have you ever been to the US? In my eyes, everyone is an individual first and foremost. Even if that was not the case, it would be hard to justify the claim that Americans are a ""united people"". Some Americans want full-blown democratic socialism, while others want just short of anarchy. Those political ideals are not reconcilable. Compromise will not be satisfactory to either side. I think the best chance for the satisfaction of both sides' ideals comes in the structure of the US government (see the 10th amendment). Because, in the Constitution, much of the business of governing was left to the states (this principle has been dramatically diluted over the years, by the way), it's possible to have radically different state governments right next to each other. I don't see why this solution is not adequate, but I think the main opposition to it is that it would decrease the power of politicians in Washington. Until the American people can take the power back from Washington, they will be left unsatisfied.

&gt;why not be great

I would love to be great, but great for me means something different than it does for many other people. Great for me means living a life without government intervention at almost all levels.

The significant event in 1932 that this cartoon is likely commenting on is the Lausanne Conference. 

From [the wiki](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lausanne_Conference_of_1932):

&gt;In December 1932, the U.S. Congress rejected the Allied war debt reduction plan, which technically meant that the war reparations and debt reverted to the debt reduction previously granted Germany by the 1929 Young Plan. However, the system had collapsed, and Germany made no further payments. By 1933, Germany had made World War I reparations of only one eighth of the sum required under the Treaty of Versailles.  

An important element in the rise of the Third Reich was the nationalism and conspiracy theories that the Nazi party used claiming that the Allies were bleeding the German economy through unreasonable debt repayment structures.

So considering that it was Germany that was spending unreasonable sums on it's military while going deeper in debt, it is only reasonable to assume that ""those armaments turned out to be necessary"" if you also believe that invading Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, and Austria was necessary.",politics,,True,149,False,t3_j55hm

I can't make a direct comparison, but the US standard of living is rather high as well.  In fact, like much of Europe we're living much higher than we can afford.  We see this in our similar debt problems.

While there's a lot of complaining there is very little actual hardship on America.

&gt;when they suspect something is wrong with their body the go and consult a doctor without any care of financial consequence.

Few people in America actually pay their own medical bills.  Many are covered through government programs.  Many others through employer payed programs.  The employer programs are so heavily regulated that they are essentially government run programs funded a special tax on employers.  The 15 percent of people not covered by these programs are covered by laws that no one can be turned away from an emergency room.  They get free treatment there.  Further, many poor people are extended extensive credit by hospitals and doctors even if there's no hope of ever getting payed back.

A couple of weeks ago NPR (National Public Radio) broadcast a segment on an immigrant woman working as a hotel maid.  She injured her back and could not work.  She got the surgery she needed.  The hospital and doctors all knew she could never pay her bills and they would never see a dime.  While doctors and hospitals aren't made of stone their actions weren't entirely altruistic.  Most hospitals accept government money.  As part of this deal they are required to accept a certain amount of these cases.  This again is essentially a government run program.  This one is funded by a tax on medical facilities.  Of course these costs are passed onto the third party payer programs of the other 85 percent of Americans.

In America almost no one pays their own medical bills.  Our biggest medical problem is not a lack of health care.  It's the over use of health care.  Most healthy adults are taking several prescription drugs to ""treat"" high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other obesity related conditions.  Why take the trouble to loose weight when you can just get the drugs for free?

&gt;Our liberal parties are comparable to your republican party but without the craziness or the religion.

America's liberal (in the American sense) media makes a big deal of any possible issue in the Republican party.  While some Republicans openly express their religious beliefs, so do many Democrats.  Our Democratic president often makes religion based arguments in support of his positions.

It's only another evidence that people need metrics to assign value, which is the economics ideology.

Basically, in Japan, the patents are full of shit. Since engineers have life time employement and extremely rarely switch companies, companies fear that patents will disclose their trade secret. So they patent only incomplete processes (the latest still being secret), and they do so by increments every month or so.

For example, they patent stuff that is not current, but maybe 6 or 7 years old and every month they add a new feature that old. The current process being of course a trade secret.

This wouldn't work in an environment where engineers move from one company to another like in the US or Europe.

Even assuming that is true, you provide no proof of correlation between higher tax rates.  And even if there is correlation that spending someone else's money makes me happier, how is that even valid?  

You make extremely dogmatic claims, like people are happier in Denmark.  How can you even objectively measure happiness?  How do you find parity with factors in two different countries?

The poor and middle class receive tremendous federal income tax breaks in this country where in Denmark they have a very regressive VAT on almost everything.  Retirees receive an average of 120% of pre-retirement income.  Over 30% of their workforce are public sector employees, who add little or nothing to economic growth.

When ANYONE disobeys these rules, they put themselves and others at risk, because they are going against the flow and regiment of traffic. If I am in a left-turn-only lane (speaking from a RHD perspective, flip it for those in North America/Europe), I expect that everyone in this lane - cyclists included - are turning left with me. So when you decide that law isn't rational for you, for whatever reason you have, and go straight - you put us both in danger of having an accident.

So no. It's not irrational to follow most road laws. 

&gt;Just because something is the law doesn't mean it is right.

Perhaps in cases of drug laws, or the death penalty. Not in this case. Don't try and play smarts anarchist with traffic rules. You're going to get yourself killed and probably take someone with you.

&gt;P.S. I don't ride in a big city, I could see that being very, very different.

You should follow the goddamn road rules no matter where you are. Just because you have less traffic in the suburbs doesn't mean you can fuck around more.

My primary area of interest is law. While it's true that the UK could achieve similar legislative programmes in or out of the EU it would be impossible to achieve the level of pan-European harmonisation that is being created in it.

The headlines often rant against EU meddling (chocolate definitions, bacon regulations, etc.) but I would imagine that having identical regulations across the EU would strongly bolster the ability of business to branch out across Europe with reduced administrative costs. A lawyer would never have been able to have worked a UK-German issue without German partners (or a German division, if a huge firm) previously.

Also, remember France had, at the outbreak of WWII, the largest land army in Europe in official numbers (this was after significantly ramping up spending as Germany became more aggessive). Moreover, France had refused to give up the gold standard and were suffering a significant loss of exports as other countries devalued their currencies.

I need to see my parents but my dad is an asshole and he rewally fucked up my familys life. i need to see my mom god dammit so much to juggle on my plate right now when all i want to do is just sit at home and relax. especially since i am trying to go to bed earlier it feels like i never have enough time. I am such a fuck up living at my girlfriends parents house i really am. i feel like a piece of shit everytime I am around my girlfriends parents because at their age they were married and had their own house but now the economy is so shitty and workers wages are shit and i feel really fucked over.

I want to get out of the united states and go to europe but I feel really fucked over enetering the adult world at the time I am. I know I am not dumb enough to be working a minumum wage job for the rest of my life but I worry I am not smart enough to get a good job. I don't want to be rich but I have a diabtetic girlfriend (future) wife to take care of and I will need money for that.

I am never going to emasure up and everybody will see me fail.

I should have never worked that last job, it fucked my car up and the money wasn't worth it. I need to work more but I don't know how anybody works and goes to school at the same time. I don't know how my parents did it or my gfs parents. I am a fuck up. that seems to be a recurring theme here. It doesn't matter anyway, i have had thoughts like this ever since i was 6 when my dad would practically treat me like i was and in my teen years tell me i was. I wonder if that is what it was like for all the other mormon kids if their parents were as degrading as my dad was. 

he hasn't really been there for me. my sister hated him after he cheated on my mom, I think she always hated him and just uses that as a mental excuse to hate him. he fucked up my life but I love him and everytime I see him now i try really hard to let him know that but it is so distant and I can tell he doesn't even like me. he straight up told me the other month how he is disappointed in me, well what the fuck does he want me to do i am pretty much a failure.

Social democracy is a political attitude toward the existing economy. They want to expand the amount of social services the government provides without completely removing the role of the marketplace in the economy.  They believe the government has a responsibly to participate in the managing of the economy, but not taking all of the control away from businesses.  They want to create this by being voted into the government.  Groups like this are very popular in Europe.

Democratic socialism is a type of economy and government.  The people who support it see no place at all for a marketplace, and think that it hurts people and is unnecessary. Democratic socialism would provide everyone with the things that they need to live; like medicine, food, a house, a job, transportation, vacations, and more.  The economy would be planned ahead of time.  They would figure out what people need and make a plan to get it for them.  The people who decide these things would be elected, and decisions about the economy would be decided by everyone.

Here's pretty much the best quote:

&gt; The American author accuses the Andalusian capital of having hospitals that stink of urine, hopelessly inefficient phones and corrupt policemen. Most wounding of all, Brown attacks Seville's best-loved monument, the international symbol of its Moorish heritage: the 12th-century Giralda tower.
The Giralda, Brown sneers, ""has stairs so steep that tourists have died here. This is not America, there are no warning signs, nor banisters, no advice about insurance policies. This is Spain. If you are stupid enough to fall, it's your own fault, independently of who built the steps.",fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,,True,6,False,t3_j53fw

...on the back of the American military, sure.  

""The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress – and in the American body politic writ large – to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense.  Nations apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets.

Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed,  Future U.S. political leaders– those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me – may not consider the return on America’s investment in NATO worth the cost.""

In UPC codes (or any other bar code system) you don't need infinite options, you just need enough options so that there is at least one number available for any given product.  If your barcode was five digits long and represented 00000 to 99999, you would have 100,000 options.  If you needed more, adding one digit would bring you to 1,000,000 options.  Even though every possible UPC code isn't assigned, current standards go to about one trillion (1,000,000,000) total codes, which is sufficient for now.  In reality, the UPC code is the old standard, and more frequently you're actually seeing EAN (European Article Number, now called International Article Number).  EANs break a product into a manufacturer number and an item number, and provide 13 digits (with an extra two-to-five digits when needed, such as with periodicals), which provides an extremely large amount of flexibility.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code gets pretty detailed.

The error coding in a UPC/EAN bar code (which are the most common barcodes you see as a consumer, though there are plenty of others) is pretty basic.  At the end of the real data, there's one digit.  This digit is determined by a mathematical formula which uses the other numbers.  If any of the other numbers are wrong, the check digit will not match.  The software that reads the bar code will then know it hasn't read the barcode correctly.  This is corrected by just trying again, reading from another angle, or changing the distance.  If it can't be corrected - for instance the barcode is physically smudged, ripped, or damaged - the system won't be able to read it at all.",explainlikeimfive,,True,4,False,t3_j59ni

&gt;George Stibitz

First off he is only considered ONE of the many fathers of modern computers.  If we were going with mechanical, I could cite this:

&gt;Around the end of the tenth century, the French monk Gerbert d'Aurillac brought back from Spain the drawings of a machine invented by the Moors that answered Yes or No to the questions it was asked (binary arithmetic). Again in the thirteenth century, the monks Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon built talking androids without any further development (Albertus Magnus complained that he had wasted forty years of his life when Thomas Aquinas, terrified by his machine, destroyed it).

&gt;Polio vaccine

Salk I know.  But who came up with vaccines?

Sometime during the 1770s Edward Jenner heard a milkmaid boast that she would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because she had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, inoculated an 8-year-old boy with it, and six weeks later variolated the boy's arm with smallpox, afterwards observing that the boy did not catch smallpox. Further experimentation demonstrated the efficacy of the procedure on an infant. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practiced in England, was banned in 1840. Louis Pasteur generalized Jenner's idea by developing what he called a rabies vaccine, and in the nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.

You could argue that at the top it is basically the same thing, although I would dispute this, but here comes one of the best/worst features of the EU beurocratic appartus. It is HUGE (in all capital letters), there are countless possibilities to interact with the EU on the lower levels and with multiple different agencies under the roof of the EU. It is astonishingly easy to get EU funds for endeavors of very different natures. Hell I know of a group named RAF (after the terrorist group), which is situated in Germany and gets EU funding. I also attended anti-government anarchist camps a few years ago which were financed in large parts by the EU. Easy and without any interference.

There are statistics that look at how much of the money a country could get from the EU they actually use. For many EU members the percentage is fairly low. (This is a whole other topic). What people do not realize is that such money is avaiable at a low level of organization and can be got quite easily were you actually to ask.

I also speak from even more personal experience since my father is a farmer and farming is still a central aspect of the EU, although it used to be much bigger. We spend a good deal of our time every year to get a hold of the dwindling or goal changing subventions. (Dwindling for farmers raising pigs since European farmers are supposed to enter world-market conditions at a far point in the future, therefore they are slowly decreased.

Back then, the people who built the churches didn't have any computers or even calculators. They needed to know how strong to build the arches and roofs in the churches and they had to do all the math in their head. 

This was hard math, and not everybody could learn it. It took many years of training and building work to become a master builder. These master builders were called master masons.

Master masons liked to make churches fancy by telling stories from the bible with the stone. They sometimes used to make 12 arches in a church because that was how many apostles Jesus had. Or sometimes they liked to use two big pillars to show that God and Jesus stand side by side. They had lots of special maths and special stories, that ordinary people could not understand.

Some of these masons travelled from town to town, helping to build churches, and they were called free masons - because they were allowed to travel where they wanted. Some even travelled to different countries to build things.

Then big wars came and towns were not able to build churches anymore because all the men were at war fighting.

Some of the masons became soldiers, and they went to fight in the holy lands where Jesus grew up. They were interested in some of the holy buildings there, especially the ones mentioned in the bible. They made their headquarters at one of the oldest churches in Jerusalem. They dug lots of tunnels under the church because the bible said there could be huge treasure there.

When the wars ended, the mason soldiers went home again. They were now a very rich organisation (maybe from the treasure), and some of the kings demanded money and gold. The wars the kings fought were very expensive and the mason soldiers lent lots of money to the kings.

After some years the king of France decided the masons were too powerful and too rich, and he hunted and captured most of them. Maybe he couldnt afford to pay back his loans.

The day that the King captured the masons was Friday the 13th. And that is why we don't like that day today, even 700 years later!

The king was very bad, and he even set fire to some masons and put their heads on sticks. He did this to warn people that they were not allowed to be masons in a secret club anymore.

This made the masons that escaped capture very afraid. They thought their special math and special stories would be forgotten. So they got into a big boat and they sailed from France to Scotland. 

The king in Scotland was friendly and he allowed some mason families to stay. He allowed them to build temples to have meetings together where they would tell their special stories.

After hundreds of years of having meetings, and having people who never built a church, the stories changed a bit, and people sort of forgot what they were all about. But they still called each other freemasons.

At this time, lots of people from Europe moved to America, and some of the freemasons went as well. They continued with their club and their stories in new towns in America.

Some of the Americans didn't like the freemasons because the club was secret and the freemasons couldnt talk about it to ordinary people. This was still a long time ago. Because the freemasons were rich and owned businesses, they were respected and some of them became politicians. 

After a while ordinary people saw how sucessful and respected freemasons were, and they wanted to join as well. Today lots of people are freemasons and go to meetings.

In the period from the end of the Civil War until the turn of the century, the US economy experienced extremely rapid growth. The US went from a mid level nation to the undisputed economic leader of the world almost before Europe realized what was going on. Take the steel industry, for example. England had dominated the steel industry for literally hundreds of years, but it took US steel mills about 20 years to surpass them in productivity and output due to innovative new plant designs. Soon English steel companies were sending representatives to American factories to figure out how they were doing it. American inventions such as the gun stock lathe shocked European engineers and solved the age-old problem of interchangeable parts, which was basically the birth of the modern machine. This was the period that the US came up with breakthrough inventions such as the light bulb, the telephone, photographic film and the phonograph, just to name a few.  

Like I said, that isn't definitive. You could make a case for Germany. The US would probably come out ahead if you're considering industry and practical inventions, while Germany would lead if you considered advancement of pure science, which Germany would continue to lead the world in until European scientists flocked to the US around WWII and established the US as the scientific powerhouse it currently is.",politics,,True,3,False,t3_j4vrb

Last I heard (end of June), the exchange rate for dollars was 8:1 so you'll definitely come out ahead. You could probably even afford to eat out most days without having to cook. We were able to get two three part meals (salad, soup, entree) with tea and drinks for ~ $10 - and that's not trying to really save money. If you go to a local marketplace (which is a popular place to buy groceries) or a supermarket, you should be able to get lots of food at a low price as well. I don't really remember any exact prices because I never bothered to memorize them, but to give you an approximate amount: a 2 liter carton of juice is ~$2, good meat (no bones, good cuts) is around $4-7 a kg, relatively pricey fish is $2-4 a kg, 1-2 liter drinks and mineral water &lt; $1. Milk, eggs, greens, etc. should all also be inexpensive. I think you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised by how much food you can easily afford. Just think about it this way - the amount of money it would cost you to get a burger, fries, and drink at McDonald's over in the US would get you a healthy and multi part meal at any moderate restaurant over there. I'd probably bring $100-200 per month and you'd be able to eat like a king.

* The language situation is kind of complicated over there. The official language is Ukrainian now and they're changing all correspondence, signage, paperwork, etc. over to that. I only have experience living in Crimea where Russian is still predominant so I can't really speak for Eastern Ukraine. However, since you're not a native speaker, I don't think it would really matter what language you try learning. I would probably suggest Russian since it seems like you could get more use out of it in the long run and it's quite similar to Ukrainian anyway. However, Ukrainian might serve you better in understanding signs and directions in the country and I would guess that a lot of people in the northern parts of the country are now speaking it. Just pick one and go with it and if you're really curious, you will quickly discover many similarities between Russian and Ukrainian.

* Alcohol is pretty popular over there; it's true. I wouldn't really worry about being ""prepared"" to drink ridiculous amounts because noone will look down on you if you don't or try to force you. In most mature circles, alcohol will be brought out for big occasions - dinners, reunions, meetings, etc. However, I guess Ukrainians like to celebrate a lot of things in life, but, like I said, it's up to you how much you drink. If you find yourself among other college aged individuals, I'm sure you'll quickly discover wild parties and just casual get-togethers  where a lot of drinking goes on, but that's not really any different from the situation over in the US or wherever else. Vodka has infamously become synonymous with Russia and Eastern Europe and there is a reason for it. A lot of people there like to drink and many even drink excessively and suffer from alcoholism, so I'm sure you'll hear quite a number of entertaining stories about drunken people doing stuff you wouldn't even think about. Personally, I suggest trying out various types of alcohol over there - but don't pinch pennies when buying liquor and never buy from street vendors or sketchy shops. You could easily get a fake bottle of liquor which will quickly make you sick and could send you to a hospital even. That doesn't mean that you should buy the most expensive liquor you see, but don't get the cheapest and try asking the locals what's good currently - they'd know. I suggest trying the Crimean wines when you get down there - the region is famous for its vineyards. I actually brought back several bottles of good wines back with me to the US from my trip. Also, there are some beers worth trying - look for a large selection (supermarket, liquor store) and pick the ones that look like they're made by a private brewery. I can't remember the name of a brew company that I really enjoyed, but they have like 10 different types of beer and I think they're based in Lviv. Koktebel cognacs are also quite delicious and highly recommended.

I'm glad I can help you with your trip a bit. Keep the questions coming if you've got them and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. Always glad to assist a fellow college student. I'm sure you'll find your trip eye-opening and unique - you will see a whole other side of the world which can't really be experienced anywhere else.

While it's true that the US spends *on average* more per student than most countries, this is significantly skewed by the higher prevalence of private schools and uneven distribution of funds to higher income neighbourhoods.  A large majority of students are getting significantly less than the average amount spent per student.  My concern with K-12   education is not that the richest 50% are getting screwed -- they aren't.  It's that the bottom 50% are.

However, my concern within the context of this question is that of higher learning (although I would limit that to the trades and sciences, and exclude the liberal arts).  In that context, money is definitely the answer.

Starting at the base, poor kids can't afford school without loans, and poor kids typically lack the grades to qualify for many grants and scholarships while they may still possess the raw intelligence and ability to succeed once outside of their home environment.

Assuming the student eventually locates primary education funding and graduates, there's very little money available for basic research.  You know how many graduates there are out there either working minimum wage jobs or otherwise not making any significant use of their education?  Spending money on public science would be a vastly better use of government money than what it's currently being spent on.

As for corporate subsidies, I'm not claiming that Europe is doing a better job with its finances.  Their economy is also screwed.  I disagree that they are a drop in the bucket, but I don't have specific figures on hand.  that doesn't really change my point though, as I wasn't trying to point out the things that would be most beneficial to the deficit, but instead trying to point out the things that I thought should be cut most.

Personally, we didn't play a large role. The Potawatomi's of that time were mostly fled to Wisconsin and other places far away from the action. If you mean Indians in a general sense, I think the people of that time were exploited by both sides, but hey, story of my life, right?

Religion has not done the world good:  Wars like the crusades, the 30 years war in Europe, the current War on Terror, the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Irish Troubles, and many others can cite religion as a primary cause or aggravating factor.  The opposition to the civil rights movement came from Baptist preachers and the KKK was organized around such churches.  In WWII the pope welcomed Hitler into Italy, and the Catholic French welcomed the Nazis into their country, as well.  The preachers in Rwanda helped to fuel the fire of hatred in that country, as well, leading to 800,000 dead.  Look at the correlation between faith and hatred of minorities, gays, and rational thought.  How many years of knowledge were lost in the massive book burnings ordered by the religious?

And the big one, you *can* be good without God.  Ask them if God reflects a moral law or creates it.  Ask her if she would obey the word of god if it contradicted what she knew to be right.  Then ask her if the Bible is God's word or whether the morals, at least, are correct.  If she answers yes, then point out basically anything in Deuteronomy or the Old Testament at large.  There's some pretty fucked up stuff up in there.  If she answered no before, or after you point out those passages, then you can ask her where she gets her morals when the bible contradicts her own.  And hope she doesn't beat you for questioning her.  That's in the Bible, too.

It depends on what you mean by 'individual liberty' and 'collectivism', I guess. We hate capitalism because it values individuals over the collective, so in that sense, it's collectivist.

'Classical liberalism' is a loaded term. It's too broad of a concept to completely accept or reject it; especially insofar as it relates to economics. I think non-confused anarchists will see that there's usually no clash between liberalism and anarchism. There is a radical center. That's why I call myself a communitarian.

But I've been told (by a Scot) that this difference of position is the result of a cultural difference between Europe and America.

Links would be helpful. I have read reports of an ""exodus"" of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits from the Kashmir valley, the region that is majority Muslim. It is difficult to find raw data, although [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandits) suggests numbers of ~200,000, and cites books that I am not currently able to find. It also cites the CIA world factbook page on India, which continues to list 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits as being Internally Displaced Persons.
- Why not let the people decide? Certainly seems like a reasonable thing to consider. One argument you've put forth for it is that Nehru agreed to the UNSC resolution. A few counterarguments are: (1) the resolution was passed at a time when the powers that be in the security council were certainly not pro-India (or even neutral towards India), so why should India acquiesce to demands made by such warmongers? (2) like I said in my above post, there is simply no precedent for *any* federation to let a state secede peacefully, and as far as I know, the Indian Constitution itself makes no provision for this. Although this may sound undemocratic, the people of each generation in any state are never consulted as to whether they want their state to continue being a part of the country that it is in, so this isn't exactly unusual.
- Although the people of the Indian subcontinent may speak different languages, follow different faiths (or none at all) and tell their children different bedtime stories, there *are* common threads that bind us that go beyond state lines. So many of the words in our languages share common roots (even across the Indo-European Dravidian language family divide), one state's cuisine is heavily influenced by its neighbours and our legends of archetypal heroes are similar. A united India is not simply a relic of the British empire. Numerous emperors for millennia have united some or all of the people of the subcontinent, and our myth books have long spoken of Bharatvarsha. Secession of India's states is something that India's competitors would very much like to see, as it is a tacit acknowledgement that the dream of Indian unity has failed. We are kidding ourselves if we do not expect Kashmir secession to embolden a wave of separatist movements in other parts of the country. Even then you could argue that if it is the democratic will of the people in those states to secede, so be it. However, in a land with so many illiterate and gullible people, it will be all too easy for the rich and corrupt who will profit most from the chaos that ensues upon secession, to convince the poor masses that all their problems stem from being a part of the Indian union. Being majority Muslim is not a good enough reason alone for Kashmir to leave, as India has nearly as many Muslims as Pakistan, and is not a country founded for Hindus alone.

Greece's taxes are higher than US taxes-how high do you want them to be? Should everyone simply pay 100% taxes and have the government feed and house them? That would certainly simplify things.

Of course, I knew you were, which is why I said a direct comparison to the US is nearly worthless. Countries in Northern Europe are rich in natural resources and have small, homogeneous populations. It doesn't take a genius to keep them solvent...

It's not a ""total budget for state and federal expenses""...pretty much whenever the term ""budget"" comes up in regards to US politics it's referring solely to the federal budget. I believe, as the US Constitution states, that the majority of governing should be done at the local level. The federal government has no business funding local roads, schools, hospitals, et cetera. 

I think the most reasonable plan is to shrink the federal budget and allow the state governments more responsibility. Let the people truly have a say in choosing their masters. It is much easier to get 600,000 people (the population of Wyoming), or even 37,000,000 (California), to agree on something than it is the 300 million + that make up the US.

One last point-if we were to write out the section of the budget dedicated to military spending, it would cut the budget in half.

These were originally owned by absentee urban aristocrats who hired professional managers to direct teams of slaves. Toward the end of the Roman empire, the simplification of society during the fall led the population to return to the countryside, and made slave labor much harder to obtain. The landowners responded by offering free citizens a portion of their latifundia in exchange for a labor obligation. Over time these farmers lost their independence to varying degrees and evolved into medieval peasants.

At the same time, the breakdown of central Roman authority permitted both local leaders and barbarian invaders to take over the latifundia system from the absentee landlords. Over time the latifundia evolved into the medieval manorial system with a local lord collecting the fruit of surplus labor from a land-bound peasantry.

The final piece of the puzzle arrived in the 8th century: the stirrup. The stirrup created a powerful social class of lance-toting knights on horseback that swept away the old land-owning aristocracy and created a military society of mutual obligations between mounted knights, funded by the manorial system, known as feudalism.

The European aristocracy arose in those areas that were original part of the Roman agricultural world - the latifundia that evolved into manors - and were later conquered by the mounted knight, the most effective military technology between the end of the Roman legion and the invention of firearms.

In today's world those views are called ""humanism"" (more or less) and are hardly shocking. But because the Bavarian government was an absolute monarchy — and officially Catholic — these views were not very popular with the regime, and so the Illuminati were more than a little bit secretive.

The group had a few thousand members, including scholars and artists. However, their security wasn't perfect; eventually their membership list leaked to the monarchy's secret police, the group was broken up and abolished and its founder exiled.

Later, it became something of a common myth or conspiracy-theory that the Illuminati had gone underground and were plotting to overthrow the monarchies of Europe — and specifically had masterminded the French Revolution. This was pretty much the 18th-century equivalent of the ""Red Scare"" or ""9/11 Truth"" or any other political conspiracy theory.

The idea of the Illuminati stuck around, especially in right-wing accusations that someone or another was a pawn of the Illuminati.

The number of European pros that are playing at a very high level is greater than their American counterparts, and the best European players are better than the American players (other than Huk and perhaps Idra, but they both play/ed in Korea, with the Korea work ethic and other factors).

Group B:KR-KR-US-EU-US-US

Group C:US(KR)-KR-EU-EU-US-US

Even in just the group stages of 2 tournaments, European players in general do better than American players. Idra is almost a Korean player in terms of work ethic and history, and TLO is suffering from injuries, but other than that European players consistently place higher. This is without Jinro, White-Ra and Morrow, probably some of the best European players that did not participate. 

If you look at the top 100 in the prize pool, if you exclude Koreans and those who play heavily in Korea (Jinro, Huk, Idra), there are 29 Europeans to 10 North Americans, 6 of which are Canadian. In fact, despite having less number of ""pros"" than the US or Canada, if you exclude GSL winnings Swedish players outearned US players outright and German and Ukrainian players came really close to matching the prize money.

Also, you don't see European players complaining about lack of practice time or making snide comments about practice and ""having no life."" In fact, most of the players who play/have expressed interest in playing in Korea are European, and when asked about Koreans Europeans generally respond with respect and a desire with wanting to play there and get better, not excuses on why they (Koreans) are better and how they could be as good if they just played more.

To summarize:

1.European players on average and by individual players are better than American

2.Making excuses/apologetic statements is much more strongly expressed by American than European players, which is why Europeans aren't included.

Sneijder was in the Euro 2008 all-stars, the WC 2010 all-stars, the 2010 UEFA European XI and the 2010 FIFPro World XI. He has won the Dutch, Spanish and Italian leagues as well as the Champions League and the World Club Cup. He's undoubtedly one of the best free kick takers in the world.

He was man-of-the-match in 4 World Cup games. He was awarded European Midfielder of the Year.

You are kidding yourself if you don't think that he is one of the biggest players in the world. A transfer would lead to many, many Sneijder United shirts being sold.

Absolutely, but it isn't always the case.  If you take the changes that China has been able to make, despite corruption etc it is still very impressive.  The level of growth and the pace of change is well beyond what most of the major world powers went through (because this process isn't new any more), but it still isn't a given.

&gt;People always talk about the improvement in quality of life for the Chinese as if it were an earth shaking thing.

Probably because changing the way billions of people live simply hasn't been done before and because the differences are immense and on a scale we simply haven't seen before..

&gt;Even after the improvement, quality of life is still not near Western standards.

Not for all and not yet.  What seems to be being missed is that China does have the capacity to end up with an economy many times larger than that of the US or the EU bloc, there are  no real reasons for US dominance any more.  Now whilst I don't think that's terribly likely in the next quarter of a century, it is certainly possible and will likely be matched with a continued reduction in standard of living elsewhere, at least to some small extent.

The heat wave that affected at least 200 million people in the United States during the past week and a half has finally subsided, but not before shattering or tying thousands of records. The geographic extent of the heat wave was highly unusual, with temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater and heat indices much higher than that stretching from Texas to North Dakota, and eastward all the way to Maine. 


This one will long be remembered for its widespread scope, high humidity levels, and dangerously warm nighttime low temperatures that remained above 80 F in many locations.

 
Nationally, 1,966 daily high maximum temperature records have been broken or tied so far this month (through July 23). Sixty-six of those records were all-time maximum temperature records.More impressive, however, are the figures for highest minimum temperature records. Because of the extremely high humidity levels during this heat wave, a whopping 4,376 record highest minimum temperature records were broken or tied through July 23. Of those minimum temperature records, 158 were all-time records.

 
In many ways, this heat wave exemplified the type of extreme heat events that climate science studies show are becoming more common in many parts of the world, likely due at least in part to manmade emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Studies of specific extreme heat events, such as the deadly 2003 European heat wave and last summerâ€™s heat wave and wildfires in Russia, have demonstrated that they were also associated with unusually large, intense high-pressure systems. 

In most states on the East Coast, their temperature records go back forever - it is something to break a record high or an all time record high or a record minimum low after all these years of recording temps! ]

At first they were royal agents sent out by Charles but after c. 802 they were important local magnates. They were responsible for justice, enforcing capitularies, levying soldiers, receiving tolls and dues and maintaining roads and bridges.

Not at all the problem.

I'm ignoring the ""all bluster"" Empire of Ottomans and Austria, which would have been lucky to keep what they had.

I'm fairly certain that the first four would have happily sat on the status quo and they had zero interest in wars. The problem was that the next two (Japan and Germany) felt that they had been shafted in this quite thoroughly. Why did France own so much of the world and Germany owned so little? The first four most definitely used their massive resource bases to bully the next two.

So no, the Empire could have gone well with just producing tons and tons of butter. However, they had so much butter that those who couldn't access all that butter started making guns instead.

In all honesty, after living in China, I really think it is the corruption driving the development, similarly to Taiwan's ""miracle"". At the end of the day, much of those construction and industrial corporations are owned by sons of communist party officials with little to no opportunity given elsewhere.

You're right about the scale. But keep in mind we are talking about the Eastern coastal areas, inner and rural China hasn't improved that much.

China has the possibility to be the world's largest developed market, but I am skeptical, much like those that talked up Mexico (which makes similar per capita) in the 80's. The USA and EU is a large market with lower wealth disparity and a long history of development along with good rule of law and a decently fair chance for competition. The USA has six huge megatropolis, and the EU is largely urban. Although China is 50% urban, the wealth disparity is still huge, and those in urban areas as we both agree is still far. Furthermore China is riddled with some of the world's worst examples of anti-competitive behavior against foreign corporations leading many experts to regard China as protocapitalists and some former pro-China business advocates to write it off.

First off:  I never said you had a choice in your identity, just that identity representation is a performance.  To put it in theater terms, from one flaming homosexual to another, we are simply given our lines to read without much stage direction:  we have the freedom in how to read them, but not what we're reading.  

I didn't claim that your or anyone's identity was not theirs or that they had a giant choice in the matter.  I did say that it wasn't biological.  There's a lot of room for things that aren't inherently biological but that we don't have a choice in, which effect our personality/values/etc. when we reach adulthood:  what social class we grow up in, how our parents treated us as children, etc.

Furthermore, the main (and my major) argument against femininity/masculinity as innate is that it hasn't always existed in its present form.  Different cultures and different time periods had entirely different ideas about what was ""masculine"" (for instance, the tendency to wear tights and heels in 18th century Europe.... by men.  As the height of masculine fashion).  Basically, what I'm saying is that our ideas about what makes someone masculine or feminine have changed throughout history, and treating them as biologically based or innate is questionable anthropologically and questionable historically.  They will keep changing.  People don't have a choice as to what is masculine/feminine when they are born, nor do they have a choice as to how they are raised or, through a variety of socialized effects, what they feel is their identity.

That's all I've said.  I haven't said that one form of masculinity is better than another.  I haven't said that there is one way to be male:  in fact, I've stated several times now that there are many ways to be male, and they vary throughout history and from one country to another.  (Fun anthropological fact:  In Mexico, men singing passionate songs and crying as they do is considered very manly.  By contrast, in Japan, men showing any emotion at all is considered unmanly.  In the US, showing aggressive emotion is considered manly, but showing a ""soft side""/etc. is considered unmanly)

Essentially, what I'm saying is:  your claim about brain chemistry could easily be explained through the brain's plasticity and I haven't seen evidence that was sufficiently scientifically convincing.  Your claim that such behaviors are biologically innate, on a side note, is also questionable.  And lastly, our behaviors are -not innate, but socialized-, and that we don't have that much choice in the matter (lines/reading).

---

For the record, your personal assumptions about me are also incorrect. I am about as flamingly not-straight as it's possible to be and not come back around the other end.  Aside from the fact that I do sleep with and am attracted to women (I'm queer/flexible/etc., and I also am attracted to and sleep with men), I am about as stereotypically gay as it's possible to get.  I do drag, I feel almost more comfortable in heels than 'normal' shoes, I wave my hands around, and I'm currently wearing a really cute pair of rose earrings that are my go-to earrings when my peacock feathers won't match my shirt (I was wearing a black shirt with various colored stripes, and black roses just went better).  I am possibly -more not-straight- than you.  I do this because it's what I enjoy, because it's who I feel like I am, and because it seems like an accurate representation of my identity.  I don't feel the need to claim that my behaviors are biologically innate or coded for, because I've seen no reliable evidence that they are.",lgbt,,True,0,False,t3_j4q5k

I'm so sick of all this ethnic cleansing accusation garbage. Yes, there were war crimes, no there wasn't ethnic cleansing. To this day only 10,000 bodies have been found after years of searching. Serb, Roma and Albanian bodies, but mostly Albanian and probably KLA fighters. The KLA was classified a terrorist organization before 1999 and suddenly in 1999 were reclassified as freedom fighters. 

The vast majority of Albanians started fleeing Kosovo after the NATO bombing started because they were careless. Before you go on about precision bombs, keep in mind this was 12 years ago and they hit the Chinese embassy by mistake. On top of that ~500 Serbian people died as collateral damage with 2500 more being Seriously wounded. So of course, with the heaviest bombardment taking place in Kosovo, the Albanians fled fearing becoming collateral damage themsevles, and since they had a freindly place to flee, Albanian, it made perfect sense. 

Kosovo isn't independent. If it were, then I guess since I'm the majority ethnicity in my apartment I will form my own state of Redditovo just cause I can.

I think in may instances you are correct in thinking that we are heading to a society without religion but there are things reinforcing it in the modern world. For instance we are seeing a greater influx of those of the Muslim faith enter Europe and their belief structure is so intertwined with their culture and traditions I'm not actually sure it can be ""tamed"". The thing with Judo-Christian and Muslim faiths is that they are so un-shaking, unmoving to their core beliefs. Not considering the more moderate amongst them for the moment. Honour killings are still not uncommon in the UK and we seem to have a few every now and then which just seems insane within our society.

In a society like ours which has evolved over thousands of years with the influence of not only religion but its attached morality, that experience grafts its mortality to the population as a whole, so you need not be religious yourself to be affected by it. When I was young I believed in god ""passingly"" but I pretty much put that to bed as I entered my teens. I could not support or condone some of its mentality and to me at the time, even at that early age it seemed immoral.

I was raised in a pretty poor area but I had educated parents and I often looked for conversation with those much older than me rather than my own age, I'm not sure if that had any bearing on my changing belief's. But it is easy to note that most of my friends at the time and still now have a belief or duty to God (generally Christianity in my area) simply because it was how they where raised. When I ask someone if they believe in god and then why they believe in god I often get a look of confusion not so much at the question I feel but the realisation within themselves that they don't actually know either and for a fleeting moment are trying to work it out why they actually do. These are people that have had no real education in religion and have really just been told ""this is what you are and this is what you believe"". I live in a fairly uneducated region and many people just wont even think to ask ""why"", ""why do I believe that and why is it right?"" And I think this is where most of the problems are and this is why we are holding onto archaic beliefs in a modern society.

If you are not familiar with the source of the debt. It is the long-standing history of the US ""borrowing its own money from the Federal Reserve at interest paid to the Fed's European owners"" - The US has had three central banks in its history, every one of them forcibly implemented via corruption and/or blackmail, and every one of them primarily owned by the Rothschild family. The whole ""taxation without representation"" relates to this - it is why people were fleeing Europe.

The stinky part of this deal was this:

If the US wants to be able to borrow more money from the Fed (European Banksters), they had to agree to form a ""super congress"" which reduces the number of people that must be bribed from 500+ down to just twelve. So, the European banksters can make even MORE exorbitant profit at the expense of the US taxpayer.

Please note, however, that you, as an ordinary person, are not supposed to be allowed to know this. So, there will be tons of shills coming out of the woodwork to call this a ""conspiracy theory"" and bury this comment where no one can see it... or will at least discredit it.

But, you asked. It's the truth. And the media won't tell you... and the politicians *can't* tell you or they lose all campaign funding.

Follow the money. Ask yourself: Who are the shareholders of the Federal Reserve? Why do we *borrow our own money* from them? Why is our government held hostage over this issue of borrowing from them? What the fuck is all this nightmare?

Then, read this [comic](http://imgur.com/WNxTP) for a quick summary to help you keep this truth in your mind when you go to the polls. But, DO NOT vote for Ron Paul for the following reason: If he gets elected, the European banksters will deliberately crash the economy so that Paul will be blamed for it.

Americans are lacking compared to their European peers mainly because of laziness. European pros and Huk have all called out Americans for generally putting comfort and life over their career as progamers. While Europeans enjoy comfort and life as well, they definitely practice a lot harder than Americans.

It all comes down to the drive to improve. Players like Huk and Naniwa has it, while certain American players prefer to spend the day working out at the gym, hanging out with wife/gf, goof around on streams while playing with their pets, and maybe spend 2-3 hours laddering a bit if they are not already ""too exhausted."" If that doesn't work out, I guess the next best thing is to express anti-korean sentiment on a SoTG or ITG.

Let's also discuss how underperforming American pros tend to take ""credit"" for foreign victories. Whenever a Huk, qxc, or Naniwa wins for example, I am sure many of us scredditors have seen American ""pros"" saying stuff along the lines of ""Foreigners beating Koreans again! Let's keep this coming."" It's almost insulting because these pros I've mentioned above have taken upon themselves to dedicate their lives to improve in the game, whether that be in the forms of training in Korea or investing 12+ hours a day working on builds. Meanwhile we have our shit pros riding the foreign pride train having done nothing for the entire day besides working out and watching Harry Potter in the theater after a dinner date with their girlfriend. Good American/Foreign pros put in the sacrifices to win and improve and it's terrible how some of our players are adding trophies to their ego cabinet while having done nothing but complain about Korean invitationals, poor infrastructure, and how hardworking Korean training environments are ""inhumane"" because they can't enjoy the 20 hours of free time they usually get to relax and fool around everyday.

I am so glad MLG doesn't listen to the QQing of our lazy pros. Without Koreans and some of our Europeans, we'd just see a bunch of half-casual egotistic American ""pros"" playing sloppy games with outdated strategies.

Being American myself, it sucks to have to shit on my own countrymen like this, but I always root for the harder worker and right now I root for guys like Huk, Naniwa, Boxer and MMA.

Modern European philosophers say roughly the same things, but merely use different words.

Where you talk about the spirit of a bear, a European philosopher would call this something like 'spirit' or 'essense', a concept that exists entirely within you as a psychological construct, but which can have profound effects on your psychology (and therefore the health of your mind).  

Carl Jung is one example of this view.  He argued that we have certain archetypes in our mind, and that by taking on the spirit of these psychological archteypes (symbolised by gods, heroes, saints, spirits, animals, etc), we can gain the psychological attributes of that particular archetype (say courage in the case of a warrior symbol like Thor or Lord Shiva or Superman).

He was heavily influenced by Tantric Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism, in which people literally try to embody the characteristics of a particular symbolic entity or spirit, such as the Buddha of compassion, Avalokitesvara.  Again, these archetypes are not independent beings that float around like ghosts, but a part of the person.  I think perhaps this is what religions like Christianity originally intended, although people now take the literal meaning.  And these traditions bear resemblance to various forms of shamanism, prayer and meditiation from across the world.

Your search for a path, based on an archetypical animal, sounds similar to me, if not the same.  

Additionally, many native religions have a common respect for nature.  Tribes in India and Brazil will avoid taking more from a forest than they need.  They might pay respect to a fallen tree that is needed for wood.  They might thank an animal for providing it's flesh so that they can live.

These concepts can be found in Buddhism and many other religions and secular philosophies.  In Buddhism, practitioners are concerned with the chain of cause and effect.  When they meditate, they attempt to understand the infinite factors that went into creating a situation.  If they are eating a vegetable, they attempt to see the sunlight, the water, the farmer, the minerals and the other factors that led to the plant sitting on their plate.  They understand that if they don't show respect to such objects, their mind will become callous to it's value.  So they choose to cultivate compassion and understanding for each of the factors that entered into the meal - the sun, without which nothing could grow, the farmer, who's labour brought them the food, etc.  In other words - they pay respect to the spirit of the animal or plant.  It's no different from animism and shamanism, it just has lots of nuanced philosophy justifying it on a philosophical level.

I guess the Christian concept of giving thanks to god before a meal is similar.

So, while native American spirituality has a reputation for oral tradition as opposed to vast monestaries and chambers of scholars, it is no less philosophically nuanced than any other world tradition.  

People today are finally getting past the prejudices of the past, where if they found a culture that happened to be less technologically advanced, they would deride it's practices, and not look at them seriously and with a spirit of philosophical respect and inquiry.  Now we increasingly understand the common wisdom and complexity of the beliefs of people across the world.",IAmA,,True,3,False,t3_j59y1

Gilleard also admitted 10 counts of child pornography offences. Officers had discovered more than 39,000 indecent images of children on his computer.  He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

July 2009 Neil Lewington, an unemployed electrician and member of the National Front convicted of preparing acts of terrorism and jailed indefinitely. He had created what was described as “nothing short of a factory for the production of homemade explosives in his bedroom,”

January 2010 Terence Gavan, former BNP member jailed for 11 years. He was arrested for commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, under the Terrorism Act 2000. Police uncovered 54 explosive devices, including nail bombs, pipe bombs and a booby-trapped cigarette packet, and 12 firearms - three of them loaded - plus devices in whisky bottles and aerosols.

May 2010 Ian Davison, an unemployed lorry driver and leader of the fascist Aryan Strike Force groupuscule sentenced to 10 years in prison for producing a chemical weapon (ricin), preparing acts of terrorism, three counts of possessing material useful to commit acts of terror and possessing a prohibited weapon. His son Nicky, a part-time milkman, was given two years' detention for possessing material useful to commit acts of terror.

June 2010 Trevor Hannington pleaded guilty to six charges which included offences of possessing and disseminating terrorist publications and stirring up racial hatred.

My family is all European born. I was raised for my first 7 years in California, then moved to Spain for a year before we resettled in France. Two years in Paris were followed by another two in the UK and one in Ireland. Then back to Spain for more years than I care to count, Switzerland to finish my MBA, Spain again and now back in the US (but the other coast).

Since I finished studying I have been able to travel to around 50 countries for business and pleasure alike and intend to go on.

That said, I probably could be said to have a lot of world under my soles. Asides from that, I am cultured enough to be able to read the WHO reports (no, not Dr. Who. The World Health Organization).

10kg/22lb (green)

The Louvre may not have as much queueing as you think. Try to go early in the morning on a weekday, for example. There are a few smaller museums in Paris you would surely enjoy which shouldn't have much queueing. I'm thinking about the [Musée Guimet](http://www.guimet.fr/-English-) (mainly ancient Asian cultures) or the [Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle](http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/foffice/transverse/transverse/accueil.xsp?cl=en) (about prehistory, but there's also a zoo, a botanical garden, etc). You can find more information on the [ParisInfo](http://en.parisinfo.com/) website. 

Paris itself is a wonderful, beautiful city. Take a stroll along the Seine river, try and walk up to the [Notre-Dame cathedral](http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/). The [Père Lachaise cemetary](http://www.pere-lachaise.com/) is also one of my must-see, but that's just because I'm a closet goth.

Here I gave you links to English version, but do NOT expect Frenchmen and women to speak English. And I can tell, I AM French. If you're staying at a friend's, better stick with that person if they speak French. If you need to ask anything in the streets, try and go to ask younger people (teens or mid-twenties). You may want to get yourself a phrase book, the American accent will draw girls like a magnet. 

French tend to have a very bad image of American tourists. Don't talk too loud, don't be rude, give a little tip (waiters and such expect usually a few cents) from time to time and you should do fine. There are some parts of Paris that you should avoid altogether or just at night, but if your friend lives there they should be able to tell you about that. 

In France, you can go cross the country in a few hours with the high-speed train (TGV). It's not very expensive if you plan your trip a bit in advance and if you travel in 2nd class. Brittany (cities such as Brest, Vannes, Rennes, Nantes), Savoy/the border with Germany (think Strasbourgh, Metz...), Provence (Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Nice)... are all very beautiful and interesting. In Brittany, you will find seawater-flavoured beers, which are quite interesting in my opinion. That's also where the crêpes come from, so their pancakes are really good. PM me if you choose to head south/Provence, because that's where I hail from and I could send you more infos and recommendations. 


I can't tell you much about other European cities. I've been to Munich and Amsterdam myself and I deeply recommend them. If you like beer, in Amsterdam try to look for a bar called [Golem](http://cafegollem.nl/?page_id=14). They serve hundreds of different delicious beers. Amsterdam is quite expensive though.

(To a 5-year old).  Many people in America are Christian, and that makes them feel friendly to people who are Jewish, because the Christian god whose name is Jesus--he was a Jew. 

Jews have lived here in the United States before we were our own country--some people think that Jews came to America with Christopher Columbus! 

While there have a been a few people here who didn't like Jewish people (the KKK), in Europe and Russia, things were much, much worse.  In Europe they were blamed for killing Jesus.  If something in the neighborhood went wrong, it was easy for their neighbors to blame the Jews and go attack them.  The kings didn't care or protect them--sometimes the kings helped do the attacking.  

The Jews were only allowed to have a few jobs, couldn't practice their religion, had to wear funny clothes, and had to live separately from Christian people.  Sometimes their children were taken away from them so they would be raised as Christians. 

During the 1700s, a period called the Enlightenment happened.  Instead of just believing what other people told them, some people began to wonder---""Hey, I've always been told that the Jews are bad people and they should say apart from us, but they're actually normal people.  We should all get along!"" 

Soon the Jews in western Europe (England, France and Germany) were allowed to move into town and live next to Christians.  Everyone could see that they were all people!  

Now, we're in the late 1800s.  In the Middle East, there was a big Empire called the Ottoman Empire (it was run by the Turks).  The Empire was breaking up and there was a power vaccuum so Britain and America thought--hmm, Jews are still being persecuted in eastern Europe and Russia--if we made a nation for them right there they would be loyal to us.  Very handy!  It would also get the Jews away from the countries who are being mean to them.

(lots of history and stuff I don't know well here...people for and against a Jewish state in Palestine, etc)

The Holocaust happens....Hitler once again trades on the fact that Jews are convenient scapegoats for everything that goes wrong (as they have been for most of European history).  Most people in America were aware that Jews were being rounded up into labor camps but had no concept about the mass crematoriums. (We didn't know for sure about the poison gas until 1944)

Most people didn't have TVs in their homes in the 40s, so they got their news by going to the movies.  Before the movie started, a newsreel would show you the week's events.  Here are some of the movies people saw of the footage our troops took as they liberated the concentration camps.
[Auschwitz adults](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?MediaId=178) 

[Kids that were experimented on](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?ModuleId=10005131&amp;MediaId=174)

I've talked to some of my neighbors and asked their reactions about seeing those movie clips.   They said it was something that would never leave you.  

A large part of establishing Israel was seeing that the Jews needed a country where they could be free to practice their own religion, just as we have religious freedom in America. Alaska and Madagascar weree actually considered as Jewish homelands, Israel just got lucky because the Middle East still needed a democratic ally to stabilize the area.


So to sum up: 
1. America always feels like people should have freedom of religion and democracy is good.

I recommend [momondo.com](http://www.momondo.com) for finding the cheapest tickets. Search results give you a whole calender of prices, and you can schedule based around the cheapest tickets days. 

And for fucks sake, don't expect to be treated like you're on a Concorde when you get to that Ryanair flight. You're paying them incredibly low money to have them transport you from A to B, not to massage your feet and whisper sweet nothings in your ear. Think of it as a bus, where you almost always only bring one suitcase/bag with you, and you're set. 

Portugal is gorgeous and cheap ( i live in Porto), France is generally expensive, Italy is like france (the south, below Rome, is cheaper), eastern europe like Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary or Croatia are worth visiting. 

Being polish and growing up in Denmark, I don't think Germany is all that special, but there are some nice cities and places there, for sure. The prices are a bit upthere, but not worse than in Paris. The Alp countries are absolutely gorgeous, but pricier, especially Switzerland. 

Expect to use a lot of money in London. It's not cheap, neither for the locals not for the tourists. ",travel,48 countries,True,5,False,t3_j5gev

Most of our friends won't buy MC because they think it looks lame lol, but they are slowly coming over, one at a time. Players are from Europe and the US. PvP is allowed in designated areas, and mobs are on. 

If I know someone is coming on for the first time, I try to be there to show them around and we offer sight seeing and amusements to make their first visit memorable. Usually another member joins us on at least a quick 'tour'. We have a town built around spawn that includes a Marina, lighthouse, swimming pool, doggie park, school, horticultural center, playground with a water slide, incinerator, pub with blazing fireplace &amp; jukebox, Music center, Cathedral, library, bakery, PvP arena, Player vs Mob facility, hospital with a psych unit and a padded room, post office, hotel, spa, bank, stores, houses, and a subway that loops around town.

We have everything landscaped and well lit. It looks attractive and gets people excited about playing on our server. 

The rules and expectations are detailed, and we only allow people over the age of 18 on. Exceptions are made for those who conduct themselves in an adult manner. ;) Animation like lava contributes to lag, so we ask members not to use it on the surface. Other than that, the rest of the server rules address conflict resolution and they stress the importance of keeping the server looking nice. 

The server is 8 months old and we have about 25 people on the white list, half don't come on anymore. One player didn't come back because we are not vanilla enough. We spawn items and blocks for public works projects. Often the server is empty or has just 2-3 people on at a time. On Saturdays, we have 5-7 on at a time. We offer a forum with a map that updates daily, which members really appreciate. It's a  community that is growing, slow but sure. They work together on each other's projects, joke around a lot, and sometimes we plan server events. Hang in there, I think it takes time and patience to build a community.

It's not too hard to learn imho, and given its popularity there's plenty of learning/help resources on the web. I only know Quark Xpress as an alternative, if you know this one better, go for it.

As for the layout itself, start by playing around with colors, types and different graphical elements. Always work based on grids! Mock-up several dummy pages with different styles and present them to your class. 
Finding a good basic layout can be really difficult. Look for inspiration anywhere you can, check out yearbooks and other printing products, and don't be afraid to copy what others did before you.

Make sure your class supplies you with a lot of images. The more material you can choose from, the better your layouts will be. Get and try out fonts from sites like [fontsquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) or [dafont](http://www.dafont.com).

Pre-press is a whole story for itself. Of course depending on desired quality and budget, I would not recommend an online printer (there you can have nasty surprises). Find a good printer in your town, and talk to him. If he's a good one, he'll be able to give you cost estimates, offer you a variety of paper, bindings and special colors, and most importantly, tell you how he wants your PDF's.

Pre-press basics: Keep your images in CMYK and at least 250dpi and make sure you have enough bleed over the edges of your document (3mm in Europe).

It's not that uncommon to see phrases transliterated to latin without indicating tone when they are particularly common phrases. It's likely that the Mandarin phrases incorporated into English in a setting like Firefly would fall in that category and quite likely lose the dependency on tone.

E.g. a lot of Europeans and Americans will recognize ni hao and xie xie written without the pinyin accents, and even more will recognize it if spoken out, because we come across them a lot as the ""token Chinese"" in movies etc.. But we're likely to butcher the pronunciation of them if we are to use them ourselves, because we don't deal with enough Mandarin to often come across words that can be confused with the individual parts of the terms.

From my very limited view/opinion on the matter the reason there is no potential (yet) to be progamers in America. The reason being is most of us, yes even those of us in our early 20s have to support ourselves. The lack of sponsorship is a HUGE determining factor. Look at professional sports, it is no different in terms of preparation. But the preparation is backed by very wealthy sponsors. America simply does not have this level of sponsorship for progaming yet. Or at least I have yet to see it. 

I would really hope that some level of sponsorship or networking can be achieved through press about the After Hours Gaming League but alas this is pretty lofty.

I can't cut down the number of people in the world who _claim_ to be christians. What that means is just that not everyone who _claims_ to be one, actually is one.

Just think about it, there is a mindset created thousands of years ago, with HUGE holes in it and looking 100% like something made to control people. It's so extremely obvious that christianity (or any other religion involving gods) isn't for real. 

Think about it this way: The only reason you're feeling bad is because your family and most of the people you know (i guess) really believes in christianity and thinks that everybody who doesn't has some problems.

If you instead take a look in europe, you see that being an atheist is much more common. You aren't an outcast going to end up in hell just because you think different from everybody else. You are actually one of A LOT of people who believes in something else, something that can be proven and isn't a flying plastic figure (you understand what I mean). 

So really, if you weren't grown up in a christian family in a christian society, you wouldn't have the brick in your stomach. You would be feeling good about that you aren't one of those mindless people who cannot criticize things at all. You aren't alone or one of a kind.

I feel sorry for you who have to feel this way just because you are one of the few persons in the US using your brain the slightest and realizing that you cannot listen to everything you hear.

**Pros**

- 2 extra clickable programmable buttons on side.

- 2 programmable buttons that act more like a lever on the side, so you slide your thumb forwards or backwards to activate them rather than pressing anything.

- Dedicated triple click button between L and R.

- 5x 4.5g weights.

- 'Gaming' and 'standard' mode for quickly changing button programming by 'clicking' the lever, mode indicated by red LED.

- programmable functions DPI between 400 – 3200dpi. Blue LEDs indicate sensitivity, in various patterns.

- Contains software for composing macros that can be assigned to buttons, that actually get saved on the mouse itself and is completely encapsulate away from the computer itself. Good for portability. Macros can contain clicks, keyboard presses, mouse movements and other such things. EG: for L4D2 I hold a side button to switch to molotovs/pipe bombs, and releasing the button switches straight back to the last used weapon. Same for pills.

**Cons**

- The scroll wheel is to the LEFT of your left mouse button, so you scroll with your index finger. See pics for details. This isn't as much a problem as thought it'd be and you get used to it, but people freak out when they borrow it.

- The weights don't seem to make much different for me, but maybe more pro gamers would notice.

If you are looking for a true answer I suggest you go and buy anti-depressants and/or give up. This shit is far from figuered out and has been discussed very controversely since at least the 90s. A good starting point is always Susan Reynolds, not because she uses good methodology or because she essentially reaches the right conclusion but because she starts out in the right direction. 

When you are sufficiently confused go and take a look at family politics. That makes things a little easier again. When Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany are all reigned over by one dude (Charles V) it explains how the systems in different nations could at first look so similiar. If you look in detail again you will see major differences between the systems of course.

A few more things to think about:

The importance of the catholic church may not be underestimated especially in the holy roman empire. The bishops often supplied one third of the empire's armies and were essentially nobles themselves. The ideal of the Christian knight and the crusader may or may not have had an influence on the nature of European nobility.

The formation of the final form of the feudal system happened in the empire only in the 12. century. At this time states were already forming within the empire essentially already undermining much of the former nobilities structures.

Just a little earlier Knights finally became an official part of nobility. Since their titles were now becoming hereditary. This is at least 100 years after Carl in France and 200-300 in the empire.

A big part of the lower mobility resulted neither from knighthood nor from the old manorial system. In the empire churches started using unfree administrators calld Mayer or Maier (still one of the most common surnames in Germany) to avoid giving away their large landholdings to nobles and to avoid having to do the administration themselves. This system was adopted in the 12th century by the wordly nobles, too. Especially the King or Kaiser used it to bypass the finalizing feudal system and keep the royal lands under central control. These administrators could gain Vice-royal status in some areas and their titles often became heriditary. They later made up up to 30% of the lower nobility in Switzerland and parts of central and southern Germany.

It is also important to note that the empire never became as absolutist (forgive me for using this kind of outdated term for lag of a better one) as France, Spain or Russia. It also had a more powerful church than England (investiture conflict). The local nobles not being at the court and under hardly any official obligation to serve the king meant that he had to create a system of multiple tiers of worldy and spiritual nobles as well as forces outside this system to be able to manipulate the nobility better. This accounts for much of the later complexity of the empires nobility. The same complexity was created in Absolutist societies by the sale of titles and the invention of new titles to sell for more revenue.

It is also hard to find evidence of a large integrated heriditary nobility in early Carolingian times at all. Here the distinction was pretty much between unfree and free men. More powerful people could hold federal titles or have influence at court, but that is hardly a differentiated system. In France we find this growing when the Carlongian kings weakened and local powerholders acquired near complete control over their territories like the Kings of Burgund and many others.

In closing we are looking at multiple distinct regions with distinct nobilities that emerged at different times in different forms for different reason. And all that in multiple stages. Huge parallels existed because of the continous cultural exchange via marriages, politics, law theory (bologna in the 15th century) and war. Many of the European nobility systems also arose from the same foundation, the one in the post above. The eastern European ones are a whole other book though.

There you have a few bullet points. The only real possibility to understand it is reading a few books and sources though. I suggest knowing latin and at least middle english or French or middle German though since much of the source material has not been translated yet. (No shit)


edit: Since I am already on it here are two more aspects of the origins of nobility in very short form.

One: In the Gallo-Roman territories there was still a prevalence of Senat-aristocracy which was not completely wiped out by the invading Franks from the lower Rhein river. They used their influence by positioning themselves as Bishops by may also have had some influence on the constitution on the later nobility of the middle ages.

Two: Some writers defined Nobles as those with a name that is old and or remembered. For this it is important to note that most people in the German lands actually carried only one first name and therefore had no remembered second or family name. This definition includes the fact that nobles were able to keep knowledge alive for longer than one generation by founding monasteries or churches where stuff could be written down. Nobles also did not move from their lands very often and were aware of their biological and political relations. We have family trees appearing around the same time nobility starts taking its consolidated forms in Germany.  
What does this mean for the origin of nobility? It means that nobles were those who kept the traditions and the knowledge of a society alive which gave them a rank higher than the normal person. This keeping of traditions is obviously only a very minor character of nobility and its origins, but I like it alot.",history,,True,9,False,t3_j59h6

Modern European philosophers say roughly the same things, but merely use different words.

Where the OP talks about the spirit of a bear, a European philosopher would call this something like 'spirit' or 'essense', a concept that exists entirely within you as a psychological construct, but which can have profound effects on your psychology (and therefore the health of your mind).

Carl Jung is one example of this view. He argued that we have certain archetypes in our mind, and that by taking on the spirit of these psychological archteypes (symbolised by gods, heroes, saints, spirits, animals, etc), we can gain the psychological attributes of that particular archetype (say courage in the case of a warrior symbol like Thor or Lord Shiva or Superman).  Sounds a lot like shaman cultures who use meditation or drugs to commune with spirits - or achieve feelings of non-duality and insight - often focusing on a god, spirit guide, or animal.

He was heavily influenced by Tantric Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism, in which people literally try to embody the characteristics of a particular symbolic entity or spirit, such as the Buddha of compassion, Avalokitesvara. Again, these archetypes are not independent beings that float around like ghosts, but a part of the person. I think perhaps this is what religions like Christianity originally intended (i.e. in venerating saints, etc), although people now take the literal/superficial meaning - they follow it like a book of law. And these traditions bear resemblance to various forms of shamanism, prayer and meditiation from across the world.

OP's search for a path, based on an archetypical animal, sounds similar to me, if not the same.

Additionally, many native religions have a common respect for nature. Tribes in India and Brazil will avoid taking more from a forest than they need. They might pay respect to a fallen tree that is needed for wood. They might thank an animal for providing it's flesh so that they can live.

These concepts can be found in Buddhism and many other religions and secular philosophies. In Buddhism, practitioners are concerned with the chain of cause and effect. When they meditate, they attempt to understand the infinite factors that went into creating a situation. If they are eating a vegetable, they attempt to see the sunlight, the water, the farmer, the minerals and the other factors that led to the plant sitting on their plate. They understand that if they don't show respect to such objects, their mind will become callous to it's value. So they choose to cultivate compassion and understanding for each of the factors that entered into the meal - the sun, without which nothing could grow, the farmer, who's labour brought them the food, etc. In other words - they pay respect to the spirit of the animal or plant. It's no different from animism and shamanism, it just has lots of nuanced philosophy justifying it on a philosophical level.

I guess the Christian concept of giving thanks to god before a meal is similar.

So, while native American spirituality has a reputation for oral tradition as opposed to vast monestaries and chambers of scholars, it is no less philosophically nuanced than any other world tradition.

People today are finally getting past the prejudices of the past, where if they found a culture that happened to be less technologically advanced, they would deride it's practices, and not look at them seriously and with a spirit of philosophical respect and inquiry. Now we increasingly understand the common wisdom and complexity of the beliefs of people across the world.

I used to take a pretty materialistic view of ethics/happiness, but find it lacking.  I incorporate some aspects of Buddhism into my secular humanism - namely the metaphysical assumption that everything is impermenant and empty of identity (something that isn't exactly out-of-line with science), and the assumption that compassion toward all beings should be the basis of ethics (logical, unless you want an un-reciprocal society of selfish individuals incapable of mutual self-sacrifice).  At the end of the day, what you end up with is a set of beliefs very similar to the Vulcans in Star Trek - a kind of secular humanist philosophy with the trappings of religion, like meditation and psychologically useful 'ritual'.",IAmA,,True,3,False,t3_j59y1

-you see the barbarian often attacking into thin air because of the desynchronization that was common in diablo 2 when characters used lots of %faster run walk (about 110% here); so on my screen it looks like I'm going to hit Invisible, but in fact he is further away from me, thus from the barbarian perspective this matchup was about reading the desynchronization.",Diablo,,True,3,False,t3_j5me1

&gt;Russia defeated Germany, not the US, or any of the other Western Allies for that matter. By the time the Allies invaded in 1944, Germany had been in retreat for over a year. The Western Allies fought against a fraction of the divisions that the Russians fought.

I will grant you that Russian bravery did take out the brunt of the German army. However I really doubt that bravery would have been enough to bring the Russians victory if it wasn't for the resources given to them by the US lend-lease program.

&gt;The United States never declared war on Germany.

The US did [declare war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_declaration_of_war_upon_Germany_(1941)) on Germany in response to their declaration of war. Even if Germany hadn't declared war first we probably would still have concentrated on the European front.

Modern European philosophers say roughly the same things, but merely use different words.

Where the OP talks about the spirit of a bear, a European philosopher would call this something like 'spirit' or 'essense', a concept that exists entirely within you as a psychological construct, but which can have profound effects on your psychology (and therefore the health of your mind).

Carl Jung is one example of this view. He argued that we have certain archetypes in our mind, and that by taking on the spirit of these psychological archteypes (symbolised by gods, heroes, saints, spirits, animals, etc), we can gain the psychological attributes of that particular archetype (say courage in the case of a warrior symbol like Thor or Lord Shiva or Superman). Sounds a lot like shaman cultures who use meditation or drugs to commune with spirits - or achieve feelings of non-duality and insight - often focusing on a god, spirit guide, or animal.

He was heavily influenced by Tantric Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism, in which people literally try to embody the characteristics of a particular symbolic entity or spirit, such as the Buddha of compassion, Avalokitesvara. Again, these archetypes are not independent beings that float around like ghosts, but a part of the person. I think perhaps this is what religions like Christianity originally intended (i.e. in venerating saints, etc), although people now take the literal/superficial meaning - they follow it like a book of law. And these traditions bear resemblance to various forms of shamanism, prayer and meditiation from across the world.

OP's search for a path, based on an archetypical animal, sounds similar to me, if not the same.

Additionally, many native religions have a common respect for nature. Tribes in India and Brazil will avoid taking more from a forest than they need. They might pay respect to a fallen tree that is needed for wood. They might thank an animal for providing it's flesh so that they can live.

These concepts can be found in Buddhism and many other religions and secular philosophies. In Buddhism, practitioners are concerned with the chain of cause and effect. When they meditate, they attempt to understand the infinite factors that went into creating a situation. If they are eating a vegetable, they attempt to see the sunlight, the water, the farmer, the minerals and the other factors that led to the plant sitting on their plate. They understand that if they don't show respect to such objects, their mind will become callous to it's value. So they choose to cultivate compassion and understanding for each of the factors that entered into the meal - the sun, without which nothing could grow, the farmer, who's labour brought them the food, etc. In other words - they pay respect to the spirit of the animal or plant. It's no different from animism and shamanism, it just has lots of nuanced philosophy justifying it on a philosophical level.

I guess the Christian concept of giving thanks to god before a meal is similar.

So, while native American spirituality has a reputation for oral tradition as opposed to vast monestaries and chambers of scholars, it is no less philosophically nuanced than any other world tradition.

People today are finally getting past the prejudices of the past, where if they found a culture that happened to be less technologically advanced, they would deride it's practices, and not look at them seriously and with a spirit of philosophical respect and inquiry. Now we increasingly understand the common wisdom and complexity of the beliefs of people across the world.

I used to take a pretty materialistic view of ethics/happiness, but find it lacking. I incorporate some aspects of Buddhism into my secular humanism - namely the metaphysical assumption that everything is impermenant and empty of identity (something that isn't exactly out-of-line with science), and the assumption that compassion toward all beings should be the basis of ethics (logical, unless you want an un-reciprocal society of selfish individuals incapable of mutual self-sacrifice). At the end of the day, what you end up with is a set of beliefs very similar to the Vulcans in Star Trek - a kind of secular humanist philosophy with the trappings of religion, like meditation and psychologically useful 'ritual'.",IAmA,,True,2,False,t3_j59y1

I read some articles where the exceptional article for that case was presented as if it was meant for every days business.

No. That's another article (Article 15 of the Media Act). This is in the main article about the protection of sources in the ""Media Constitution"".

&gt;As i know, the protection of investigative journalism was added in, there was no such thing previously.

The Media Constitution does add a new provision explicitly mentioning the journalist's right to protect his sources, but then in the same article, it creates the big loophole I described above. Basically, they gave something very nice-sounding with one hand, and implicitly took it away again in the same law with the other hand. 

As often with these laws, I genuinely don't know whether that was deviousness, or just imcompetence. 

I mean, in general, the centralization of the entire media regulation system in the hands of one authority (the NMHH, with the Media Council as part of it), and more specifically one person (Annamaria Szalai, who is both President of the NMHH and Chairman of the Media Council) is obviously deliberate. That is what the UN representative on freedom of expression called ""a mindset of control"". 

For random example, look at the new public broadcasting system. The four public service media bodies (public TV, radio, Duna TV and the national news agency) were centralized in one foundation, which is overseen by a Board of Trustees appointed by Parliament. Not ideal, but not all that outrageous. In the meantime, however, all their assets, 90% of their staff, as well as the tasks of producing and purchasing programmes were taken away from them and given to a new centralized media fund, the MTVA. And this fund is directly controlled by Annamaria Szalai. She appoints its director, and can recall him too, and determines his salary. His work is managed by the Media Council, chaired by Szalai. Moreover, Szalai also appoints his deputy-directors. And in addition, she appoints both the chaiman and all the members of the supervisory board of this new media fund. Basically, she gets to appoint every single person of any power in this new fund, personally, and this fund in turn will determine most everything that is done and broadcast by the public media.

That's not coincidence, that's planning. But with stuff like this protection of sources loophole, I honestly can't tell if it's malice or incompetence.

To be fair - and I only read that this weekend - parliament passed a new set of amendments (not the ones ordered by the European Commission, separate ones) on the last afternoon of their last session before summer recess; and one of those amendments explicitly specified that only courts and the police have the authority to oblige journalists to disclose their sources in those vaguely defined ""exceptionally justified cases"". So that's something - there are no longer any other unspecified ""authorities"" who can do so. 

On the other hand, the same set of amendments saw some significant deteriorations too. For example, any fines which the Media Council imposes can now be collected as taxes, regardless of whether there are still ongoing legal proceedings. And meanwhile, the police has [already started using](http://atlatszo.hu/2011/07/27/confidentality-of-sources-denied-by-hungarian-police/) the loophole about obliging journalists to reveal their sources to ""prevent crime"" in a blanket fashion, without feeling the need to argue that it is an ""exceptionally justified case"".",euro,,True,1,False,t3_j24yl

When west european countries do it, its called efficiency, when Hungary does it, you call it democratic deficiency. The whole criticism is based on the assumption that Hungary is a post-communist country which doesn't even know what democracy is, and which is leaning into fascism. That is not true.

I recognize [this criticism](http://www.politics.hu/20110111/western-media-law-criticism-said-to-reflect-low-trust-of-cee-democracies/), but I don't think that the Hungarian government has much of an argument playing the ""victim card"" (they're picking on us, specifically!). Look at Italy and Berlusconi's grip on the government there. International organizations, NGO's, and the international media have been all over that too. The European Parliament adopted resolutions, journalist groups launched protests, everything. I don't see the double standard.

&gt;The practice of appointing media council leadership varies across europe. The practice that the media council is under government control is not unique in europe. As i remember its not the PM who appoints the members, but the parliament.

Parliament appoints the members of the Media Council, true. The thing is that, under the old system, with the Council's predecessor (the ORTT), each parliamentary party got to appoint its own candidate, so the body as a whole reflected the full parliamentary spectrum. That's not ideal either (you're still talking about political control), but it's better than one party appointing all members. Especially since the Media Council is much more powerful than the ORTT ever was. 

Theoretically speaking, even now each party gets to nominate a candidate, and they did. But then the governing party Fidesz did something unexpected: instead of just nominating one member like the other parties, or two because it's so much bigger, it nominated a full slate of candidates, for all Media Council posts. And Parliament, with its 2/3rd Fidesz majority, then proceeded to elect all those candidates, and none of the ones suggested by the opposition. 

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister appoints the Chairman of the Media Council. (Well, it's a little more complicated: he appoints the President of the new media authority NMHH - Annamaria Szalai - and with that, she also automatically became the nominee to be Chairman of the Media Council. Parliament had no say about her appointment to NMHH president, but did formally have to approve her appointment as Media Council Chairman. However, it doesn't have the right to nominate an alternative candidate, so, yeah.) 

Media regulatory bodies with all politically appointed members are not unique in Europe, as you say, though it's certainly not best practice, and a lot of those councils have considerably fewer powers than the NMHH and Media Council do. Having all those members exclusively appointed by the governmental majority party, however, is very rare. And it gets worse: each member of the Media Council as well as the Chair(wo)man was appointed for nine years. That is to say: the current two-third majority's choices are in place for over two parliamentary cycles, ensuring that Fidesz appointees will continue to control the media even if the party loses the next elections. There is no other EU country where members of a national media regulatory authority are appointed for such long terms.

&gt;As i read in the law, the fines are high, but not impossible. The maximum fine for a person is equal to about a media persons one months salary. Fines are high for TV stations, but the TV stations are the ones who are profiting nicely. The fines are still much lower than in west Europe, while the incomes are almost comparable.

&gt;They do not warrant undermining the basic principles of our constitution. There is no need to conflate one failure with another failure.

But the discussion in that region of India is to override the constitution. I hope you will try to engage the Islamists of Kashmir with your great vision of order and ideals. 

&gt;Sternly demanding that Muslims do their bit to protect us all logically follows in a democracy. They are the ones who can act to stem the rot within their community. They can be persuaded to take action. 

As I have stated earlier, it seems you are woefully ignorant of exactly how the this country was founded and shaped, and what academic narratives were born before it's shaping. I dare you to find a single criticism of the Muslims in fostering riots and petty terror by any academic for the halls of the Marxists. 

&gt;Bold claims without any backing evidence. You claim that all avenues have been tried and they all have failed. Quite the contrary, instead of boldly standing our ground, there has been one capitulation after another ala the Shah Bano case. Again, our failure or laziness to engage the Muslim community in broad debates and fixing our own government doesn't warrant tearing up the principles laid down in our constitution by the country's founding fathers.

Actually it is you who is making claims. You said that the secular fabric will bring the communities together. I replied that the country was born of ""secular"" principles and in whatever way they have been applied, have resulted in utter failure to stem the Hindu-Muslim antagonism. In fact this antagonism and the close knit Muslim society have become political vehicles. The Shah Bano case is a further example of exactly how this ""secularism"" is another name for ""anti-Hindu/pro-Islam"". 

&gt;Why is extremist indoctrination allowed to happen at all? Again, weak governance. Doesn't warrant undermining the secular nature of India.

LOL. The entire system of Indian politics is based on the appeasement of Muslims. Do you think any political party can expect to enforce strict sanctions on the madarssas? Riots and acts of petty terror will ensue on a national scale. Just look at the fallout of the Babri demolition. You are too idealistic and very poorly read. I suggest you read some history to understand exactly where this antagonism springs from. 

&gt;Highly dubious claim, given the notorious history with caste system. Hindus discriminated against Hindus, let alone people of other religion.

As I said you are quite ignorant. Let us talk in specifics when we deal with academic subjects such as the caste system and it's manifestation and reality. For this we will need to look at primary sources, primary sources relating to sociology of said time and finally the history of the debate. I make the claim that the caste system is more a search for the history of the identity of the Europeans(via the British) than the history of India. Moreover the caste system did exist from the period of the early twentieth century till it was abolished shortly after. An unfortunate side effect of the British census of the late 19th century. As I said, you are no hypocrite.

&gt;The point is, what is the alternative that we have to offer? What is the counter ideology?

First and foremost we have to recognize that the problem lies in Islam. Even the Muslims suffer because of it. We have to combat this malignant ideology head on. Exactly why the problem is Islam would be a vast lesson in history. I suggest you begin to your reading of history and present your counter claim exonerating Islam.

The majority have made many changes to benefit themselves (higher wages, universal healthcare, mandatory vacations, strong welfare programs, etc.), but they are willing to pay for these changes, and these changes seem to make these countries more, and not less stable. Granted, they won't become empires anytime soon, but I don't think we need great empires anymore.

Now China's doing it. Basically what that model does is produce tons of goods cheaply. But because there's insufficient domestic demand to snap up all of those goods, they're shipped overseas to mature markets like the US and EU. A trade surplus is basically a certainty.

That ties into the prices and stability of our bonds (because, with a huge trade surplus of dollars, the safest place to sock it away would be US Treasury Bonds), but that's not the subject of this thread.

China's been growing its own domestic market, but still heavily relies on exports as the main driver of its economy. Because US and EU demand is soft, that increases pressure to promote domestic demand. To really stoke domestic demand, China would have to allow the RMB to appreciate. They've been hesitant to do so, because it would kill a lot of industries, so that's one very delicate balancing act, but still only one issue.

Some articles from The Economist and other sources (along with China bears like Jim Chanos) also cite the proportion of their GDP that is based on construction -- it's a staggering 50% or more, depending on whose estimates you are viewing. Basically half or more of their GDP is based on building infrastructure that no one is using, and they are still increasing capacity. On top of that, anecdotal evidence in the Tier 1 cities show new luxury condominiums going up all the time, with mainly speculators snapping up all of the empty lots because real estate prices have been heating up like crazy. That's generally the surest sign of a bubble, but, like all market issues, it's impossible to pin down the exact moment when everything will turn over on itself.

The third issue is simply debt. China's central government recently had to write off a ton of debt from local governments. It has the bankroll to do so, but it's a bad sign for the economy as a whole. Local governments wield tremendous power in developing their respective areas, and until recently when the new guidance from Beijing for determining local governments' efficacy was changed, the only barometer of success was GDP growth. Those debts come from unneeded bloat like construction projects whose sole purpose was for the local official to skim parts of the funding off, and, when that was achieved, the building would be left in its half-finished state.

For all of the wonders of China, their central government is still staffed with people, and their government still has its own political concerns. They are not master planners, even if they're mostly engineers and not lawyers.

The point is that we have  such a ridiculously strong military that it is absurd for anybody to even attempt to build up a comparable force. While it is incredibly expensive it has been very effective. The Europeans have stopped building up and maintain modest militaries and while China is attempting to build up their armed forces, it is doubtful that they will reach a state anywhere near the American military in the next couple of decades. 

Now imagine that the US stops spending. China sees it's opportunity and begins a massive buildup, the Europeans then must counter that threat by building up in a comparable manner.

[Bam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_jump) - Plains indians' shockingly wasteful mass-killing of buffalo so that a few can be used.  Of the animals they used, every part was put to good use, but given the numbers of animals killed it would have been impossible to process all the animals they killed quickly enough before they started to spoil or go bad, resulting in a massive waste.

Interestingly enough, this practise was only stopped after American Indians obtained horses *from European explorers/immigrants*, allowing them to chase down and kill individual buffalo rather than resort to wasteful mass-killing.

Also see the [precipitous drop in North American megafauna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event#Overkill_hypothesis) within the 1000 years after humans reached the territory - within 1000 years of humans reaching North America, 80% of megafauna species had been driven to extinction, at least partly as a result of human agency.

&gt; This is like the argument that we fought the Civil War almost purely over state rights, and that slavery was only a minor side issue.

With the greatest will in the world, that's complete rubbish.

The GP is arguing that American Indian cultures were a complex mixture of good and bad practices, and it's wrong to romanticise then as either *all* good or *all* bad.

*You're* the one arguing for a simplistic, cartoonish view of history, in which the native cultures were perfectly ecologically sound and environmentally friendly, and never did anything wrong or inefficient or wasteful.

American Indian cultures did have a number of ecologically sound practices, and in general had a great reverence for nature and a holistic approach to the environment, and I certainly think we could use a lot more of that kind of attitude in our society.  However, pretending they *never* did *anything* ecologically unsound is just ridiculous.

In particular, how do you suppose that a comparatively primitive society of nomadic hunter-gatherers accurately assessed the overall ecological impact of its actions over multiple decades or generations?

*We* still have trouble assessing this now, and we have hundreds of thousands of scientists, billions of dollars, a complex and quantitative scientific understanding of the processes behind many environmental mechanisms, and sophisticated technology and measuring systems all over the globe.

Don't romanticise history, and don't confuse the low environmental impact from *a relatively sparse population of nomadic peoples with low technology* with those people's practices necessarily being genuinely environmentally sound on a mass-scale.",IAmA,,True,34,False,t3_j59y1

When American colonists declared independence from England in 1776, they also freed themselves from control by English corporations that extracted their wealth and dominated trade. After fighting a revolution to end this exploitation, our country's founders retained a healthy fear of corporate power and wisely limited corporations exclusively to a business role. Corporations were forbidden from attempting to influence elections, public policy, and other realms of civic society.


Initially, the privilege of incorporation was granted selectively to enable activities that benefited the public, such as construction of roads or canals. Enabling shareholders to profit was seen as a means to that end.


The states also imposed conditions (some of which remain on the books, though unused) like these:

- Corporate charters (licenses to exist) were granted for a limited time and could be revoked promptly for violating laws.
- Corporations could engage only in activities necessary to fulfill their chartered purpose.
- Corporations could not own stock in other corporations nor own any property that was not essential to fulfilling their chartered purpose.
- Corporations were often terminated if they exceeded their authority or caused public harm.
- Owners and managers were responsible for criminal acts committed on the job.
- Corporations could not make any political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making.


For 100 years after the American Revolution, legislators maintained tight controll of the corporate chartering process. Because of widespread public opposition, early legislators granted very few corporate charters, and only after debate. Citizens governed corporations by detailing operating conditions not just in charters but also in state constitutions and state laws. Incorporated businesses were prohibited from taking any action that legislators did not specifically allow.


States also limited corporate charters to a set number of years. Unless a legislature renewed an expiring charter, the corporation was dissolved and its assets were divided among shareholders. Citizen authority clauses limited capitalization, debts, land holdings, and sometimes, even profits. They required a company's accounting books to be turned over to a legislature upon request. The power of large shareholders was limited by scaled voting, so that large and small investors had equal voting rights. Interlocking directorates were outlawed. Shareholders had the right to remove directors at will.


In Europe, charters protected directors and stockholders from liability for debts and harms caused by their corporations. American legislators explicitly rejected this corporate shield. The penalty for abuse or misuse of the charter was not a plea bargain and a fine, but dissolution of the corporation.


In 1819 the U.S. Supreme Court tried to strip states of this sovereign right by overruling a lower court's decision that allowed New Hampshire to revoke a charter granted to Dartmouth College by King George III. The Court claimed that since the charter contained no revocation clause, it could not be withdrawn. The Supreme Court's attack on state sovereignty outraged citizens. Laws were written or re-written and new state constitutional amendments passed to circumvent the Dartmouth ruling. Over several decades starting in 1844, nineteen states amended their constitutions to make corporate charters subject to alteration or revocation by their legislatures. As late as 1855 it seemed that the Supreme Court had gotten the people's message when in Dodge v. Woolsey it reaffirmed state's powers over ""artificial bodies.""


But the men running corporations pressed on. Contests over charter were battles to control labor, resources, community rights, and political sovereignty. More and more frequently, corporations were abusing their charters to become conglomerates and trusts. They converted the nation's resources and treasures into private fortunes, creating factory systems and company towns. Political power began flowing to absentee owners, rather than community-rooted enterprises.


The industrial age forced a nation of farmers to become wage earners, and they became fearful of unemployment--a new fear that corporations quickly learned to exploit. Company towns arose. and blacklists of labor organizers and workers who spoke up for their rights became common. When workers began to organize, industrialists and bankers hired private armies to keep them in line. They bought newspapers to paint businessmen as heroes and shape public opinion.

Corporations bought state legislators, then announced legislators were corrupt and said that they used too much of the public's resources to scrutinize every charter application and corporate operation.


Government spending during the Civil War brought these corporations fantastic wealth. Corporate executives paid ""borers"" to infest Congress and state capitals, bribing elected and appointed officials alike. They pried loose an avalanche of government financial largesse. During this time, legislators were persuaded to give corporations limited liability, decreased citizen authority over them, and extended durations of charters. Attempts were made to keep strong charter laws in place, but with the courts applying legal doctrines that made protection of corporations and corporate property the center of constitutional law, citizen sovereignty was undermined. As corporations grew stronger, government and the courts became easier prey. They freely reinterpreted the U.S. Constitution and transformed common law doctrines.


One of the most severe blows to citizen authority arose out of the 1886 Supreme Court case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad. Though the court did not make a ruling on the question of ""corporate personhood,"" thanks to misleading notes of a clerk, the decision subsequently was used as precedent to hold that a corporation was a ""natural person.""


From that point on, the 14th Amendment, enacted to protect rights of freed slaves, was used routinely to grant corporations constitutional ""personhood."" Justices have since struck down hundreds of local, state and federal laws enacted to protect people from corporate harm based on this illegitimate premise. Armed with these ""rights,"" corporations increased control over resources, jobs, commerce, politicians, even judges and the law.


A United States Congressional committee concluded in 1941, ""The principal instrument of the concentration of economic power and wealth has been the corporate charter with unlimited power....""

Many U.S.-based corporations are now transnational, but the corrupted charter remains the legal basis for their existence.


Its obvious, that corporations are not something that is needed in a really free market.


FA Hayek wrote in ""Road to Serfdom"" and predicted nearly 100 years ago that markets would become dominated by large corporations the bigger that government became. The bigger the govt the more large corps and the fewer small businesses.  He explains why central planning leads to this sort of market, and he did it before hardly any corporations even existed.



THE PROBLEM IS that big government LOVES big corporations. Big government is all about CONTROLLING the economy, controlling the people, and controlling the means of production. The central planners and socialists LOVE corporations. In this market, with a few big corporations they only have to arm twist, make back room deals with them, enact special regulations, etc.. to achieve their central planning and control. If the market was made up of many smaller independent businesses it would be almost impossible for them to exert so much control over the marketplace.  Socialists are the ones who love corporations. They achieve their central control of the economy by making back room deals etc with just a few large corps. Central planning of the economy would not work if the market was full of many small businesses run by individuals. They can't control that, too many mom and pops would tell the socialist planners to fck off.

The next time you hear democrat socialist complaining about ""big x"", ""corporate greed"", or ""powerful x""....remember....they are LYING through their teeeth. They need big corporations more than anyone else in order to achieve their political visions.

In a free market, there is no need or corporations to exist.  

Many libertarians believe that corporations should be ELIMINATED. Without all the special rights and privileges given to corporations, business would be FAR less likely to do things without fear of getting caught.


Imagine if REAL people would be on the line for their own money and be personally responsible for the actions of their business, not some nameless, faceless corporate person hood.

Given that the us founders hated corporations and there were many laws against them for a long time. We should go back to that.
Remember The corporation is given all it's special power and privileges by the GOV. Whenever you hear any politicians complain about big business they are full of shit. Big government loves big business. They are easy to control compared to a marketplace with many smaller businesses in it.

Practicing bunker rush 40 times in a row is just not very entertaining to watch.  

I sure hope the e-sports scene continues to grow in the West.  I think MLG is trying to increase the prize pool?  Great matches like Boxer-MMA will, I hope, increase fan interest in the e-sports scene and lead to bigger events, greater pool money, so that a truly professional Western teams will arise here.

Foreign players can help, I think.  Imagine an important pro Korean player coming over to the U.S. to set up a pro house.  Korean media can portray this as ""XXXX goes to conquer the U.S."" story.  Korean media is full of ""Star X goes to conquer U.S. pop!"" stories - this is extremely common for Korean rappers and musicians.

1) Islamic society sits on lakes of black gold. The US went to the moon with their oil. [This is the current status of the islamic society when it comes to science](http://www.springerlink.com/content/a1h2t70w07684l00/). Note that science = technology = GDP = better lifestyle and services. With its oil, islam is doing nothing but invade the rest of the world and reproducing, overshooting the global carrying capacity and dooming everyone to hunger, even their own children, a self-destructive strategy which apparently is hardcoded in islamic lifestyle. How do you explain it?

2) Islam, like any other society, sooner or later will disappear. Either replaced by another self-proclaimed prophet, or by an asteroid impact or global pestilence, within 5000 years tops, islam will be no more, like any other of the 20-more civilization which vanished in the past. How do you reconcile the fact that your religion has an expiration date ?

3) Islam is supposed to be one. You have a bunch of branches, and slay/bomb the shit out of each other since basically the death of mohammed. How can't you see the problem when it comes to the intolerance hardcoded into your religion, when even your co-religious are intolerant against you ?

4) Do you really believe that mohammed did the stuff he claimed (meeting the angel, flying on the horse)? How do you reconcile these statements with reality, and in particular with the hypothesis that he was either crazy, or very clever in forcing other people to believe this stuff.

5) mohammed was an assassin. Do you think he is a good role model in today's society ?

6) Europe had dark ages, caused by christianity. We have seen what religious fundamentalism can do to societies, in particular by comparing the dark ages with the scientific progress and public services (sewers, plumbing, saunas) available to the romans. Why do you think islam can achieve a better, more advanced society, especially when we have this example from history, and the current example from afghanistan/pakistan /somalia/egypt. Do you really think that living in a moderate islamic society is even possible, when the result is invariably a drift toward fundamentalism. The answer ""christianity is wrong, islam is right"" cannot be considered a valid answer. Christians will say the exact opposite, so it's your word against theirs.

If Trotsky is our only hope then we're doomed. He was wrong about almost everything (e.g. permanent revolution, socialism in one country, the role and nature of the party). That is precisely why Trotskyites have never accomplished anything and never will. It's not just due to bad luck.

I'm glad that you admit your rejection of Leninism; most Trotskyites still try to deny that, despite the obvious differences between Lenin and Trotsky. By the way, Trotsky was certainly not above executing ""enemies of the State"" when he was in the Soviet government; he had quite a bit of blood on his own hands (e.g. Kronstadt). If anything, he may have been even *more* ruthless than Stalin (and Lenin). Read his [Terrorism and Communism](http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/index.htm) (originally titled *Dictatorship vs Democracy*) for Trotsky's views on dealing with class enemies. And read Isaac Deutscher's biographical *The Prophet Armed*, where Trotsky's exaltation of forced labor is discussed, and Trotsky is quoted (on p.495 in my copy) as saying:

&gt; Display untiring energy in your work, as if you were on the march for battle. A deserter from labor is as contemptible and despicable as a deserter from the battlefield. Severe punishment to both!...Begin and complete your work, wherever possible, to the sound of socialist hymns and songs. Your work is not slave labor but high service to the socialist fatherland.

Trotsky, obviously, was a bit of a nut. Notice that Trotsky says ""socialist fatherland."" In fact, he himself was not always clear on the impossibility of socialism in one country. See his pamphlet [Towards Capitalism or Towards Socialism?](http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/11/towards.htm) where he speaks of ""the fine musical notes of the harmonious growth of socialism"" and generally speaks favorably of the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country. In fact, Trotsky used that pamphlet in his defense when he was accused later of pessimism and defeatism during the big debate on this issue at the Fifteenth Party Conference in October 1926. Of course after his defeat he took a different stand.

Regardless, it is dogmatic to insist that socialism can't be built in one country; history itself has shown that it is possible. Socialism was indeed built in the USSR. People who say it isn't possible are being just as dogmatic (and wrong) as those who held to the idea that proletarian revolution must first break out in the advanced industrial capitalist countries in Western Europe. Marx and Engels thought that would be the case in the mid 1800s, but that was more of an expectation (based on the then-current circumstances) than a theoretical formulation. By the early 1900s things had changed, as Lenin showed that the development of imperialism had created ""weak links"" like Russia - backward and mostly peasant - where proletarian revolution could succeed. And history showed Lenin was right. He didn't just dogmatically say ""well, Russia is too backward so let's not even try."" That would have been silly, just as silly as those today who still insist that socialism can't be built in one country. Inter-imperialist contradictions open up that possibility, and that's basically why the Soviet Union was able to build socialism. Lenin, then Bukharin, then Stalin all came around to that conclusion *based on actual experience of what was developing at the time*, both domestically and internationally. That is genuine Marxism: taking actual developments into account instead of resting on dogmatic formulas. Trotskyites take the opposite approach of trying to fit facts to their theory! That is the rejection of a scientific approach. Marx himself admitted he was wrong about certain things after the *actual experience* of the Paris Commune.

I agree with you here.

&gt;Here's a solution to the muhammad picture issue: Denial. 

Denial don't solve problems. Read some history and you'll see.
By example if europe didn't deny Hitler rise to power, WWII might have been a lot more different.

&gt;when someone claims to have drawn a picture of muhammad. Just deny it and say ""sorry, you're mistaken that is not the prophet muhammad, you have drawn a picture of another man and claimed it was him. he didn't look like that"".

Is your reply the same if somebody drew a picture of your mother in a fucking gangbang ? If it is, then you're a coward and a pussy.

&gt;Boom, done.

You have it all figured out isn't ? I even start to wonder why we are talking about this.

&gt;It's dogmatically appropriate since it's not a picture of muhammad, and it means they don't have to ""enforce"" their back-assward beliefs.

Man all this time I was in the wrong searching for enlightement and here I find it on reddit. This site is really awesome in every way ...

Just so we are clear, I am against violence to solve this matter.
My opinion is that the prophet should not be drawn, because it is forbidden. The rest is just drama.
People who wants to draw the muslim prophet or any prophet are none of my concern. It is my concern when people wants me to accept it and justify common sense by some crap about freedom when we live in societies where Big Brother is the ultimate tv show and porn a way of life.

Aircraft carriers are, ultimately, not necessary for defending ones own territory. EU forces can fly from any EU airbase - if all you want to do is defend the land you have, and you have lots of runways on that land, you don't really need aircraft carriers very much.

&gt; That is diametrically opposed to the facts. WW2 was very very different. We were lending money to our friends and we had a massive boost in production. We had a rather small military before the outbreak of war. Everyone was suddenly going to work in factories.

The facts are that even the USA had to ration the basic necessities (fuel, food, metals), people worked very hard to produce military equipment just to let it be destroyed in combat and the quality of life was sacrificed to win the war. In Europe or other main war theaters the devastation was even more stark: whole cities (like Dresden) were burned into ashes, factories, farms, infrastructure was destroyed.

For me as a SC2 player into the tournament scene, the biggest issues are the lack of LAN and the region lock. Blizzard basically gimped battle.net to increase their profit margin. It sounds mundane and really small, but the removal of LAN and the region lock on bnet 2.0 have been a huge pain in the ass. Blizzard takes a cut of any SC2 tournament with a prize pool over $500. The removal of LAN serves two purposes - effective DRM by forcing you to log in, and allowing Blizz an easier time of keeping tabs on tournaments. Tournaments have issues with disconnects through b.net that wouldn't occur if LAN was still an option, and if one person forgets to set themselves to 'busy', anyone on b.net can disrupt the tournament through messaging. One of the recent MLG's this year had a player receiving information on what his opponent was doing because he had forgotten to set himself to busy. Tournaments in Korea have dealt with this issue by having a DQ rule if you forget to set yourself to busy. 

The region lock gimps international tournaments, forcing players to buy another account to play tournaments hosted in a different region. It's not even an issue of finding a friend in that zone and using theirs - Blizz has threatened to ban professional players for using friend's accounts before. So if I have a friend in Korea, or Europe, I can't play against them, I can't even *message them* unless I spend another $60 for an account in their region.

This sounds really silly and nitpicking to the average gamer I'm sure, but for those of us involved in the SC2 scene, it's an issue. To put things into perspective for gamers unaware of how big it's gotten, we have tournaments pulling in 60,000 viewers, and the GSL top prize is $80,000 USD.

I like people that can do that.

&gt;My primary area of interest is law. While it's true that the UK could achieve similar legislative programmes in or out of the EU it would be impossible to achieve the level of pan-European harmonisation that is being created in it.

Pan-European harmonisation is great and if I were France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia,...,... I'd probably see lots of reasons why there should be some time of EU model.  I think the EU has been far too ambitious and expanded to quickly.  It has even become clear now with Spain, which had been an EU success story, that forced growth makes for rocky foundations, but essentially the idea behind the EU is a good one even if it does come with certain risks.

Well, my attitude to that would be the continent can have this model and the UK can benefit from it, but they don't have to be in it.  Yes, I'm aware that might seem a little selfish because the UK would be benefiting from something it is not directly contributing too but I've thought about it and  I'm good with it.   I dare say they'd find ways to benefit from us, like we all already do Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.

&gt;The headlines often rant against EU meddling (chocolate definitions, bacon regulations, etc.) but I would imagine that having identical regulations across the EU would strongly bolster the ability of business to branch out across Europe with reduced administrative costs.

Occasionally when I'm talking about my stance on the UK leaving the EU somebody will make a slight or accusation that anti-EU people are xenophobic.  It's true some people do work very hard to dishonestly equate UKIP with the BNP and their racism.  Whenever the accusation is leveled I love answering it with the same answer to your comment here, that is that I completely trust the Germans, the Nordic countries and France to come up with completely sensible standardisation and regulations in the norm without any UK say in the matter.  Even if the UK did have a problem with a regulation the reality is at the moment they might have a say, but it's not a particularly weighty say.  If however a contract was to be put to tender for a company to research standardisation of packaging, for example, wouldn't we all want the successful company to have the ruthless practicality and precision of German engineering?  I certainly trust the French with food regulation, it's like a religion to them.  Whether the UK is in the EU or not Europe's always going to be the major trading partner so any producers are going to make products that conform with EU regulations.  In reality we copy, not because we have to, but because what difference does it make if Hans wants to change the shape of the bottle my fabric conditioner comes in to make it more efficient?  If there is any regulation that doesn't sit well then at least the UK would have the privilege of not having to adopt it.  But in the main, in this respect, I can't be accused of racism that some might try, I'm all for delegating it to the EU with no UK input.  I trust them to come up with good ideas and it doesn't compromise the UK at all.

&gt;if a form of EU sanctioned Euro-Contract law was created that could indeed reduce barriers that the UK on it's own could not achieve.

When it comes to contract law that's one barrier/line of defence that I would want the UK to have.  It could still respect EU contract law when dealing with Europe.  The UK has to learn to realise that it is a major net contributer to the EU, one of the most developed, and set to be the smallest receiver per capita - whatever bar the EU sets across its 27 states it is one that the least amongst them have to be able to  achieve.  EU contract law should be UK contract law lite.  It would lead to elements of protectionism.  I'm okay with that too.

&gt;A point made to me recently is that there has been no comprehensive, open, review as to the merits and demerits of being within the EU.

For me the double barreled shotgun blast of diminished democratic representation and the Common Fisheries Policy should be a game ending deal breaker for the UK.  The fact that government has to match EU grants and subsidy to get access to money awarded to them is just the cherry on the top.  That the UK could actually take control of its own trade without having to go through an appointed commissioner is the sweet Amaretto seeping into my chocolate sponge.

People still very much remember the Great Depression, which was almost a hundred years ago.  People still remember that Herbert Hoover cut spending to create a balanced budget and apparently greatly prolonged and deepened the Depression - and he at least had the excuse that this had not happened before in US history.

And the United States of America survived that one.  But the stakes are a lot higher now.  If this does actually bring down the American Empire, people will remember these days for a lot longer than a century.

As for the Juno spacecraft, well, it depends on whether anything comes of it or not.  I'm a huge SF fan and have been for decades, but unfortunately a lot of other people don't see the use of a space program, and with the coming mega-austerity, I can't see anything like this happening again for a long time.  It might be that in a hundred years, this is a forgotten dead-end in history.  :'(

I remember the first space landing - I was just seven years old, it happened in the middle of the night in England where I was living at the time. My godmother slept in front of the TV, which rang an alarm, and we all crowded around it to see grainy black and white pictures of _men walking on the moon._  I believe it was the most amazing single thing that humans ever did.

At the time, everyone was predicting we'd have colonies in space by 2000.  The ISS, bless it!, is a little step in that direction but by no stretch of the imagination is it even partially self-sustaining, it costing the Earth over $1000 a minute per astronaut to keep it going.  We don't have re-usable space-craft, even, and we need a lot more than just a space station and reusable craft to set up a real colony.

Now, America _could_ do this - except Americans would much rather spend trillions on regime change in foreign countries.  Heck, they'd rather spend the money on the military than the education and health of their own kids, no wonder the space program is neglected.

Other countries or geographic organizations (i.e. the EU) _might_ do this - but it's becoming clear that the economics of space travel are daunting and if, as all the signs seem clear, we are headed into a prolonged global depression, there simply might not be the money and the will to do this.

I'm sorry to keep connecting the ongoing wars with the failure of the space program, but we can either challenge outer space, or our neighbors, but not both.

But I do agree with the first definition. In daily life Latin America feels more like the Spanish/Portuguese speaking nations. I am sure never hear of Belize, Surinmae, Jamaica, etc being considered part of Latin America the same for Haitians.

And there are no people outside Argentina/Uruguay that would say they are not part of Latin America, what I mentioned was racism groups that exist between their borders. Those people would care less for the name and would like not to be associated with the term Latin America.

In the next few days, people will tell you to uninstall LoL and go play tetris (I literally had a guy tell me that once), they'll tell you you suck, they'll call you a fag, and they'll threaten to report you for being a noob. Just shrug and move on.

This means you should find some friends to play with, and avoid getting matched with jerks if you can. YMMV, though: most of my levelling up was done playing at least duo-queue with my brother-in-law who had a few months' head start on me, so I was constantly playing with people far better than me. Definitely a faster learning experience, but oh so frustrating.

People who say you suck are 100% right, though it's a useless statement, since you probably already know that, and they're not helping you change it. Focus on sucking a little bit less every game. Towards that end, there's a few key tricks that you should learn:

First concept you need to be aware of is **Pushing**. You win the game by destroying the nexus, which means that you will have to break at least some towers along the way. By killing minions and hitting the tower you will be *pushing* your lane further towards the enemy base. However, the further away you are from your tower, the more exposed you are to getting *ganked*.

**Ganking** is when your opponents gang up to kill you. If, for example, the opponent on the mid lane kills your teammate there, he buys himself a few precious seconds where he can roam around unchecked. Since he'll usually be higher level than the folks on either the top or bottom lane, he'll have an easy time following the river to one of the side lanes and jump on you. Since you were busy *pushing* like mad and had the fight right up against the opposing tower, you won't have an escape route and you'll give the kill away quite easily. This is why it's considered so important to let your teammates know a champion is missing from your lane, and why, instead of attacking the enemy minions constantly, you should focus on *last hitting* instead.

**Last Hitting** revolves around the idea that you get gold from *killing* rather than damaging *damaging* minions. So to get the gold for a minion you only need to deal that one last hit that kills it. If you focus on last hitting and your opponent actively attacks minions, the lane will push towards your side. As long as it's pushed towards your side but not actually hurting your tower, you're safe. You'll probably lose a few minion kills to the tower, but that's a lot better than getting yourself killed. And, since the tower is close by, you need only run a wee bit to get back to safety, which means it's a lot safer to *harass* your opponent.

**Harassing** is attacking the opponent with the intent to wear him down, rather than kill him. You mentioned you bought Ashe. If you're fighting a melee opponent you can often shoot an arrow at him, or hit him with a volley, without getting any damage back. If you're patient and keep this up for a while, you'll eventually find an opening to go for the kill, or he'll be forced to retreat to base to heal -- which is still pretty awesome, since this'll make him lose experience and gold from the minions that got killed while he was away.

These four concepts would sum up the lane phase (the early game, when everyone focuses on their lane almost exclusively) quite nicely. Most the things you should and shouldn't do revolve around achieving these objectives.

Once some or all of the lanes have been settled one way or another (enough kills that one of the side is well and truly fed, or broken towers, or something to that effect), then people will start converging on one lane (typically, but not always, mid) to try and push that one lane decisively. This is when the team fights start. In the beginning you'll find that team fights are chaos incarnate, and you probably will have a proper tough time figuring out who to target, who to run away from, and where to position yourself. The answer to those questions is too dependent on context to answer here, but you'll get there eventually.

If you want more concrete advice, I'd suggest you focus yourself on a few champions only. Depending on your play style, I'd suggest starting off with Annie (or Veigar), Ashe or Soraka (or Taric). They're all squishy and unforgiving of positioning errors (well, except Taric), but they all teach you some important lessons.

Annie and Veigar teach you farming. Melee minions start at 25g per kill, so it takes around 60 kills to get a a big item like the Needlessly Large Rod, but both Annie and Veigar have effects tied to their Q spell (mana recovery on Annie, permanent AP gains on Veigar) that make last hits rewarding then and there.

Ashe isn't the highest damage champion in the AD Carry class, but has loads of utility. A well timed arrow into the middle of the opposing team can turn the fight around. Plus, her Hawkshot is a brilliant scouting tool, and once you get into the habit of throwing Hawkshot into the brush before you move into a dangerous position will make you understand the importance  of wards and Clairvoyance later on.

Soraka and Taric will teach you the value of team play like nobody else can. Most of the kills you do get will be accidental, but Soraka can keep herself and a partner in the lane forever and ever (via W and E), and has one of the most annoying harasses in the game, since her E hits reasonably hard and has a very annoying silence built in. If you do get hit back, shrug, heal yourself, and pretend it didn't happen. Taric can be played much more aggressively, since he's tough as nails. You have crap sustained damage but a respectable burst in your stun &gt; shatter combo. Your stun can be used to save lives, or it can be used to severely punish any misstep from your opponent. With the right lane partner, a bad engagement at level 1 will easily convert into first blood.

If I've correctly read the thrust of your argument, you seem to advocate a mainland EU, from which the UK would benefit by accepting a decent proportion of regulations into domestic law where they work. You say you're comfortable with this, but would the other countries be? 

I'm no economist, but are Norway (with fishing and oil) and Switzerland (finance) not especially well placed to do well outside of the Union? Would the UK not suffer for sitting outside from it's trading partners?  

UKIP is an interesting party. I'm not well versed in their policies, but I am dimly aware of some very reactionary and regressive tendencies. Nigel Farrage once asserted that the UK prison population should rise, because we have a large number of criminals, for example. Their defence policy is equally barmy, with delusions of grandeur in massive increases for no apparent reason. It also deployed enormous posters of Churchill and Union Flags before elections, as if we were warring with Europe. Search for them on google and their spiel reads 'Libertarian, non-racist party'. Trying too hard? I'm not suggesting they (and certainly not you) are racist. I'm just saying that I find UKIP hard to take seriously. 

But that's kind of beside the point. The main issue is surely that we simply don't know the full picture. You don't like the CFP, matching grants or having to act through the Commissioner. But what if gains are made elsewhere? It's such an enormously complicated (not to mention plain enormous) institution that I cannot see how anyone can strongly claim IN or OUT with great conviction. The international repercussions of leaving it (considering there's no precedent) are impossible to predict.

I agree, that's why I've focused on giving specific examples and citing the specific laws and regulations involved.

&gt;And that is published on Origo, which you cannot even accuse of being right-leaning.

I don't see how Origo's political lean makes what someone says in an interview more or less credible. The only question is whether the vice-boss of RTL can be taken at his word on this. On the one hand, he is as intimately involved as anyone, so he should know his stuff. On the other hand, considering the immense power which the new media authority has over licenses and fines, I would imagine that someone in his position is treading quite carefully, and choosing his words quite strategically, right now. 

I mean, in the month of May alone, the new media authority slapped fines of almost 1 million Euro on RTL Klub, of which EUR 330,000 were just about the January broadcasts of one reality TV show. I hate those shows as much as anyone, but if they're in the process of imposing fines of 330,000 euro for broadcasts of one show during one month, I imagine the station's management is a bit wary of doing or saying anything that would upset Annamaria Szalai right now.

In the end, therefore, it's best to just go on facts. If you can give me an example of an actual media law in Western Europe that goes as far, across the board, as the Hungarian one does, yet did not attract the same kind of outcry from journalists, the European Parliament etc, I'd be happy to hear it. I've heard Hungarian government officials make this same claim, but they never give an example.

What the Hungarian government *did* do, to its credit, [last December](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-public-administration-and-justice/news/criticisms-and-answers-formulated-on-the-subject-of-the-proposed-media-act-examined-in-a-european-context), was to publish a detailed rebuttal of a number of criticisms, in which they claimed that similar laws or regulations existed in individual other EU Member States regarding each individual element that was being criticized (eg, the fines are too high, the appointment procedures are not transparent enough). A new research will come out in a week or two fact-checking these claims. (Cliff notes: sort of... but not really; the claims often refer to bodies with much fewer authorities than the NMHH's; often involve citing a similar provision that exists in another country, but then omitting to mention other provisions in the same country's laws that limit or conditionalize it - that kind of stuff.)

While one can quibble with each example the government provided in that document, however, it kind of misses the point. Even if there *were* analogous examples in individual other countries for each specific problematic regulation, there is no other country whose media laws amasses *all* or even most of them. Sure, France may have problematic element X and Finland element Y; but all of them together lead to a law that is substantively more restrictive. I think it was Miklos Haraszti who quipped that it was as if they had purposefully cherrypicked the most restrictive elements of varous media laws in other EU countries, and they welded them together in something that goes far beyond anything that existed before, at least within the EU. Kind of like the opposite of a best-practice approach.

This is how the Hungarian think tank Political Capital [put it](http://www.riskandforecast.com/post/hungary/the-new-hungarian-media-law-evaluation-and-summary_645.html) - and you can hardly accuse them of being in hock to the left:

&gt;No single passage of the Media Law is particularly odious on its own; indeed, other countries have similar media regulations. The problem arises when all the passages are taken together as a whole. The law authorizes a single authority (composed solely of Fidesz's hand-picked associates) to regulate, investigate and take disciplinary action against media outlets. The wording of the rules is vague and the regulations apply to all media outlets with little regard for the idiosyncrasies inherent in each type of media. The net impact is that the government has broad discretion to supervise the Hungarian media as it sees fit.

I personally think they're still being too nice - there definitely are single passages that by themselves are already odious. But yeah, it's adding them all together that makes the new Hungarian media laws uniquely alarming in the EU.",euro,,True,1,False,t3_j24yl

He's said that he wants to stay in Europe, and I believe that he would see an MLS move as a step down in class, even from Turkish D-2.

From my understanding, a short time after he was signed to Benfica, the manager was replaced, and the new manager just didn't like him very much.

So Adu went on loan. And at least a couple years when he had been on loan, the teams he was playing for made offers that Benfica refused.

But there seems no indication that Benfica will re-sign him. I don't know that I see a Bundesliga or Serie-A team taking the chance on him on a free transfer, though a second-league team or a team in France/Belgium/Netherlands might have a go.

I'd prefer for him that he gets regular playing time in a competitive top-level European league. I'd prefer for *me* that he comes back to MLS.

I feel like in 10 years or so, when his career is done, that there will be a very good story to tell. How old is he really? How good did he really look at such a young age and why? How good could he have been with proper handling? Where did it all go wrong?

So I'll give you my impression of it. I bought it about a month and a half ago. I use to smoke only rolled up stuff (I'm from Europe though so I add tobacco normally) pretty much every day.

Vulcano is expensive (I have the analog model). There may be others that are as good but less expensive, I honestly don't know. I tried a few vaporizers that were much cheaper and I honestly didn't like using them.

So before I bought Vulcano I thought to myself is it worth it. Having had limited experience with vaporizers (the few times I tried I didn't like it) I thought I was risking a lot because maybe I just don't like to vape. After I read/watched some reviews I decided to go for it.

Now that I own it I'm not sad I bought it, at all. I find that I get a better high that lasts longer from the same amount I normally used when I rolled. At least for me it saves me money because I end up using less.

The way I use it is I turn it on, set it to 6.5 (find that to be ideal temperature). In the time it takes to heat up (a few minutes) I grind and prepare the stuff (about 0.5g). When its done I find that I get 2 good balloons and 1 so-so balloon out of it (I always regrind after every balloon). If I'm using it alone it will take me awhile to finish them all because after the first balloon I'm already feeling nicely high. Even if I'm sharing with another person I find that I still get high enough. After that I'm good for awhile. Of course this all varies for people but so far anyone that has tried it with me got nicely high. The vapor feels gentler on my lungs and tastes better than smoke. But even though its vapor I still cough quite often because I end up taking in too much and it just tickles my throat.

Having smoked for years its still a bad habit I didn't quite break. I do light up occasionally and sometimes find myself too lazy to make a balloon.

Personally I think its best to buy it if you don't enjoy smoking or want to quit smoking. I want to quit smoking so that was the main reason I bought it. I'm still failing at my goal but I find it a great (if not better) alternative. If you still plan on smoking even after you buy it then I don't think its worth it.

Yes.

The fact that we currently have a tory government who do appear to be attempting to dismantle the NHS as a state entity in England and Wales does not mean that the NHS has failed, in principle of in practise. It just means the tories are in, and so funding isn't what it would otherwise be - you get what you vote for.

Honestly, this seems a pretty bad one to pick, since socialised health care has a proven track record of being fairly awesome in most of Europe.

The gold market alone is worth $8.8 trillion dollars. That's about half the GDP of the U.S. and twice the GDP of Germany. It's 4 times the total revenue collected by the U.S. government in 2011. 

If you think Schiff had anything to do with moving that market then you have much greater respect for his powers of persuasion than I do.

His argument is that the dollar is being propped up by other nations and one of his often repeated lines is that the Chinese and the world would be better off not sending us their money and using it at home instead. Guess who the largest buyer of gold is?

The largest buyer of gold and the one that has increased it's appetite for it the most have been the [Chinese](http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/112783/china-top-gold-bug-wsj?mod=bb-budgeting). 

You know, the same Chinese that have been supporting our debt. The same Chinese that are currently stuck with soaring inflation exactly because they peg the yuan to the dollar. The same Chinese who ripped us a new one a couple of days ago for our fiscal irresponsibility. The same Chinese that, should they finally throw in the towel on our debt would start a cascade of events that would utterly shred the dollar.

Schiff can't make that happen, but anyone with eyes can see why it might.

Largest debt increase in history approved for the holder of the reserve currency, check. Near default due to internal strife, check. Potential downgrade on U.S. debt looming, check. Economic outlook for worlds largest economy looking weak, check. Europe with it's own systemic solvency issues, check. 

Existence of a large, liquid and stable bond market that could replace U.S., nope. There is no alternative. There are some smaller markets like German bonds, but there is no way it could absorb the influx from a U.S. bond exodus. Doubt in the long term economic stability of the U.S. and lack of an alternative is pushing money into things that are perceived to have reasonably stable long term value, like gold, silver, commodities, agricultural land, etc. All the things you see elevated in value right now, not just gold. Things that aren't in those classes are mostly doing crappy.

There might indeed be a bubble in gold (and silver and commodities and basic materials) but if it is, then it's driven not by Schiff, but by inflationary fears worldwide, doubt about the quality of U.S. debt and uncertainty for the continued stability of the world economic status quo. 

Now I'm of the opinion that bubbles usually have a factor that can be traced back to government driven issues like access to cheap money and I have little doubt that the post housing bubble stimulus (very time coincidental with the rise in value of these classes) has to some, possibly large degree oozed over into these markets. If that's the case, then it bodes even more poorly for the U.S. dollar because stimulus intended to boost the U.S. economy has instead been used to effectively vote against it.

Gypsies themselves are an ethnic group in Europe if you didn't know. There are some modern people you see calling themselves gypsies, but they're not related to the ethnic group.

Frankly, I'm appalled that people on Reddit, a community that is known for it's progressive thinking and support for minority rights, would be so heavily discriminatory towards gypsies.

Just look at some of these replies here:

&gt;They do not go to school, they reproduce like bunnies and they use their kids to beg, steal, hurt people

&gt;You have to experience how bad they are. You can't cross the road without a gypsy trying to rob you or kill you without any reason other than the fact that you are a hungarian.

How backhanded and disgusting. You scream ""discrimination is wrong"", you support the rights of atheists, homosexuals, minorities, but when it comes to this, half of the topic is full of blatant racists.

Well, let me tell you my side of the story. I was born in Hungary, and I faced discrimination every day by the same people who claimed they were ""upright"" compared to gypsies. What a joke. Even my teachers berated me for being roma. Look at me - I went to *university*, I have an *80k/year job*, and I even considered quitting school when I was still living in Hungary. Even the teachers discriminated, throwing my tests in the garbage bin and telling us we'd have to do them over again because I, and others ""cheated"". Other children wouldn't play with me because I was a ""bad influence"". People would bully and beat me up in school *almost every day*. I once had a doctor at a hospital refuse to see me when I had bronchitis.

I moved to Canada when I was 16. I graduated my high school with honors even though I knew little English. I went to college and completed a few years of university before I got a great job.

People in this topic are so eager to put down people just because they're born some way. To stereotype them because they're different. You know why half the gypsies don't get jobs, don't go to school, don't do anything? Because they're blatantly abused and mistreated by everybody. 

You won't see a gypsy politician.

You won't see a gypsy doctor.

You won't see a gypsy lawyer.

You won't see a gypsy teacher.

Nobody would hire them. Why would they? Those are the same people who have been taught by their fathers and mothers that these people are the scum of the earth. Those are the same people who teach their kids the same thing.

I, for one, am glad I left my country. I still practice Hungarian traditions here in Canada. You can call me a traitor if you want, but I've met the **real** Hungarians here in montreal.

But before it was officially started - March, 2003 - there was a massive international protest.  I think that's the first time in history that an imperialist war has been massively protested before it was officially begun... There was no saturation bombing by B-52s, there was no chemical warfare - horrible enough, but it could've been a lot worse.  

   And furthermore, the Bush Administration had to back down on its war aims.  Step by step, it had to allow elections, which they didn't want to do; mainly a victory for nonviolent Iraqi protest.  They could kill insurgents, they couldn't deal with hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, and their hands were tied by the domestic constraints...They had to back down...Iraq's a horror story, but it could've been a lot worse.

We're properly penitent about derogatory racial slurs, and we frame our points in public discourse as though we don't have the prejudices which, looking at statistics, we're still fumbly blindly with.

You'll see a ton of replies in this thread from Europeans saying something like ""but they're really bad"" or ""you'd understand if you lived near them.""

But despite this, Europe's social response to the ""gypsy problem"" is, overall, more successful than America's handling of its racial issues.

Yes much of what is written is crap from people trying to profit, but it also benefits authors who have had ideas for years that the publishers wouldn't touch because they don't think it will sell.

&gt; Look at the legislation that is attempting to be passed. There are automatic triggers for cutting spending if the government doesn't cut enough. Some of those triggers include military cuts, which is the kind of cuts that would force even Republicans to cut spending.

These triggers are meaningless and will simply be undone by congress when the time comes.

Sephardic Jews are Spanish, African, Middle-Eastern - Mediterranean Jews.  They tend to have darker skin than Europeans, and are, as a population, no different than any other.  Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of Central and Eastern-European Jews.  They are, usually, very fair skinned, sometimes blonde - especially the Russian Jews.  Ashkenazi Jews are shown by some studies to have a higher incidence of genius among their populations than most other ethnic groups - information can be found by googling ""Charles Murray"" and ""Jewish genius"".  This is largely regarded to be a result of the distinct challenges faced by European Jews in Christian communities - which I won't go into great detail about - but suffice it to say societal pressures forced many Jews into intellectually demanding professions - medicine, law, banking - and those who were unable to keep up, starved, or had fewer surviving children.

Yes, they are. Here in Spain it's their only job, since they absolutely refuse to even attempt to get any kind of regular job, and laugh at us non-gipsies that ""waste our time"" working. Since they're very little, they're tought that regular jobs are not for them. Only aggresive begging, stealing, drug dealing, etc.

&gt; Are Roma disproportionately likely to not send their children to school?

Yes, disproportionately. I can't find the article right now, but I once linked to it on Reddit in another discussion. Basically, in Spain, some regional governments started special campaigns to **try and convince gypsies to take their children to school**, even if it's already mandatory to take them to school anyway, because of the terrible figures of unscholarized gipsy children. They are removed from school as soon as possible to get them started in begging and stealing, which is the actual job they actually need to learn. That's for boys though, since most girls aren't even sent to school, or get pulled out earlier. This is due to the fact that they need to learn the proper ""women tasks"", such as taking care of the house, cooking, looking after younger brothers/sisters, etc. The ironic thing is, they actually integrate pretty well with other people when they actually stay there. It's not like people are usually racist against the gipsy kid in school (at least from my experience, I'm talking about Spain). Most of them have friends like everyone else and play with other kids, etc. But they usually never do their homework because their parents never even try to help them out or give any importance to school. They start missing schooldays, until one day, they never come back and you don't hear from them ever again. I would say that the younger they are, the more integrated they are in society since they attend to school and socialize with everyone else. But when they leave school, the gap starts increasing again until it's impossible to revert the situation.

Needless to say, these 'scholarization' campaigns had no effect, since the parents know very well that letting their kids learn too much might cause them to get out of the gipsy way of life and into an actual decent life integrated into society, and that would be a complete dishonour for the family (and would mean a 'lost soldier', of course).

&gt; Is there any truth to the tales of Roma mothers deliberately drinking alcohol while pregnant or damaging their newborn children in order to collect additional funds from the government intended to help the families of disabled children?

I have never had notice of anything like that. But it's not uncommon to see a gipsy mother begging around while carrying her baby, and seeing her pinch the baby or puncture him/her with a small needle when she thinks nobody's watching, so that he continues crying louder and louder so that people might feel more sympathy for them and might be more inclined to give her money. So, while I haven't seen what you talk about, I wouldn't be suprised if I heard about it. They do send their small kids to steal and get involved in very dangerous fights with adults so that they can get cash, so it's not like they actually value their childrens' health much more than potential money after all.

I've had similar experiences to what other redditors point out: I've had about 4-5 fights in my whole life (I'm 26). Only 1 of them wasn't gipsy-related. All the others were with gipsies, and they weren't even fights, but rather assaults where I had to give them my money/mobile phone at the risk of getting attacked with a knife or beaten by 5 gipsies while I was alone.

I have no idea of how to solve the problem, other than somehow pulling those children out of that lifestyle while they're still young (which is not reasonable). But the problem is there, and is very real, definately not a question of simple racism or perception by the non-gipsy community. Of course, it's a vicious circle and there will be people who are irrationally racist against them, but that's the smallest part of the problem. The real issue here is that they don't want to change, they're not willing to use any of the chances and opportunities they're constantly given, and they only use those opportunities to abuse the system if there's any chance. I should remind you that most European countries have free universal healthcare, so you don't need to make a dime in your whole life to receive full and free medical assistance. They also live for free (either abusing the opportunities that the system offers for jobless people, or illegally occupying buildings), drive for free (they never bother to obtain a driving license of any kind and usually steal cars or ""buy"" them second hand somehow), and dedicate their lives to stealing or drug dealing so that they can also eat and buy some luxuries without ever having a job.

I respect your opinion, but that is hardly the opinion of the average academic historian. [Look at the aggregate rankings for a sample of scholarly surveys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_results); it's Wikipedia, but you can follow up on any of the surveys listed. Wilson is never ranked below 11 and has an aggregate ranking of 6. The only 20th century presidents he is behind are Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt.

As for why *I* like him, there are plenty of reasons. The broad, over-arching theme would be that he proved it was possible to get elected on a progressive, Democratic platform (I'm talking about 1916, not 1912, that was a special aberration in history) and in doing so moved the non-Southern portion of the Democratic Party away from the semi-radical pseudo-populism of William Jennings Bryan. His politics and policy formed the intellectual core which Franklin Roosevelt was able to turn into New Deal (""modern"") liberalism. 

As for specifics, I'll start with the 16th Amendment (in conjunction with the Revenue Act of 1913, especially since the 16th Amendment was proposed before Wilson was in office) and the Federal Reserve Act. These two acts brought the United States out of a financial dark age. They were not perfect immediately (see the Great Depression (though it is also important to notice Chairman Benjamin Strong's death just under a year before that crisis)), but they created the basis of a modern central government and greatly increased the financial flexibility of that government. 

Where this became very important was during WWI. The ability to provide credit to the Allied Nations was essential to those nation's eventual victory over Germany (also, his Food Administration (an interesting tidbit, it was run by Herbert Hoover) saved millions of Europeans from starving to death). It became even more important when you look at the eventual American involvement in that same war. The ability of the Government to raise revenue for war through income taxes and fund deficit spending through the Federal Reserve was crucial. I will also add that I believe WWI was a just war and was fought against a genuine Napoleonic-type threat of annexationism expansion. [See my lengthy post here for further details and explanation on that subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/elx71/because_im_tired_of_seeing_people_repeat_baseless/c1946pz). Lastly, Wilson's idea for a League of Nations was the inspiration for our modern United Nations and I believe the world would have been better off had the United States ratified the Treaty of Versailles (I do, however, blame Wilson for the failure of that treaty in the Senate). 

Moreover, during WWI, Wilson also moved the Democratic Party away from the position of being the party of strikebreaking and union busting (I'm making an exception for the IWW here and I will discuss that later). The last Democratic president before Wilson had been Grover Cleveland; he was president during two of the most notorious strike breakings in American labor history, the Pullman Strike and the Homestead Strike. In the former case, it was actually Cleveland who ordered regular army troops to fire on the strikers. Wilson changed this and formed something called the War Labor Board. He collaborated with Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor (my username's namesake), and leaders of American industry to promote unionism and collective bargaining as an alternative to industrial conflict and to maintain crucial war production. This was the biggest boon to the labor movement in it's history up to that point. Post war issues complicate the picture, especially during the Republican 1920's, but at the end of Wilson's administration, the labor movement had gained considerable ground

I'm going to conclude by just listing a few things like the Federal Trade Commission, Clayton Anti-Trust Act, and the Keating-Owen Act, all of which were the necessary first tries at true regulation of destructive business practices (a method of enforcing cease and desist orders against unfair trade practices; a stronger anti-trust and pro-collective bargaining bill; and an anti-child labor law, respectively) which were refined during the 1930's. 

I do also admit that Wilson had significant flaws. He was a white Southerner at a time when the Klan was seeing a major resurgence. He tolerated the discrimination and segregation that his Southern colleagues brought to the Executive branch. Worse was the Red Scare and the raise of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer under the Espionage and Sedition Acts. Palmer collaborated with the Gompers and the AFL to destroy things like the IWW (who, though I don't agree with them, suffered some of the more reprehensible oppression outside of blacks and native Americans). Lastly, he failed to make the peace process following WWI a bipartisan effort even though his party had lost control of both houses of congress following the 1918 midterm elections. This almost definitely caused the failure Treaty of Versailles in the Senate (along with Wilson's stubbornness). 

All of that said, however, I do not think those negatives overshadow the rest of his accomplishments (plenty of which I've either only mentioned in passing or omitted). Even the most successful administrations have had their black points in our enlightened hindsight. George Washington marched troops on the Whiskey Rebellion and killed a few citizens. John Adams had the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lincoln suspended Habeus Corpus. Every president between Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt had some hand in the Native American genocide and Roosevelt himself had some shady imperialistic dealings. Any discussion of FDR must mention the interment of the Japanese and Truman was initially crucified over Korea. Eisenhower had the Iranian coup. Kennedy had the Bay of Pigs. LBJ had fucking Vietnam. Nixon...was Nixon. Reagan had Iran-Contra. These are arguably most of the best presidents (the only one not on there is Jefferson and I would argue against Reagan).

1) they could sell it to their own people, but they make way too much of it (remember, it was enough for people all over the world)
2) they could make less stuff, but that would put some of their own people out of jobs, and that's not good for the country

The answer is not simple. It's one part of the problem. Another problem is that so much money is spent on construction that it's not sustainable.

Regarding their domestic construction/infrastructure/real estate market:

Suppose there's a company that sells toys. People buy these toys because they're collectors and think the prices will go up. They think that because that's what happened to the other toys the company sold before. But now the company is making tons of toys and people are buying them ONLY because they think the prices will go up, NOT because people actually want to play with them. Eventually there will be too many toys for sale and not enough people who actually want them. What do you think will happen to the price when that happens?

What happens when that toy business is more than 50% of the company's sales?

Now, in keeping with the toy company analogy, suppose that there are individual retail stores (local governments) selling the toys. These locations like to take huge loans from the parent company (central government) to make big glitzy storefronts that never get finished. They just give up halfway. Because the parent company will never be repaid, they're going to take a loss every time that happens.

The debts are huge.

For example the progression of light bulb efficiency has a boundary limit at some point where you can't get the lumen to watt ratio any higher. That being said let's call a spade a spade. The pressing issue in energy is carbon based fuel both in terms green house gasses and the fact that we are probably past peak oil. 

When we think in these terms many of the inefficiencies are structural. For example American's drive larger and more inefficient vehicles greater distances than Europeans. So in order to have large efficiency gains the current fleet needs to be replaced and new high density urban plans have to be implemented. That is a hugely expensive multi-decade project. How do you finance it? How do you implement it. 
What this means is globally the gap between primary energy supply and demand is projected at about 400 exajoules by 2050 ([pdf source](http://www-static.shell.com/static/aboutshell/downloads/aboutshell/signals_signposts.pdf). Given that there is only marginal efficiency gains to be made in most electrical technologies it's unlikely that we'll be able to to make up that gap. More importantly if energy intensity is so closely tied to GDP growth and GDP growth is the answer to all debt problems how do you deal with a loss of primary energy at that scale.

The European system is two things once.  The actual infrastructure is a total government monopoly/utility.  The government builds, expands and maintains the infrastructure necessary to provide internet/telecom services.  The gov't than leases/rents that infrastructure to different private companies, with no preference/incentives/subsidies to any firm, and lets those firms compete for market share.  

Railroads:  The railroad system in the US was not set up to be a monopoly, but coalesced into one through mergers and acquisitions.  Again, despite the fact that railroad trusts engaged in price-fixing and other behavior detrimental to the economy and society (behavior that was stopped through government intervention); there is no rational argument that suggests that [railroads were bad for the American economy](http://books.google.com/books?id=J7wgAAAAIAAJ).  

The main thrust of my argument here is that government intervention/industrial organization is beneficial in a certain context, utilities and other essential services with high cost infrastructure and barriers to entry.  When these services are run by private companies, they, more often than not, turn into [natural monopolies/oligopolies](http://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/markets/monopoly-diagram.html) that produce a a lower volume for a higher price (the point of profit maximization) than the social optimal volume/price (where marginal cost = demand).  

These types of industries work best in situations where substitutes/preferences don't matter.  You don't want governments building cars because the government can't respond to consumer preferences the way that markets can.  Its fine if governments run utilities though because there are no consumer preferences involved.  Everyone wants the same water/power/police/etc.  The only thing that differs is quantity demanded.  Private companies dont produce better electricity, the only things that matter are price and quantity.  

Why health care fits in this model:
Almost every industrialized country in the world uses some form of government/single payer insurance monopoly to run their health care system.  These countries enjoy cheaper per capita health care, much more expansive coverage and (for the most part) higher life expectancy.  This means they get more health care, for MUCH less money.  Clearly this isnt enough to automatically deduce that government health care is better, but its a large start.

My comment was very generalized and not intended as an accurate historical cause-and-effect timeline. Of course war is older than technology; looking at any chimpanzee society will show you that.

But if you'll look into it, most of our societal problems stem from the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture 10,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherers ran around, lived in very natural, untrammeled settings, they traveled freely across continents, got plenty of fresh air and exercise, followed the natural patterns of animal migrations, and had healthy relationships with each other, their non-human neighbors, and the Earth.

Once agriculture kicked in, our species went through radical, cataclysmic changes. They lost their mobility, they had to spend hours of unpleasant labor in the fields, and mowed down hundreds of acres of forests. They collected livestock, which disrupted animal migrations, setting off tremendous ecological consequences. Predators such as wolves, deprived of their normal food source, began to eat the livestock, creating terribly antagonistic relationships between humans and other predators, with the result that, even today, some people are attempting to exterminate other predators such as wolves and bears, and consider them pests. And with agriculture, humans now needed to compete with insects and other herbivores, forcing them to drench all their crops in toxic chemicals.

Agriculture also led to overpopulation, because farmers would have lots of kids to help with the fieldwork, and then the kids would grow up, destroy more forest for farmland, and have more kids. This led to wars over land, as well as wars with other humans who were still sensible enough to remain hunter-gatherers. The farmers believed the hunters to be ""primitive"" and on a lower moral scale, while the hunters saw what the farmers were doing to themselves and the Earth, and railed against it. This is why the Native Americans put up such a big fight against the Europeans. And any modern scientist can tell you the Natives were right: Look at the track record. 14,000 years of North American sustainability, vs. just 500 years of post-European life and we're dirty, overpopulated, and on the verge of ecological nightmare.

Agriculture also led to industrialization. More humans to feed, plus new innovative ways to perform basic agricultural tasks faster and more effeciently, led to the so-called Industrial Revolution. Suddenly, for the first time in history, humans were growing at an unprescedented scale. They spread faster, released more toxic chemicals into the air and water than ever before, and brought industry into the residential sphere. Now we have massive farms covering pretty much entire states, like Iowa, feeding giant industrial mega-cities like New York. This has also led to the massive poverty we see today, because farmers feel that they ""own"" the food that they grow, and if somebody doesn't or can't collect money, they don't eat.

This is not sustainable. The topsoil is eroding, the world is getting dirtier and dirtier. Rivers which once cleaned and nourished the landscape are now toxic. The oceans are saturated with shit. The pristine forests of the pre-agricultral world are gone, we're growing faster than a blister in the sun and our collective actions are going to bring about massive changes in the near future.

Everything we do in our daily lives is a product of industrialization, which is a product of agriculture. Driving our cars on megahighways, sitting at computers in supercooled rooms during the summer, sleeping in big luxurious beds in massive sterile suburbs where animals and poor people are chased away. (Alligators, for example - they've been here for much longer than us. They dig deep holes which conserve water and protect aquatic life during dry season. But if they show up in a suburban area, everyone freaks out, and the city comes and takes the gator away. And many cities, such as Miami Beach and Hollywood, export their homeless people to other areas such as downtown.)

The cost of the industrial/suburban world is more than just environmental, however. People are unhappy. Many kids growing up in suburbs grow up isolated, obsessed with death and escape, and afraid of an uncertain economic future. Everybody knows that in order for our society to function smoothly, a good percentage of children have to fail. Shut up in their houses, they have nowhere to go - suburban sidewalks are often as deserted as ghost towns, with everbody hiding in their homes, luxuriating in air-conditioned rooms and computer screens, or afraid of pedophiles, boogiemen, and sunlight. Everybody wants to sit around, eating shitty industrial food, which leads to people being overweight, malnourished, and unhealthy - even in economically wealthy areas such as, say, Golden Beach.

Being overweight, malnourished, and unhealthy, and getting zero exercise outside of walking from the car to the classroom, especially in the heat, produces some pissed-off, insecure, maladapted humans with low self esteem. Kids trying to impress members of the opposite sex wind up depressed and foreveralone (ever wonder why that's such a big meme here?). Your nutrition and health also affects your mood; a well-exercised person is more likely to be in a good mood than a tired, lazy, bored person with no energy. A good chunk of so-called psychological diseases can be cured simply by good diet and exercise, and healthy relationships with other people, and getting out of the house every once in a while. Other psychological diseases, such as ADD, are simply the natural human condition reacting badly to unnatural settings such as classrooms and offices. We need to be outside. Just as we need to eat, drink, sleep, and shit, we need to run.

You can observe the same thing in puppies: A tired puppy, who has just run five miles, is a happy puppy. A puppy that's been shut inside all day will be restless, chew up all your shoes and furniture, and make a lot of noise. They may even fight with other puppies, just out of boredom, restlessness, and a lack of understanding of why they are unhappy.

Same with humans. Take two teenagers in a fistfight, make them each run five miles, and they're likely not to want to fight anymore. Same with adults, same with nations. The United States is fighting wars because the nation is bored and broke, and wants to make money. Since someone else is already handling the agricultural tasks - the only really important physical tasks in our whole society, the production of food - you have masses and masses of people with nothing to do, nothing to contribute, who also need to feed themselves. So: Dress them up in uniforms and have them kill each other.

The cause-and-effect between lazyness and war is very subtle, but it is there. Lazyness leads to bad health, which leads to unhappiness, and restlessness, which, on a seven-billion-people-wide scale, leads to massive quarreling. And, of course, it is industrialization which led to lazyness, and agriculture which led to that.

That is not to say that hunter-gatherers did not fight - some certainly did. But they were healthy, and their world was healthy. We are not. They ate plants and animals. We eat chemicals and pesticides. They grew up in groups, together with other members their own age. They took care of their elders, who were recognized for having the wisdom of age. We grow up in isolated nuclear family units, spread out across vast land that could be put to better use, and we throw our old people away.

To go back to my example about chimpanzees: Chimpanzees and bonobos are, biologically, two very similar monkeys, geographically separated by some river in the Congo (possibly the Zaire, I think). For many decades, scientists believed the two were one species, until about the 1970s, when it was discovered that they are two species. The main difference between chimps and bonobos is this: Chimps fight, and bonobos don't. Chimps are crazy motherfuckers. When two groups of chimps meet, they'll start beating and ripping the shit out of each other, usually killing several adults and babies in the process (and disproving my theory that war is caused by human lazyness). Bonobos, however, are known for being peaceful with one another. They don't kill each other, they're very sweet and tame, and they take care of their babies. A major difference is this: Bonobos fuck. They fuck each other like nymphs. When two groups of bonobos meet, everyone fucks everyone. Males on males, females on females, everyone. They just go for it, uninhibited, like a bunch of hippies. [(Source)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG84FuIjMqA)

You could argue that chimps are better, stronger, kill the weaker members, and as a result, are better suited for long-term Earth survival. But bonobos, like chimps, have flourished for thousands of years.

They aren't really Punk either.

I'll try and keep it brief but if people are interested I'll write this up somewhere in full whiny detail.  

Most games developers *aren't* working on Halo.  They're working on licences, kids games, budget game and rather tired cash-ins on existing genres.  I have 5 published games.  I'd only be interested in playing one of them.

Overtime is endemic.  One company asked me to do overtime even though my area was comfortably running to schedule.  At the time I was only on a temporary contact.  I said ""no"".  There was a lot of pressure for me to work overtime.  Never a threat that I might lose my job.  In Europe, firing someone isn't that easy.  I was made to feel like I wasn't a team player though.  It's surprising how hard it it so say no when everyone else says gives in.

Next company - Overtime was common. They kept saying they'd do something about it in the next project, but never did.  I repeatedly refused to work overtime unless *I* deemed in necessary.  This didn't go down well.  My not doing overtime came up in performance reviews.  I mentioned the ""work life balance"" they were so keen on. They assured me they were looking into it. 

I don't know anyone who got anything resembling a bonus.  Ever.  

""Getting out of the industry"" isn't that easy.  Not that much call for c++ programmers - especially C++ programmers who don't know UML.  
There's the finance industry which is just as bad.  If I applied for jobs I'd always find that the advertisement was from an agent.  The agent was never interested in putting me forward to the job I'd applied to but always had a few openings for games companies.

The common (in left-wing continental Europe) ""because Americans are retarded"" argument is obviously   untrue, but it probably comes down to fundamental cultural assumptions because many of the things Europeans see as retarded Americans see as essential.

I think this Steinbeck quote says a lot about the American psyche:
&gt; Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

(Clearly, by continental West-European standards, the majority of Americans *are* exploited proletariat.)

The success of politicians everywhere depends on saying and doing what their constituents want--not what needs to be done--and the US's massively gerrymandered electoral districts make this all the more pronounced in the US.

Here in Germany, Doing The Right Thing (TM) probably did for the last government, and every bastard knows the pension system desperately needs reforming, but as every politician privately admits, ""we know what needs to be done, but we don't know how to get re-elected afterwards.""

This is far more pronounced in the US, with her two-party system and large number of extremely-religious voters.

Whereas coalitions and compromise are the norm in Germany, American politics leaves no room for the separation of fiscal and social conservatism/liberalism. And the aforementioned gerrymandering means that you're not only preaching to the converted, but that you're competition is doing the same. It's all about going far enough but not too far.

Balanced electoral districts would lead to a fight for the middle, as is common in Europe, where most (successful) politicians can be described as a bit left or a bit right of centre (though where the centre is still differs wildly).

Much of Western Civilization's astronomy and mathematics come directly from them, as little as a handful of centuries ago. Hell, even the game of Chess was invented by the Moors. Likewise not trying to be a dick. But you should read up on Mid-East History. You'll be very surprised by what you find.

And let me assume that by ""religious zealots,"" you mean Islamists who hate all non-Islamists as Infidels worthy of death (if not, then nevermind). Up until the West began effectively taking over power in the early-to-mid 1800s, there was no instance of religious warfare, save for the first hundred or so years of Islam (630ad - 750ad); warfare was political only. In fact, in the Ottoman Empire (ie, everything west of present-day Iran), there was always a very rigid and thorough protection (both via government and social custom) given to all non-Muslims, with Christians and Jews being particularly well-treated. Because the Muslim faith is based around the idea that God gave Muhammad His Third and Final Revelation to mankind (the Jews received the First, and Christians the Second, but both groups ignored the Third-and-Final), tradition holds that it is a Muslim's duty to view both Jews and Christians as ""wayward brethren,"" who just kinda missed the point, the third time around. They might have been treated as Second-class citizens, but they were always treated with a large degree of respect, whereas much of contemporary Europe was still deeply under the influence of the Inquisition.

This whole bomb-strapped Zealot mythology that's been associated with Islam is a very VERY recent thing: since the West's economic takeover of the Middle-East in the early 1800s, the various Middle-Eastern peoples have slowly but steadily lost their ability to ensure their own truly independent self-determination. Granted, World War II briefly reversed this, but only for a short while. The entire region is to a very large extent still economic slaves to the West, with the sole exception of the OPEC countries. These bomb-strapped guys that you see, whose methodology and ethos are very much played-up by Western Media (fear sells AND influences, remember?), are often really just the bottom-ditch efforts of a semi-powerless people to assert themselves. -Violently, if need-be.

And yes, OBVIOUSLY it's a terrible way to assert oneself. But you don't see a lot of Muslims doing it. Only a tiny fraction do. Every society has it's proportional handful of extremists, and to say that Mid-Easterners are generally bomb-happy Nutzos is just as ridiculous as saying that all Pro-Life Protestants must likewise be detonator-happy, since two abortion clinics were bombed this year. Or, for that matter, that all Ethiopians are Pirates, simply because Pirates operate off the coast of Ethiopia.

And speaking of ""no signs of change,"" damn near every Mid-Eastern country has had a grass-roots based democratic revolution in the past year and a half. EVEN ISRAEL, this past month!

Patents are made so that the innovator can profit from their innovation. Otherwise, you would end up with a legal situation like China, where technology gets stolen and no one is held accountable. As far as I know (unless there is some systematic corruption I am not aware of) everyone has an equal ability to get a patent - the only limit is how good your idea is and how much money you have to pursue it. Obviously, we don't expect many individuals to file for patents because it is difficult to create something with no resources. However, it's not impossible, and that person would have a legal right to 'become one of the big guys'. All firms become a 'big guy' because of either government monopoly or successful business practices. I wonder which is more common in a place like England? Now compare that to the US. I doubt the ratios are even close. 

Free education is unsuccesful DESPITE the vast amount of money being thrown at it. The worst school district in the country, Newark, spends the most per student - close to $30,000 PER STUDENT. At that rate, they could almost afford a teacher per student. No, don't blame the failure of the education system on the rich. Blame it on people who don't care. Parents, students, administrations and voters. I've yet to see the unions make any attempts to better the services their educators provide. I have seen Bill &amp; Melinda Gates donate $5 BILLION of their own money to help these districts. 

Free healthcare would only benefit the poor, since the rich would be able to get it regardless. I don't see your point with that one. 


War racket? US military spending is double the average of most other countries that field standing armies. The difference is that we, through historical precedent, essentially police the world free of charge. How many countries have little to no army because they are our allies and thus protected by us?

Without our leadership, I doubt the world would enjoy nearly half the level of prosperity it does now.

That's exactly as it currently stands with the EEA.  Norway for example accepts all regulations when trading with the internal market but in turn as a non-EU member they get to operate within it.

&gt;I'm no economist, but are Norway (with fishing and oil) and Switzerland (finance) not especially well placed to do well outside of the Union? Would the UK not suffer for sitting outside from it's trading partners?

Well Swiss banking is actually fueled by being outside the EU, its landlocked 'isolation' and its neutrality.  The finance sector in the UK is a world leader, the argument being that it could actually do better outside the EU.  The UK wouldn't have to sit outside its trading partners, but its also excellently placed with its place in the Commonwealth and world links.   It already stands astride the Atlantic in acting on behalf of the EU.  In theory there's no reason why the UK should not be an entrepôt to the EU.  Something it could only do whilst outside the EU. 

&gt;UKIP is an interesting party. I'm not well versed in their policies, but I am dimly aware of some very reactionary and regressive tendencies. 

I agree with UKIP's position on Europe, I disagree with much of their other domestic and foreign policy.  I'm not a fan of their manifesto - I think they're better served working as a protest party.  That's what they're good at.  They even came second in the last European elections to the traditionally EU sceptical Tories.  As a domestic party I don't take them seriously at all, as a European protest party they demand respect even from their staunchest critics.  They got a higher percentage of the vote than Labour.

&gt;he main issue is surely that we simply don't know the full picture. You don't like the CFP, matching grants or having to act through the Commissioner. But what if gains are made elsewhere?

That's the point.  They could announce tomorrow there'd been an accountancy error and the UK was due a £100billion annual rebate and less representation with an appointed commission is, for me, still a deal breaker.  It's beyond the line in the sand.  Same goes for the CFP, it's literally killing UK fishing stock.  That's not even mine to kill, it also belongs to the generations that will come after me, the industry itself deserves protection and those communities based around it - much as little Norway's two sovereign wealth funds are the third largest in the world.  Norway's oil is seen to belong to future Norwegians just as much it belongs to today's Norwegians and those that drill for it.  It makes sense to drill and sell it now but much of the money is saved or ethically invested.

&gt; I cannot see how anyone can strongly claim IN or OUT with great conviction. 

For me it's like science.  It doesn't matter how many times results have shown a theory to work, you only need to find one case where the theory does not work to disprove it.  In this sense the question is whether there is one compromise made where no amount of compensation or reward elsewhere is enough.  In this case I'd argue yes.  If the EU were to have my backing it would have to be more representative and not less.  It's not.

&gt;The international repercussions of leaving it (considering there's no precedent) are impossible to predict.

Most things are impossible to predict but the UK can leave the EU and still have access to the internal market through joining the EEA.  Added to that whatever funding is put into Europe by the UK it receives less,  and it actually costs them more money to access EU grants made to them.  

*How much does it cost a year for Norway to be a member of the EEA?*     
Approximately, according to UK treasury figures, the same amount it currently costs the UK to be a member of the EU for one week.

* While involvement in Kosovo turned out alright, and was for a nice enough cause, it was still a war of choice. It wasn't in our backyard. I understand we have NATO and other treaty commitments but I also think they need to be scrapped/revamped given that their reason to exist, the USSR, is long gone. This was a European issue that should have been handled exclusively by Europeans. I could still almost feel good about it, though.
* Liberating Kuwait was clearly motivated by our dependence on oil, especially from the Saudis, as we feared Saddam would keep going. We are so dependent upon oil that we can not lose even one major supply center. It is dangerous that we can not shift our resourcing around to make up for a temporary 10% - 20% shortfall. Also note that Saddam was a creature of our own creation, as a bulwark against revolutionary Iran, which was also a creature of our own creation.
* We are now involved in Libya under similar circumstances. In general, repressive regimes throughout the middle east have been able to stay in power by funding security forces with oil exports. It is to be expected that they will be unstable and prone to revolution and that because of our poor policies we will have to get involved.

Our issue with energy is not raw quantity so much as needing such a large proportion of it on-demand. For example, I think we're barking up the wrong tree trying to replace internal combustion engines with batteries and fuel cells. The internal combustion engine is actually incredibly well suited to cars. The problem is a deeper legacy of urban development left over from when car manufacturers dominated public policy similar to how bankers do so today. The real answer to dependency on gasoline is laying out cities closer to how they were in the 19th century, bicycles and walking. We could actually have redeveloped our major cities for the cost of our involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and the banker bailouts. Several trillion dollars is an incredible amount of wealth.

Similarly, we no longer construct housing oriented properly with the sun, with rooms in the correct places, and with proper basements. Instead, we rely upon refrigeration and air conditioning. I could go on with things like eating manufactured food instead of local, seasonal food. And irrigating grass lawns in the southwest.

We could replace most of our on-demand energy needs with passive policies and ""when available"" energy (e.g. we could wait for sunny or windy days to mill grain).

It is not a ""Hungarian"" problem. It's the same all over Europe, at least I am not aware of anywhere where they could be integrated without issue with the majority.",IAmA,,True,1,False,t3_j5m92

Schizophrenia (MGS2) project recruited 
an adult control sample of non-Hispanic 
European-ancestry (N=3,364) and African 
American (N=1,301) subjects.

&gt;**Method**: Subjects gave consent to deposit phenotypic data and blood samples 
into a repository for general research 
use, with full anonymization of the sample. The authors compared the control 
sample with population census data for 
demographic data and with previous 
population surveys for anthropometrics 
and prevalences of psychiatric disorders 
as estimated by an Internet-administered 
questionnaire.

&gt;**Results**: The full MGS2 control sample includes 4,665 subjects (European-ancestry: 
N=3,364; African American: N=1,301), of 
whom 3,626 were included in the MGS2 
genome-wide association study (GWAS). 
The sample is generally demographically representative of the U.S. population, except for being older and more 
female, educated, and affluent, although 
all strata are represented. Self-reported 
ancestry was consistent with genotypic 
and census data. Lifetime prevalences 
for depressive, anxiety, and substance 
use diagnoses were higher than in previous population-based surveys, probably 
due to use of an abbreviated self-report 
instrument. However, patterns such as 
sex ratios, comorbidity, and demographic 
associations were consistent with previous reports. DNA quality for the Internet 
collected/evaluated control sample was 
comparable to that of the face-to-face 
case sample.

&gt;**Conclusions**: The Internet-based methods facilitated the rapid collection of 
large and anonymized non-Hispanic 
European-ancestry and African American control samples that have been validated as being generally representative 
for many aspects of demography, ancestry, and morbidity. Utilization of clinical 
screening data shared with the scientific 
community may permit investigators 
to select appropriate controls for some 
studies.

Unfortunately, integration of a tightly integrated nomadic culture into largely settled society is far from a simple concern. The US government's treatment of Native American Indian peoples was the 1800's method: Kill, cage, destroy the culture, indoctrinate the kids. While not all Native American tribes were nomadic, a fair number were. This same problem was faced by the British Empire when dealing with the Bedouin tribes. Strong central government in countries like Mongolia is also impacted by the same problem.

In fact, growing up in the Southwest, *many* of the things I'm hearing said about gypsies were applied to Indians living on the reservations. About living horribly dirty, getting money for nothing, having hoards of uncared for kids, doing nothing but drink/drug/fuck/fight, etc.

I think of high-level languages not as much in terms of abstraction as in how much one command does, or how many other commands it replaces. Even more extreme than Java would be Python:

    print(""Hello, World!"")

The first example that comes to mind is the way English and French turn statements into questions. In English we do it with word order, sometimes restoring words (like 'did') that would normally be dropped. 'You did' becomes 'Did you', 'He will' becomes 'Will he', etc. This is also acceptable in French, but I believe it's more common (certainly in the classroom) to keep the statement word order and attach 'Est-ce que' to the beginning, which literally means 'Is it that'. ""He went (did go) to the store."" becomes ""Did he go to the store?"" in English, but the classroom French would translate as ""Is it that he went to the store?"" 

As for the idea that languages are roughly equally complex, but have their complexities in different areas, I can't say it's not true, but I can't see any good reason it has to be that way. Most languages developed from more complex sources (grammatically), so it may be that they all just stopped simplifying around the same place due to the limits of the average human brain, or the average educational system over the last few centuries. I recall once seeing a linguist's blog post saying that the easiest language to learn from a neutral perspective is Farsi (from an English-speaking perspective, it's Norwegian). Unfortunately, I lost the link and don't remember why. I'm told that English, as compared to some European languages, has a very simple grammar, but with more irregulars, and atrocious spelling (in terms of correlation between spelling and pronunciation). I've heard that Mandarin is even farther to that extreme. When first learning English, native speakers of Mandarin will sometimes refer to women as 'he', because Mandarin doesn't distinguish gender in pronouns, but even English is easier to learn to write. Romance languages, by contrast, tend to be better about spelling (certainly Italian and Spanish), but distinguish between a few more tenses and cases for verbs, and in more detail between persons.

Washington DC is 3rd in the country, with $12979 per pupil, just $1100 less than New York state, at number 1.

Yet DC is perceived as mediocre at best.

I think that the problems are that 1) bureaucracy soaks up much of the money before it hits the classroom and 2) the real problem is bad parenting, caused by huge socio-economic divides.   Throwing money at schools won't fix this.   Building up stable households over several generations with carrot-and-stick social programs might help.

However, I must also ask, do people ask for proof on Reddit just for something to do? I assumed it was common knowledge for people who have interest in mid-late 20th C Romanian politics. The fact the Romanian Govt. refused to recognise them as either a people or minority guaranteed them a status of one to be assimilated because nothing was offered them.
I suggest checking out Guy's ""Between past and future: the Roma of Central and Eastern Europe"" and Gheorge &amp; Miga's ""The Roma in the 21st Century.""

Essentially, the policies practiced in Romania (of compulsory education for gypsies, urbanisation, labour, children removed, etc) were an extension of Habsburg policies, largely practiced in Transilvania and lasting well into 20th C.

in Achim's The Roma in Romanian History, we read: ""From the year 1948, when Communism established itself fully in Romania, the Gypsies no longer appear in official documents of political nature…The motion of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party regarding the national problem from December 1948,which laid the foundations for the policy of the new regime with regard to the ethnic minorities, ignored the existence of the Gypsies. Consequently, the Gypsies were not represented as an ethnic group at the level of the Party and state administration; there were no institutions to promote their collective interests and to deal specifically with the problems of this minority, within the
limits of the totalitarian Communist State, of course. At the end of the
1960s, when a new form of representation for minorities was introduced, no national council of workers of Gypsy nationality was created, as was the case for the Hungarians, Germans and other minorities. For three decades, until the middle of the 1970s, the Communist regime did not pay any attention to the fate of this population as a whole, and there was no special policy dedicated to the Gypsies. On the part of the authorities there was an attempt to conjure away the serious problems faced by this population.""
""The social transformation that took place in Romania during the years of Communism also affected the Gypsies. The nationalisation of the economy, the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, the transformation of the village as a result of the collectivisation of agriculture, the policy of social “homogenisation”, the transformations affecting the rural and particularly the urban environment, the occupational changes that took place—all of these naturally could not fail to affect the Gypsies. Citizens of Gypsy origin experienced both the positive and negative effects of these transformations. As a part of the country’s population, the Gypsies felt the effects of the benefits and disasters brought by the new order.""

I'd love to cite specific policies, but since the Gypsies were not considered people, and former communist governmental records are notoriously difficult to come by, I cannot.

So many veterans are out on the streets. So much mental illness because of the breaks that are like yawning fissures in society here. Homelessness is always on the increase when we have dips like this, but why is it so bad here when northern Europe after WW2, put social programs in place and kept there. That ugly word ""social"" but it pays off.

Germany's economy is so strong because they've kept their manufacturing base and invested in it. When the downturn happened, they didn't lay people off, they worked a shorter week, yes they got paid less but it was still a darn sight more than social security and they were still contributing to the state's coffers; going out and buying the things they need. Yes people would tighten there belts but nothing like if they have to look at where their next meal is coming from. That is responsible economics, not looking at a balance sheet and saying our shareholders won't be happy, we are not going to turn a profit for 2 quarters. Looking at the bigger picture; the employees are the company, the company is part of the overall economic picture; fiscal responsibility is not just what the government does. As a result, despite absorbing a severely under invested in eastern block, the Germans swallowed 50% tax on their wages, so that the whole place could be rebuilt. I very much doubt that their taxation is that high now because the infrastructural investment is paying for itself now. 

America is moving in the opposite direction in leaps and bounds. Shipping investment abroad and putting those who are educated to enough of a standard into the service sector.  Elite minds will soon follow suit. Not everyone who went to Ivy league schools came with a silver spoon in there mouth and a mandate to fuck anally anyone who didn't. Richard Feynman, one of the finest minds to ever walk this planet was from blue-collar parents. Parents that spent time with him and made him fascinated in the world around him admittedly.

We are living through extra ordinary times. The end of manned space flight, defunding of grass roots education, the devaluing of humanity's self worth like never before, but this was always going to be the end game of a model that is as equally floored as the communists were. There has to be balance, yin for yang extremes of either will not work. If this path continues I really think there will be chronic upheaval in these United States; hopefully peaceful &amp; political. But it has to come. You can't break a pact so completely as has been happening here for so long and expect there not to be one. Look at the Middle East.

•	The Roma family is still characterized by marriage, however, by investigating real life situations, the unstable, i.e. partnership relationships, and singleton lifestyles are spreading.
•	The most common form of household is the nuclear family (49.3%), but compared to the average Hungarian household, Roma families have a higher percent of multi-generational families (10.5%). The average household membership is around 4.4 persons.
•	Data on educational attainment show that the education of Roma in few cases exceeds the 8-year primary schooling. 53.5% of the Roma have finished elementary school, and 16.5% of them have not even finished the 8 years of elementary school.
•	The strategy for further studies still shows the dominance of vocational schools. The number of high school and university graduates is low. 	
•	While on the national level the ratio of active workforce is 55%, in the gipsy community it is 18%. As a correlate the rate of unemployment among gypsies is 38%, while in the total population it is 11,5%.
•	Educational level is strongly associate with employment. Those who did not finished the primary education (8. grade) 1,3% has regular employment. This is the national average of employment on this educational level (the situation is the same for diploma). However gypsies with high school graduation have higher employment rate and gypsies with vocational training (skilled labourers) have lower amplyment rate then the national average on these educational levels.
•	2/3 of the respondents have good or very good health and 14% have bad or very bad health. This is very similar distribution to the national results, however this population is younger.
•	77% of the respondents received social subsidies in the past 12 months. The two most frequently received subsidy was the regular social aid (rendszeres szociális segély) and the residence support (lahatási segély).
•	The two most freqent types of residence was gypsy settlements (21,8%) and detached hauses (38,5%). In most cases the occupants own the estates (69,9%) or they rent it from the local government (12,6%).
•	During the inquiry of the residential environment and housing of the Roma, it was found that respondents typically live in Roma settlement houses or family houses, in most cases in own property. In addition, it turned out that the average quality of Roma homes is very low, regardless of the ownership form. 	
•	36.1% of the respondents considered themselves primarily Hungarians, while 67% of them reported to have the primary identity of Roma / Gypsy. 44% of the latter group declares Hungarian as its secondary identity. 17.7% of the respondents in the sample only have a Roma / Gypsy identity. It is clear that the absolute majority of respondents (from those who reported themselves Hungarian nationals, Roma or Gypsy nationals), have chosen Hungarian Roma (53.3%) at the question concerning their identity.

It wasn't in our backyard. I understand we have NATO and other treaty commitments but I also think they need to be scrapped/revamped given that their reason to exist, the USSR, is long gone. This was a European issue that should have been handled exclusively by Europeans. I could still almost feel good about it, though.

Yes it was a war of choice, but I disagree that this automatically means it was wrong to do.  Pretend that the Japanese never bombed Pearl Harbor.  Should we have just sat around while Hitler took over Europe?  The rightness/wrongness of military involvement can't be boiled down to just whether engagement was a choice or not.  Also, allies are allies, regardless of where they are located.  European problems (has history has shown) can eventually escalate into American ones as WW1 and WW2 did.  I'd say we're right to be involved with NATO.  Also, Europe has the highest density of democratic nations versus any other region, which (IMO) makes it worth actively protecting.

&gt; Liberating Kuwait was clearly motivated by our dependence on oil, especially from the Saudis, as we feared Saddam would keep going. We are so dependent upon oil that we can not lose even one major supply center. It is dangerous that we can not shift our resourcing around to make up for a temporary 10% - 20% shortfall. Also note that Saddam was a creature of our own creation, as a bulwark against revolutionary Iran, which was also a creature of our own creation.

Oh no question, we were there to protect the rich Kuwaitis and their sweet, delicious oil.  But that doesn't mean helping them was the wrong thing to do.  Just because you don't always intervene on behalf of the defenseless doesn't mean you should never intervene.  (basically, even though part of our reason for being there were the “*wrong reasons*” we still had a positive effect resulting in a more moral conclusion).

&gt; We are now involved in Libya under similar circumstances. In general, repressive regimes throughout the middle east have been able to stay in power by funding security forces with oil exports. It is to be expected that they will be unstable and prone to revolution and that because of our poor policies we will have to get involved.

I think this is a gross oversimplification that ignores a long history of racial, tribal, sectarian and cultural divisions in the Middle East.  You can't blame all of the Middle East's conflicts on oil.  Some for sure, but you get dictators in all parts of the undeveloped world, regardless of the presence/absence of oil.

&gt; Our issue with energy is not raw quantity so much as needing such a large proportion of it on-demand. For example, I think we're barking up the wrong tree trying to replace internal combustion engines with batteries and fuel cells. The internal combustion engine is actually incredibly well suited to cars. The problem is a deeper legacy of urban development left over from when car manufacturers dominated public policy similar to how bankers do so today. The real answer to dependency on gasoline is laying out cities closer to how they were in the 19th century, bicycles and walking. 

I don't think this alone is a comprehensive solution, and even in cities you need oil for some travel.  Even if 100% of people were using public transit or walking/bikes, at the very least you need it for the delivery of commercial goods.

But I do agree that urban sprawl is a major component of the problem (hell, I live in Texas where it's pretty much impossible to get by without a car because everything was built so spread out).  Yet, I disagree with any assertion that solving urban sprawl solves oil dependency.  It just mitigates it.

&gt; Similarly, we no longer construct housing oriented properly with the sun, with rooms in the correct places, and with proper basements. Instead, we rely upon refrigeration and air conditioning. I could go on with things like eating manufactured food instead of local, seasonal food. And irrigating grass lawns in the southwest.

Energy efficiency in home-design is a problem, but not really an oil-relevant problem.  Indeed, these are energy efficiency issues, but I don't think they affect foreign policy.  These A/Cs &amp; refrigerators are powered by coal/nuclear, not foreign oil.  I'm getting off-topic now, but I still want to say in regards to irrigating grass lawns, this isn't the primary problem.  The more serious problem is agriculture industry, and them growing things in the southwest that shouldn't be growing there.  I suspect agriculture uses a lot more water out there than lawns do.",politics,,True,1,False,t3_j55hm

Black Americans clearly look different from non-black Americans. This allows sharper contrast between two black people who choose to embrace different cultures.

As far as I know, Gypsies/Roma (as a composite group in Europe) don't have significantly darker skin or other features that distinguish them from many other Europeans (or other immigrants). Gypsies that behave counter to their stereotypes probably aren't even recognized as gypsies, so there are no ""good gypsies"" to introduce cognitive dissonance to public perception. 

It's seems similar to a phenomenon in Asia that I'm more familiar with in which Vietnamese working in HK choose to use Sinofied pronunciations of their names (Vuong--&gt;Wong/Wang) because they don't want any disadvantageous stereotypes associated with their ethnicity to drag them down. The consequence of this of course is that while individuals may benefit from keeping a low-profile on their ethnicity, the ethnicity as a whole suffers: *""No competent Vietnamese exist.""*

&gt;However, its very clear once you take the time to understand the concept, and read the other threads in this post, that it is far from racist or flawed.

To be totally frank, I respectfully disagree. I've read almost all of your responses and I cannot shake the feeling that you are racist toward whites and blame them for everything (I can't blame you if you feel this way, although it does make me pity you), whereas blacks, Indians, Muslims, etc. in the U.S. and U.K. (countries I've lived in for significant periods of time) don't typically walk around blaming ""whites"" for poor treatment in the past that carries over to this day; smart ones blame the past that lead them to where they are as well as the current bigots and racists that walk the streets today. It's like this with Indians (not American Indians, but people from India) in America, Latinos, and other oppressed peoples - which is much deeper than ""race."" This issue is much more intricate than just racism from whites and you're discrediting yourself and your people with an overly simplistic response. You seem to be dumbing down an entire country as ""white people,"" which is, ironically, led by a black man.

In Europe, there are entire countries that hate other countries that are the same race. They're all white. I wholeheartedly wonder if you were shortchanged by your tribe or brainwashed into thinking white people are the devil when there things like the Troubles in Northern Ireland - terrible white on white violence; or black on black crime in America; or white on white genocide in the Holocaust.

&gt; And ok, he used the Canucks as an example as to why people feel alienated? It's a bullshit example. So many people here are hockey fans and none of them are angry they can't get tickets, or don't get to see games, or whatever. They enjoy the game. So it's a really stupid shitty example, if that's what it is. Or maybe he's talking about the very small minority that aren't hockey fans? Well, they aren't alienated because of price, they just don't like the sport, that's fine. Either way, his example crashes and burns. It's horrific.

You really aren't good in comprehending things that aren't 1+1 or explained to you in every little detail, are you? You completely missed his point.

&gt; I like that you're still tossing insults out by the way.

I am surprised you can actually identify them. I thought I was too obtuse.

&gt; I feel badly for people that feel alienated from Vancouver if they've lived here a long time, that sucks for them. Without any meanness in my being when I say it. They should leave. Not because Vancouver doesn't want them, but because they feel unwanted. You obviously are one of these people. You should go somewhere else. There are lots of beautiful cities, right in here Canada actually I can think of 2 other absolutely amazing ones. Ottawa is beautiful and for culture and night life etc., Montreal can't be beat. Want something smaller, Halifax is amazing. Unfortunately, it will be tougher to find work in all 3 of those cities than here, despite what you said earlier.

Uhuuu. I guess that why headhunters, especially from Calgary and Toronto, constantly contact me with rates that are easily 25% above what is being paid by similar companies here.

And btw, criticism does not equal ""unhappiness"" per-se. But the way people like you react to any kind of criticism comes close to Stockholm Syndrom.

&gt; The author is flat out wrong. If his point is people feel alienated so they rioted, the process to demonstrating that is very simple. First, demonstrate some people that feel alienated, second show that they rioted. He did neither.

Huh? He did point out why people feel ""pushed out"" of Vancouver quite well actualy, he used the Canucks as an example on how people reacted back then vs. how they react right now. That sort of shows that they rioted. In case you didn't notice it, just go to the CTV website or anywhere else and look for ""Vancouver riot 2011"", there is ample video evidence on what happened that day.

&gt; The reality is most of the people who rioted were young people from the sub urbs, with both surrey and maple ridge being over represented. There is a culture in both those sub urbs of glorifying criminal lifestyles. It's an ongoing issue and nothing new. Most of these relative kids live a fairly gifted existence within a society with plenty of resources. There is no alienation. That is a large part of the problem, the problem people are allowed to remain, be incorporated. They are not alienated.

Actually you're just supporting his point. He points out repeatedly that the people are getting pushed east, no longer identify with Vancouver and feel displaced.

I have been out to Maple Ridge etc. and it is a completely different world from downtown Vancouver. The alienation there DOES exist, just living in a large house or being rich does not make you part of the community.

Which, btw, you could read out of this as well: Where the Canucks in the past were part of the community now they are a product that gets hyped and sold. Where there is the ""We are all Canucks"" sing-sang being played over and over and over while trying to get you to buy overpriced merchandise to fill the coffers of the owners. 

Maybe in your book you're ""not alienated"" if you wear the same Jersey as the guy next to you, but for most people it's just a costume and as quickly as you can slip it on you can take it off again.

&gt; Anyways, even if the author was by some silly miracle correct, he didn't demonstrate his point at all. He does not like the Canucks, or he feels they make too much and then applied those emotions to others, without demonstrating that they exist there.

Proof it. Show me in his text where he shows these tendencies. Come on, it's only fair you demand the same from him.

&gt; Finally, I'll pose this to you. Do you honestly believe the riots happened because of economic disparity within our society? 

It was one of the components, not the core of this but not unexpected.

&gt; You think this was about the economic stratification, or class warfare?

Actually yes. Not consciously so but I observe a lot of anger against ""them"" in the 20 something crowd. Many seem to feel cast aside and left with little or no prospects and they are angry at various targets at different times. I think this general anger, coupled with the serious hype that precluded game 7, was what set this off.

&gt; Some could argue they should be happening now in a lot of places, but do you think that happened here? 

Umm, do you actually read any news? Seen what's going on in most of Europe? What's been going on in Israel etc.?

Yes, there has been little taking to the streets in North America but I can think of a few reasons why:

* Cities are spread out a lot, so it is hard to conjure up the numbers, especially in suburbs where there aren't really any meeting places.
* General ""doping up"" of society, the idea that if you feel unhappy you should pop a pill.
* Authoritarian culture. Just take a look at the responses / comments over the G20 events. It's abundantly clear that the majority of people thinks that we have it good enough and that protesting is only done by losers.

So those are the top three reasons why I do not think we will see any mass protesting in North America in the short term. How this will play out in the long run though will be anybodies guess.

&gt; You're willing to assign that level of intelligence to this riot? I'm not. It's not the case here, and it gives too much credits to the idiots who rioted.

This has nothing to do with intelligence. At the core the riot was over a lost hockey game, but it was fuelled by a general sense of frustration and anger. That the rioters mostly broke down windows of large businesses and left smaller ones unscathed is a pretty good indication that the anger had at least some basic direction.",vancouver,,True,-1,False,t3_j5rw6

The latter I would agree with you on to a certain extent, although Hong Kong in the 90's did much the same with stuff coming from areas outside of China, the former however isn't unique to China, nor is it something that we shouldn't expect from a nation state. Israel and France are both well known to be both capable in this area and to have used it rather a lot.. If you ask me the 'computer hacking' element coming from China seems to be at least partially propaganda on the part of the US, the base of attacks is much larger and includes most of Eastern Europe quite considerably.

Actually it was quite prominent then too, proportionally, the difference is the amount of media coverage, the increased ease of intercommunication and the fact that the US has suddenly realised it's in a similar situation that the UK was when the US was becoming dominant, it's the one getting fucked over rather than the one doing the fucking.

&gt;That being said it still doesn't make what they are doing right.

That's arguable.  Personally I think copyright lengths are excessive, software patents shouldn't be possible (they aren't in Europe) and that there is a difference between reimplementing an idea and counterfeiting...  On top of that if we look at this from a Chinese perspective it should be quite clear that the right thing for them to do is push their own development...  That doesn't mean it's a nice thing for existing 'knowledge economy' participants, but then a rapidly industrialising nation with a population in excess of 1bn, is already a bit of a threat to them.",business,,True,5,False,t3_j5t8d

I never meant to imply the gyspies were beaten, burnt alive, etc. What I was implying was that it was common policy to push them either out of areas/across borders or to force them into government housing and into schools etc. If I in some way compared the policies to Nazis or other extreme agendas, I am sorry.

Most would regard this prior status as terrible. To not be counted at all appears much worse.

If I was in a position to donate a large sum of money, I'd rather give it to a private charity where I know more or less where it would go (and knowing it won't go to the ""war effort""). It's possible to get a rough idea of where your taxes are going, which is better than having no idea at all.

I'm not arguing with your reasoning. I'm arguing the idea that MATT DAMON want's to give more to the government. And he can, if he *really* wants to.

&gt;Taxes generally go to more specific purposes, and less to the general fund.

Not the taxes He or democrats propose. Those are specific for the general fund.

I meant donated to the government. The topic here. Not donated to his tax write offs.

And let's be clear, your quick google search doesn't show him donating anything but his time. I'm sure he donates what his financial advisers tell him to donate so he can write it off, don't get me wrong... And even that is not chronicled in your link. Just because he lends his name to a cause... that doesn't mean he spends much time or effort or money with it.

Your article notes how much a foundation ""raised"", not how much he gave. SO he likes to go to africa and play bigshot with his hollywood friends for a day or two. Maybe do a benefit dinner that he can use as an excuse to write off travel expenses. I'm sure that makes him feel better when he jets off to Europe for a vacation or makes 27 million dollars for 8-10 weeks of ""work"".

I dislike this thread because it is eliciting a response from commentors that Muslims treated Jews fairly as a whole, as opposed to the evil Christians.  While this sentiment will find a ready, receptive crowd among Redditors (throw in a slam against America and Conservatism and you'll have a lot of pairs of underwear that need washing), it is simply not true.  If one looks at the deception practiced against the Jews following the defeat of Meccan forces by the Muslims of Medina (despite the Constitution of Medina, which, although it earned the cooperation of the Jews of the city, was later discarded in favor of persecution) and the many, many other examples of anti-Christian and anti-Jewish behavior perpetrated by Muslim governments, one would find this sentiment to be false.

**Grandfather** - During WW2, my grandfather was an ordinance officer for one of the side batteries on the USS Saratoga. A kamakazie plane hit near his battery and engulfed him in flames. His friend grabbed a blanket, ran into the flames, and pulled my grandfather out. Incredibly, you would never know that my gandfather had suffered these horrific burns unless you looked at his fingernails.

**Great Uncle #1** One of my great uncles led a group (I'm not sure of the size) of Japanese-American soldiers in the European theater. While assaulting a farm house, he had the back of his head completely shot off. He was a big guy (6'3), and none of the Japanese-American soldiers could carry him single-handedly; so, under fire, 3 of them dug fox holes and remained while the rest retreated to better cover. After dark, they went and retrieved what they assumed was his corpse. He survived, completely recovered (with a metal plate in his head), and lived a full and happy life. (We played golf together until he was about 81)

**Great Uncle #2** Was a co-pilot in a B-17 during WW2, and was shot down over occupied France. He and his surviving crew traveled across France, and hiked over the Pyrenese Mountains into Spain with virtually no supplies. Although I did not know him well enough to hear a detailed account of the story. I did meet one of his crew mates a couple of times, and on both occasions he told me ""Your uncle Casey saved our lives. We were all at the point of exhaustion in the mountains, but your uncle would NOT let us give up. I would not be here if it weren't for your uncle."" They eventually made it back to the allies and he flew again during the war. He always wore a pin on his lapel that was a winged boot.

As for the cost, I wouldn't do it again - I could never justify that debt to myself and count myself very lucky that I had a 'cheaper' education. However, there are ways around it.

If you would just think a bit, you'd also realize how incredibly Western-centric that approach is -- even if we assume there really was a Dark Age, that was only in Western Europe.  Why didn't the rest of the world leave Western Europe in the dust?
Third, you assume all of these goals are actually attainable through science.  There's no guarantee science will be able to do much more than it has already done.  Fourth, historians also know that stories about religion *causing* slower technological development are myths.  Even if there was a Dark Age (there wasn't), and even if it somehow retarded progress worldwide (how?), and even if these projections are actually feasible (your faith in science is both touching and ironic), then you still have the problem that there's no empirical evidence religion is to blame.

You can get the data that Brooks used [here](http://www.cfsv.org/communitysurvey/results.html) so you can do your own analysis.  The broad outline of his findings have been widely published and discussed.  Similar statistics are reported by [Putnam and Campbell](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703766704576009361375685394.html).

The thing is I find these stats, even given by a biased source, reasonably persausive and that's because they fit in with other stats I have come across elsewhere, such as in Canada: 

&gt;""The 32 per cent of Canadians who are religiously active contribute 65 per cent of direct charitable donations. As one might expect, this group is responsible for 86 per cent of donations to religious bodies; yet even in the secular sector, the religiously active provide 42 per cent of the $2.1 billion raised by direct giving. [source](http://www.givingandvolunteering.ca/pdf/n-vc1sen.pdf)

And even to [a lesser extent](http://media.gallup.com/poll/graphs/UKCANUS120307Graph5.gif) in european countries.

The self reported issue is a problem, but in the absence of any kind of reason to assume religious people would be  more likely to overreport things like giving blood or amount of money they donate, I'll assume, in the absence of better data that what we have indicates something approximating the truth.

I think the most important point you make is that many of these figures lump all apathetic people in with 'secular' people, when in fact there are distinct groups of secular people - active and apathetic just as there are active and apathetic religious people, and it's certainly unfair to include apathetic religious people in with the secular group for these things.  So I loaded the dataset into PSPP, and did a crosstab of those who answered some form of religion to ""What is your religious preference"" and those who answered ""no religion"" against ""$ amount donated to *nonreligious* charities in the last 12 months"".

Amount      | None   | less than $100 | less than $500 | less than $1000 | less than $5000 | More than $5000
-------------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------
Religious    | 26.6% | 17.4%             | 31.0%            |  12.0%              | 10.9%              | 2.2%
No Religion | 30.1% | 13.9%            | 29.4%             | 10.7%               | 13.6%              | 2.3%

So now the lazy religious people are included in the religious figure, and the lazy secular people are included in the no religion figure.  Religious giving is ignored here - it's likely that many of the religious people here are *also* giving to religious charities, while any of the no religion guys giving to secular causes are *included*.

What does this blog or thread have to do with the Middle East or any other backwards society? This issue, for the time being, is a first world problem, so don't go dragging the discussion into every shithole that exists in our world in order to dismiss a problem in Western society.

If some feminists are actually approaching modern day issues with the vigor as if they were Muslim women... then that would explain why they have such disregard for seeking equality.

You think you can evade any examples by demanding it be perpetrated by women. Well, we live in a very ideological charged society. You don't need women to directly oppress men, you need only to educate society to do so.

Regardless, you bring up many examples of injustice perpetrated against women. I can do the same thing, too.

There isn't a male rape epidemic in war-torn African countries?

Men aren't sent to jail by Americans that knows full well that they could get raped, and will likely be raped if their crime is heinous enough? Not only that, but the possibility of it is a laughing matter?

In Canada, infanticide is a lesser crime of murder that only women can be charged with, and thus they recieve a maximum sentence far less than what murder can illicit? Interesting considering that women perpetrate the majority of child abuse cases, and mothers are twice as likely to be the perpetrated of child abuse than the father.

How in NA and Europe, men are discriminated on their car insurance and have to pay upwards of 4 times more?

The fact that there are many professions, even in male dominated ones such as software engineering, where women, in general, are paid more than men for the same job when we hold all externalities equal?

The acceptance of male genital mutilation in a developed liberal feminist society, many times imposed by their mothers? Not to mention that in those backwards countries, women are just involved in the process of imposing female genital mutilation...

How society has historically condemned men to be the ones who are sent to hunt dangerous animals, to war, to give up their spot on the lifeboat, to do the arduous and dangerous labor, etc...? And many of those attitudes continue to persist.

You speak about systematic oppression of women by men...  Undoubtably there was, but women were definitely involved as well. You can also point towards some powerful women in history that controlled some of the largest and/or strongest Empires. It's the same case now-a-days, where both men and women are both involved in the oppression of men, women, or even both unintentionally.

Where is mainstream feminism when it is men that are being oppressed, discriminated, mutiliated, etc...?

This is precisely what I meant when I speak about how empowerment or victimization, which are quite frankly two sides of the same coin, are the wrong approach for feminists. The historical approach of the 20s feminist movement was towards equality of opportunity, to be regarded and treated as equals. Much of feminism has since devolved into female empowerment and victimization, which has motivated feminists towards equality of results, and towards a society that oppresses men.

How are men oppressed by our society? Just about every branch of the justice and legal system is stacked against men. I can actually make a claim that there is not a single instance in the system that treats men ""better"" than women. Male babies recieve no protection from genital mutilation. Men recieve less health care and therapy than women and it shows in far higher rates of suicide and mental problems. Men are raised in a society that teaches them to laugh at male victims of domestic abuse or rape, which in turn trains them to not seek help or make their case known because they'll be seen as less of a man. Boys are unnecessarily medicated at far higher rates then their female counterparts, and it's mostly because of unethical or medically unsound reasons which paint men as inferior to women. Men recieve no protection from a permanently tarnish reputation if they are simply accused of a sexual or child-related offense. In some societies, men, and women, are unable to divorce without facing retribution from society. In war-torn countries, while there is a spike in rape amongsts civilian women (more so than men), there is a spike in deaths amongst civilian men (more so than women).

We can play this game all fucking day long... All I'm hoping is that you can see how unproductive female empowerment is in a modern society. Heck, in any society. What is wrong with gender equality? Why are so many feminists simply unable to stand up against cases of male oppression? Because they've been brainwashed to victimize themselves and focus only on empowering women. That's why there is such a divide amongst MRAs and Feminists, because Feminists moved away from equality between genders and it created a Western society that actually needs MRAs...

As someone who is incredibly passionate about the preservation of endangered languages, I see it as a combination of the following:

a) Language = identity.

b) We in the western world are so incredibly focused on written traditions. In most of the world, for most of human history, the transmission of culture has been done orally. Losing an oral tradition is losing an ancient compendium of knowledge. A tribe in the Amazon might use a plant with incredible medicinal properties that even the most well-trained botanist would group together with a species thought to have no medicinal potential.

It's easy to say that this isn't important because aspects of this are retained by neighbouring cultures and it probably wasn't even that unique in the first place. But think about it for a minute: how would you feel if the Louvre were to burn down and every priceless work of art it held were to be lost forever? Sure there are pictures, and replicas, and similar pieces to be found around the world. That doesn't make it any less of a tragedy. Our responsibility as human beings is to value all cultures equally insofar as no way of looking at the world is intrinsically less valuable or important than any other.

c) The more we study lesser known languages, the better we can understand the nature of language itself. To anyone without a background in linguistics, this might seem like a moot point. Even someone fluent in 15 European languages, who can surely appreciate the variety of expression learning a new language can provide, is missing out on the mind-blowing linguistic diversity that is there to be found around the globe. 

Language is (arguably) part of what makes us human. The variety in human language is yet another testament to the magnificence of the human mind. 

tl;dr: Every language is fully capable of fully expressing human thought using its own mechanism. To say that we only need one of these mechanisms is a failure to value the many ways in which the human brain is capable of understanding its surroundings. At the end of the day, it probably doesn't matter much to most people. The least that can be done is respect those who are losing an integral part of their culture.",wikipedia,,True,5,False,t3_j5jue

In the past, the major currencies were based on gold. Any time someone held a dollar bill or a British pound, there was somewhere they could go to get that exchanged for a specific amount of gold (maybe it was a bank, maybe it was the government).

With that system, exchange rates were easy. If one dollar could buy one ounce of gold and one British pound could buy two ounces of gold, then one British pound is worth one dollar.

However, these days, most money isn't on the ""gold standard."" Now, we have ""fiat currency,"" which basically means that money only has value because people say it does. We all agree to buy and sell things with dollars, so they have value.

Nowadays, exchange rates are determined by supply and demand. In other words, the value of a currency depends on how many people want it and how many people are willing to sell it.

Important aside: we don't think about buying and selling money. However, a lot of money gets bought and sold. People buy dollars with other currencies, and people buy other currencies with dollars. Why? Mostly to buy and sell OTHER things. When Americans want to buy clothes from China, they need to buy Chinese currency. When Chinese people want to buy cars from Germany, they have to buy German currency. And, when German people want to buy American computers, they have to buy American currency.

So, back to supply and demand.

If America is making a lot of really great products that people all around the world want to buy, more people abroad will want to buy American currency. If more people want to buy American currency, the price will go up. Conversely, if Americans want to buy a lot of European products, Americans will be supplying a lot more dollars to buy up European currency. If more people are supplying dollars, the value of dollars will go down.

The tricky part comes in when we include central banks. Central banks are probably too confusing for a five-year-old, but let's say this: central banks can buy and sell money. This affects supply and demand in much the same way that imports and exports would affect supply and demand.

This is where a country could ""trick the system.""

Another quick aside: what would be an advantageous exchange rate? Everybody wants to sell stuff, right? And, how do you sell stuff? You make it cheap. The way to make your country's goods cheaper than another country's goods is by making your exchange rate weaker. For simplicity, say that a book costs 10 U.S. dollars in America. Now, suppose that a dollar costs one British pound. Then, a book costs 10 pounds. Then, suppose that (for whatever reason) dollar costs half a British pound. Then, the book costs 5 pounds. Suddenly it's much cheaper for Brits to buy a book from Americans. So, a cheap currency means that your country will sell more goods.

So, what can a central bank do to ""trick the system""? It can increase supply to keep its currency cheap.

This is what China has been doing in the last few years. People have been buying A METRIC SHIT TON (sorry that wasn't for five-year-old ears) of goods from China. Normally, this would drive the price of China's currency sky-high. That is, to buy Chinese goods, people have to buy Chinese currency, so a lot of people have been buying Chinese currency. Demand goes up; price goes up.

However, the Chinese central bank has been printing off loads and loads of its currency and buying dollars to keep the value of its currency down. That way, China can keep selling all of its goods.

I'm guessing that each of those 3,000 students drives 2 - 3 cars to school everyday.

In the US it's common to jerry-rig all of your vehicles with a combination of ropes, wooden poles, pulleys, and bricks so that you can drive all of them at once. The reason is that you can take up all the lanes on the road and even the sidewalk sometimes if you happen to be in a very small town (I hear that in Europe not all roads are 16 lanes, is that true?), because it's your God given right to not share the road with anyone else.

Another common practice is for whole families to drive their separate vehicles to the school, and then drive back home again once they know their child has made the journey safe and sound. Why don't we all drive in one vehicle you might ask? Well first of all it's unpatriotic and Jesus said something about driving no less than 1 vehicle, but I don't remember the exact quote. Second and most importantly, we couldn't if we wanted to because most of the other seats in current US cars have been replaced by extremely large cup holders.

The directly link post was interesting, but the very end implies that not being dependent on fossil fuels will make us less of a target from ideological terrorists. Perhaps, I'm too unlearned to see how that works out. It seems to me that terrorists hit nations that are much more ""green"" than us and have been much more vocal against the military campaigns (e.g. various EU nations). I'm not making an argument for the MIC or any thing like that, but I also take issue that the military doesn't provide innovation. I agree that we shouldn't always pay worship to the military spending question, but a large part of innovation (looking at the government as a provider of R&amp;D) has come from, well, governments -- whether it be DARPANET, GPS, or ship building from the 19th century. Though, it's also a shame that private sectors shut down great R&amp;D institutions like Belle Labs, but that's a different discussion entirely.

I can't help but feel the end portion was a bit too alarmist, i.e. America == New Rome. I think it's unfair to imply America is mostly in decline because of the balance between guns and butter. A natural part of spreading capitalism (or the derogatory ""globalization"") is knowledge becomes more accessible by anybody. We can't simply sit in our previus knowledge like putting cash in the bank--it will get out. So, in a sense, it's an arms race of innovation. I would argue that we've under-prepared our civilization to compete in the world we helped usher in. 

Of course, you could argue that education is part of ""butter"", and perhaps we don't put enough buttery money towards education. I'm not sure about that^1 claim. I don't mind if money gets taken out of guns and into more butter. But, I do feel putting money into *some kinds of butter* -- like infinite government pensions or a broken (cost) medical system aren't... much better than guns.

So, my problem is, shifting from guns &gt;&gt; butter seems like a shallow statement since there are... so many kinds of ""butter"".

And the precipitous decline in stock prices was caused by the fact that regular investors (not HFT firms) panicked and started dumping their holdings (which further depressed prices) at level that the market could not sustain.

On a side note I think that market stop-loss orders are far worse for markets that HFT. You're probably going to get out at the worst possible time, you have no idea what price you're going to get, and thus you're probably going to get your face ripped off.

The first one was diving in Sipadan, Borneo.
It was our third day diving and everything had so far been awesome. At the time I was a pretty new diver with just above 20 dives and a fresh advanced certification.
We did all the safety checks and hoped into the water. At first I had some trouble with equalizing so I went down vertically. At 19 meters I finally solved my ear problem and saw that the others was finning away 15 meters ahead. Eager to catch up I started to swim just to get first a few drops of water in my mouth, but on the second and third breath there was only seawater flowing through my regulator...

Choking on the salt water I nearly panicked, inexperienced as I was with malfunctions so I switched to my octopus which fortunately was working and managed to fill my lungs with air again. I managed to catch up with the others and ""told"" the diveguide about my problem. I was content to continue the dive with just the octopus and by being close to the rest...but at the end of the dive my pressure gauge started to act weird and depending on how I was positioned in the water it would pend between 200 bars and 0 bars...at that point the octopus also gave out and started feeding me water instead of air and I endured the safety stop while buddybreathing with the diveguide.

In the end it was a faulty regulator with a damaged seal that was the problem. But it made one heck of a horror story! :)

The second and the most terrifying experience to date was when wreck diving in Coron Bay in the Philippines. They have a lot of japanese WWII wrecks there. It was an large support fleet that got sunk in a pretty shallow bay.

The most famous wreck is Irako Maru which is a 147m long cold-storage freighter.
The day before me and my friend had done 3 dives at other wrecks in the area and those dives were awesome, with a lot of swim-throughs and tight passages. But as with all ""normal"" wreckdiving you almost always have a way out...

Enter Irako Maru!
First dive of the day, with a new dive guide we hadn't met before...at this point I was a certified divemaster with about 130 dives and felt very comfortable with my diving since I had been diving for 3 months straight.

Me and my friend expected the wreck to be like all the other wrecks, cool, with lots of swim-throughs and so on. What we did not expect was a wreck penetration at 42 meters...
We dove down to the aft of the ship and went in a big hole blown up by a torpedo...we swam into a really tight passage along the propeller axel...my diving computer didn't like being under the recreational 40m limit at all and beeped until we got into the engine room...10-15 meters later now at 36m depth. The engine room had no way out whatsoever, the closest was the way we just came, and this is the point when I realize that we potentially are in very deep shit.

With crap rental flashlights the only thing we could focus on was the diveguides fins and to continue the dive. I counted 10 minutes from when we entered the wreck until I saw the next exit out into the open blue water...this time at 29 meters. From there I thought that the worst was over but it wasn't until we finally swam out of the wreck that I noticed another 15 minutes had passed. The only thing in my head during that time was where I had seen the nearest exit, to control my breathing and check my pressure gauge constantly and trying to ignore all the circular ""windows"" that lined a long passage way...sure you could see the blue beyond but if a problem arose, it was no way I could squeeze through there...

Later that day a lot of ""if"" thoughts swam in my head...what if the diveguide had hit his head on some bulkhead...what if we bumped into a stonefish in one of the tight passages, what if my regulator starts feeding me water when im crawling through a small maintenance hatch...what if...

In hindsight I probably should have aborted the dive at first chance, but ego and determination to complete the dive can be a powerful drive sometimes. :)

Remember something I read in a Lonely Planet book about the Philippines...they have a very easygoing attitude to safety, something that reflects a lot in traffic incidents and airplane crashes etc... i.e. all the domestic airlines are banned by EU standards...
So I guess I shouldn't be surprised when the same applies to divecentres being run by philippinos. ^^

The Norway shooter represents the connection of the present to the past. He is connected to his (somewhat imaginary) idea of the historical European culture, and wants to save it. He supports Christianity, is a Christian, but his ideology is not embedded within religion. Numerous times in his ""manifesto"" he talks about how logic and rationalism should remain superior to religion at all times. 

Al Qaeda on the other hand, though deigning to represent genuine grievances of many people such as Palentenians, is propelled by their belief in God and Gods plan for Earth. Without that (stupid) metaphysical claim, they cannot exist. This is shown from the fact that none of Al Qaeda fighters are Christians or Arab Jews or atheist. They are all Muslims. On the other hand, the Norway killer reports how Buddhits and Hindus are to be considered his (movements) ""brothers"".


Wafa Sultan, is on record saying that [""Civilizations do not collide; they compete""](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1296126090432829344).

Huntington's thesis has no proof that Chinese civilization and ""Western civilization"" are on a collision course. There is no proof that ""Indian civilization"" and Chinese are on collision course. All that there is in that theory is that Islam is on collision with Hindu, Western and ""Jewish civilization"", if one exists. 

You have to ask yourself, which of these ""civilizations"" are driven by a fantastical world view that ""There is just one God and Mohammed is his Prophet"", and then answer why are there so much violence between it and others .

The Debt ceiling is bunk, it's a distraction. If you really want to deal with the so called ""debt ceiling"" - it's easy you reintroduce Glass–Steagall act and you go to a credit policy, which is what the American constitution defines as our economy. 

No more bailouts... No more QE anything.

There is no way to adhere to an arbitrary debt ceiling because it will never stop with out mass murder. The solution is very simple - denounce the ""debt ceiling"" for exactly what it is, a fraud and go back to the constitution.

As part of the credit system you take all the bad debt and bundle it up and give that crap back to the investment banks, and tell them you wanted this, you created this, YOU EAT IT.

But no, politicians are too cowardly AND too corrupt to do what is right. Instead they have every dumb ass in the country somehow believing that there has to be a solution for an already insurmountable debt by adding more debt and making you and the next 20 generations economic slaves? Have you lost your minds?

It's a complete fraud that has been going on since Sept 2008 which was built on top of another fraud that has been going on for roughly 40 years.

Bottom line money has no intrinsic value the only thing that does is what you are doing to improve the future. This country was founded to be a credit system - there is no such thing as a debt ceiling. If you truly understand how money is created as debt you'd understand what a destructive scam this entire system is.

The founders (Hamilton Credit system) plan was to give out credit for productive purposes - education, science, R&amp;D, innovation, etc.. and if that were to go over an arbitrary figure, you have to ask if you are giving this credit for a future value into the economy so you can monetize it and pay down the debt. 

So how do you pay back QE? It's impossible under the current monetary system where money is used as debt. It's insanity...


All of this attention to QE is brainwashing and a distraction from reality. It's an oligarch system. It's destroying the Nation. Because of this the Government is backing this insane swindle and tossing the American public and homeowners to the wolves. That is the most un-American thing you could possibly support. 

The debt ceiling debate is a fraudulent debate. Whats the context of the statement? They have a deal or we don't have a deal. Whats the nature of the deal? 

Its' a fraudulent deal made on gambling debt from fake money and bad loans to morons that bought into it. 

Seriously, we're paying of debt in Greece on yet another bailout (which will also happen here) and who is going to purchase those bonds? They can't even pay the interest on the current bonds and their economy is shrinking 5% per quarter and we'll give them another bailout? By the way the FED is buying 90% of our bonds because we can't afford them either... 

Can't you see that following this insane scheme will take us down the very same path to what has happened in Europe? 

Not only current day Europe, but in this is also the same austerity / bailout package that Hitler used in the 1930's. It's insane... It didn't work then and it wont work now. This will take away the power of a Nation to determine to instruments of self government what the policies should be.

You know how there's a Walmart in every city you go to? Well, Walmart is a really big store that people own, but it's too big to own by any individual person. What they need to do is split the company up into lots of small pieces, so lots of people can get together and own a company as a big group. When people do that, the part of the company they own is called a ""stock"".

When you have old toys you don't want anymore, you can sell them at a yard sale, right? And other kids come along and buy them from you? Well, stocks work the same way. They go online to a big store called a ""Stock Market"" that lets grown ups buy and sell stocks. Since so many grown ups care about these stocks, they have prices from the Stock Market that get updated all the time saying how much a stock is worth.

Right, you guess how much corn you'll have at the end of the year, and you may guess you'll have as much as last year. But what if you buy more land? Or what if there's more rain?

Right, you'll get more corn. Well, stocks work like that too. Some years, people notice that Walmart is selling more things, so they thing Walmart is going to have more money at the end of the year. Since a stock is like owning part of every Walmart store, that makes Walmart stocks worth more. This makes the stock prices change.

Sometimes grown ups make guesses because they don't know how much Walmart is selling, and lots of people believe their guesses. People whose job is guessing are called ""stock analysts"", and grown ups pay them for making good guesses. So if the stock analysts think Walmart is selling a lot, then they'll tell people to buy Walmart stocks, or if they think Walmart isn't selling a lot, then they'll tell people not to buy Walmart stocks.

You'd be pretty upset if someone told you to buy Walmart, and they didn't sell as much as you thought Walmart would, right? Well, that happens with stocks, and that's called an ""upset"" and makes people sell Walmart stocks.

Since so many people buy and sell stocks, there's a whole section in the newspaper that talks about them. They tell you how much a stock is worth for every company, and they tell you how much more it's worth than yesterday too (in case they had an upset!)

Really, that's all too confusing for most grown ups, since how can you tell which company is going to upset? So instead you can buy a special stock like Spiders (""SPY""). These stocks are called ""Funds"" kind of like the children's fund charity you help with. You know that money is going to lots of different kids, right? Well, Spiders is like that, except the money goes to lots of different companies. That way, if one company does badly, another company will do well, and so you're happy with how much your stock is worth all the time!

Most grown ups who don't want to read the boring newspaper every day should buy those instead since most grown ups buy companies that have lots of upsets!

**TD;DR not for a 5 year old:** If you want to invest, just buy a basket of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track different markets. SPY is a good one for the US S&amp;P 500 market, but you should probably find a cheap European ETF as well to get some diversification--any fund from a respectable company with a low expense ratio will do. Put the same amount of money into the funds every month/year and you *will do better than any professional investment manager* 97% of the time on a 5 year horizon (mutual funds, that is).

Picking stocks is stressful, and a fool's errand. Just buy ETFs. Individual stocks are a waste of time unless you're willing to put in at least 10 hours/week to do real research.

It certainly conflicts with Western culture's romanticized vision of Native culture. However, I don't recall seeing any scientific evidence that this was a harmful procedure. In fact, given the information, one could argue it provided a net benefit for that ecosystem. You've drawn a different conclusion, but based on what?

&gt;The GP is arguing that American Indian cultures were a complex mixture of good and bad practices, and it's wrong to romanticise then as either all good or all bad.
&gt;
&gt;You're the one arguing for a simplistic, cartoonish view of history, in which the native cultures were perfectly ecologically sound and environmentally friendly, and never did anything wrong or inefficient or wasteful.

Hardly so. I certainly haven't argued that way, but you seem to have welcomed yourself to making that conclusion.

There is plenty in Native culture that we shouldn't bring back. Some plants that we traditionally used for medicine have been scientifically proven to have no medicinal qualities, for example. And certainly, there is plenty from our culture that will conflict with modern views on ecology, etc.

What is amazing to me, however, is that you seem to believe that the North American ecosystem is one that would survive better without human influence, and any botanist worth his salt will tell you that is not the case. The fact is, the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM of North American has evolved to NEED the human interaction it got from ancient tribes. My people in Southwest Michigan used to burn through the land in huge controlled projects. It turns out, the Native plants of the region have evolved to expect and to need those yearly burns in order to grow healthy. Without the yearly burns, Native plants in Michigan can hardly be found outside some certain strongholds. European plants have taken over and choked out much of the landscape.

Whats more, the soil of the region has been suffering the loss of the Native caretaking. Where once yearly burns would re-oxidize the soil and make it ripe for growing, now the soil has compacted, where once it was soft, and water runs over it instead of down into it and into the ground water. The result is warm, polluted water making its way directly into the rivers instead of finding its way there through the natural watershed.

The end result here will be a lack of Native plants except in museums, the total loss of good, usable soil, and ultimately the destruction of the earth. And all of this was being prevented by ""a relatively sparse population of [non-]nomadic peoples with low technology"". Amazing.

&gt;However, pretending they never did anything ecologically unsound is just ridiculous.

Its a funny argument to make though... The native people of North America were as much a function and pawn of the ecosystem they were as they were a shaper of it. Whereas, in Western culture, humans are separate and distinct from the plants around (although this isn't totally true... the fact that many European plants survive so well in bad environments can be directly attributed to their need to evolve to the shithole world the Europeans made for themselves).

&gt;In particular, how do you suppose that a comparatively primitive society of nomadic hunter-gatherers accurately assessed the overall ecological impact of its actions over multiple decades or generations?

**I think you ought to try to get a better grasp of the kinds of people you are talking about. My tribe was non-nomadic and had a vibrant agriculture, as were many many many other tribes.**

As far as ecological impact goes... I think you're refusing to incorporate the Native people as both players *and* pawns in this ecosystem. Their actions impacted it, to be sure, but much of the surrounded ecology *depended* upon that impact in order to survive.

&gt;Don't romanticise history, and don't confuse the low environmental impact from a relatively sparse population of nomadic peoples with low technology with those people's practices necessarily being genuinely environmentally sound on a mass-scale.

I try hard to avoid romanticism. There is much and more about my people that I have to be ashamed of, but certainly very little of that involves ecology. And scaling isn't at issue--the real issue is that these things have happened for thousands of years and drove the ecosystem from the ground up and now they have suddenly stopped... and we're paying the price for it.

The only opponents were Republic of South Africa and the head of League of Arabian states. [edit: they had 6 nations of South America sign on also.]

So first off I'm actually from Barcelona, Spain and I haven't seen the mercury fountain at the Miró Museum. [This was the actual storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKwxiVOvHME) that caused the flood last Saturday!

So from what I gather there's pretty much no reason for the electricity to leave the power strip or its immediate surroundings and absolutely no reason electricity will go up one leg and come down the other effectively 'zapping' you even if you do stand near it. I don't know if it's because of the cartoons I watched when I was little or (most likely) the  serious lack of physics education in my curriculum, but I had the idea that powered outlets in water = instant zap.

However, I've learned something new today! 

If a circuit is made, electricity will follow that circuit, since it's the easiest path.

If there isn't one, but there's a grounding wire, it will follow that.

If there's no grounding, then it will flow downwards, or spread to the nearest path that's grounded if the floor is insulated. In this case, best to have feet insulated and in either case, don't touch anything anywhere near the outlet.

Now, since Europe, how about getting briefly zapped by 220V? :)

""To pay the soldiers the Government issued its Treasury notes, authorized by act of Congress, July 17, 1861, for $50.000.000, bearing no interest. These notes circulated at par with gold. The Rothachilds' agents inspired the American banks to offer to Lincoln a loan of $150 million. But before they had taken much of the loan, the banks broke down and suspended specie payments in Dec. 1861. They wished to blackmail Lincoln and demanded the 'shaving' of government paper to the extent of 33%, an extortion which was refused. A bill drafted for the Government issue of $150 million, which should be full legal tender for every debt in the United States, passed the House of Representatives Feb. 25, 1862, and was hailed with delight by the entire country. But the Wall Street bankers were furious.

Sen. Pettigrew reprints the so called 'Hazzard Circular' sent in 1862 by the Bank of England (ruled by the Rothschilds):

'Slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power and chattel slavery destroyed. This I (Rothschild) and my European friends (the 300 men) are glad of, for slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborer, while the European (read 'Rothschildian') plan led on by England (i. e. the Rothschilds) is for capital to control labor by controlling wages. THIS CAN BE DONE BY CONTROLLING THE MONEY. THE GREAT DEBT THAT CAPITALISTS WILL SEE TO IS MADE OUT OF THE WAR must be used as a means to control the volume of money. To accomplish this the BONDS must be used as a banking basis. We are now waiting for the Secretary of the Treasury to make his recommendation to Congress. It will not do to ALLOW the GREENBACK, as it is called, to circulate as money any length of time, as we cannot control that.'

Thus the order of the Rothschilds was clear: 'Capitalists WILL SEE TO IT that a DEBT is MADE out of the war.'

The derelict neighborhood off Michigan Avenue is a sharp contrast to Goldman's bustling skyscraper headquarters near Wall Street, but the two operations share one important element: management by the bank's savvy financial professionals.

A string of warehouses in Detroit, most of them operated by Goldman, has stockpiled more than a million tonnes of the industrial metal aluminum, about a quarter of global reported inventories.

Simply storing all that metal generates tens of millions of dollars in rental revenues for Goldman every year.

There's just one problem: only a trickle of the aluminum is leaving the depots, creating a supply pinch for manufacturers of everything from soft drink cans to aircraft.

The resulting spike in prices has sparked a clash between companies forced to pay more for their aluminum and wait months for it to be delivered, Goldman, which is keen to keep its cash machines humming and the London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's benchmark industrial metals market, which critics accuse of lax oversight.

Analysts question why London's metals market allows big financial players like Goldman to own the warehouses which store huge quantities of metal even as they trade the commodity.

Robin Bhar, a veteran metals analyst at Credit Agricole in London says the conflict of interest is so acute he wants U.S. and European anti-trust regulators to weigh in.

""I think it makes a mockery of the market. It's a shame,"" Bhar said. ""This is an anti-competitive situation. It puts (some) companies at an advantage, and clearly the rest of the market at a disadvantage. It's a real, genuine concern. And I think the regulators have to look at it.""

Goldman said its warehouse subsidiary Metro International Trade Services has done nothing illegal, and abides by the LME's warehousing rules. ""Producers have chosen to store metal in Detroit with Metro,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said. ""We follow the LME requirements in terms of storing and releasing metals from our warehouses.""

The London Metal Exchange defends its rules. ""There is a perception that consumers have not been able to get to their metal when the reality is that it is big banks, financing companies and warehouses that are not able to get to their huge tonnages of metal fast enough,"" said LME business development manager Chris Evans.

BUSINESS MODEL

Goldman's warehouse business relies on a lucrative opportunity enabled by the LME regulations. Those rules allow warehouses to release only a tiny fraction of their inventories per day, much less than the metal that is regularly taken in for storage.

The metal that sits in the warehouse generates lucrative rental income.

Little wonder that so many want in. Metro was acquired by Goldman in February 2010, while commodities trading firm Trafigura nabbed UK-based NEMS in March 2010, and Swiss-based group Glencore International acquired the metals warehousing unit of Italy's Pacorini last September.

Henry Bath, a warehousing firm and founding member of the London Metal Exchange in 1877, has been owned for about 40 years by traders or banks including Metallgesellschaft in the 1980s and failed U.S. energy trader Enron at the turn of the century. It now comes under the umbrella of JP Morgan, which bought the metals trading business of RBS Sempra Commodities in July last year.

Despite its rental income, Goldman's warehouse strategy apparently hasn't been enough to snap a slumping performance in commodity trading, with the company reporting a ""significant"" drop in revenues from a year ago in its latest quarter, the sixth time in the past 10 quarters that it has failed to expand.

CONSUMERS FUME

The long delays in metal delivery have buyers fuming. Some consumers are waiting up to a year to receive the aluminum they need and that has resulted in the perverse situation of higher prices at a time when the world is awash in the metal.

""It's driving up costs for the consumers in North America and it's not being driven up because there is a true shortage in the market. It's because of an issue of accessing metal ... in Detroit warehouses,"" said Nick Madden, chief procurement officer for Atlanta-based Novelis, which is owned by India's Hindalco Industries Ltd and is the world's biggest maker of rolled aluminum products. Novelis buys aluminum directly from producers but is still hit by the higher prices.

Madden estimates that the U.S. benchmark physical aluminum price is $20 to $40 a tonne higher because of the backlog at the Detroit warehouses. The physical price is currently around $2,800 per tonne.

That premium is forcing U.S. businesses to fork out millions of dollars more for the 6 million tonnes of aluminum they use annually.

It has also had a knock-on impact on the global market, which is forecast to consume about 45 million tonnes of the lightweight, durable metal this year.

Also pushing aluminum costs higher are bank financing deals, which are estimated to have locked up about 70 percent of the 4.4 million tonnes of the metal sitting in LME-registered warehouses around the world. LME inventories hit an all-time record above 4.7 million tonnes in May.

In a typical deal, a bank buys aluminum from a producer, agrees to sell it at some future point at a profit, and strikes a warehouse deal to store it cheaply for an extended time period.

The combination of the financing deals and the metal trapped in Detroit depots, means only a fraction of the inventories are available to the market.

Premiums for physical aluminum -- the amount paid above the LME's cash contract currently trading at $2,620 a tonne -- in the U.S. Midwest hit a record high of $210 a tonne in May, up about 50 percent from late last year. In Europe, the premium is at records above $200 a tonne, double the levels seen in January 2010.

The ripple effect into Asia has seen the premium paid in Japan increase 6 percent to $120 a tonne in the third quarter from the previous quarter, the first rise in nearly six quarters.

COLLECTING THE RENT

You won't hear banks like Goldman complaining. Rental income continues to pour in at the 19 Detroit area warehouses run by Metro as of June.

From the outside one recent afternoon, a depot in the Detroit suburb of Mt Clemens appeared to be deserted. But neighbors say the place is a whirl of activity in the early hours of the morning when metal is usually delivered for storage.

The LME sets the maximum allowable rent at 41 U.S. cents per day per tonne. At that rate, Goldman's warehouse operation in Detroit -- said to be holding more than 1.1 million tonnes -- could be generating as much as $451,000 per day or about $165 million a year in revenue.

An exact figure cannot be calculated because many clients negotiate lower rental rates and Goldman declined to detail its income from its warehouse business. But when Swiss-based trading company Glencore listed earlier this year it revealed that its metals warehousing unit generated $31 million in profit on $220 million in gross revenue in 2010.

LONG HISTORY

Caught between consumers and warehouse operators is the 134-year old LME, one of the world's last exchanges with open-outcry trading. Sessions take place in a trading ring with red padded seats while visitors can watch from a gallery. Traders juggle multiple telephones and use archaic hand signals to fill orders from consumers, producers and hedge funds.

The ring is a perhaps more civilized version of the tumultuous trading pits made famous in Chicago. Each of six major industrial metals including copper and nickel are traded for five minute bursts in the morning and afternoon. Only 12 firms have access to the ring, arranged in fixed positions in a circle, with many others involved via the ring dealers and on the LME's electronic trading system.

Longer sessions in the late morning and afternoon allow trading of all metals simultaneously and are known as ""the kerb"" from the days when dealers continued to trade on the kerb, or sidewalk, after leaving the exchange.

The LME certifies and regulates the Detroit sheds as part of a global network of more than 640 warehouses. The network is meant to even out swings in volatile metals markets. During recessions, surplus metal can be stored until economies recover and demand picks up, when the metal can be released.

But that function is now being undermined by the backlog in Detroit.

LME rules stipulate that warehouses must deliver a certain amount of metal each day. However the rules apply not to each warehouse but to each city that a company has warehouses in. At the moment, a warehouse operator needs to deliver just 1,500 tonnes a day per city, whether it owns one warehouse there or dozens.

That means each of Metro's Detroit warehouses need to release only 79 tonnes of aluminum a day. At that rate, it would take two years to clear the stocks held by Goldman's Detroit warehouses.

The backlog sparked outrage last year, prompting the LME to task London-based consultancy Europe Economics to look into its rules. Europe Economics recommended the exchange raise its minimum delivery rates and earlier this month the exchange announced a new regime for operators with stocks of over 900,000 tonnes in one city.

From April 2012 the minimum delivery rate will double to 3,000 tonnes a day.

Critics dismiss the move as too small to have any real effect, especially because of the delay until it comes in.

""The move is too little and too late to have a material effect in the near-term on an already very tight physical market, particularly in the U.S.,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a July note.

A senior executive at a metals brokerage told Reuters ""the recommendations won't change anything. The problem will still be there six, nine months down the line.""

""If Detroit has 1.1 million tonnes at the moment, what's to say it won't have 2 million tonnes next year,"" he said.

MOVING MORE METAL

One obvious solution would be to impose minimum delivery requirements per warehouse or per square meter of warehouse space rather than per city.

It's not as if the warehouses can't cope with delivering more stock: large operations can shift much more than 3,000 tonnes a day, warehousing sources say. An experienced forklift driver takes about 20 minutes to load one 20-tonne truck with aluminum in the United States. That means one warehouse in Detroit with two doors, two forklifts and an eight-hour working day could move out as much as 1,920 tonnes of metal every day.

""If you take Detroit in particular, those warehouses historically extracted metal at a faster rate ... the infrastructure is there,"" a senior analyst in the metals industry told Reuters.

Madden at Novelis said: ""I don't know the specific details of every warehouse but our view is that they seem to be able to absorb metal coming in at almost an infinite rate and so we feel there's a lot more they can do on the output side to push up the (load out) rates.""

The LME could also crack down in the same way it did in 1998 when it banned Metro from taking any more copper into its Long Beach and Los Angeles warehouses. Then the complaints were said to have come from copper consumers worried that 80 percent of total copper stocks in LME-approved warehouses were held in California.

The exchange argues that any change right now might disrupt the market.

""Changes to the delivery out rate have required careful consideration because it will impact the cost structure for those holding metal, and were those costs to rise sharply it could affect the way that metal is stored and traded,"" said the LME's Evans.

The exchange could also rule that a warehouse cannot charge rent once aluminum has been purchased, no matter how long it takes to ship it. But a change like that would hit the LME itself as it receives about 1 percent of the rental income earned by the warehouses it approves.

LEGAL FEARS

Nobody at the LME will say whether the Europe Economics study -- industry sources said it talked to more than 40 companies -- advised more radical measures, arguing that such information is ""proprietary"".

In any case, say metal markets sources, LME officials may be hesitant to make bigger changes because they fear legal action from the likes of Goldman, which could argue that Metro's business model has been based on existing LME warehouse rules.

The LME declined to comment on possible legal challenges, but its Chief Executive Martin Abbott said at a recent briefing that the warehouse delays were not causing market and price distortions.

""No, I don't believe it is,"" Abbott said, when asked if the situation was causing distortions in the market.

Abbott said the exchange had received no official complaints from consumers about bottlenecks at warehouses. The LME also dismisses concerns about banks trading metal and owning the warehouses where it is stored.

While a British parliamentary committee raised the issue in May, Britain's Office of Fair Trading declined to open a probe.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the futures and options markets, said it would not comment.

Britain's Financial Services Authority, which regulates exchanges where commodity futures are traded but not warehouses that store physical material, declined to comment.

WHAT NEXT?

The lack of real change has some in the industry questioning the very structure of the LME, which, unlike its publicly owned U.S.-based rival commodities exchanges, is owned by many of the financial institutions that trade there.

""The belief is that they are focused on serving their shareholders; most of them being the banks ... We see our clients and contacts trying to avoid the LME as much as possible now,"" said Jorge Vazquez, Managing Director of the Aluminum Intelligence Unit at HARBOR Commodity Research.

That concern is growing. Critics of the exchange point to a potential problem with zinc supply though New Orleans, where inventories now account for 61 percent of total LME-registered stocks.

Most of the warehouses in New Orleans are owned by Goldman and Glencore.

Metal industry sources believe regulators should take a closer look at the possible conflict of interest that arises when trading houses also own the warehouses.

""If the whole thrust of regulation and regulatory reform is increased transparency and open and above board operations, letting banks own warehouses seems to run entirely counter to that,"" said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Standard Life Investments said.

The LME says it enforces a strong separation between warehouses and the trading arms of their owners. Just this week it proposed that companies which own warehouses should engage an independent third-party to verify the robustness of Chinese walls.

""We enforce it through regular audits of warehouses,"" said the LME's Evans. ""If people say Chinese walls are leaking then they should bring us evidence and we'll investigate.""

If there were any truth to the hypothesis that atheists are bad people, the sociology of modern prosperous democracies would look a hell of a lot different than it does. For a scholarly examination of that, look at Gregory Paul's [The Chronic Dependence...](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP07398441_c.pdf):

poorly in 2, average in 4, well or very in 4, and the best in 1. Specifically, the U.S., scores the 
most dysfunctional in homicide, incarceration, juvenile mortality, gonorrhea and syphilis 
infections, abortions, adolescent pregnancies, marriage duration, income disparity, poverty, 
work hours, and resource exploitation base. The level of relative and absolute societal 
pathology in the U.S. is often so severe that it is repeatedly an outlier that strongly reinforces 
the correlation between high levels of poor societal conditions and popular religiosity.

&gt; Because the U.S. performs so poorly in so many respects, its cumulative score on the 
SSS is a uniquely low 2.9 (Fig. 1), placing it as an outlier so dysfunctional relative to the other 
advanced democracies that some researchers have described it as “sick” (Sapolsky, 2005;

Its not that I think I'm a superior driver either, I just don't see the point in sitting on 100km/h when I'm the only car in sight on a long, straight, open stretch of road headed through Kalbar or something. Is it unsafe to do 110 in a well-maintained vehicle while not surrounded by other cars? Nope.

I'll get fined for it anyway but I'm willing to accept the consequences if I do get caught.

The fact is in Europe they have the Autobahn, in the US their interstates are (I think, from memory) 75mph which is 120km/h and their highways are rough and shitty from what I've seen,  in comparison to ours especially.

I know that speed is a safety factor but for fucks sake, the number of 40 zones within 10 minutes of my house right now that are there purely because there are plastic barriers 10m off either side of the road is infuriating. If you follow the speed limit then you end up with a massive line of cars angrily queuing up behind you. If you do a genuinely safe speed then you're risking getting done for 20+km/h over the limit.

I guess my point is that the more they lower our limits to embarrassing levels, the more prominent speeding will be.

Assholes will be assholes and the VN with his wank-o-meter (monster tacho) and HRT stickers is still going to think hes awesome doing 140 in an 80 zone but for the average person doing 5 - 10km/h over... its more revenue than it is safety.

The biggest thing that contributed to my learning how to play the game was reading through strategy guides for the different classes.  Especially reading medic strategy guides helped me realize that for the new-player skill level, medic is probably the best class to play.

Granted, all the duties of a medic are intense, and it takes awhile to get used to them.  Meted down to the most basic tenets of medic play - you need to stay alive, heal everyone especially fellow medics, and know which classes to uber in which situations.  Pyros can be helpful to just push the other team backwards or to create chaos, demos are best when there are multiple enemy sentries to destroy, and heavies are best when the enemy is crowded around in a tight, open (in terms of line of sight) area. 

also, playing medic and determining which players are highly-skilled is the best way to play.  I had accumulated probably 400 medic hours before I started heavily playing another class.  I began to play demo simply because the map I favored was a demo-favorable map.  Thus, most of the time the very best players I healed were demos.  Simply put, if you're new to the game, play medic, and simply observe the players you heal and how they play.  Especially try to find the highly-skilled players, heal them, and figure out how and why they do the things they do.

Lastly, if you can't get above 10 fps, you're probably not going to get good at this game.  I have a fairly low fps compared to others who play this game, but I still get good enough to react to players around me.  10 just isn't high enough.  That said, if you're getting frame issues, the best classes to play are probably medic and engineer.  When I play on european (I live in the U.S.) servers, those are the classes easiest to play without losing too much of a competitive advantage.   

tl;dr Play medic, observe skilled players, and learn how to play those classes by observation.  Also, read class strategy guides.  I would recommend watching videos, but many of them are outdated. 

edit1: forgot the most basic tip - use a microphone, and communicate with (and listen to) your teammates. this is especially necessary when playing a medic, but it's helpful to you and your team to communicate no matter what class you play. ",tf2,,True,1,False,t3_j5ytw

Having said that I do not agree with your analysis of China. China does not hold our debt. They hold Treasury bonds which haven't really been a denomination of debt for the US since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971. 

The reason China wants to hold these bonds has more to do with their domestic policy than anything else. By doing this they are able to keep the dollar strong thereby artificially keeping their currency weak. This allows them to be a net exporter to the US as they can produce low tech goods more cheaply.

Oh, and could Joseph Smith have written the BoM? Absolutely. That book isn't that great. Here's a list of a few things off the top of my head that indicate that it doesn't take a genius to write the book. 

* Let's look at Nephi as a character. One common sign of amateur writing is the inclusion of a [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue), that is to say, where the author inserts him/herself into the story as a key character that comes up with all the good ideas while everyone else sits back and wonders what the hell is going on. Read the story of Nephi with this in mind and you'll spot this trope everywhere.
* Laman and Lemuel. How old were these guys? Older than Nephi, who was himself old enough to carry the plates and impersonate Laban. That means those two *had* to be at least in their 20s. If Lehi is as wealthy as the BoM suggests, he had to a merchant. There is nothing Lehi could have done to stop those two from staying. So complaining makes no sense when they could just stay.
* Oh, and Zoram. ""Sure, I'll go out and have my daughters marry your daughters! That sure will delay the incest by one generation, yesiree!"" (psst... the next generation will be reproducing through incest still)
* Lehi's dream. [I'll just leave this here](http://www.centerplace.org/history/misc/jsp.htm#14) and move on.
* One of my favorites... why could Lehi's family offer burt offerings if they couldn't cook their food for fear of being spotted? Not to mention that burnt offerings and similar ordinances were only to be performed by the Levites, whereas Lehi states that he was from the tribe of Joseph, which he learned from reading the plates. But how could he have used the plates to learn this if he didn't know his lineage to begin with? And what's more, how could someone living in a culture where your lineage is as important to you and recited as often as your surname not know what his lineage is? You could fumble around a dozen FAIR articles for convoluted explanations for these (most of which would not satisfy a skeptic in the least) or you could take the simpler explanation that Joseph Smith simply did not know Hebrew culture that well and put Lehi in the tribe of Joseph rather than the more logical Levi where the prophets were likely to come from because of his narcissism.
* Oh, and speaking of the tribe of Joseph, if Lehi really was in that tribe he would have been captive in Babylon in 600BC. 
* Speaking of the supposed 600BC time frame, much of the plagiarized chapters in Isaiah were written at around 500BC, after Lehi would have left. That is also assuming that you ignore the known translation errors that exist in the King James Bible verses that are found in the Book of Mormon word for word. Yes, the same errors exist there too.

I could go at this all day, but I'll stop there before the list gets too long. However, I can't end this without bringing up the mindfuck that is the journey of the Jaredites. They supposedly brought over nearly a dozen plants and animals that never existed in the Americas before the Europeans arrived, such as horses, sheep, bees, etc and never mentioned any of the most important foods that sustained the Natives such as sweet potatoes. They left from the Tower of Bable whose existence anthropology has pretty thoroughly debunked, entered barges with only one hole for air so the inhabitants will suffocate, and travel a distance that they could not possibly have packed enough food for and in a time period where they could barely seal a small boat from leaks much less a submarine.

Want sources for all this? Check out the page on [Mormonthink](http://mormonthink.com/book-of-mormon-problems.htm), they have a much bigger list than I do and cite everything. Best source ever. While you're there, be sure to read about the places where JS plagiarized parts of the BoM from. There's even bits from Gulliver's Travels in there. Good times.

I am a Macedonian postgrad student in New Zealand and am currently writing a dissertation on reproductive behaviours of the (Central and Eastern) European Roma, under a biological anthropology framework. I'm mostly interested in fertility rates, inter-birth intervals and number of children. Finding the data has proven very difficult, largely because of the identity issue, but also because no stats databases report these numbers according to ethnicity. All I have to rely on is (mostly biased) secondary sources. If I manage to find actual data, I believe the results would be interesting and could be used in policy making. Unfortunately it might take a while until I can go into the field and collect data myself.
 
Do you have any suggestions where I can find information on these things? I've searched the internet (including journals), but so far with limited success. Also, when are you going to publish this study and in which journal? 

I think you will find similar results in most Central and Eastern European countries, in terms of socio-economic status, employment and identity. The sad part is that these unfavourable outcomes are what influence the attitudes of the general public towards the Roma and promote discrimination and at the same time place them into that situation of poverty and bad health, which in turn promotes further discrimination. It's a vicious circle. Also, some ""scientific"" research has done nothing more but encourage discrimination (eg. Chvorovic on Serbian Roma). It's gonna be hard to get out of that loop.

The 14th century Huolongjing was also one of the first Chinese texts to carefully describe to the use of explosive land mines, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the Yuan Dynasty afterwards.

The problem wasn't that China didn't event the gun, it was the gun was never see as more than specialised weapon. Bows in Asia is just too good that no one saw guns as a via replacement. This is because

A) Unlike feudal Europe, china always fielded proffesional armies, and therefore the long training time required to use the bow was not as prohibtive. Muskets sucked vs bows for centuries, and people used them because no skill was required.

B) The Asia composite bow had the power of ENglish long bow, and was much less unweildy.

I'd get pretty despondent too, and yeah i could see my performance drop. Maybe instead of bagging on the ""bad"" teachers, the public at large and the district education boards can support them and try to help improve them and their conditions and maybe you will start to see an improvement in the barely registrable minority of teachers that are ""bad""?

I would like to point out that as such it would be correct to call citizens of any country listed 'North Americans'. As you can see citizens of only one country in North America are collectively and internationally referred to as 'Americans' or 'America', these 'Americans' are citizens of the U.S.A. . Citizens of Canada while still being 'North Americans' are collectively called Canadians as are citizens of Mexico known as Mexicans. Saying Canadians are American would be somewhat similar and just as absurd to me referring to citizens of England as Germans. Both countries are European; yes. But this does not mean there is no differentiation between the countries that consist of Europe. The citizens of England are English and the citizens of Germany are German, the fact both of those countries are geographically grouped as European does not take away from that fact. So I would suggest that in the future if you're going to refer to North America, that you clearly state it as such. Otherwise it will lead to this type of confusion. 

So considering your grammatical blunder I feel that it was completely acceptable for me to make my ~~assumption~~ presumption that you were specifically indicating citizens of the United States of America. 
Also I'd like to point out if you were in fact originally referring to Canadians and Americans as just Americans this only brings forth further issues with your original statement. It would then mean that originally you had meant that Canadians **and** Americans like to sue too much. When in fact Canada's suing practices are no where near in a similar state to that of the U.S.A. . Addmittingly yes there have been some insane lawsuits that occurred in the Canadian legal system but I feel like you would be hard pressed to find a country with a modern legal system that didn't have some odd lawsuit cases. In Canada the process of suing is much different and much more ""difficult"" (for lack of a better term) than it is in the U.S.A., as is the interprtation of the law (and the law itself) and the human rights awarded to citizens of each country. As such it is clear that if you were referring to both Canada and U.S.A. citizens when saying ""You Americans"" it further degraded the quality of your original comment. 

My next point is that in your second comment to me (the one I'm replying to now) you said 
&gt;The fact you seem to assume instantly that I meant United States of America shows you obviously realise there is a general problem with a 'suing culture'.

This refutes your last claim and even further discredits what you were saying by clearly stating that because I assumed you only meant the U.S.A. I must be admitting there is an issue with 'suing culture' in the U.S.A.. When you said those quoted words you implicated that you yourself believe in this statement considering you clearly intended it to appear as 'obvious fact' that the U.S.A. does have an issue in their 'suing culture', which I was apparently admitting to believing. It's clear that when you indicated the U.S.A. does have a 'suing problem' you continued your attacks towards the U.S.A. only, and further my belief that you did in fact originally only mean citizens of the U.S.A. ... However with this point I can only accuse you of such intentions and not firmly prove so. It shall then remain up to those who read our comments to make up their own minds of your true original intent to the word ""Americans"".

Finally, yes suing (if won) in most cases results in monetary gain. However winning a lawsuit is *supposed* to only occur when compensation is deemed appropriately awardable to the victim of an offence in which the victim was provably victimized. For example if the victim lost the ability to walk without a cane because of the other party, or when the victim is put through unnecessary mental anguish by the offender and as such will be awarded compensation deemed appropriate for the level of mental anguish the victim can prove they were subjected to. I am in no way defending the American lawsuit culture as I will gladly admit there are issues with it and it is most definitely not perfect. But this does not mean that because there are many seemingly crazy lawsuits that occur and are won in the U.S.A., that all lawsuits that happen in the U.S.A. are equally uncalled for or in anyway crazy. 

I would also like to point out that the only other acceptable time to refer to a group of people as Americans when not referring to citizens of the U.S.A. specifically, is when referring to humans living in all three Americas (North America, Central America, South America). Even then it would be more prudent to call them citizens of the Americas. Even if you do claim that you intended to refer to citizens of all three Americas I would point out that doing so would clearly make your original statement even more absurd as I and others would be hard pressed to believe that **all** countries that make up the Americas have suing problems.

Edit: I wanted to further add that regardless of if you or I feel that this specific case is suitable for the victim(OP) to file a lawsuit against the doctor or not, is not up to us to make. It would be the American Justice System that would ultimately decide based on all evidence revealed in court. Neither you nor I have all information pertaining to this case and even if we did our final opinions would still be just that; opinions. Although based on the information given to us our philosophical beliefs, morals, etc. would also effect whether we felt the doctor should be sued or not. As such it is - in at least my mind - pointless to argue that either of us could be 100% correct on this specific matter as this matter is clearly one based on opinions. Also I know I ripped into you on this and I do not mean it to be interpreted as an attack on your personal character.

Right, but that's a little disingenuous. Under that metric, the border of any North American country would absolutely dwarf everything in Europe. But it's not the length of the border *around* the country that matters: It's the length of the border that has to be actively policed, which is really what I was getting at with the ""border you've gotta worry about"" remark. And the U.S./Mexican border is 2,000 miles' worth of a political and security headache crossing some massively inhospitable terrain.

&gt;True, but as you go east an ever increasing disparity emerges and given it's one area of free travel you could go all the way from relatively poor Romania or Latvia to France without waving a passport. You could get to Iceland, Ireland or the UK if you found a form of travel over the sea that wouldn't demand an ID before boarding.

Yup. As I said, I consider the Schengen Agreement to be one of Europe's great triumphs, and I think it provides an excellent model for political and economic cooperation elsewhere (really, that Canada and the U.S. haven't instituted something similar is kinda dumb, but I haven't looked into it. There may be a valid set of reasons as to why it hasn't happened yet). But a hard-eyed political realist would consider the poorer nations you've mentioned here to be pretty effective ""buffer states"" between wealthy western European nations and true poverty elsewhere (on top of the Mediterranean Sea/English Channel). And, as far as I'm aware, the so-called ""Polish plumber"" issue is still a serious one in at least the U.K.

I should probably mention that the porous Mexican border is widely considered to be more of a security than a political issue by people in the U.S. government. NAFTA, political and economic failure in Mexico, the degree of nepotism and corruption in the Mexican government, and the increasing ugliness of cartel wars have all resulted in a very fatalistic attitude on the part of U.S. lawmakers toward the border: They accept and know that a certain amount of illegal immigration is going to happen, and it's something we can overlook as long as the U.S. economy can absorb it. But if you can get to Mexico, you can get to the States -- and of the *very* small percentage of border-runners who get picked up every year, we know that people from all over the world are crossing into the States from the south.

Of course, if one probes deeply enough into the past then all humans have a common ancestor; peering even deeper, then all eukaryotic and, before them, all prokaryotic lifeforms also share a common ancestor.

Thus, although they're both descendants of an unknown ancestor who lived thousands of years before Egypt was united under the First Dynasty—let alone Tutankhamen's *Eighteenth Dynasty*—no Europeans are likely to be *direct* descendants of Tutankhamen.  In fact, *no one* is likely to be a direct descendant of Tutankhamen due to his early death around the age of seventeen and no evidence of any surviving male offspring.  Furthermore, nothing about this information allows one to know how genetically related—id est, the degree of correspondence between genomes, or the percentage of DNA ""shared""—King Tutankhamen may, or may not, have been to modern Europeans.  Autosomal DNA, not the handful of Y-chromosome markers used here, is necessary to accurately compare genetic relatedness.

So in other words, this is merely sensationalism born out of an unholy marriage of science and commerce; a technically accurate, but misleading, assertion to garner publicity for their company and promote their genetic testing products.  It is somewhat interesting insofar as King Tutankhamen's haplogroup—R1b1a2, which is also shared by many Western Europeans—is presently far from common in Egypt in particular or the Near East in general; this could imply the royal family was foreign in origin, that Egypt has experienced a significant demographic change sometime in the past three-thousand years, or, perhaps more likely, it could simply be an anomaly.

I can certainly say that, yes, when the people are frustrated with their living conditions to the point of mass rage (French Revolution, Russian Revolution, Arab Spring) the likelihood of precipitating a mass resistance movement increases tenfold but I do not accept jumping to the conclusion that it is a) the only factor that can precipitate mass resistance movement nor b) the dominant factor that can precipitate mass resistance movements. 

A mass resistance movement can start and gain momentum in a number of ways. In Cuba, a small guerilla force provoked a mass movement that, for better or worse, led to a mass resistance movement. The living conditions there are not enviable to say the least yet no resistance movement has come about since.

In 1968, students in the West, in US and across Europe, spanning the Eastern Block, took part in mass resistance protests. They haven't amounted to much in terms of revolutionary change but neither did the Egyptian uprising, for that matter, if we are talking anarchism perspective. So if we are talking about purely getting a mass movement going, 1968 student uprising is one example where the living conditions were not unbearable but rather the freedom of expression was the driving motive for the popular uprising. 

To lay claim to destitute as the *only* motivating factor worth considering is, firstly, intellectually bankrupt and, secondly, must lead to the logical conclusion that, if it is indeed the only motivating factor worth considering, then anything else apart from efforts to bring it about are a waste of time. Either it is not the only motivating factor worth considering or it is but then, to be consistent, doing nothing or aiding the deterioration of living conditions is, logically, the only thing to be done that will have an effect on bringing about mass resistance.

Ah, well, only if you read the Daily Mail, the newspaper of choice of the middle class British xenophobe!

The truth is porous borders brought a great deal of man power to the UK - free movement of labour (like free trade) did the building trade a lot of good. Particularly before 2008 the building industry was booming and facing a [skills shortage](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-10473801-labour-shortage-hitting-builders.do), migrant labour filled that role and once it disappeared [many left](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/3248852/Polish-immigrants-leaving-Britain-What-the-Poles-did-for-us.html).

Don't get me wrong, I know many British builders who feared the ""Polish invasion"" as it lowered wages and increased competitions for jobs.

I would prefer to live in a world where I would never have started drinking, i.e. there were no significant social benefits attached to that. I have absolutely no personal problem with alcohol.

However, that's not the reality where I live and study/work, so no can do. How do you affect that? By legislation. I'm fortunate enough to live in a place where we're systematically killing off smoking (as in cigarettes), the culture and industry, through increased education campaigning, warning labels, restrictions on where smoking is allowed and tax increases. It's working, and the same will, gradually, happen with alcohol, I hope.

There is a way to do that, push the society in a certain desireable direction. It doesn't happen overnight.

""Rocket technology first became known to Europeans following its use by the Mongols Genghis Khan and Ögedei Khan when they conquered parts of Russia, Eastern, and Central Europe. The Mongolians had acquired the Chinese technology by conquest of the northern part of China and by the subsequent employment of Chinese rocketry experts as mercenaries for the Mongol military.

I was standing next to my car with a friend of mine (I can't remember if it was my girlfriend, or whatever), and an angry mob came up to trash my car, and I practically burst into tears telling them that I wasn't insured for rioting, and that i'd have no way to travel around if it was destroyed (In reality, I couldn't give a shit). 

The worst part was that the mob passed, some of them said they'd go and 'volunteer' for something. Military, or cleaning up something. I don't know.

I watched one of them get into a military flatbed, and I realised that he was one of my colleagues a few years back. As it drove away, i realised it was part of a larger convoy, and several more vehicles packed with my friends passed. Then, there were several more vehicles (or individual, I can't remember) with severely fucked up people getting pushed along on stretchers, with IV drips attached, probably victim to the incident i described earlier. Then after a while they passed, and several tipper trucks filled to the brim with charred, human body parts passed me.

The Israeli education system is dedicated to making you believe a particular story about your history and turn you into a compliant soldier and advocate for the state of Israel. 

Despite being trained to believe that you are living in a society that represents the pinnacle of civilised democracy, you are infact living in a country created by stealing the land of the Palestinians and sticking them in a giant prison. 

Despite thinking you are at the forefront of the struggle against racism and discrimination, you are living in a society so deeply steeped in racism and ""tribalism"" that some of the worst racist groups around the world admire you, even as they hate your Jewishness. 

Despite thinking you are a member of a modern Western-style liberal society, you are infact existing in a society which is an antiquated leftover from the European colonial conquests of the Middle East and nothing to do with modern values.

It is based on things people should do if they wish to live together with other humans. Humans should not kill other people, steal, commit adultery, or bear false witness. These ideas are not special, no?

A person doesn't need religion to understand morality. Some of the morals the Abrahamic religions (Christian, Judaism, Islam) teach are to not murder people, don't steal, don't lie, and don't commit adultery. However, anyone who is a member of a community knows these ideas. Take the idea of murdering a person. There are only 2 options for a society...either murdering a person is acceptable or murdering a person is not acceptable. In every society on Earth, murdering a person is not acceptable. It is not acceptable in Korea, Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, India, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, and Hawaii. A person doesn't need to be a member of a religious group to understand this. Who wants to live with a murder?...or a thief?...or a liar?...or a adulter? It is a simple idea. Further, anyone who does bad behavior would be ostracized from the group. Their behavior will have negative consequences.

Humans (homo sapiens) have been on Earth and living in groups for ~150,000 years. For 99% of the time humans have been on Earth, they did not have the Abrahamic religions to teach them morality (they learned morality on their own), but somehow they survived...praying to the wrong Gods and living immoral lives.

But by the year 1000 the Byzantine Empire was in big trouble. It kept losing territory to Muslim invaders from the east. When it lost control of the Holy Land to Muslim Turks, that got lots of people in Western Europe alarmed. 

In 1095, the Byzantine Empire asked Pope Urban II, head of the Catholic Church for help. Urban proclaimed a crusade, and encouraged people from Western Europe to head to the Holy Land to get it back from the Muslims. For the next 200 years, crusaders would make a number of attempts to try to win the area back, but could only hold the land for a short time.

First problem is that I know that the Normans will be coming before I die, or at least very close to my death. Since that ultimately turned out quite nicely I'm not sure I'd like to interference in the politics on the side of the old order.

What I would do is migrate to the City of London and make myself useful. I'd introduce things that are more abstract than anything else like insurance, futures trading (for farmers) and joint stock companies. These would all be considerable innovations that would spread enormous amounts of good while making me fabulously wealthy. This would probably be surprisingly quick once the wealthy people of the City realized how useful I was.

At this point I would start sponsoring engineering education while spending quite a lot of time asking surprisingly insightful questions from the masters and artisans I had hired to teach in the university. Clear pushes towards metallurgy and steam power in particular, with a strong hint that going for chemistry might be a good idea.

In parallel with the engineering education I would start the worlds first proper venture capital fund, where I'd take money from a lot of the most powerful people in the City (and by now probably Amsterdam and Paris to a degree). I'd let some of the most intelligent of them in on my secret of knowing essentially what was to come.

Another thing to fund early on would be a true hospital where I could actually get a lot of small things going. Enforced hygiene would be a very good thing. My VC fund would also focus quite a bit on optics until we actually can detect bacteria. Once that is working, I'd hint that people should try out mushrooms and what happens with all that bacteria. I don't think penicillin would in any way be out of range in about 20-25 years, though manufacturing it would be problematic.

During all of this I would have to spend a lot of energy and money bribing the Danes/Saxons/Norwegians constantly raiding the country. This would be the part that would get quite dangerous as I might be forced to bind quite closely with them, which would put me in enormous danger once William the Conqueror arrived. I might even be forced to resist him, which I'm not sure I'd really want to do longer term. Perhaps a better arrangement would be me allying with him earlier and even encouraging him to take over England.

Another problem would potentially be the church. I'd have to hold a VERY pious face and again get very close with the bishops etc. They were hardly immune from bribery so it shouldn't be difficult, especially if the hospital I sponsor is like one big edifice to Jesus.

Lots and lots of things to do, and being near one of the centres of finance would definitely be helpful as you could gain a large amount of resources quite easily just with some of the modern financial instruments (including ways around usury laws, which were common in Europe at the time).",history,,True,1,False,t3_j3koe

The minute I saw the picture and went ""But, but..."" I figured the artist either had no idea, or just simply wanted an impressive backdrop for Thrawn.  Also, who's to say this isn't him during a grand review for the Emperor or something?

You're right about the ""secret"" part starting to dissolve as the EU expands and Thrawn is fleshed out.  I said ""pushed off"" loosely, the Emperor gave him assignments that were meant for his skillset, meaning:  ""discretion is necessary, achieve fantastic results with limited resources, and stop this giant threat.""  Thrawn liked using his outsider status as a tool, rather than an obstacle.

I've never seen child exploitation personally and I wouldn't defend it.  You're still misunderstanding my point.  I'm saying that Africans have children, who grow up and and become workers.  Africa has a steady supply of labor, which is why so many Africans are able to emigrate to countries with little to no native population growth.

&gt;You don't threaten us by picking up our garbage.

The first generation picks up garbage, the second, larger generation, usually does better.  Breivik seemed to feel threatened, so do all the right wing parties in Europe and the US that oppose immigration.

&gt;2% growth. Also, as I said before, 5% of almost nothing is much less impressive than 2% of the Earth's most powerful economy.

[1.3%](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jul/29/us-economic-growth-slows-down-sharply).  That's only because the US is a [parasite](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60468.html) on the world economy.  Even if we assume that the world continues to use the US' funny money, if Kenya is 500 years behind, as you say, then how long to catch up?  Through compound interest (5%, compounded annually) I've calculated that Kenya's modest $30 billion gdp will match the US' current GDP in about 75 years (I divided the US gdp of $14 trillion by 16, because Kenya is geographically 1/16 the size of the US, if I don't divide, it only adds another 5 years).  ""Catching up"" to the US's future state might take a few years from that, but the growth outlook doesn't look great for the US.

&gt;Dirt farmers and criminals with Western cell phones are still dirt farmers and criminals.

They're still making money though, if money is the measure of ""civilization"".

&gt;the Africans' short lives are pretty much wasted.

Not if they are put to good use as workers.  Economically, as long as they work and there's enough of them to drive down labor costs, their lives aren't wasted.  Some suburbanite American who goes gets an expensive education and upbringing and returns to live with his parents after obtaining his liberal arts PhD and racking up $80k in student loans is worse than ""wasted"", he/she is a parasite.  Some urban American single mother who never works, lives in subsidized housing, has five kids, draws SSI on two for personality disorders, has all medical bills paid for by medicaid, has food paid for by food stamps, has heat paid for by LIHEAP, has education paid for by state and local taxes is worse than wasted, her life is parasitic.  US economic growth was driven for a while by immigrants packed into urban tenements.  In a sense it still is; without a steady supply of illegal immigrants to ""pick up garbage"" the 1.3% growth would probably evaporate.

After Christ's death the area remained part of the Roman Empire until 638, when it fell to Arab Muslim armies. It became part of the Abbasid caliphate, ruled from Baghdad, and their successors, and by the eleventh century was part of what is known as the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. All these were Sunni states. In 1095, however, Jerusalem fell to an invasion mounted by the Fatimid rulers of Egypt, who were Shi'ite (Shia) Muslims.

Because Islam accords some status to both Christians and Jews (who are 'The Peoples of the Book'), it was still possible for Christian pilgrims to visit Jerusalem for most of this period. During the 1060s, however, there was a certain amount of violence towards and persecution of these pilgrims. This was of concern to the Christians of Europe, and particularly to the Papacy, which under Gregory VII and his successors was introducing the new concept of the 'Papal monarchy' at much the same time. This suggested that the Popes, in addition to being the spiritual heads of Christian Europe, should also be acknowledged as the temporal superiors of all the kings and princes of the west.

There thus existed the conditions in which a Pope would feel justified in calling on those temporal rulers for support in what was primarily a spiritual aim, the recapture of the Holy Land for Christendom.

Several other factors also contributed to the readiness of the Papacy to preach a crusade:

[1] The kings, princes and nobles of Europe were bred and trained for warfare; most disdained learning and their worth was measured in terms of their prowess as knights. Thus there was constant agitation to fight. The Papacy became increasingly concerned at the amount of damage endless warfare between Christians was doing, not least to non-combatants. In the C11th, two significant attempts were made to limit this - the proclamation of the Peace of God (non combatants such as churchmen, women and children should not be harmed by warriors) and the Truce of God (no fighting on Sundays). However, it seemed a much better idea to take a third course, and divert Christian knights to fight a non-Christian enemy

[2] Younger sons in a feudal system designed not to divide up family lands had to find some outlet for their ambitions and that meant somehow obtaining land for themselves

[3] The Byzantine Empire - the successor state to the Roman Empire inthe east, with its capital at Constantinople - felt increasingly threatened by the rise of Islam. In 1071 the Byzantines suffered a shattering defeat at the hands of the Seljuks at Manzikert and as a result lost almost all of their Anatolian heartlands, which were also the main recruiting area for the Byzantine Army. By 1095 the Seljuk capital was at Nicea, just across the Bosphorus from Constantinople, and there was a significant chance that the next attack would lead to the fall of Byzantium. In 1095 the Emperor Alexius wrote to the Pope appealing for help in obtaining Christian forces from the west to help defend his empire.

Alexius had in mind a force of a few thousand knights that would have been put at his disposal, but in fact his appeal acted as a trigger for the proclamation of a crusade to recapture the Holy Places from the Muslims. This was preached by Pope Urban II to widespread acclaim and resulted in the creation of a number of crusading armies and the eventual invasion of the Muslim territories of the Near east via Byzantium in 1096.

The First Crusade was - despite some narrow squeaks - eventually successful and Jerusalem fell in 1099. There were several reasons for the Crusaders' success:

[1] Although the Crusaders (almost all of whom came from what is now France and Germany) were far from united (there was for instance no one leader of the First Crusade, and the various princes and nobles who led armies squabbled quite a bit among themselves) the Muslims in the Near East were even more divided. Most significantly, the last really able Sultan of Rum, Malik Shah, had died in 1092 and his empire was in the process of disintegration; add to that rivalry between Sunnis and Shias and you have a difficult situation. Numerous petty Muslim rulers were quite happy to see the Crusaders wipe out their rivals as they advanced, and the forces of Islam as a whole never joined together to resist the Crusade

[2] Urban had announced significant dispensations for those who joined the Crusade, most importantly an indulgence that guaranteed  all those who died on Crusade would be absolved of their sins. The Papacy also saw to it that rivals who remained at home did not stir up troubles for the Crusaders. Thus, spiritually, morale was high among the Christian forces and they believed fervently in their cause and that God was on their side

[3] The prospect of seizing land also appealed; as a result of the First Crusade, four major 'Crusader kingdoms' were carved out in the Near East and the followers of their rulers were settled on land confiscated from defeated Muslims

[4] Thanks to the assistance of several Italian city states (Venice, Genoa and Pisa) the Christians enjoyed almost complete command of the sea

[5] The defences of Jerusalem itself had not been repaired properly after the Fatimid siege of 1095

Jerusalem fell on 15 July 1099 and the last fragment of the Crusader kingdoms, Acre, did not revert to Muslim control until 18 May 1291. Of course a lot (including eight other Crusades) happened during that time, but maybe someone else would like to explain that!

But try two do the same for 1 - 2 = ?. Now that's different: How could you possibly give two legos to me if you only have one yourself? A long time ago, somewhere in Europe, someone decided that it would be nice to still be able to give an answer to 1 - 2 = ? and they said ""well, the answer to the *negative* problem is 1, so we'll call the answer to this problem *negative* 1"". It's just a made up thing that makes it possible to write down an answer for some problems. We can interpret it as debt, for example, but that's just an added bonus. Negative numbers *do not exist*, if you think about it.

A similar problem occurs when you think about the root of numbers. The square root of 4 is 2 and -2. That means 2 * 2 = (-2) * (-2) = 4. But what is the root of -4? There was no such number!

But then, someone, not so long ago, *invented* a ""number"", and called it *i*, and said ""well, this number is the solution to Sqrt[-1] = ?. That is why it is called imaginary, because it is just made up. But just like the negative numbers, it is useful because without it many problems would be impossible to solve.

To give you a real world example is much more difficult, because we'd have to get into the geometry of imaginary numbers for that - They are perfect for calculating rotations and stuff like that.

My very first nightmare I can remember, I must have been four or five. Now the first time I learned about vampires was the film Blade. I was six when I saw it. Before that, to my knowledge I knew nothing about them. It was close to being sleep paralysis I suppose, but I've never dealt with it so I don't think it was. I was laying at the foot of my parents' bed, and I look over out through the door into the living room and all of the doors are open, it's dark with just enough natural light to see things. Like any dream, everything was murky with flourishes of clarity. A man with tan, deep brown skin, possibly Eastern European is standing in my bedroom doorway at the opposite end of my house with a white dress shirt, partially unbuttoned, exposing his chest that's covered in scaring. Behind him is a mural of Christ on the cross, done in blood and dripping down the wall. He starts walking towards me slowly, a step every second, hunched over and his eyes, they're this disgusting glowing yellow with deep, jet black pupils. His hair is jet black and cut short, and his lips are slightly parted. He resembles leather, almost. I want to scream, but all I can feel is air silently passing through my throat as it shuts itself. I wiggle my legs and can feel my parents but they're asleep, maybe dead. The man can tell I'm afraid and he puts a finger to his mouth as I scream in silence, making a face of ""shhhhhhh......"" He smiles and laughs and I can see this massive set of fangs when he does it, the laugh is sick and I can't stop staring at his teeth and eyes. He made it to the doorway to the room before I woke up. 

One very intense dream I've had was involving me waking up in an apartment, in my dream it's my apartment. Everything in this city is grey-blue and black, there's no bright colors, it's all muted like a zombie film. I get out of the bed with grey sheets and I can feel something wrong in my chest, I tear off the red shirt I'm wearing in front of a mirror and there's hole in my chest where my heart should be, I can see where a large bullet broke through, I know that it's inside of me. I'm covered in my own blood, I'm panicking. My heart aches. It's not physical pain, it feels more emotional. I try to call for an ambulance, the phone is dead. I walk into the hall and climb down the stairs, reaching the lobby and it's empty aside from a few couples making out in the corners. The sound of residents' TVs turned up too loud reaches faintly. I leave the building, I walk down the street. Cars blast by so fast you can only see blurs of color and headlights. People walk by holding umbrellas, it's raining. No one notices. Next thing I know I'm standing in a DVD/game store, a few people I know idly shopping, I try to get people's attention, looking for help but no one notices. I'm invisible to everyone, so it seems. There's a doorway with a bead curtain covering it as a door, I step through, my hair catching on it for a moment. There's a large, stone room with holes for windows that let jaggedly gorgeous light pour in, there's a smell of perfume and smoke. A bed sits there, empty, the sheets untouched. Somehow I end up in a hospital trying to get the nurse to understand that I'm going to die, she doesn't notice me. Eventually she says I have to sign in, the first person to even acknowledges my existence. I do, but my hands won't write. I just can't. The pen slips, the clipboard falls, the letters are jagged and illegible, my hands cramp. There's a rifle next to me and smoke fills the air, I pick it up, I place the barrel in my mouth, I can feel my finger on the metal of the trigger and the cold steel on my tongue.

I don't know if the ZR-7 is as undervalued in Europe as it is here in the states, but I wanted to point at that the one I saw-- 20,000 miles, very clean with some pricey accessories, was selling for $2500, the equivalent of 1765 euro. This might be due to the trend in the US of riders buying bikes from well-defined genres-- supersports, cruisers, scooters. There isn't much love in the mainstream for naked bikes, especially those with half-fairings. There aren't any reality shows about practical, reliable motorcycles.

I don't think that the ZR7 would be my first choice if I were shopping for a bike that size, especially if I lived somewhere with a better selection of midsize naked bikes.

As an SV1000 owner, I want you to take a look at the SV650. The first-gen, the one with carburetors and the rounded frame, tends to be a really affordable, reliable, easy-to-ride bike. So is the fuel-injected second generation, except the prices tend to be a bit higher. You still might get lucky. I'd also check out the Hornet (called the 599 in the States) and the Kawasaki Z750 which is liquid-cooled and a good deal sportier than the ZR7.

Don't be turned off by the Honda F4. It may look like a sportbike, but it's much more comfortable and ergonomic with flatter power delivery than modern 600 sportbikes. The seat is low and soft, the bars are high, and it has a small but full fairing for you to tuck behind on the highway. It's definitely not as powerful as my SV1000, but will cruise comfortably at 110mph whereas my naked SV can really beat you up at highway speeds.",motorcycles,2007 Aprilia Tuono,True,1,False,t3_j45h0

Then came Pepin the Short, who started a new dynasty in France. An important part of his power came from an alliance with the Pope. He basically laid the groundwork for his son Charlemagne to expand the borders of the Frankish kingdom to much of modern France and Germany.

This is really when European expansion began. Second born Frankish nobles had no claim to their father's estate and so had a strong impetus to seek their fortune through conquest and adventure. A Norman noble (William) conquered England in 1066. German princes essentially colonized eastward into central Europe. The reconquista of Spain began as the Muslims were slowly repelled. And of course there were those (mostly Frankish) knights who went East. Not just to conquer the Holy Land, but also Sicily, Malta, and other places.

&gt;You say: ""Socialism is a big tent yes, but economically speaking, they're all the same. Central economic planning, which means government ownership of the means of production.""

&gt;You are correct up to a certain point.....""government ownership of the means of production"" To a degree you are correct, yet what kind of government? ......A workers government, and a government that puts workers first AKA the masses the people first.

&gt;I just want to point out why I think this is important in your debate: It is vital to point out what kind of government in the same vain as a packet of crisps, but what flavour?

It doesn't matter what kind of government.  They are all subject to the same critical flaw that prevents them from being rational and productive, namely, an absence of a price system for the means of production.  A ""worker's government"" that ""puts workers first"" cannot overcome this limitation.  The USSR, communist China, Cambodia, Cuba, North Korea, were all examples of governments ""putting the workers first.""  Just because the RESULTS were exactly counter to worker interests, that doesn't mean the intentions were not ""worker"" oriented.  You need to learn the difference between intentions and results.  Then you need to learn that in order for socialist central planning to even be maintained, the central planners MUST be tyrannical and brutal, for if they weren't, then individual civilians across the country/society will make their own investments and plan for their own futures according to their own needs and desires.  This is incompatible with socialism, because in socialism, individual civilians cannot own and control their own means of production.  If the central planners are peaceful, then individual civilians across the country/society will rightfully consider the central planners to be a bunch of arrogant, pompous demagogues who fallaciously believe themselves to know what's best for other individuals over and above the individuals themselves.

You don't know what I need and desire and what costs I am willing to incur.  Any attempt by you to ""plan"" my life will be met with my hostility and rejection, and the more you insist, the more I will defend my own goals and desires as superior to your goals and desires for me.  Thus, the ONLY way you as an individual other than me can ""plan"" for my life as a central economic planner, would be if you threatened me with violence, so that I will be coerced into capitulating to your attempt to control me, over what I produce, over what I trade for, over what I own, and thus over what I consume.  If you aren't willing to use violence, then I will simply thumb my nose at you and consider you a nuisance, while I go about living my own life and planning for my own life external and separate from your desire to control my economic life.  Thus, ""nice socialists"" could not maintain socialism.  Socialism requires violence in order for one or more individuals to control the economic lives of all other individuals.

&gt;The difference between a socialist government and a capitalist government is very different flavours. Currently the governments in power now represents a Capitalist government who are the minority in economic terms for example: 10% of the worlds population have 63% of the worlds wealth, therefore leaving 90% of the population with 38% of the wealth. The 10% minority are the Capitalists capitalising on the worlds wealth they rule and govern now.
Who made that decision on how wealth should be distributed in this way??  Obviously not the majority or a mathmatician. 

A number of problems here.  

One, we don't have a capitalist government.  We have a welfare/warfare, social democracy government.  The fact that most of the means of production in our economy are privately owned does not make the US government a ""capitalist"" government.  Most of the means of production are also privately owned throughout all of Europe.  Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and every other ""socialist"" country are in fact ""capitalist"" using your own treatment of capitalism in the phrase ""capitalist government,"" because most of the means of production in these societies are privately owned, not state owned.

Two, it is in fact the majority that created what we have today in this country.  The majority of people do not want a separation between economy and state.  The majority wants an official state economy, through welfare and warfare.  The majority wants the minority of individuals to be members of the official state welfare/warfare economy, and if they don't like it, then they have to move some place else.  Thus, when the majority wants a welfare/warfare government, the result is massive wealth transfer, from both poor to rich, and rich to poor, depending on whether it is warfare or welfare that is being preached and practised.

Three, wealth disparity increases the more government interferes with civilian's economic lives.  This is especially true when money production is controlled by the state.  When you can print your own money, and give it to your friends, you and your friends can become wealthy without even working for it, thus living as parasites off of the productive, that is, those who do have to work to earn their money.  Couple that with the increases in government spending relative to GDP all around the world, and the regulations which supposedly help the weak and vulnerable but in reality hurt them by preventing them from competing, and the result is expected.

Fourth, socialism is not ""worker oriented.""  Socialism is command and control oriented.  That command and control is based on violations of individual property rights, and it is individual property rights that is the ONLY ""worker oriented"" system there is.  Every ""group"" based political system necessarily contains one group exploiting another group.  Only a system based on individual rights and freedoms can ensure no inherent exploitation will take place.  The problem with you socialists is that you believe there is an inherent exploitation taking place in voluntary profit-seeking.  As long as individuals are free to trade and earn profits by selling goods for more than the money costs in producing them, the more other people are not ""receiving the full product of their labor.""  So you advocate for government guns, to ""right the wrong"", to exploit the profit earners, by either taxing them 90%, or forcing them to pay a wage that is above the market rate.  Since no individual wants to be exploited, the capitalists have responded to the newly created government power, generated by the majority wanting that power to exist, by utilizing that power themselves.  So we now have the poor exploiting the rich, and the rich exploiting the poor, and in the process, everyone's standard of living declines from where it otherwise would have been.

Fifth, and most importantly, wealth disparity is not inherently evil, as long as it is a product of differences in individual performance as judged by their fellow individuals in a context of free trade.  To make blanket condemnations against wealth disparity is to believe that one can obliterate the connection between an individuals choices and actions, and the consequences of those choices and actions.  One individual who works hard and saves, and earns more than another individual who is lazy and doesn't save, is not an injustice.  That is justice.  As long as neither the hard working individual nor the lazy individual initiate force against the other's person or justly acquired property, then ANY wealth disparity no matter how large, is fully justified and moral.

The US being the most capitalist friendly nation in the world attracts (and spawns) capitalists. To understand the geopolitical climate of the world you must understand that it is no longer controlled by nation states. There is of course the *appearance* of superpowers but these superpowers tend to correlate well with the wealth held by their citizens. 

World affairs are now primarily influenced by a *plutocracy* which exists in rich nations such as the US, Canada, and the EU (primarily the UK). This was the intended result of globalization. If you consider the US the center of world wealth (and thus power) it is important to understand how the elite came to dominate the US. This is best explained in “Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich”.

It is not *purely* about wealth but wealth *disparity*. The gulf between the richest and the poorest in the world is now larger than it's ever been. The rich continue to become richer while the poor continue to become poorer. This is by design and primarily executed by those who control (and purchase) political influence.  The beauty of this power grab lies in the perceived assignment of blame to political parties thus freeing the elite from blame in the minds of the proletariat. The top 1% of the nation now controls 40% of the wealth. This is not well understood by most because it is difficult to grasp what exactly it means to wealthy today. If the wealthiest in the US held their wealth in US currency notes ($100.00 each) they would have far more cash than would fit into most middle class homes. One billion dollars weights 29,160 Kg. The wealthiest however own tens of billions of dollars or more.

Because the US is a two party system and *both* parties influence policies that support vast wealth creation it becomes difficult for US citizens to enact democratic policies which might change this power imbalance. 

tl:dr: The world not controlled by nation states but by the wealthy, most of which originate from the US. This is a *class* issue rather than a political issue.

Because of that I hold it to a greater standard than I do countries like Syria and thus I expect better from it. In absolute terms, sure, Israel's neighbors are run by terrible human beings who commit huge atrocities.

 But let's go through a thought experiment: Imagine if a Norwegian local government sentenced a person to death by stoning or hanging (purely hypothetical), would that not get more news coverage than if it happened in Afghanistan or Pakistan? Why? Because the world expects better from the Norway and if such an atrocity ever occurred it would surprise a lot of people. 

Now this of course is an extreme example but I think you should be able to understand my argument. No other Western Democracy (minus the US of course which I happen to be very critical of) has such paranoid and hawkish military policies as Israel. Israel shoots down protestors at its borders and used greatly unbalanced force against the people of Gaza among other things. Additionally it annexed and still builds on arab land, demolishes palestinian homes and has a racially discriminatory citizenship policy. These are all not characteristics of a western democracy and we should expect better from it. 

I am additionally critical of Israel for failing to be the bigger person in talks with the Palestinians. Israel is by far the strongest economy and military power in the Middle East. It can afford to take some security risks for long-lasting peace. Because of its failure to do this I think it is holding up peace in other arab countries which affects the US and many European countries who should thus have legitimate issue with Israel's actions and should be very critical of it.

The pope said: ""Ok, in this case killing is allowed and you'll score extra points for getting into heaven"".

Around the same time Christianity split up in two parts. In the west they followed the pope. In the east, in the Byzantine Empire, they followed the Patriarch. They became enemies but didn't really fight. 

However, about 20 years later the Byzantines were in big trouble because the Turks attacked them. Their boss asked the pope for help. 

The pope had become pretty strong around this time and had been fighting with the emperor about things like appointing bishops. He now had a chance to play the boss over the emperor. Also, pilgrims to the Holy Land (Palestine) were attacked and now they could pretend to protect them.

The pope said: ""Ok, we'll help. And killing is allowed, you get bonus points for getting into heaven if you go and if you die you go to heaven right away"".

The First Crusade started in 1095. It was a war against non-Christians. In Germany people killed a lot of Jews before they went east. Then they fought the Turks in Turkey and the Arabs, Palestinians, Jews and other non-Christians in Palestine.

They did pretty well, they conquered Syria and Palestine. But after only 150 years they were kicked out and Palestine was under control of Muslims until the First World War.

There were other crusades too. There were crusades against Muslims in Spain. There were crusades against pagans in Russia and the Baltic states. There was a crusade against the Cathars in south France because the pope said they weren't real Christians. And during the fourth crusade they just plundered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantines!

Basically, when the Christians in Western Europe got strong enough they united and kicked out anyone they didn't like - especially Muslims and Jews. They figured they couldn't beat the Turks but fought on in Spain and eastern Europe. The conclusion was that the Christians completely reconquered Spain in 1492.

""Voting against their own interest"" only applies in any significant way to poor and working class Whites (particularly white men).  Poor and working class Latinos and Blacks do vote their class interest.  White conservatives have been convinced that white privilege means that their interests align with the ruling class.   They are convinced that they will be rich someday as long as government doesn't take their money and give to to people of color on welfare.  (This of course ignores the fact that more tax money goes to warfare than welfare, that taxes are at a historic low, that inter-generational social mobility in the USA is among the lowest in the OECD, and that most people on welfare in the USA are white).  

This is less significant of a factor, but the UK has a parliament and at least some semblance of proportional representation and *real* political parties--though not as much as continental Europe.  The US first past the post, single member districts, winner take all, strong executive, party primary, etc system prevents minority voices from having a say and can only effectively represent the center or status quo.

Another factor is that the USA is a more reactionary authoritarian society.  Left wing politics have risen here: the socialist party, the communist party, the IWW, the grange movement, the SDS, the Black Panthers etc...but these movements were largely crushed by the state.  Hundreds of wobblies were imprisoned or deported in the first red scare.  Eugene V Debs was jailed.  Fred Hampton was assassinated.  We don't have a labor, social democratic, democratic socialist, communist, etc party.  We no longer have strong unions.  We are a very corporate dominated society.

The USA is also a more religious society.  Most European revolutions were violently anti-clerical (the French, Spanish, and Russian revolutions in particular).  Some of that sentiment probably rubbed off on the UK.  Ironically, the US being founded on relative religious freedom, and separation of church and state probably protected both the church(es) and state from the change that was sweeping the world in the wake of the Enlightenment, industrialism, the growth of Marxism/Anarchism, and the discovery of evolution.  We never had a good church burning revolution here.  Strongly religious people are delusional and easy to manipulate.

After Irene gave me the tour of her home, she asked, ""How did I get this way?"" It completely baffled her that her home was nearly unlivable. ""I know I am smart and capable, so why can't I manage my stuff? I see other people doing it. Why can't I?"" I had no answer for her.

When we began studying hoarding, we were told by other mental health experts that it was a response to deprivation. Living through a period of deprivation, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s or the Holocaust, might cause people to stock up on whatever they can find to prevent such an experience from occurring in the future. Indeed, in our first study of hoarding, we found that many people described much of what they collected as ""just in case"" items. But when we asked our hoarding research participants if they had ever experienced periods of deprivation, by and large they said no. In fact, many of them grew up quite wealthy and never faced any shortage of food, money, or luxuries. Irene's experience was typical: She grew up in a middle-class family. Her father was a high school accreditor, and her mother taught typing and shorthand at the local high school. They had enough money and never experienced any material deprivation.

Irene could not remember exactly when her hoarding began. She remembered saving her schoolwork from elementary school, much of which she still had. But when she was young, her room was not cluttered, and she had little trouble managing the things she owned.

Her father traveled a lot for his job. She remembered being spellbound by his descriptions of the places he visited and the things he saw, and his stories left her with a lifelong interest in travel. Although she traveled very little herself, travel sections of newspapers and travel brochures could be found throughout her house. They were among the most difficult things for her to discard. Perhaps they represented a bond with her father that she cherished. The rest of her relationship with him was not so warm.

Outside of his travel stories, Irene remembered him as distant and cold. Irene recalled her father's terrible temper when she was growing up. Although he never hit her, she remembered being afraid of him. That dynamic continued into her adulthood. One day she showed me a letter he had written to her several years earlier. It was formal and criticized the way she cared for her house. ""You have failed in your obligation to properly maintain the house and grounds,"" he complained. He had helped them buy the house but now threatened to cut her off if things didn't improve.

On another occasion, not long after she got married, Irene went looking for a pair of gray wool slacks some friends had given to her husband. She recalled putting them in a box in the barn behind her house with some of her many ""lists,"" but the box was nowhere to be found. Her father had been in the barn, so she asked if he had moved it. He admitted to having thrown the slacks away, trying to secretly rid his daughter of stuff. Irene drove to the town dump and spent several hours searching through the trash. She never found the slacks.

More recently, she saw her father tear up and throw away some of her late mother's handwritten lesson plans. Irene was incensed that he would do this and rescued them. The shredded papers now rested in her living room. After her mother died, Irene stopped receiving birthday or holiday cards from her father, though she knew that he wrote to other people. Perhaps he feared contributing to her clutter, or perhaps out of frustration he'd lost interest in communicating with her, so different were they in their views of the world. We have often wondered whether cold and distant parenting may be a contributing factor in the development of hoarding. In several recent studies, people with hoarding problems recalled disconnected relationships with their parents, particularly their fathers.

In contrast, Irene was extremely close to her mother. Whenever she faced a crisis, she turned to her mother for advice and comfort. She came to value anything connected with her mother, especially after her death.

Irene's earliest memories were of a very happy childhood, filled with lots of children and activities. She walked to school with the neighborhood kids. They all gathered together after school and on weekends, and there was always someone around to play with. When she was in the second grade, however, her family moved to the suburbs. With only one other child in the new neighborhood, Irene felt isolated and alone. She rode the bus to school by herself and found the bus driver loud and menacing. He frequently yelled at the kids. She was frightened of him and avoided speaking to anyone on the bus. Her teacher seemed no better. Irene was so scared, she seldom spoke in class and began to dread going to school. ""I was scared all the time,"" she told me. ""It was horrible.""

Under these conditions, she began to devise strategies to manage her emotions. She recalled getting wrapped up in objects as a child. ""Things were fun, interesting, and different,"" she said. ""They were removed from emotional life—soothing. All my fears were gone."" She elaborated: ""Things were less complex than people, less moody. People either leave or hurt you."" Ironically, it was her things that eventually caused her husband to leave.

Fear still permeated Irene's life nearly fifty years later. During one of our sessions, she admitted, ""Every day, I wake up in fear,"" although she couldn't articulate exactly what she was afraid of. She coped with her fear by surrounding herself with things, just as she had as a child. One day she told me, ""You know, yesterday, without thinking about it, I sat down and built a little fortress around myself. It felt nice, comfortable."" She made a number of such comments during the time we worked together.

Around the age of seven or eight, Irene began ordering and arranging her possessions in peculiar ways. She arranged her books and papers so they were perpendicular and perfectly aligned with the edge of the desk. At first this compulsion was mild and did not interfere with her life. But over time the feeling got stronger, and she began to spend hours arranging and rearranging things. She had trouble getting her homework done, doing her chores, and even getting ready for school on time. If she was prevented from doing her arranging or interrupted in the middle, she felt uncomfortable and anxious. This was the first hint for Irene of problems related to possessions, and it is consistent with research finding symmetry obsessions and arranging compulsions in children who also have hoarding problems. Since symmetry, arranging, and hoarding all have to do with physical objects, the connection may suggest a deeper problem with how people interact with the physical world or separate themselves from it. Luckily for Irene, the symmetry obsessions and arranging compulsions eventually disappeared.

During those early school years, Irene began to gain weight and had struggled with her weight ever since. At one point in high school, her eating habits became rigid and unusual. In retrospect, she thought that she may have been anorexic at the time. Now she believed that her weight and hoarding were connected: ""My body and my house are kind of the same thing. I take things into them for solace."" We've had a number of other hoarding clients who believed that their weight problems were related to their hoarding, and in one study we found that people with hoarding problems had higher than average body mass indexes.

When Irene was nine years old, her grandparents moved in with the family. They were elderly immigrants from Europe, and their grooming habits were at odds with Irene's. They seldom bathed or used deodorant, and they seemed to Irene to leave an odor wherever they went. She would not sit in a chair that one of her grandparents had recently used; it disgusted her. Before long, she stopped sitting in any chair her grandparents had once occupied. Still, there was no cleaning compulsion, just a sense of disgust. In all likelihood, this was a precursor of her contamination fears.

Objects seemed to have a special significance for Irene as a child. Although she was not deprived, she had relatively few toys and cherished the ones she had. She recalled never taking a number of them out of the package, perhaps foreshadowing her tendency to value mere possession over use of an object. She remembered one treasure, a cylindrical paisley pocketbook with a mirror on top, that her parents threw away when she was about ten. By this time, they had become annoyed with the number of things she was saving and occasionally took matters into their own hands. Perhaps this shaped her response, years later, to a friend who agreed to help her clean up but was dismissed for throwing away a gum wrapper. Irene developed elaborate strategies to foil those who insisted that she get rid of her stuff. When her husband threw out her piles of newspapers, she sneaked them back into the house by using them to line the bottoms of boxes she brought in to help her organize.

Even losses that were not emotional were troubling, particularly the loss of a potential opportunity. I got a sense of this one day as we excavated in Irene's TV room. She came across a piece of paper with a telephone number written on it. Judging from its depth in the pile and the fact that it was yellowing, it had been there for quite some time, possibly years. Clearly, she had written it in haste on whatever she could find. As was the case for most of the information in the pile from which it came, she had not taken the time to identify it or put it in a phone or address book — it was just a number on a piece of paper. When she picked it up, she exclaimed, ""Oh, a phone number! I'll put it here on the pile where I can see it and deal with it later.""",hoarding,Might Need That Someday,True,1,False,t3_j6sdg

What did Obama's Treasury secretary, Geithner, do when discussing the EU's plan to tax financial transactions with leaders there? He argued strongly against it.

I hate this president, I hate the establishment and I hate both the parties. They're leading this country into a ditch economically, their neoliberal policies have caused the real economy to collapse and now they are putting the nail in the coffin. I can't even listen to him speak anymore. I thought I couldn't dislike another president more than Bush Jr.

I never had faith in Obama. However, given the fact that these horrible neoliberal economic policies caused this world wide collapse, given they've failed time and time again, going back decades, I figured that there is no way he would come into office and continue them with NO fundamental changes. Sure, like all good neoliberal, center right Democrats he would do his best to change as little as possible, but certainly strengthening these policies would be out of the question. They AREN'T sustainable and anyone with two working brain cells can see they will make this horrible situation worse. He had the public behind him, they had given his party as much power as they will ever have to put in place at least some small pieces that might turn into something in the future.

Amazingly he has STRENGTHENED these policies and surrounded himself with the very geniuses whose ideas caused this economic collapse. After all this, he wants to pretend like he's the adult in the room, he is the rational one.

All of this is illogical and immoral. People WILL be harmed, some will die, because of these policies. Damn him and the political establishment for what they have done.

I will say this though, as a radical myself, people are becoming aware of what this system is. I am not saying it will turn into anything I approve of. It might, but that is up to people like me to organize and educate people about these issues. There are no bumper stickers that can justify this and the typical capitalist rationale for these immoral policies will not work anymore for most working people.

The most important thing that I did that no one else did was figure out how to get money. 

If you don't have one already, open a Bank of America checking account. You will be able to take money out of any Barclays ATM (the largest bank there) for free (with a 1% for changing from pounds to dollars). A credit card will likely charge you 2-3%. Many other debit cards will charge you up to 5$ per withdrawal+any fee the ATM charges.  

Also, your debit card may come with a 6 digit PIN. Use a BofA ATM to change that to a 4 digit PIN that does not start with a zero. Some European ATMs will not take longer PINs or PINs that start with zero. If you are only there for a semester, you will not be able to open a bank account in London, so don't try that.

Your BofA card will also allows free withdrawls from several other banks in Europe, which is useful if you travel on the continent. However, it is only free for the bank in the specified country (for instance, you will see Barclays ATMs in other countries, but you only get free withdrawals from the Barclays ATMs in the UK.) 

A lot of my friends didn't check this stuff and ended up pay hundreds in ATM fees or were stuck without access to money for the first few weeks (having an ATM card with a PIN that didn't work or trying several banks before realizing they weren't able to open an account at all).

Also, don't put off all your essays until the last two weeks like I did. I managed surprisingly good grades but wrote 60 pages of essays in the last 2 weeks I was there, so it was not the best ending. ",AskReddit,,True,1,False,t3_j6pd8

The EU's expansion of the character is kind of...weird. Inconsistent, I believe would be the more accurate term. Logically I put Zahn's work above anyone else's for canonical reference and character development, but even his stuff is becoming less and less antagonistic.

You can agree with him and sympathize and respect what he does, but at the end of the day, you shouldn't be thinking that he's not the antagonist. That's what's been happening recently. No stretch of the imagination could have made him out to be the villain in Choices of One- it was just  designed that way. Though I suppose the argument against that point of view is that Pellaeon was right there beside him and was definitely not an antagonist until other authors got hold of him, then got pushed back to good guy status from the Duology on.

A good portion of the US deficit is due to lowered tax receipts due to the recession.  Its a spiral...recession = lower tax receipts = larger deficit.  Its an automatic fiscal stabilizer.

Besides, there is no solvency issue for a currency issuer that issues a non convertible currency.  The US literally can not go bankrupt, so the deficit is only a pseudo-problem sometimes.  Deficits are only a problem if they are large when the economy is running well and near full employment, as that can lead to inflation.  But in a shitty balance sheet recession like we're currently in, the deficit needs to be large enough to sustain demand.  Cutting back shrinks GDP.

Overall, I would say Germany made the decision because there is a strong environmental movement in Germany. Germany has already started building wind farms and is big on solar technology both because they are a technological and industrial powerhouse. Germany already had a law on the books to phase out nuclear energy until the lifespans of the nuclear reactors were lengthened by the current government. The lengthening of reactor lifespans was highly controversial here with a huge segment of the population being unhappy about it. When Fukushima happened, the government made an about-face on their plans. Since the reactor life extension was already unpopular the government figured it could try to save face.

There are ideas that are becoming dogmatic as an online community, but atheists only have to hit the criteria of not believing in God to be one, I know so many atheists with so differing views here in the UK.

&gt; It's the same principle as helping third world countries; we're forcing life in non-life sustaining habitats.

What is the criteria for a habitat to be life sustaining? Availability of food? Europe has had many famines -- Ireland would be a good example. The climate? I'd say the greater part of the first world would be uninhabitable during the winter if it weren't for heating. Education? Some pre-colombian civilizations were amazingly advanced even by European standards back then.

I'm not familiar with the history of all third world countries, but the few I know are in this state due to ransacking of their natural resources and disregard for their culture by the imperialist countries that once dominated them.

So yes, I think that stray animals and underdeveloped countries are alike.

I cited it in my argument.  It was Foucault's position.  I used it in my thesis argument.

&gt;First, just because Foucault said it, doesn't mean it's true. 

If that's the best you can do in counter-arguing his oeuvre of work, then we're not going to get very far with any meaningful discussion.

&gt;The man essentially wrote the same book four times in a row: Society has moved from using sovereign power to using disciplinary power to reify various modes of thought, and thereby strengthen normatizing constructs by enforcing the Otherness of some sub-population.

Glibly put, but I have yet to read how your case refutes this basic premise.  

&gt;There's History of Sexuality, Discipline and Punish, and Madness and Civilization  in a nutshell. He's almost as bad as Szasz (somebody else I would have expected to be brought up in this conversation), and his books are fun to read, but hardly novel in the grand scheme of things.

That one's work is novel is not indicative of whether it is a most authoritative scholarship.

&gt;It's fine to summarize the salient points-- it would be unreasonable to expect a full treatment on some random forum-- but then to drop the argument halfway through and disavow any burden is disingenuous.

Wow.  You really are holding onto this.  So be it.  There was no disavowal to speak of.  Proper attribution was presented for our argument.

&gt;Similarly, other cultures may have participants perform actions we would associate with homosexuality that are actually expressions of non-sexual power structures, and therefore can't be used in support of Foucault's hypothesis. 

I'm curious. What are these other cultures? In what ways were they implicated by the Age of Enlightenment, by the Industrial Revolution, or by economic liberalism?

Foucault's argument, unless I have always parsed it wrong when reading, is that sexuality is integral to humanity, to culture, and to social orders.  It's just that the social orders we broadly affirm (that is, in how our cultures are ordered in the contemporary context) are informed by a chain of social constructs built upon foundations of authority — even when that authority, held up to today's knowledge base, would implode forthwith.   If anything, his argument holds better when allowing for a far wider casting of the net to include cultures outside a European-American context.

&gt;The argument doesn't even touch on the consideration that acculturation could supercede innate tendencies. 

Actually, you're right.  That wasn't within the scope of the discussion I was having with TheRaven7.  But if you are to allow that acculturation — that of adapting to a new culture — could supersede innate tendencies, then you must also allow that a first culture (and the social order intertwined with it) could supersede innate tendencies.  If so, then we return to the social constructs of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" (as well as bisexuality, pansexuality, and so on) as systems of meaning and order within which we allow ourselves to express that which is innate.  This is one reason so many people run into being unsure whether they're ""gay"" or ""straight"", when it's that they're probably some amalgamation thereto.  But so long as our social systems of order devalue one construct — in this case, bisexuality — and privilege others in the same stroke, then you will have people struggling to wedge themselves into social constructs into which they aren't innately predisposed.",lgbt,,True,1,False,t3_j6547

And don't forget the crappy sequels!

The Second Crusade started when several Catholic counties (like Edessa) fell to the Muslim Turks. Several European leaders brought massive armies to help but were defeated by the Turks in Anatolia (now Turkey) and ultimately were defeated when trying to assault Damascus. 

Jerusalem fell some time after the Second Crusade to the Fatmid (Egyptian) dynasty under Saladin, which instigated the Third Crusade. Notable members of the Third Crusade include Richard the Lionheart, Prince Phillip II of France, and Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's army turned back after Frederick drowned in a river and both Phillip II and Richard were defeated by Saladin, unable to reclaim Jerusalem (but they still kept a sizable portion of the Holy Land under Catholic control like Edessa and Acre). 

Then there was the Fourth Crusade, the first true sign of the corruption of a noble effort. French knights traveled to Venice where they asked Doge Enrico to ship them to the Holy Land. Unfortunately, the French knights did not have enough money to buy the ships and mercenaries and thus Doge Enrico asked them to pay for it by attacking nearby Zara on the Dalmation Coast (what is now Croatia). The French complied and the Pope was outraged, excommunicating everyone involved. The French and Venetians then, unperturbed by the decree, set forth for the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. After a long siege, the Venetians took the city and ushered in the era of Latin States, where the Byzantine Empire was near vanquished and several crusader states were formed in its former holdings in Greece. 

There were 4 or 5 more crusades afterwards of little significance and also some really strange ones like the Children's Crusade, where thousands of Children thought that they could travel and capture the Holy Land because of some divine power. As soon as they boarded ships, they were captured as slaves by the captain or lost.  ",explainlikeimfive,,True,17,False,t3_j6kyc

Revelan pacto 'Chapo'-DEA
Ofrecieron inmunidad y le daban 'pitazos' de operativos, asegura 'Vicentillo'
José Díaz Briseño / Corresponsal
Washington DC, Estados Unidos (2 agosto 2011).- 00:00 AM
Estados Unidos otorgó inmunidad a los líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa, Joaquín ""El Chapo Guzmán"" e Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a cambio de que éstos suministraran información sobre las bandas rivales, según testimonio escrito presentado por Vicente ""El Vicentillo"" Zambada ante una Corte federal de Illinois. 

Además la Administración para el Control de Drogas de Estados Unidos (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés) dio aviso en años pasados a los principales líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa de operativos policiales en su contra para que pudieran huir, afirmó Zambada Niebla. 

Como parte de una solicitud para desechar el proceso criminal que enfrenta ante la Corte Federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, el hijo de Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada afirmó que Washington dio inmunidad a los capos contra cualquier proceso criminal en EU.

""El Vicentillo"", quien está preso en Chicago luego de ser extraditado en 2010, afirma que el acuerdo se concretó antes de 2004 a través de Humberto Loya-Castro, abogado del Cártel e informante de EU, y que le fue refrendado personalmente por agentes estadounidenses en una reunión en 2009. 

""En algún momento anterior a 2004, y siguiendo a lo largo del periodo cubierto por esta acusación, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos entró a un acuerdo con Loya y el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa, incluidos 'El Mayo' y 'El Chapo'"", asegura el testimonio presentado el pasado viernes por la defensa.

""Bajo el acuerdo, el Cártel de Sinaloa, a través de Loya, iba a proveer al Gobierno de Estados Unidos información acopiada por 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros, contra organizaciones rivales de tráfico de drogas mexicanas"", agrega.

Informante desde 1998 para la Administración para el Control de Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés), Loya Castro fue descrito por la defensa como un confidente de los líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa y a quien, cumpliendo el acuerdo, se le habría desechado un proceso criminal que enfrentó en 2008 en California. 

""Como reciprocidad, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos acordó: desechar el proceso del caso pendiente contra Loya, no interferir con sus actividades tráfico de drogas (de Loya) ni aquellas del Cártel de Sinaloa, a no procesar activamente a (Loya), ni al 'El Chapo', ni al 'El Mayo' ni el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa y a no arrestarlos"", agrega. 

Vicente Zambada Niebla, quien tiene mañana miércoles una cita ante la Corte, aseguró que la inmunidad le fue ratificada personalmente por agentes de la DEA durante una reunión en el hotel Sheraton del DF en marzo de 2009, horas antes de ser arrestado por el Gobierno de México. 

Las reuniones con la DEA

Según un testimonio escrito (moción) presentado ante la Corte federal, ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que agentes de la DEA le reiteraron verbalmente dicha inmunidad en una reunión en un hotel del Distrito Federal horas antes de ser arrestado por el Ejército mexicano y la PGR la madrugada del 18 de marzo de 2009. 

""Siguiendo el acuerdo (con EU), Loya acordó que el señor Zambada Niebla se encontrara con agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos en el hotel Sheraton de la Ciudad de México en marzo de 2009"", agrega la defensa en otra moción que asegura que contaba con la venia de agentes de EU.

""Ésta (reunión tenía) el fin de presentar al señor Zambada Niebla a los agentes y con el propósito de continuar proveyendo personalmente de información a la DEA y al Gobierno de Estados Unidos y ya no a través de Loya"", agrega la moción de la defensa que describe la reunión en el DF. 

De acuerdo con los documentos, Zambada acudió a dicha reunión bajo gran riesgo físico para él y en ella estuvieron presentes un supuesto agente de la DEA de nombre ""Manny"" -con el que Loya trabajaba- así como otro agente llamado ""David"" quienes le confirmaron el acuerdo de inmunidad. 

""En la reunión (del Sheraton) quedó claro que el acuerdo existente con Estados Unidos -que cubría a Loya y el acusado y por el que el acusado estaba bajo inmunidad de sus acciones- estaba vigente y continuaría"", agrega la defensa encabezada por los abogados George Santangelo y Ed Panzer. 

""Al acusado le fue dicho específicamente que recibiría inmunidad no sólo a partir del acuerdo anterior con Loya, sino por un acuerdo con él personalmente y aprobado a los más altos niveles del Gobierno (de EU)"", agrega la defensa, asegurando que los agentes agradecieron a Zambada Niebla por datos.

""Al señor Zambada Niebla se le dijo (en la reunión) que una acusación basada en Washington, DC, sería desechada y que estaría inmune de cualquier proceso"", asegura otra moción de la defensa, recordando que ""El Vicentillo"" tenía ya una acusación previa a la que afronta actualmente.

""Hubo evidencia que en el hotel, el señor Zambada Niebla aceptó el acuerdo y que de ahí en adelante el señor Zambada Niebla proveería de más datos sobre cárteles de droga rivales. Al señor Zambada Niebla le fue dicho por los agentes del Gobierno que estaban satisfechos con la información que les proveería y que haría arreglos para volverlo a ver"", añade.

Dentro de los documentos presentados por la defensa, Zambada Niebla asegura que hay muchos antecedentes de que la DEA se basa en acuerdos de colaboración con informantes dentro del narcotráfico para datos de criminales por lo que el caso del Cártel de Sinaloa no sería la excepción. 

Los 'pitazos'

Ante la Corte federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, la defensa de ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que tiene pruebas que la DEA tuvo comunicación indirecta con Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada y con Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán como muestra de que EU le otorgó inmunidad el liderazgo del Cártel. 

De acuerdo con la moción legal de ""El Vicentillo"", la DEA informó a ""El Chapo"" y ""El Mayo"" de operativos en su contra a través del abogado Humberto Loya Castro.

""La defensa tiene evidencia que de tiempo en tiempo, el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa fue informado por agentes de la DEA, a través de Loya, si agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y/o autoridades mexicanas realizaban investigaciones cerca de los territorios que son hogar de los líderes del Cártel"", apunta el documento sin citar casos.

""(Esto) para que los líderes del Cártel tomaran acciones apropiadas para evadir a los investigadores aún cuando el Gobierno de Estados Unidos mantenía acusaciones, solicitudes de extradición y recompensas por la aprehensión de 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros supuestos líderes así como por el señor Zambada Niebla"", añade el documento.

De acuerdo con el documento presentado por la defensa ante la Corte, tanto los miembros del Cártel como la DEA sabían que el abogado Loya Castro servía como correo entre ellos y que la propia agencia de EU -junto a otras- lo habían vuelto informante desde 1998.

Piden retomar 'Rápido y Furioso'

La defensa de Vicente ""El Vicentillo"" Zambada pidió a una Corte federal considerar incluir datos del operativo ""Rápido y Furioso"" -por el que Estados Unidos habría permitido el tráfico vigilado de armas a México- como pruebas de que EU mantenía un pacto de inmunidad con el Cártel de Sinaloa.

""Las solicitudes de Zambada Niebla están enfocadas en obtener información gubernamental para determinar si líderes y/o miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa estuvieron entre los individuos que recibieron armas (de Rápido y Furioso)"", asegura la solicitud incluir datos del operativo como prueba.

The Byzantines were asking for help from the rest of Europe.  But even though it was all over by the time word got to the rest of Europe, The Church was like, ""Yeah let's do this anyway.  And while we're at it, let's take back the Holy Land.  You know, for God, bro.""  Europeans during that time had originally referenced it as 'pilgrimage'.

Arabs had been living in the Holy Land for quite a long time, and when the first European pilgrims arrived, the Muslims were pretty much like, ""WTF!  Get out of my home, dude.""

So pilgrims/crusaders invaded, and Muslims defended.  Eventually the Muslims realized that there was money to be made, so there were settlements and trade that developed over time with the Christians.  There was still a lot of conflict in the Holy Land, and this eventually sparked an anti-Muslim movement within Europe later (specifically al-Andalus or what we know as modern day Spain).

If I remember correctly from my crusades class in college, part of the propaganda of pilgrimage was to promote the idea of permanently absolution; thus, any sin committed thereafter 'doesn't count'.  This was how it was advertised at the time by the church.  If you embarked on pilgrimage, you got a 'Get Out of Hell Free' card.  The understood *sin*cycle was/is:

1. Sin
1. Confession
1. Repentance
1. Absolution
1. Repeat Step 1

So if you were a pilgrim, your status would be frozen at step 4: profit.

These numbers are without context and do not account for the fact that there were two Polish armies under Red Army control who also participated in rapes.

- For very knotty and dried hair, use clothes softner on it,

- One spoon of vinegar on egg whites and sugar will make your merangues fucking fantastic

- Sun burn? Corn-starch on it.

- Good remedy for thrust: cover a tampoon on natural yoghurt and shove it up there. Alternative: wrap a garlic clove on some cloth and put it there too. Please just don't let it fucking rot, change yoghurt and garlic every few hours.

- For urinary infections, drink cherry tea

- To lower the fever on a baby or kid, compress orange flowers on their wrists and forehead. If nothing else it helps them sleep :)

- To tighten your skin before a party or event, use a brush to cover it with egg whites for half an hour.

- For tooth ache make, chew cloves or make a little compress with clove essence.

- If you burn yourself (lightly, not talking about a fucking house fire here) wrap it on tin foil to cool it down. You can also peel potatos and make a paste to cover it, but I suspect this would work with anything that is cold :p

- For insect bites, cut an onion in half and rub it in the bite.

- If someone is freaking the fuck out give them some oil of passion fruit, passion fruit juice or something with real passion fruit in it. Water with sugar also helps.

- Food to help constipation: coffee, olive oil, papaya seeds, oranges, banana, dark raw vegetables, prums, popcorn. Green leaves normally help as well (i.e. camomile)

- Food to help diahorrea: apple, potatoes, vegetable coal (You can get these in pill form), black tea, corn startch, rice, pasta, plain chicken breast.

- Knife or spoon on a bruise to stop a bump from forming

- To stop a baby from hiccuping put a wet cotton ball on his forehead. Works better with very young babies

- A few drops of mother's milk can help conjutivaties on babies

- Cook everything in iron cast pans or with a little sack of nails to help anemia (But once cooked make sure you transfer the food to a clean container)

- For sore throats soak a cloth on warm water and alcohool and wrap it around your neck (I don't think you can even buy that in Europe or the U.S but it really helps). And of course be very careful to ensure you're not suffocating, burning the skin or asfixyating someone by doing this.

- Another one for insect bites and itches: dilute one spoon of vinegar on three of water and apply to it. Some people can be sensitive to vinegar so if it doesnt improve or itches more, wash it off.

Item build isn't really important, because you end up going for Aegis/Shurelyas/Zongya's Hourglass etc. depending on your team comp and how hard you're getting aimed.

Your job during laning phase as a EU style support means no last hitting, keeping your bot lane warded in case of ganks. I try to keep Q up to help the lane partner with their last hits. Sona's Q is pretty good for the harass game; and Q power chord does a bit of damage. Running a full AP page helps with your early game harass. 

Mid game will see you using your E much more; the speed boost is really good for getting your team into position. In laning phase, it was most likely used to avoid ganks. Moreso, the slow on the power chord is pretty significant. You will find you will stay with your team members most of the time, unless you're warding important points.

Branching off from the EU style support, I find that Sona kinda fun to play. A recommended build would be Shurelyas, Hourglass, CD Boots, Aegis, Banshees/Randuins (depending on the enemy) and Rylais. Your damage won't be astounding, but you'll live long enough to make your auras worth it's while. Your AP is high enough for your pokes and heals to do damage. Rylais also works with your Power Chord, so the E power chord becomes great. This build also stems off two gp5s, so you can still get wards and stuff. 

I find that the money that could've gone into this build could've otherwise gone to the carries/tank items and let them do more damage.

""An Arabic op-ed entitled ""The Broder Dilemma and Inferiority Complex,"" written by the Muslim intellectual Khaled Montaser late last year, and translated below, portrays the Muslim world as suffering from just such an inferiority complex.

We Muslims have an inferiority complex and are terribly sensitive to the world, feeling that our Islamic religion needs constant, practically daily, confirmation by way of Europeans and Americans converting to Islam. What rapturous joy takes us when a European or American announces [their conversion to] Islam—proof that we are in a constant state of fear, alarm, and chronic anticipation for Western validation or American confirmation that our religion is ""okay."" We are hostages of this anticipation, as if our victory hinges on it—forgetting that true victory is for us to create or to accomplish something, such as those [civilizations] that these converts to our faith abandon.

And we pound our drums and blow our horns [in triumph] and drag the convert to our backwardness, so that he may stand with us at the back of the world's line of laziness, [in the Muslim world] wherein no new scientific inventions have appeared in the last 500 years. Sometimes those who convert relocate to our countries—only to get on a small boat and escape on the high seas back to their own countries.

The dilemma which we Muslims imbibed from one end of the earth to the other—by way of our sons, our intellectuals, our youth, our elders, our men and our women—regards the German writer Henryk Broder. We celebrated him through our media and Internet sites, saying that he had converted to Islam, because he said ""I have been saved from misguidance and have come to know the truth, returning to my natural state [fitriti, i.e., Islam]."" Our writers and intellectuals portrayed Broder's statement as a slap to Germany's face, since he was one of the most critical opponents of Islam, but now he had announced his repentance.

Then the truth was immediately revealed and the embarrassing predicament which we imbibed of our own free will: for Broder is not to blame; he merely wrote a sarcastic article—but we are a people incapable of comprehending sarcasm, since it requires a bit of thinking and intellectualizing. And we read with great speed and a hopeful eye, not an eye for truth or reality. Some of us are struck with blindness when we read things that go against our hopes.

We actually imagined that the man was speaking truthfully and sincerely! Thus we drank from the bitter cup of failure and shame, products of our chronic ignorance and contemptuous feelings of inferiority and detestability.

[Translator's note: many popular Arabic/Muslim websites—including Al-Islam Al-Youm (Islam Today) Al-Sharuk News, Al-Moheet—continue to gloat under headlines like ""Famous German embraces Islam after his long struggle against it.""]

How come the Buddhists don't hold the festivities we do for those who convert to their religion? And some of these converts are much more famous than Broder. Did you know that Richard Gere, Steven Seagal, Harrison Ford—among Hollywood's most famous actors—converted to Buddhism? What did the Buddhist countries of Asia do regarding these celebrities? What did the Buddhists in China and Japan do?

Did they dance and sing praise and march out in the streets, or did they accept these people's entrance into Buddhism as a mere matter of free conviction? When Tiger Woods, the most famous golf player and richest athlete in the world, discussed his acceptance of Buddhism, did China grant him citizenship, or did Japan pour its wealth on him? No, being self-confident, they treated him with equality, not servility.

It is sufficient for the Buddhists that these celebrities purchase their nations' electronic goods—without any beggary or enticements.""",Israel,כדור הארץ,True,2,False,t3_j6i7b

Third, how do classify the UK as a 'right wint' country? It is and has been pretty social democratic, shown by the social security safety net, NHS, minimum wage, unions still having prominence. Yes it's moved to the right since Thatcher but not nearly enough to be considered a 'right wing nation'.

Fourth, partisan alignment has been widely accepted to be diminishing in many theories. It does still exist but that is based on history. The differences in the UK are based on regions as much as income. The north, scotland and wales got royally screwed by the tories and won't forgive them. The south east is more strongly conservative.

I abhor this nonsense wheel sizing. 622 is a real measurement, in millimeters, of the bead seat diameter of modern road &amp; 29er wheels. It's called ISO sizing. 23 is the width in millimeters of the tire. A tube stretches, therefore it can fit multiple tire widths. 23 - 25mm tire. 25.4mm = 1"". 27 refers to the larger old road size tire, which again is not a real measurement. The ISO size of a 27"" tire is 630mm. Hence only 8mm different than the modern road ISO of 622. The tubes are interchangeable. When in doubt with wheel and tire sizes, ALWAYS refer to the ISO measurement as it's a real number. What's worse is that in Europe, 700c (ISO 622) wheels/tires are marketed (g'damn marketing ppl) as 28"", when in actuality, they're smaller (by 8mm) than 27"" wheels/tires. Makes no f'cking sense!

Also a spoiler warning below. The books are old, doubtful anyone doesn't know what has happened by now, but just in case. Spoilers. 

The pre-Duology inconsistency comes from everyone else latching onto the character as the only non-sith threat that the fandom would accept. Pop back into the Thrawn wookieepedia page, and check the Appearances list. There are more (Mentioned only) references than you can shake a stick at. And each one of those references had the referring character characterize him a little more, up to the point that Specter of the Past had to flat out say ""You really built him up waaaay too much""

The modern inconsistency probably comes from a combination of things. I am almost tempted to say it's Zahn rewriting the fall of Darth Vader, but more realistically. There's several parallels to what happened with Thrawn and his exile, and with Anakin and his fall to Vader. Of course it's nowhere near a perfect parallel, the most glaring fact being one's a Sith and the other's just a really smart militaryman. I'd need to do much more research before I'm willing to stamp it and say ""Yep, that's what he's doing"", but there's definitely a suspicious connection. 

As for the softening as a whole, I'm not really sure. I think we fans did want to see a sympathetic Thrawn, and we got that in Outbound Flight. But we also saw him do some pretty ruthless stuff in there, most notably the slaughtering of the Vagaari to overwhelm the Jedi, and murdering his own brother. Maybe the latter wasn't done maliciously, but he certainly had a hand in what happened to Thrass. I'd have to re-read the end of Outbound Flight to pick out quotes and passages to defend this position. But this ruthlessness just didn't seem to be there in Choices of One. 

I also can't tell if the author's got a bias for the character or not. I had thought there was when Outbound Flight was published, but there was enough ambiguity there that I could believe that Thrawn was still the villain in the whole thing, we just saw him from the sympathetic point of view of Car'das. If someone else had narrated it, we may have seen more of his flaws and less of his strengths. Though, Pellaeon's narration still showed Thrawn as cold and ruthless and they were solidly on the same side. If this is a favorite character, absolutely he'll start making it seem like he's more the misunderstood anti-hero than the villain. I can't speak for what LFL may or may not be doing, as I'm not privy to their plans and goals. 

I'm hoping to get some more insight when the 20th anniversary edition ships next month. The annotations should help shed some light. Really, it may be nothing more than characterization marching onwards through the EU, and Zahn deciding that with all of the other changes, he can modify Thrawn to be a little more human and a little less overwhelmingly evil. But on the other hand, it's also building up his logic and intelligence at the same time. The Thrawn trilogy only ended where it did because of missing information (Which ended up being directly provided to him in Tatooine Ghost by Leia herself, thus ruining the entire arc of the trilogy, but that's a rant for another thread). While the recent publications have made him more human, they've also made him frighteningly intelligent. The missteps he made in the original trilogy aren't showing anymore (Except in Side Trip, where he had to explain to the narrator that his plan fell flat on it's face the moment he landed; he was revising the original plan the entire time). Which makes me wonder if Zahn has plans to continue with the character arc and draw out his fall. That would be beautiful for us silly obsessive fans. ",StarWars,,True,1,False,t3_j6528

Monetary policy is not a good way of dealing with a lack of aggregate demand, especially not in the situation the US is in right now.

And there still wouldn't be a reason to loan to or invest in those whose demand is needed: small businesses and individual consumers.

Promoting exports would be worthwhile, but not through monetary policy. The US is far less dependent on foreign trade than most nations, and has a significantly negative trade balance. That means that domestic demand would suffer for the sake of exports, which is responsible for a far smaller portion of the economy.

As for a global competitive devaluation being a good thing... definitely not.

This does not mean that modern day Europeans are descended from King Tut though (especially since we have no evidence to indicate King Tut had any sons to carry on his genetic heritage).
