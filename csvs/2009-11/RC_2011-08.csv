I'm by no means an expert as I was in your position only a few years ago, but I'll have a go at trying to help.  [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e41q3/when_people_claim_insert_league_name_here_is_the/) is a good introduction to the different leagues in Europe.  The EPL seems to get a bit more coverage here in the States, so you'll have a good chance to see games if you go to a good sports bar.  See if there is a place nearby that is open for games, which is becoming more and more common in the States these days, and have a pint or two early on weekend mornings

As for choosing a team in the EPL, [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/j3pgd) is meant more as a joke, but it's not a bad place to start.  The best advice is to just start watching as many games as possible and you'll start to get a feel for the teams.  This isn't something you have to choose overnight.

I also really recommend getting involved with a nearby MLS team.  I'm assuming you're from the west coast, and there are some really great fan bases out your way.

The English league is definitely amongst the top leagues in the world (quite possibly the best, although different people with different criteria may feel otherwise). It's a good place to start, but give Spain, Italy and Germany a chance too - they're the other top leagues. There's plenty of good football in France, Holland and Brazil as well. Also, give the MLS a shot - there's nothing like going to matches. 

Bouncing around youtube will get you some good highlights, and there's plenty of clips here too. 101greatgoals.com is one of several good sites to get current highlights from. Footytube is another. MyP2P.eu is a decent place to find streams if you want to catch a game. Find a good sports bar near you where football fans congregate for matches, that's the best place to get into it.

Also, the Community Shield between Manchester United and Manchester City is next week (I believe) and that's a good game to start out with. It's *technically* a friendly game, but it's going to be competitive as hell - they're local rivals, title rivals (ask your Leeds-supporting friend for a quick debrief on this one) and both have very strong teams.

Those were minor things like putting troops into the Rhineland. 

&gt; Europe looked away because they didnt want another war, they couldnt handle another war. They kept hoping that Hitler would stop eventually, but the invasion of Poland and the treaty with the Russians was the last straw. Britain and France hoped that we would again join them in the fight, which is why they declared war.

First, The British and French had no idea about the treaty between Hitler and Stalin. That was not a factor. Second, they didn't declare war because they knew America would join. They wanted them to join but didn't *need* them at that moment. 

&gt; however FDR knew that we would eventually have to step in which is why he agreed to help GB and France because that would give us the ability to get our military rolling again.

They believe the government has a responsibly to participate in the managing of the economy, but not taking all of the control away from businesses.  They want to create this by being voted into the government.  Groups like this are very popular in Europe.

Democratic socialism is a type of economy and government.  The people who support it see no place at all for a marketplace, and think that it hurts people and is unnecessary. Democratic socialism would provide everyone with the things that they need to live; like medicine, food, a house, a job, transportation, vacations, and more.  The economy would be planned ahead of time.  They would figure out what people need and make a plan to get it for them.  The people who decide these things would be elected, and decisions about the economy would be decided by everyone.

In UPC codes (or any other bar code system) you don't need infinite options, you just need enough options so that there is at least one number available for any given product.  If your barcode was five digits long and represented 00000 to 99999, you would have 100,000 options.  If you needed more, adding one digit would bring you to 1,000,000 options.  Even though every possible UPC code isn't assigned, current standards go to about one trillion (1,000,000,000) total codes, which is sufficient for now.  In reality, the UPC code is the old standard, and more frequently you're actually seeing EAN (European Article Number, now called International Article Number).  EANs break a product into a manufacturer number and an item number, and provide 13 digits (with an extra two-to-five digits when needed, such as with periodicals), which provides an extremely large amount of flexibility.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code gets pretty detailed.

The error coding in a UPC/EAN bar code (which are the most common barcodes you see as a consumer, though there are plenty of others) is pretty basic.  At the end of the real data, there's one digit.  This digit is determined by a mathematical formula which uses the other numbers.  If any of the other numbers are wrong, the check digit will not match.  The software that reads the bar code will then know it hasn't read the barcode correctly.  This is corrected by just trying again, reading from another angle, or changing the distance.

While it's true that the US spends *on average* more per student than most countries, this is significantly skewed by the higher prevalence of private schools and uneven distribution of funds to higher income neighbourhoods.  A large majority of students are getting significantly less than the average amount spent per student.  My concern with K-12   education is not that the richest 50% are getting screwed -- they aren't.  It's that the bottom 50% are.

However, my concern within the context of this question is that of higher learning (although I would limit that to the trades and sciences, and exclude the liberal arts).  In that context, money is definitely the answer.

Starting at the base, poor kids can't afford school without loans, and poor kids typically lack the grades to qualify for many grants and scholarships while they may still possess the raw intelligence and ability to succeed once outside of their home environment.

Assuming the student eventually locates primary education funding and graduates, there's very little money available for basic research.  You know how many graduates there are out there either working minimum wage jobs or otherwise not making any significant use of their education?  Spending money on public science would be a vastly better use of government money than what it's currently being spent on.

As for corporate subsidies, I'm not claiming that Europe is doing a better job with its finances.  Their economy is also screwed.  I disagree that they are a drop in the bucket, but I don't have specific figures on hand.  that doesn't really change my point though, as I wasn't trying to point out the things that would be most beneficial to the deficit, but instead trying to point out the things that I thought should be cut most.

Not at all. I spent some time in Europe myself and it wasn't a pervasive concept for people there.

&gt;How do you see your peoples place in the war of independence?

Personally, we didn't play a large role. The Potawatomi's of that time were mostly fled to Wisconsin and other places far away from the action. If you mean Indians in a general sense, I think the people of that time were exploited by both sides, but hey, story of my life, right?

Religion has not done the world good:  Wars like the crusades, the 30 years war in Europe, the current War on Terror, the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Irish Troubles, and many others can cite religion as a primary cause or aggravating factor.  The opposition to the civil rights movement came from Baptist preachers and the KKK was organized around such churches.  In WWII the pope welcomed Hitler into Italy, and the Catholic French welcomed the Nazis into their country, as well.  The preachers in Rwanda helped to fuel the fire of hatred in that country, as well, leading to 800,000 dead.  Look at the correlation between faith and hatred of minorities, gays, and rational thought.  How many years of knowledge were lost in the massive book burnings ordered by the religious?

And the big one, you *can* be good without God.  Ask them if God reflects a moral law or creates it.  Ask her if she would obey the word of god if it contradicted what she knew to be right.

There's some pretty fucked up stuff up in there.  If she answered no before, or after you point out those passages, then you can ask her where she gets her morals when the bible contradicts her own.

These were originally owned by absentee urban aristocrats who hired professional managers to direct teams of slaves. Toward the end of the Roman empire, the simplification of society during the fall led the population to return to the countryside, and made slave labor much harder to obtain. The landowners responded by offering free citizens a portion of their latifundia in exchange for a labor obligation. Over time these farmers lost their independence to varying degrees and evolved into medieval peasants.

At the same time, the breakdown of central Roman authority permitted both local leaders and barbarian invaders to take over the latifundia system from the absentee landlords. Over time the latifundia evolved into the medieval manorial system with a local lord collecting the fruit of surplus labor from a land-bound peasantry.

The final piece of the puzzle arrived in the 8th century: the stirrup. The stirrup created a powerful social class of lance-toting knights on horseback that swept away the old land-owning aristocracy and created a military society of mutual obligations between mounted knights, funded by the manorial system, known as feudalism.

The European aristocracy arose in those areas that were original part of the Roman agricultural world - the latifundia that evolved into manors - and were later conquered by the mounted knight, the most effective military technology between the end of the Roman legion and the invention of firearms.

Inductive reasoning is when you have pieces of evidence, and you come up with ideas that explain the evidence. (""Sam is a boy, and likes football; Bob is a boy, and likes football; Joe is a boy, and likes football ... Maybe all boys like football."")

Deduction gets in trouble when you have ideas that you aren't *totally* sure of. If even *one* boy doesn't like football, then we can't say ""all boys like football"" any more, and so deduction can't tell us anything about Joe any more. You can't do deduction with ""Most boys like football"" or ""I think maybe Joe is a boy."" It has to be 100% sure.

Induction gets in trouble when you can't tell which of several ideas is the best explanation for the evidence. You can never be sure there's not some new evidence coming up that will completely break your idea. Europeans believed that all swans in the world are white ... until someone went to Australia and saw black swans.

Both deductive and inductive reasoning are parts of a bigger picture called *Bayesian reasoning*. This is a way to use math to talk about belief in ideas. It lets you figure out how much you should change your belief in an idea when you get new evidence.

China has the possibility to be the world's largest developed market, but I am skeptical, much like those that talked up Mexico (which makes similar per capita) in the 80's. The USA and EU is a large market with lower wealth disparity and a long history of development along with good rule of law and a decently fair chance for competition. The USA has six huge megatropolis, and the EU is largely urban. Although China is 50% urban, the wealth disparity is still huge, and those in urban areas as we both agree is still far.

The Serbs didn't like that and they started the war in Kosovo to ""clean"" it form the Kosovars. NATO intervened, and eventually Kosovo got their independence.""

I'm so sick of all this ethnic cleansing accusation garbage. Yes, there were war crimes, no there wasn't ethnic cleansing. To this day only 10,000 bodies have been found after years of searching. Serb, Roma and Albanian bodies, but mostly Albanian and probably KLA fighters. The KLA was classified a terrorist organization before 1999 and suddenly in 1999 were reclassified as freedom fighters. 

The vast majority of Albanians started fleeing Kosovo after the NATO bombing started because they were careless. Before you go on about precision bombs, keep in mind this was 12 years ago and they hit the Chinese embassy by mistake. On top of that ~500 Serbian people died as collateral damage with 2500 more being Seriously wounded. So of course, with the heaviest bombardment taking place in Kosovo, the Albanians fled fearing becoming collateral damage themsevles, and since they had a freindly place to flee, Albanian, it made perfect sense. 

Kosovo isn't independent. If it were, then I guess since I'm the majority ethnicity in my apartment I will form my own state of Redditovo just cause I can.

I think in may instances you are correct in thinking that we are heading to a society without religion but there are things reinforcing it in the modern world. For instance we are seeing a greater influx of those of the Muslim faith enter Europe and their belief structure is so intertwined with their culture and traditions I'm not actually sure it can be ""tamed"". The thing with Judo-Christian and Muslim faiths is that they are so un-shaking, unmoving to their core beliefs. Not considering the more moderate amongst them for the moment. Honour killings are still not uncommon in the UK and we seem to have a few every now and then which just seems insane within our society.

In a society like ours which has evolved over thousands of years with the influence of not only religion but its attached morality, that experience grafts its mortality to the population as a whole, so you need not be religious yourself to be affected by it. When I was young I believed in god ""passingly"" but I pretty much put that to bed as I entered my teens. I could not support or condone some of its mentality and to me at the time, even at that early age it seemed immoral.

I was raised in a pretty poor area but I had educated parents and I often looked for conversation with those much older than me rather than my own age, I'm not sure if that had any bearing on my changing belief's. But it is easy to note that most of my friends at the time and still now have a belief or duty to God (generally Christianity in my area) simply because it was how they where raised. When I ask someone if they believe in god and then why they believe in god I often get a look of confusion not so much at the question I feel but the realisation within themselves that they don't actually know either and for a fleeting moment are trying to work it out why they actually do. These are people that have had no real education in religion and have really just been told ""this is what you are and this is what you believe"". I live in a fairly uneducated region and many people just wont even think to ask ""why"", ""why do I believe that and why is it right?""

Americans are lacking compared to their European peers mainly because of laziness. European pros and Huk have all called out Americans for generally putting comfort and life over their career as progamers. While Europeans enjoy comfort and life as well, they definitely practice a lot harder than Americans.

It all comes down to the drive to improve. Players like Huk and Naniwa has it, while certain American players prefer to spend the day working out at the gym, hanging out with wife/gf, goof around on streams while playing with their pets, and maybe spend 2-3 hours laddering a bit if they are not already ""too exhausted."" If that doesn't work out, I guess the next best thing is to express anti-korean sentiment on a SoTG or ITG.

Let's also discuss how underperforming American pros tend to take ""credit"" for foreign victories. Whenever a Huk, qxc, or Naniwa wins for example, I am sure many of us scredditors have seen American ""pros"" saying stuff along the lines of ""Foreigners beating Koreans again! Let's keep this coming."" It's almost insulting because these pros I've mentioned above have taken upon themselves to dedicate their lives to improve in the game, whether that be in the forms of training in Korea or investing 12+ hours a day working on builds. Meanwhile we have our shit pros riding the foreign pride train having done nothing for the entire day besides working out and watching Harry Potter in the theater after a dinner date with their girlfriend. Good American/Foreign pros put in the sacrifices to win and improve and it's terrible how some of our players are adding trophies to their ego cabinet while having done nothing but complain about Korean invitationals, poor infrastructure, and how hardworking Korean training environments are ""inhumane"" because they can't enjoy the 20 hours of free time they usually get to relax and fool around everyday.

I am so glad MLG doesn't listen to the QQing of our lazy pros. Without Koreans and some of our Europeans, we'd just see a bunch of half-casual egotistic American ""pros"" playing sloppy games with outdated strategies.

Being American myself, it sucks to have to shit on my own countrymen like this, but I always root for the harder worker and right now I root for guys like Huk, Naniwa, Boxer and MMA.

Very often when talking about Native American's (or whatever the current PC term is), they are lumped into one big group. This always bothered me, as I feel that doesn't reflect my understanding that different tribes have complicated histories with each other, that sometimes was pretty violent.

I wondered if you as a Potawatomi, sort of feel that european colonization somehow overrides this - say your tribes history with the iroquois for example - since now the different tribes have much more common goals of preserving their culture.

(To a 5-year old).  Many people in America are Christian, and that makes them feel friendly to people who are Jewish, because the Christian god whose name is Jesus--he was a Jew. 

Jews have lived here in the United States before we were our own country--some people think that Jews came to America with Christopher Columbus! 

While there have a been a few people here who didn't like Jewish people (the KKK), in Europe and Russia, things were much, much worse.  In Europe they were blamed for killing Jesus.  If something in the neighborhood went wrong, it was easy for their neighbors to blame the Jews and go attack them.  The kings didn't care or protect them--sometimes the kings helped do the attacking.  

The Jews were only allowed to have a few jobs, couldn't practice their religion, had to wear funny clothes, and had to live separately from Christian people.  Sometimes their children were taken away from them so they would be raised as Christians. 

During the 1700s, a period called the Enlightenment happened.  Instead of just believing what other people told them, some people began to wonder---""Hey, I've always been told that the Jews are bad people and they should say apart from us, but they're actually normal people.  We should all get along!"" 

Soon the Jews in western Europe (England, France and Germany) were allowed to move into town and live next to Christians.  Everyone could see that they were all people!  

Now, we're in the late 1800s.  In the Middle East, there was a big Empire called the Ottoman Empire (it was run by the Turks).  The Empire was breaking up and there was a power vaccuum so Britain and America thought--hmm, Jews are still being persecuted in eastern Europe and Russia--if we made a nation for them right there they would be loyal to us.  Very handy!  It would also get the Jews away from the countries who are being mean to them.

(lots of history and stuff I don't know well here...people for and against a Jewish state in Palestine, etc)

The Holocaust happens....Hitler once again trades on the fact that Jews are convenient scapegoats for everything that goes wrong (as they have been for most of European history).  Most people in America were aware that Jews were being rounded up into labor camps but had no concept about the mass crematoriums. (We didn't know for sure about the poison gas until 1944)

Most people didn't have TVs in their homes in the 40s, so they got their news by going to the movies.  Before the movie started, a newsreel would show you the week's events.  Here are some of the movies people saw of the footage our troops took as they liberated the concentration camps.
[Auschwitz adults](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?MediaId=178) 

[Kids that were experimented on](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?ModuleId=10005131&amp;MediaId=174)

I've talked to some of my neighbors and asked their reactions about seeing those movie clips.   They said it was something that would never leave you.  

A large part of establishing Israel was seeing that the Jews needed a country where they could be free to practice their own religion, just as we have religious freedom in America. Alaska and Madagascar weree actually considered as Jewish homelands, Israel just got lucky because the Middle East still needed a democratic ally to stabilize the area.


So to sum up: 
1. America always feels like people should have freedom of religion and democracy is good.

Some Ryanair tickets are as low as 5€, Porto-Madrid e.g. Granted, the Ryanair flights to Paris don't fly from Paris, but a smaller airport a bit further away. But the whole Eurorail deal is hyped up to americans, us europeans don't really use those things. Fly, you can save shitloads. If you're flying in eastern Europe, use Wizzair.com. 

I recommend [momondo.com](http://www.momondo.com) for finding the cheapest tickets. Search results give you a whole calender of prices, and you can schedule based around the cheapest tickets days. 

And for fucks sake, don't expect to be treated like you're on a Concorde when you get to that Ryanair flight.

PvP is allowed in designated areas, and mobs are on. 

If I know someone is coming on for the first time, I try to be there to show them around and we offer sight seeing and amusements to make their first visit memorable. Usually another member joins us on at least a quick 'tour'. We have a town built around spawn that includes a Marina, lighthouse, swimming pool, doggie park, school, horticultural center, playground with a water slide, incinerator, pub with blazing fireplace &amp; jukebox, Music center, Cathedral, library, bakery, PvP arena, Player vs Mob facility, hospital with a psych unit and a padded room, post office, hotel, spa, bank, stores, houses, and a subway that loops around town.

We have everything landscaped and well lit. It looks attractive and gets people excited about playing on our server. 

The rules and expectations are detailed, and we only allow people over the age of 18 on. Exceptions are made for those who conduct themselves in an adult manner. ;) Animation like lava contributes to lag, so we ask members not to use it on the surface. Other than that, the rest of the server rules address conflict resolution and they stress the importance of keeping the server looking nice. 

The server is 8 months old and we have about 25 people on the white list, half don't come on anymore. One player didn't come back because we are not vanilla enough. We spawn items and blocks for public works projects. Often the server is empty or has just 2-3 people on at a time. On Saturdays, we have 5-7 on at a time. We offer a forum with a map that updates daily, which members really appreciate. It's a  community that is growing, slow but sure. They work together on each other's projects, joke around a lot, and sometimes we plan server events. Hang in there, I think it takes time and patience to build a community.

It's likely that the Mandarin phrases incorporated into English in a setting like Firefly would fall in that category and quite likely lose the dependency on tone.

E.g. a lot of Europeans and Americans will recognize ni hao and xie xie written without the pinyin accents, and even more will recognize it if spoken out, because we come across them a lot as the ""token Chinese"" in movies etc.. But we're likely to butcher the pronunciation of them if we are to use them ourselves, because we don't deal with enough Mandarin to often come across words that can be confused with the individual parts of the terms.

From my very limited view/opinion on the matter the reason there is no potential (yet) to be progamers in America. The reason being is most of us, yes even those of us in our early 20s have to support ourselves. The lack of sponsorship is a HUGE determining factor. Look at professional sports, it is no different in terms of preparation. But the preparation is backed by very wealthy sponsors. America simply does not have this level of sponsorship for progaming yet. Or at least I have yet to see it. 

I would really hope that some level of sponsorship or networking can be achieved through press about the After Hours Gaming League but alas this is pretty lofty.

Think about it this way: The only reason you're feeling bad is because your family and most of the people you know (i guess) really believes in christianity and thinks that everybody who doesn't has some problems.

If you instead take a look in europe, you see that being an atheist is much more common. You aren't an outcast going to end up in hell just because you think different from everybody else. You are actually one of A LOT of people who believes in something else, something that can be proven and isn't a flying plastic figure (you understand what I mean).

**Pros**

- 2 extra clickable programmable buttons on side.

- 2 programmable buttons that act more like a lever on the side, so you slide your thumb forwards or backwards to activate them rather than pressing anything.

- Dedicated triple click button between L and R.

- 5x 4.5g weights.

- 'Gaming' and 'standard' mode for quickly changing button programming by 'clicking' the lever, mode indicated by red LED.

- programmable functions DPI between 400 – 3200dpi. Blue LEDs indicate sensitivity, in various patterns.

- Contains software for composing macros that can be assigned to buttons, that actually get saved on the mouse itself and is completely encapsulate away from the computer itself. Good for portability. Macros can contain clicks, keyboard presses, mouse movements and other such things. EG: for L4D2 I hold a side button to switch to molotovs/pipe bombs, and releasing the button switches straight back to the last used weapon. Same for pills.

No. That's another article (Article 15 of the Media Act). This is in the main article about the protection of sources in the ""Media Constitution"".

&gt;As i know, the protection of investigative journalism was added in, there was no such thing previously.

The Media Constitution does add a new provision explicitly mentioning the journalist's right to protect his sources, but then in the same article, it creates the big loophole I described above. Basically, they gave something very nice-sounding with one hand, and implicitly took it away again in the same law with the other hand. 

As often with these laws, I genuinely don't know whether that was deviousness, or just imcompetence. 

I mean, in general, the centralization of the entire media regulation system in the hands of one authority (the NMHH, with the Media Council as part of it), and more specifically one person (Annamaria Szalai, who is both President of the NMHH and Chairman of the Media Council) is obviously deliberate. That is what the UN representative on freedom of expression called ""a mindset of control"". 

For random example, look at the new public broadcasting system. The four public service media bodies (public TV, radio, Duna TV and the national news agency) were centralized in one foundation, which is overseen by a Board of Trustees appointed by Parliament. Not ideal, but not all that outrageous. In the meantime, however, all their assets, 90% of their staff, as well as the tasks of producing and purchasing programmes were taken away from them and given to a new centralized media fund, the MTVA. And this fund is directly controlled by Annamaria Szalai. She appoints its director, and can recall him too, and determines his salary. His work is managed by the Media Council, chaired by Szalai. Moreover, Szalai also appoints his deputy-directors. And in addition, she appoints both the chaiman and all the members of the supervisory board of this new media fund. Basically, she gets to appoint every single person of any power in this new fund, personally, and this fund in turn will determine most everything that is done and broadcast by the public media.

That's not coincidence, that's planning. But with stuff like this protection of sources loophole, I honestly can't tell if it's malice or incompetence.

To be fair - and I only read that this weekend - parliament passed a new set of amendments (not the ones ordered by the European Commission, separate ones) on the last afternoon of their last session before summer recess; and one of those amendments explicitly specified that only courts and the police have the authority to oblige journalists to disclose their sources in those vaguely defined ""exceptionally justified cases"". So that's something - there are no longer any other unspecified ""authorities"" who can do so. 

On the other hand, the same set of amendments saw some significant deteriorations too. For example, any fines which the Media Council imposes can now be collected as taxes, regardless of whether there are still ongoing legal proceedings. And meanwhile, the police has [already started using](http://atlatszo.hu/2011/07/27/confidentality-of-sources-denied-by-hungarian-police/) the loophole about obliging journalists to reveal their sources to ""prevent crime"" in a blanket fashion, without feeling the need to argue that it is an ""exceptionally justified case"".",t1_c28qq3i,False,True,t1_c29ccoo,,0,almodozo

But most people in Europe weren't middle-class or workers. They were peasants or farmers, living in the countryside. They were usually more religious than people living in the cities, and so tended to be less interested in radical change. 

Also, armies tended to get their soldiers from the countryside, so rulers began to realize that their soldiers weren't interested in revolution. Those soldiers from the countryside saw people in cities as strange and not like them, and didn't have a problem using force against them.

When west european countries do it, its called efficiency, when Hungary does it, you call it democratic deficiency. The whole criticism is based on the assumption that Hungary is a post-communist country which doesn't even know what democracy is, and which is leaning into fascism. That is not true.

I recognize [this criticism](http://www.politics.hu/20110111/western-media-law-criticism-said-to-reflect-low-trust-of-cee-democracies/), but I don't think that the Hungarian government has much of an argument playing the ""victim card"" (they're picking on us, specifically!). Look at Italy and Berlusconi's grip on the government there. International organizations, NGO's, and the international media have been all over that too. The European Parliament adopted resolutions, journalist groups launched protests, everything. I don't see the double standard.

&gt;The practice of appointing media council leadership varies across europe. The practice that the media council is under government control is not unique in europe. As i remember its not the PM who appoints the members, but the parliament.

Parliament appoints the members of the Media Council, true. The thing is that, under the old system, with the Council's predecessor (the ORTT), each parliamentary party got to appoint its own candidate, so the body as a whole reflected the full parliamentary spectrum. That's not ideal either (you're still talking about political control), but it's better than one party appointing all members. Especially since the Media Council is much more powerful than the ORTT ever was. 

Theoretically speaking, even now each party gets to nominate a candidate, and they did. But then the governing party Fidesz did something unexpected: instead of just nominating one member like the other parties, or two because it's so much bigger, it nominated a full slate of candidates, for all Media Council posts. And Parliament, with its 2/3rd Fidesz majority, then proceeded to elect all those candidates, and none of the ones suggested by the opposition. 

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister appoints the Chairman of the Media Council. (Well, it's a little more complicated: he appoints the President of the new media authority NMHH - Annamaria Szalai - and with that, she also automatically became the nominee to be Chairman of the Media Council. Parliament had no say about her appointment to NMHH president, but did formally have to approve her appointment as Media Council Chairman. However, it doesn't have the right to nominate an alternative candidate, so, yeah.) 

Media regulatory bodies with all politically appointed members are not unique in Europe, as you say, though it's certainly not best practice, and a lot of those councils have considerably fewer powers than the NMHH and Media Council do. Having all those members exclusively appointed by the governmental majority party, however, is very rare. And it gets worse: each member of the Media Council as well as the Chair(wo)man was appointed for nine years. That is to say: the current two-third majority's choices are in place for over two parliamentary cycles, ensuring that Fidesz appointees will continue to control the media even if the party loses the next elections. There is no other EU country where members of a national media regulatory authority are appointed for such long terms.

&gt;As i read in the law, the fines are high, but not impossible. The maximum fine for a person is equal to about a media persons one months salary. Fines are high for TV stations, but the TV stations are the ones who are profiting nicely. The fines are still much lower than in west Europe, while the incomes are almost comparable.

Think about how many baseball players today toil in high schools, colleges, minor leagues, farm leagues, working out and constantly improving their skills, just for a slim shot at the majors.  Then look about at history and read about how the first National League teams were made up of guys who played after their factory shifts.

Players in the U.S. and Europe are still just successful amateurs.  This isn't meant as a knock to them - players like Idra have ton of talent and drive to succeed.  It's just that the economics of the scene isn't conducive to the intense, dedicated practice regimes common in Korea.  

How do pros make money in the West?  I don't know if anyone's done a serious study of this, but it would not suprise me if streaming is a big chunk of that.  Destiny said he makes $3k or so a month from streaming.  The quality of play will not increase to match Korea's if streaming is the primary source of income for Western players.  That's because streaming is mostly practiced on ladder, and to make it interesting you have to introduce 'drama' - play fun matches, play trolls like CombatEx and Deezer.  Practicing bunker rush 40 times in a row is just not very entertaining to watch.  

I sure hope the e-sports scene continues to grow in the West.  I think MLG is trying to increase the prize pool?  Great matches like Boxer-MMA will, I hope, increase fan interest in the e-sports scene and lead to bigger events, greater pool money, so that a truly professional Western teams will arise here.

Foreign players can help, I think.  Imagine an important pro Korean player coming over to the U.S. to set up a pro house.  Korean media can portray this as ""XXXX goes to conquer the U.S."" story.  Korean media is full of ""Star X goes to conquer U.S. pop!"" stories - this is extremely common for Korean rappers and musicians.

If Trotsky is our only hope then we're doomed. He was wrong about almost everything (e.g. permanent revolution, socialism in one country, the role and nature of the party). That is precisely why Trotskyites have never accomplished anything and never will. It's not just due to bad luck.

I'm glad that you admit your rejection of Leninism; most Trotskyites still try to deny that, despite the obvious differences between Lenin and Trotsky. By the way, Trotsky was certainly not above executing ""enemies of the State"" when he was in the Soviet government; he had quite a bit of blood on his own hands (e.g. Kronstadt). If anything, he may have been even *more* ruthless than Stalin (and Lenin). Read his [Terrorism and Communism](http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/index.htm) (originally titled *Dictatorship vs Democracy*) for Trotsky's views on dealing with class enemies. And read Isaac Deutscher's biographical *The Prophet Armed*, where Trotsky's exaltation of forced labor is discussed, and Trotsky is quoted (on p.495 in my copy) as saying:

&gt; Display untiring energy in your work, as if you were on the march for battle. A deserter from labor is as contemptible and despicable as a deserter from the battlefield. Severe punishment to both!...Begin and complete your work, wherever possible, to the sound of socialist hymns and songs. Your work is not slave labor but high service to the socialist fatherland.

Trotsky, obviously, was a bit of a nut. Notice that Trotsky says ""socialist fatherland."" In fact, he himself was not always clear on the impossibility of socialism in one country. See his pamphlet [Towards Capitalism or Towards Socialism?](http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/11/towards.htm) where he speaks of ""the fine musical notes of the harmonious growth of socialism"" and generally speaks favorably of the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country. In fact, Trotsky used that pamphlet in his defense when he was accused later of pessimism and defeatism during the big debate on this issue at the Fifteenth Party Conference in October 1926. Of course after his defeat he took a different stand.

Regardless, it is dogmatic to insist that socialism can't be built in one country; history itself has shown that it is possible. Socialism was indeed built in the USSR. People who say it isn't possible are being just as dogmatic (and wrong) as those who held to the idea that proletarian revolution must first break out in the advanced industrial capitalist countries in Western Europe. Marx and Engels thought that would be the case in the mid 1800s, but that was more of an expectation (based on the then-current circumstances) than a theoretical formulation. By the early 1900s things had changed, as Lenin showed that the development of imperialism had created ""weak links"" like Russia - backward and mostly peasant - where proletarian revolution could succeed. And history showed Lenin was right. He didn't just dogmatically say ""well, Russia is too backward so let's not even try."" That would have been silly, just as silly as those today who still insist that socialism can't be built in one country. Inter-imperialist contradictions open up that possibility, and that's basically why the Soviet Union was able to build socialism. Lenin, then Bukharin, then Stalin all came around to that conclusion *based on actual experience of what was developing at the time*, both domestically and internationally. That is genuine Marxism: taking actual developments into account instead of resting on dogmatic formulas. Trotskyites take the opposite approach of trying to fit facts to their theory! That is the rejection of a scientific approach. Marx himself admitted he was wrong about certain things after the *actual experience* of the Paris Commune.

Aircraft carriers are, ultimately, not necessary for defending ones own territory. EU forces can fly from any EU airbase - if all you want to do is defend the land you have, and you have lots of runways on that land, you don't really need aircraft carriers very much.

What we also have, is nukes, and lots of them. If you think Russia is just going to march into Ukraine or Poland then you are severely underestimating European solidarity against the ruskies.

People still very much remember the Great Depression, which was almost a hundred years ago.  People still remember that Herbert Hoover cut spending to create a balanced budget and apparently greatly prolonged and deepened the Depression - and he at least had the excuse that this had not happened before in US history.

And the United States of America survived that one.  But the stakes are a lot higher now.  If this does actually bring down the American Empire, people will remember these days for a lot longer than a century.

As for the Juno spacecraft, well, it depends on whether anything comes of it or not.  I'm a huge SF fan and have been for decades, but unfortunately a lot of other people don't see the use of a space program, and with the coming mega-austerity, I can't see anything like this happening again for a long time.  It might be that in a hundred years, this is a forgotten dead-end in history.  :'(

I remember the first space landing - I was just seven years old, it happened in the middle of the night in England where I was living at the time. My godmother slept in front of the TV, which rang an alarm, and we all crowded around it to see grainy black and white pictures of _men walking on the moon._  I believe it was the most amazing single thing that humans ever did.

At the time, everyone was predicting we'd have colonies in space by 2000.  The ISS, bless it!, is a little step in that direction but by no stretch of the imagination is it even partially self-sustaining, it costing the Earth over $1000 a minute per astronaut to keep it going.  We don't have re-usable space-craft, even, and we need a lot more than just a space station and reusable craft to set up a real colony.

Now, America _could_ do this - except Americans would much rather spend trillions on regime change in foreign countries.  Heck, they'd rather spend the money on the military than the education and health of their own kids, no wonder the space program is neglected.

Other countries or geographic organizations (i.e. the EU) _might_ do this - but it's becoming clear that the economics of space travel are daunting and if, as all the signs seem clear, we are headed into a prolonged global depression, there simply might not be the money and the will to do this.

How to help?

If you're in the US, join the Planetary Society.  Call your representatives and tell them that you are against the wars - particularly if you're an American.  I'm sorry to keep connecting the ongoing wars with the failure of the space program, but we can either challenge outer space, or our neighbors, but not both.

He's said that he wants to stay in Europe, and I believe that he would see an MLS move as a step down in class, even from Turkish D-2.

From my understanding, a short time after he was signed to Benfica, the manager was replaced, and the new manager just didn't like him very much.

So Adu went on loan. And at least a couple years when he had been on loan, the teams he was playing for made offers that Benfica refused.

But there seems no indication that Benfica will re-sign him. I don't know that I see a Bundesliga or Serie-A team taking the chance on him on a free transfer, though a second-league team or a team in France/Belgium/Netherlands might have a go.

I'd prefer for him that he gets regular playing time in a competitive top-level European league. I'd prefer for *me* that he comes back to MLS.

I feel like in 10 years or so, when his career is done, that there will be a very good story to tell. How old is he really? How good did he really look at such a young age and why? How good could he have been with proper handling? Where did it all go wrong?

There was a giant fight (like 50 teenagers going at it) a few blocks away a few months ago, just saw it from a distance, and last week there were some gang-bangers shooting at each other right in the middle of the street 6-7 blocks away, I was walking the dog on my lunch break, turned the corner and all these cop cars were pulling up, pissed of neighbors coming out, I missed it by like 5 minutes. So that sucks.

I respect your opinion, but that is hardly the opinion of the average academic historian. [Look at the aggregate rankings for a sample of scholarly surveys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_results); it's Wikipedia, but you can follow up on any of the surveys listed. Wilson is never ranked below 11 and has an aggregate ranking of 6. The only 20th century presidents he is behind are Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt.

As for why *I* like him, there are plenty of reasons. The broad, over-arching theme would be that he proved it was possible to get elected on a progressive, Democratic platform (I'm talking about 1916, not 1912, that was a special aberration in history) and in doing so moved the non-Southern portion of the Democratic Party away from the semi-radical pseudo-populism of William Jennings Bryan. His politics and policy formed the intellectual core which Franklin Roosevelt was able to turn into New Deal (""modern"") liberalism. 

As for specifics, I'll start with the 16th Amendment (in conjunction with the Revenue Act of 1913, especially since the 16th Amendment was proposed before Wilson was in office) and the Federal Reserve Act. These two acts brought the United States out of a financial dark age. They were not perfect immediately (see the Great Depression (though it is also important to notice Chairman Benjamin Strong's death just under a year before that crisis)), but they created the basis of a modern central government and greatly increased the financial flexibility of that government. 

Where this became very important was during WWI. The ability to provide credit to the Allied Nations was essential to those nation's eventual victory over Germany (also, his Food Administration (an interesting tidbit, it was run by Herbert Hoover) saved millions of Europeans from starving to death). It became even more important when you look at the eventual American involvement in that same war. The ability of the Government to raise revenue for war through income taxes and fund deficit spending through the Federal Reserve was crucial. I will also add that I believe WWI was a just war and was fought against a genuine Napoleonic-type threat of annexationism expansion. [See my lengthy post here for further details and explanation on that subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/elx71/because_im_tired_of_seeing_people_repeat_baseless/c1946pz). Lastly, Wilson's idea for a League of Nations was the inspiration for our modern United Nations and I believe the world would have been better off had the United States ratified the Treaty of Versailles (I do, however, blame Wilson for the failure of that treaty in the Senate). 

Moreover, during WWI, Wilson also moved the Democratic Party away from the position of being the party of strikebreaking and union busting (I'm making an exception for the IWW here and I will discuss that later). The last Democratic president before Wilson had been Grover Cleveland; he was president during two of the most notorious strike breakings in American labor history, the Pullman Strike and the Homestead Strike. In the former case, it was actually Cleveland who ordered regular army troops to fire on the strikers. Wilson changed this and formed something called the War Labor Board. He collaborated with Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor (my username's namesake), and leaders of American industry to promote unionism and collective bargaining as an alternative to industrial conflict and to maintain crucial war production. This was the biggest boon to the labor movement in it's history up to that point. Post war issues complicate the picture, especially during the Republican 1920's, but at the end of Wilson's administration, the labor movement had gained considerable ground

I'm going to conclude by just listing a few things like the Federal Trade Commission, Clayton Anti-Trust Act, and the Keating-Owen Act, all of which were the necessary first tries at true regulation of destructive business practices (a method of enforcing cease and desist orders against unfair trade practices; a stronger anti-trust and pro-collective bargaining bill; and an anti-child labor law, respectively) which were refined during the 1930's. 

I do also admit that Wilson had significant flaws. He was a white Southerner at a time when the Klan was seeing a major resurgence. He tolerated the discrimination and segregation that his Southern colleagues brought to the Executive branch. Worse was the Red Scare and the raise of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer under the Espionage and Sedition Acts. Palmer collaborated with the Gompers and the AFL to destroy things like the IWW (who, though I don't agree with them, suffered some of the more reprehensible oppression outside of blacks and native Americans). Lastly, he failed to make the peace process following WWI a bipartisan effort even though his party had lost control of both houses of congress following the 1918 midterm elections. This almost definitely caused the failure Treaty of Versailles in the Senate (along with Wilson's stubbornness). 

All of that said, however, I do not think those negatives overshadow the rest of his accomplishments (plenty of which I've either only mentioned in passing or omitted). Even the most successful administrations have had their black points in our enlightened hindsight. George Washington marched troops on the Whiskey Rebellion and killed a few citizens. John Adams had the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lincoln suspended Habeus Corpus. Every president between Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt had some hand in the Native American genocide and Roosevelt himself had some shady imperialistic dealings. Any discussion of FDR must mention the interment of the Japanese and Truman was initially crucified over Korea. Eisenhower had the Iranian coup. Kennedy had the Bay of Pigs. LBJ had fucking Vietnam. Nixon...was Nixon. Reagan had Iran-Contra. These are arguably most of the best presidents (the only one not on there is Jefferson and I would argue against Reagan). If you only judge a president by the worst aspect of their presidency, you fail to be a good and objective historian.",t1_c29c396,False,True,t1_c29evws,,0,Samuel_Gompers

But if you'll look into it, most of our societal problems stem from the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture 10,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherers ran around, lived in very natural, untrammeled settings, they traveled freely across continents, got plenty of fresh air and exercise, followed the natural patterns of animal migrations, and had healthy relationships with each other, their non-human neighbors, and the Earth.

Once agriculture kicked in, our species went through radical, cataclysmic changes. They lost their mobility, they had to spend hours of unpleasant labor in the fields, and mowed down hundreds of acres of forests. They collected livestock, which disrupted animal migrations, setting off tremendous ecological consequences. Predators such as wolves, deprived of their normal food source, began to eat the livestock, creating terribly antagonistic relationships between humans and other predators, with the result that, even today, some people are attempting to exterminate other predators such as wolves and bears, and consider them pests. And with agriculture, humans now needed to compete with insects and other herbivores, forcing them to drench all their crops in toxic chemicals.

Agriculture also led to overpopulation, because farmers would have lots of kids to help with the fieldwork, and then the kids would grow up, destroy more forest for farmland, and have more kids. This led to wars over land, as well as wars with other humans who were still sensible enough to remain hunter-gatherers. The farmers believed the hunters to be ""primitive"" and on a lower moral scale, while the hunters saw what the farmers were doing to themselves and the Earth, and railed against it. This is why the Native Americans put up such a big fight against the Europeans. And any modern scientist can tell you the Natives were right: Look at the track record. 14,000 years of North American sustainability, vs. just 500 years of post-European life and we're dirty, overpopulated, and on the verge of ecological nightmare.

Agriculture also led to industrialization. More humans to feed, plus new innovative ways to perform basic agricultural tasks faster and more effeciently, led to the so-called Industrial Revolution. Suddenly, for the first time in history, humans were growing at an unprescedented scale. They spread faster, released more toxic chemicals into the air and water than ever before, and brought industry into the residential sphere. Now we have massive farms covering pretty much entire states, like Iowa, feeding giant industrial mega-cities like New York. This has also led to the massive poverty we see today, because farmers feel that they ""own"" the food that they grow, and if somebody doesn't or can't collect money, they don't eat.

This is not sustainable. The topsoil is eroding, the world is getting dirtier and dirtier. Rivers which once cleaned and nourished the landscape are now toxic. The oceans are saturated with shit. The pristine forests of the pre-agricultral world are gone, we're growing faster than a blister in the sun and our collective actions are going to bring about massive changes in the near future.

Everything we do in our daily lives is a product of industrialization, which is a product of agriculture. Driving our cars on megahighways, sitting at computers in supercooled rooms during the summer, sleeping in big luxurious beds in massive sterile suburbs where animals and poor people are chased away. (Alligators, for example - they've been here for much longer than us. They dig deep holes which conserve water and protect aquatic life during dry season. But if they show up in a suburban area, everyone freaks out, and the city comes and takes the gator away. And many cities, such as Miami Beach and Hollywood, export their homeless people to other areas such as downtown.)

The cost of the industrial/suburban world is more than just environmental, however. People are unhappy. Many kids growing up in suburbs grow up isolated, obsessed with death and escape, and afraid of an uncertain economic future. Everybody knows that in order for our society to function smoothly, a good percentage of children have to fail. Shut up in their houses, they have nowhere to go - suburban sidewalks are often as deserted as ghost towns, with everbody hiding in their homes, luxuriating in air-conditioned rooms and computer screens, or afraid of pedophiles, boogiemen, and sunlight. Everybody wants to sit around, eating shitty industrial food, which leads to people being overweight, malnourished, and unhealthy - even in economically wealthy areas such as, say, Golden Beach.

Being overweight, malnourished, and unhealthy, and getting zero exercise outside of walking from the car to the classroom, especially in the heat, produces some pissed-off, insecure, maladapted humans with low self esteem. Kids trying to impress members of the opposite sex wind up depressed and foreveralone (ever wonder why that's such a big meme here?). Your nutrition and health also affects your mood; a well-exercised person is more likely to be in a good mood than a tired, lazy, bored person with no energy. A good chunk of so-called psychological diseases can be cured simply by good diet and exercise, and healthy relationships with other people, and getting out of the house every once in a while. Other psychological diseases, such as ADD, are simply the natural human condition reacting badly to unnatural settings such as classrooms and offices. We need to be outside. Just as we need to eat, drink, sleep, and shit, we need to run.

You can observe the same thing in puppies: A tired puppy, who has just run five miles, is a happy puppy. A puppy that's been shut inside all day will be restless, chew up all your shoes and furniture, and make a lot of noise. They may even fight with other puppies, just out of boredom, restlessness, and a lack of understanding of why they are unhappy.

Same with humans. Take two teenagers in a fistfight, make them each run five miles, and they're likely not to want to fight anymore. Same with adults, same with nations. The United States is fighting wars because the nation is bored and broke, and wants to make money. Since someone else is already handling the agricultural tasks - the only really important physical tasks in our whole society, the production of food - you have masses and masses of people with nothing to do, nothing to contribute, who also need to feed themselves. So: Dress them up in uniforms and have them kill each other.

The cause-and-effect between lazyness and war is very subtle, but it is there. Lazyness leads to bad health, which leads to unhappiness, and restlessness, which, on a seven-billion-people-wide scale, leads to massive quarreling. And, of course, it is industrialization which led to lazyness, and agriculture which led to that.

That is not to say that hunter-gatherers did not fight - some certainly did. But they were healthy, and their world was healthy. We are not. They ate plants and animals. We eat chemicals and pesticides. They grew up in groups, together with other members their own age. They took care of their elders, who were recognized for having the wisdom of age. We grow up in isolated nuclear family units, spread out across vast land that could be put to better use, and we throw our old people away.

To go back to my example about chimpanzees: Chimpanzees and bonobos are, biologically, two very similar monkeys, geographically separated by some river in the Congo (possibly the Zaire, I think). For many decades, scientists believed the two were one species, until about the 1970s, when it was discovered that they are two species. The main difference between chimps and bonobos is this: Chimps fight, and bonobos don't. Chimps are crazy motherfuckers. When two groups of chimps meet, they'll start beating and ripping the shit out of each other, usually killing several adults and babies in the process (and disproving my theory that war is caused by human lazyness). Bonobos, however, are known for being peaceful with one another. They don't kill each other, they're very sweet and tame, and they take care of their babies. A major difference is this: Bonobos fuck. They fuck each other like nymphs. When two groups of bonobos meet, everyone fucks everyone. Males on males, females on females, everyone. They just go for it, uninhibited, like a bunch of hippies. [(Source)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG84FuIjMqA)

You could argue that chimps are better, stronger, kill the weaker members, and as a result, are better suited for long-term Earth survival. But bonobos, like chimps, have flourished for thousands of years.

* While involvement in Kosovo turned out alright, and was for a nice enough cause, it was still a war of choice. It wasn't in our backyard. I understand we have NATO and other treaty commitments but I also think they need to be scrapped/revamped given that their reason to exist, the USSR, is long gone. This was a European issue that should have been handled exclusively by Europeans. I could still almost feel good about it, though.
* Liberating Kuwait was clearly motivated by our dependence on oil, especially from the Saudis, as we feared Saddam would keep going. We are so dependent upon oil that we can not lose even one major supply center. It is dangerous that we can not shift our resourcing around to make up for a temporary 10% - 20% shortfall. Also note that Saddam was a creature of our own creation, as a bulwark against revolutionary Iran, which was also a creature of our own creation.
* We are now involved in Libya under similar circumstances. In general, repressive regimes throughout the middle east have been able to stay in power by funding security forces with oil exports. It is to be expected that they will be unstable and prone to revolution and that because of our poor policies we will have to get involved.

Our issue with energy is not raw quantity so much as needing such a large proportion of it on-demand. For example, I think we're barking up the wrong tree trying to replace internal combustion engines with batteries and fuel cells. The internal combustion engine is actually incredibly well suited to cars. The problem is a deeper legacy of urban development left over from when car manufacturers dominated public policy similar to how bankers do so today. The real answer to dependency on gasoline is laying out cities closer to how they were in the 19th century, bicycles and walking. We could actually have redeveloped our major cities for the cost of our involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and the banker bailouts. Several trillion dollars is an incredible amount of wealth.

Similarly, we no longer construct housing oriented properly with the sun, with rooms in the correct places, and with proper basements. Instead, we rely upon refrigeration and air conditioning. I could go on with things like eating manufactured food instead of local, seasonal food. And irrigating grass lawns in the southwest.

We could replace most of our on-demand energy needs with passive policies and ""when available"" energy (e.g. we could wait for sunny or windy days to mill grain).

Schizophrenia (MGS2) project recruited 
an adult control sample of non-Hispanic 
European-ancestry (N=3,364) and African 
American (N=1,301) subjects.

&gt;**Method**: Subjects gave consent to deposit phenotypic data and blood samples 
into a repository for general research 
use, with full anonymization of the sample. The authors compared the control 
sample with population census data for 
demographic data and with previous 
population surveys for anthropometrics 
and prevalences of psychiatric disorders 
as estimated by an Internet-administered 
questionnaire.

&gt;**Results**: The full MGS2 control sample includes 4,665 subjects (European-ancestry: 
N=3,364; African American: N=1,301), of 
whom 3,626 were included in the MGS2 
genome-wide association study (GWAS). 
The sample is generally demographically representative of the U.S. population, except for being older and more 
female, educated, and affluent, although 
all strata are represented. Self-reported 
ancestry was consistent with genotypic 
and census data. Lifetime prevalences 
for depressive, anxiety, and substance 
use diagnoses were higher than in previous population-based surveys, probably 
due to use of an abbreviated self-report 
instrument. However, patterns such as 
sex ratios, comorbidity, and demographic 
associations were consistent with previous reports. DNA quality for the Internet 
collected/evaluated control sample was 
comparable to that of the face-to-face 
case sample.

&gt;**Conclusions**: The Internet-based methods facilitated the rapid collection of 
large and anonymized non-Hispanic 
European-ancestry and African American control samples that have been validated as being generally representative 
for many aspects of demography, ancestry, and morbidity. Utilization of clinical 
screening data shared with the scientific 
community may permit investigators 
to select appropriate controls for some 
studies.

Strong central government in countries like Mongolia is also impacted by the same problem.

I assumed it was common knowledge for people who have interest in mid-late 20th C Romanian politics. The fact the Romanian Govt. refused to recognise them as either a people or minority guaranteed them a status of one to be assimilated because nothing was offered them.
I suggest checking out Guy's ""Between past and future: the Roma of Central and Eastern Europe"" and Gheorge &amp; Miga's ""The Roma in the 21st Century.""

Essentially, the policies practiced in Romania (of compulsory education for gypsies, urbanisation, labour, children removed, etc) were an extension of Habsburg policies, largely practiced in Transilvania and lasting well into 20th C.

in Achim's The Roma in Romanian History, we read: ""From the year 1948, when Communism established itself fully in Romania, the Gypsies no longer appear in official documents of political nature…The motion of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party regarding the national problem from December 1948,which laid the foundations for the policy of the new regime with regard to the ethnic minorities, ignored the existence of the Gypsies. Consequently, the Gypsies were not represented as an ethnic group at the level of the Party and state administration; there were no institutions to promote their collective interests and to deal specifically with the problems of this minority, within the
limits of the totalitarian Communist State, of course. At the end of the
1960s, when a new form of representation for minorities was introduced, no national council of workers of Gypsy nationality was created, as was the case for the Hungarians, Germans and other minorities. For three decades, until the middle of the 1970s, the Communist regime did not pay any attention to the fate of this population as a whole, and there was no special policy dedicated to the Gypsies. On the part of the authorities there was an attempt to conjure away the serious problems faced by this population.""
""The social transformation that took place in Romania during the years of Communism also affected the Gypsies. The nationalisation of the economy, the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, the transformation of the village as a result of the collectivisation of agriculture, the policy of social “homogenisation”, the transformations affecting the rural and particularly the urban environment, the occupational changes that took place—all of these naturally could not fail to affect the Gypsies. Citizens of Gypsy origin experienced both the positive and negative effects of these transformations. As a part of the country’s population, the Gypsies felt the effects of the benefits and disasters brought by the new order.""

I'd love to cite specific policies, but since the Gypsies were not considered people, and former communist governmental records are notoriously difficult to come by, I cannot.

The latter I would agree with you on to a certain extent, although Hong Kong in the 90's did much the same with stuff coming from areas outside of China, the former however isn't unique to China, nor is it something that we shouldn't expect from a nation state. Israel and France are both well known to be both capable in this area and to have used it rather a lot.. If you ask me the 'computer hacking' element coming from China seems to be at least partially propaganda on the part of the US, the base of attacks is much larger and includes most of Eastern Europe quite considerably.

&gt; I guess there are just more things to rip off now than back then so it seems more prominent.

Actually it was quite prominent then too, proportionally, the difference is the amount of media coverage, the increased ease of intercommunication and the fact that the US has suddenly realised it's in a similar situation that the UK was when the US was becoming dominant, it's the one getting fucked over rather than the one doing the fucking.

&gt;That being said it still doesn't make what they are doing right.

That's arguable.

It's possible to get a rough idea of where your taxes are going, which is better than having no idea at all.

I'm not arguing with your reasoning. I'm arguing the idea that MATT DAMON want's to give more to the government. And he can, if he *really* wants to.

&gt;Taxes generally go to more specific purposes, and less to the general fund.

Not the taxes He or democrats propose. Those are specific for the general fund.

I meant donated to the government. The topic here. Not donated to his tax write offs.

And let's be clear, your quick google search doesn't show him donating anything but his time. I'm sure he donates what his financial advisers tell him to donate so he can write it off, don't get me wrong... And even that is not chronicled in your link. Just because he lends his name to a cause... that doesn't mean he spends much time or effort or money with it.

Your article notes how much a foundation ""raised"", not how much he gave. SO he likes to go to africa and play bigshot with his hollywood friends for a day or two.

What does this blog or thread have to do with the Middle East or any other backwards society? This issue, for the time being, is a first world problem, so don't go dragging the discussion into every shithole that exists in our world in order to dismiss a problem in Western society.

If some feminists are actually approaching modern day issues with the vigor as if they were Muslim women... then that would explain why they have such disregard for seeking equality.

You think you can evade any examples by demanding it be perpetrated by women. Well, we live in a very ideological charged society. You don't need women to directly oppress men, you need only to educate society to do so.

Regardless, you bring up many examples of injustice perpetrated against women. I can do the same thing, too.

There isn't a male rape epidemic in war-torn African countries?

Men aren't sent to jail by Americans that knows full well that they could get raped, and will likely be raped if their crime is heinous enough? Not only that, but the possibility of it is a laughing matter?

In Canada, infanticide is a lesser crime of murder that only women can be charged with, and thus they recieve a maximum sentence far less than what murder can illicit? Interesting considering that women perpetrate the majority of child abuse cases, and mothers are twice as likely to be the perpetrated of child abuse than the father.

How in NA and Europe, men are discriminated on their car insurance and have to pay upwards of 4 times more?

The fact that there are many professions, even in male dominated ones such as software engineering, where women, in general, are paid more than men for the same job when we hold all externalities equal?

The acceptance of male genital mutilation in a developed liberal feminist society, many times imposed by their mothers? Not to mention that in those backwards countries, women are just involved in the process of imposing female genital mutilation...

How society has historically condemned men to be the ones who are sent to hunt dangerous animals, to war, to give up their spot on the lifeboat, to do the arduous and dangerous labor, etc...? And many of those attitudes continue to persist.

You speak about systematic oppression of women by men...  Undoubtably there was, but women were definitely involved as well. You can also point towards some powerful women in history that controlled some of the largest and/or strongest Empires. It's the same case now-a-days, where both men and women are both involved in the oppression of men, women, or even both unintentionally.

Where is mainstream feminism when it is men that are being oppressed, discriminated, mutiliated, etc...?

This is precisely what I meant when I speak about how empowerment or victimization, which are quite frankly two sides of the same coin, are the wrong approach for feminists. The historical approach of the 20s feminist movement was towards equality of opportunity, to be regarded and treated as equals. Much of feminism has since devolved into female empowerment and victimization, which has motivated feminists towards equality of results, and towards a society that oppresses men.

How are men oppressed by our society? Just about every branch of the justice and legal system is stacked against men. I can actually make a claim that there is not a single instance in the system that treats men ""better"" than women. Male babies recieve no protection from genital mutilation. Men recieve less health care and therapy than women and it shows in far higher rates of suicide and mental problems. Men are raised in a society that teaches them to laugh at male victims of domestic abuse or rape, which in turn trains them to not seek help or make their case known because they'll be seen as less of a man. Boys are unnecessarily medicated at far higher rates then their female counterparts, and it's mostly because of unethical or medically unsound reasons which paint men as inferior to women. Men recieve no protection from a permanently tarnish reputation if they are simply accused of a sexual or child-related offense. In some societies, men, and women, are unable to divorce without facing retribution from society. In war-torn countries, while there is a spike in rape amongsts civilian women (more so than men), there is a spike in deaths amongst civilian men (more so than women).

We can play this game all fucking day long... All I'm hoping is that you can see how unproductive female empowerment is in a modern society. Heck, in any society. What is wrong with gender equality? Why are so many feminists simply unable to stand up against cases of male oppression? Because they've been brainwashed to victimize themselves and focus only on empowering women. That's why there is such a divide amongst MRAs and Feminists, because Feminists moved away from equality between genders and it created a Western society that actually needs MRAs... Funny how that works in an apparently male-dominated society. /s",t1_c29g0vc,False,True,t1_c29gteu,,0,c0mputar

In the past, the major currencies were based on gold. Any time someone held a dollar bill or a British pound, there was somewhere they could go to get that exchanged for a specific amount of gold (maybe it was a bank, maybe it was the government).

With that system, exchange rates were easy. If one dollar could buy one ounce of gold and one British pound could buy two ounces of gold, then one British pound is worth one dollar.

However, these days, most money isn't on the ""gold standard."" Now, we have ""fiat currency,"" which basically means that money only has value because people say it does. We all agree to buy and sell things with dollars, so they have value.

Nowadays, exchange rates are determined by supply and demand. In other words, the value of a currency depends on how many people want it and how many people are willing to sell it.

Important aside: we don't think about buying and selling money. However, a lot of money gets bought and sold. People buy dollars with other currencies, and people buy other currencies with dollars. Why? Mostly to buy and sell OTHER things. When Americans want to buy clothes from China, they need to buy Chinese currency. When Chinese people want to buy cars from Germany, they have to buy German currency. And, when German people want to buy American computers, they have to buy American currency.

So, back to supply and demand.

If America is making a lot of really great products that people all around the world want to buy, more people abroad will want to buy American currency. If more people want to buy American currency, the price will go up. Conversely, if Americans want to buy a lot of European products, Americans will be supplying a lot more dollars to buy up European currency. If more people are supplying dollars, the value of dollars will go down.

The tricky part comes in when we include central banks. Central banks are probably too confusing for a five-year-old, but let's say this: central banks can buy and sell money. This affects supply and demand in much the same way that imports and exports would affect supply and demand.

This is where a country could ""trick the system.""

Another quick aside: what would be an advantageous exchange rate? Everybody wants to sell stuff, right? And, how do you sell stuff? You make it cheap. The way to make your country's goods cheaper than another country's goods is by making your exchange rate weaker. For simplicity, say that a book costs 10 U.S. dollars in America. Now, suppose that a dollar costs one British pound. Then, a book costs 10 pounds. Then, suppose that (for whatever reason) dollar costs half a British pound. Then, the book costs 5 pounds. Suddenly it's much cheaper for Brits to buy a book from Americans. So, a cheap currency means that your country will sell more goods.

So, what can a central bank do to ""trick the system""? It can increase supply to keep its currency cheap.

This is what China has been doing in the last few years. People have been buying A METRIC SHIT TON (sorry that wasn't for five-year-old ears) of goods from China. Normally, this would drive the price of China's currency sky-high. That is, to buy Chinese goods, people have to buy Chinese currency, so a lot of people have been buying Chinese currency. Demand goes up; price goes up.

However, the Chinese central bank has been printing off loads and loads of its currency and buying dollars to keep the value of its currency down. That way, China can keep selling all of its goods.

The first one was diving in Sipadan, Borneo.
It was our third day diving and everything had so far been awesome. At the time I was a pretty new diver with just above 20 dives and a fresh advanced certification.
We did all the safety checks and hoped into the water. At first I had some trouble with equalizing so I went down vertically. At 19 meters I finally solved my ear problem and saw that the others was finning away 15 meters ahead. Eager to catch up I started to swim just to get first a few drops of water in my mouth, but on the second and third breath there was only seawater flowing through my regulator...

Choking on the salt water I nearly panicked, inexperienced as I was with malfunctions so I switched to my octopus which fortunately was working and managed to fill my lungs with air again. I managed to catch up with the others and ""told"" the diveguide about my problem. I was content to continue the dive with just the octopus and by being close to the rest...but at the end of the dive my pressure gauge started to act weird and depending on how I was positioned in the water it would pend between 200 bars and 0 bars...at that point the octopus also gave out and started feeding me water instead of air and I endured the safety stop while buddybreathing with the diveguide.

In the end it was a faulty regulator with a damaged seal that was the problem. But it made one heck of a horror story! :)

The second and the most terrifying experience to date was when wreck diving in Coron Bay in the Philippines. They have a lot of japanese WWII wrecks there. It was an large support fleet that got sunk in a pretty shallow bay.

The most famous wreck is Irako Maru which is a 147m long cold-storage freighter.
The day before me and my friend had done 3 dives at other wrecks in the area and those dives were awesome, with a lot of swim-throughs and tight passages. But as with all ""normal"" wreckdiving you almost always have a way out...

Enter Irako Maru!
First dive of the day, with a new dive guide we hadn't met before...at this point I was a certified divemaster with about 130 dives and felt very comfortable with my diving since I had been diving for 3 months straight.

Me and my friend expected the wreck to be like all the other wrecks, cool, with lots of swim-throughs and so on. What we did not expect was a wreck penetration at 42 meters...
We dove down to the aft of the ship and went in a big hole blown up by a torpedo...we swam into a really tight passage along the propeller axel...my diving computer didn't like being under the recreational 40m limit at all and beeped until we got into the engine room...10-15 meters later now at 36m depth. The engine room had no way out whatsoever, the closest was the way we just came, and this is the point when I realize that we potentially are in very deep shit.

With crap rental flashlights the only thing we could focus on was the diveguides fins and to continue the dive. I counted 10 minutes from when we entered the wreck until I saw the next exit out into the open blue water...this time at 29 meters. From there I thought that the worst was over but it wasn't until we finally swam out of the wreck that I noticed another 15 minutes had passed. The only thing in my head during that time was where I had seen the nearest exit, to control my breathing and check my pressure gauge constantly and trying to ignore all the circular ""windows"" that lined a long passage way...sure you could see the blue beyond but if a problem arose, it was no way I could squeeze through there...

Later that day a lot of ""if"" thoughts swam in my head...what if the diveguide had hit his head on some bulkhead...what if we bumped into a stonefish in one of the tight passages, what if my regulator starts feeding me water when im crawling through a small maintenance hatch...what if...

In hindsight I probably should have aborted the dive at first chance, but ego and determination to complete the dive can be a powerful drive sometimes. :)

Remember something I read in a Lonely Planet book about the Philippines...they have a very easygoing attitude to safety, something that reflects a lot in traffic incidents and airplane crashes etc... i.e. all the domestic airlines are banned by EU standards...
So I guess I shouldn't be surprised when the same applies to divecentres being run by philippinos. ^^

You know how there's a Walmart in every city you go to? Well, Walmart is a really big store that people own, but it's too big to own by any individual person. What they need to do is split the company up into lots of small pieces, so lots of people can get together and own a company as a big group. When people do that, the part of the company they own is called a ""stock"".

When you have old toys you don't want anymore, you can sell them at a yard sale, right? And other kids come along and buy them from you? Well, stocks work the same way. They go online to a big store called a ""Stock Market"" that lets grown ups buy and sell stocks. Since so many grown ups care about these stocks, they have prices from the Stock Market that get updated all the time saying how much a stock is worth.

I want you to imagine for a second that you're a corn farmer, and you're trying to plan how much money you'll make at the end of the year. What do you do?

Right, you guess how much corn you'll have at the end of the year, and you may guess you'll have as much as last year. But what if you buy more land? Or what if there's more rain?

Right, you'll get more corn. Well, stocks work like that too. Some years, people notice that Walmart is selling more things, so they thing Walmart is going to have more money at the end of the year. Since a stock is like owning part of every Walmart store, that makes Walmart stocks worth more. This makes the stock prices change.

Sometimes grown ups make guesses because they don't know how much Walmart is selling, and lots of people believe their guesses. People whose job is guessing are called ""stock analysts"", and grown ups pay them for making good guesses. So if the stock analysts think Walmart is selling a lot, then they'll tell people to buy Walmart stocks, or if they think Walmart isn't selling a lot, then they'll tell people not to buy Walmart stocks.

You'd be pretty upset if someone told you to buy Walmart, and they didn't sell as much as you thought Walmart would, right? Well, that happens with stocks, and that's called an ""upset"" and makes people sell Walmart stocks.

Since so many people buy and sell stocks, there's a whole section in the newspaper that talks about them. They tell you how much a stock is worth for every company, and they tell you how much more it's worth than yesterday too (in case they had an upset!)

Really, that's all too confusing for most grown ups, since how can you tell which company is going to upset? So instead you can buy a special stock like Spiders (""SPY""). These stocks are called ""Funds"" kind of like the children's fund charity you help with. You know that money is going to lots of different kids, right? Well, Spiders is like that, except the money goes to lots of different companies. That way, if one company does badly, another company will do well, and so you're happy with how much your stock is worth all the time!

Most grown ups who don't want to read the boring newspaper every day should buy those instead since most grown ups buy companies that have lots of upsets!

*Grownup note: I offer this post with no warranty express or implied. This post does not constitute financial advice.*

**TD;DR not for a 5 year old:** If you want to invest, just buy a basket of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track different markets. SPY is a good one for the US S&amp;P 500 market, but you should probably find a cheap European ETF as well to get some diversification--any fund from a respectable company with a low expense ratio will do. Put the same amount of money into the funds every month/year and you *will do better than any professional investment manager* 97% of the time on a 5 year horizon (mutual funds, that is).

Picking stocks is stressful, and a fool's errand. Just buy ETFs. Individual stocks are a waste of time unless you're willing to put in at least 10 hours/week to do real research.

So first off I'm actually from Barcelona, Spain and I haven't seen the mercury fountain at the Miró Museum. [This was the actual storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKwxiVOvHME) that caused the flood last Saturday!

So from what I gather there's pretty much no reason for the electricity to leave the power strip or its immediate surroundings and absolutely no reason electricity will go up one leg and come down the other effectively 'zapping' you even if you do stand near it.

However, I've learned something new today! 

If a circuit is made, electricity will follow that circuit, since it's the easiest path.

If there isn't one, but there's a grounding wire, it will follow that.

If there's no grounding, then it will flow downwards, or spread to the nearest path that's grounded if the floor is insulated. In this case, best to have feet insulated and in either case, don't touch anything anywhere near the outlet.

Now, since Europe, how about getting briefly zapped by 220V? :)

Economics,1,0,,1427420970,,1,1312263800,False,0,c29jcf9,t3_j6fvy,t5_2qh1s,"(Reuters) - In a rundown patch of Detroit, enclosed by a cyclone fence and barbed wire, stands an unremarkable warehouse that investment bank Goldman Sachs has transformed into a money-making machine.

The derelict neighborhood off Michigan Avenue is a sharp contrast to Goldman's bustling skyscraper headquarters near Wall Street, but the two operations share one important element: management by the bank's savvy financial professionals.

A string of warehouses in Detroit, most of them operated by Goldman, has stockpiled more than a million tonnes of the industrial metal aluminum, about a quarter of global reported inventories.

Simply storing all that metal generates tens of millions of dollars in rental revenues for Goldman every year.

There's just one problem: only a trickle of the aluminum is leaving the depots, creating a supply pinch for manufacturers of everything from soft drink cans to aircraft.

The resulting spike in prices has sparked a clash between companies forced to pay more for their aluminum and wait months for it to be delivered, Goldman, which is keen to keep its cash machines humming and the London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's benchmark industrial metals market, which critics accuse of lax oversight.

Analysts question why London's metals market allows big financial players like Goldman to own the warehouses which store huge quantities of metal even as they trade the commodity.

Robin Bhar, a veteran metals analyst at Credit Agricole in London says the conflict of interest is so acute he wants U.S. and European anti-trust regulators to weigh in.

""I think it makes a mockery of the market. It's a shame,"" Bhar said. ""This is an anti-competitive situation. It puts (some) companies at an advantage, and clearly the rest of the market at a disadvantage. It's a real, genuine concern. And I think the regulators have to look at it.""

Goldman said its warehouse subsidiary Metro International Trade Services has done nothing illegal, and abides by the LME's warehousing rules. ""Producers have chosen to store metal in Detroit with Metro,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said. ""We follow the LME requirements in terms of storing and releasing metals from our warehouses.""

The London Metal Exchange defends its rules. ""There is a perception that consumers have not been able to get to their metal when the reality is that it is big banks, financing companies and warehouses that are not able to get to their huge tonnages of metal fast enough,"" said LME business development manager Chris Evans.

BUSINESS MODEL

Goldman's warehouse business relies on a lucrative opportunity enabled by the LME regulations. Those rules allow warehouses to release only a tiny fraction of their inventories per day, much less than the metal that is regularly taken in for storage.

The metal that sits in the warehouse generates lucrative rental income.

Little wonder that so many want in. Metro was acquired by Goldman in February 2010, while commodities trading firm Trafigura nabbed UK-based NEMS in March 2010, and Swiss-based group Glencore International acquired the metals warehousing unit of Italy's Pacorini last September.

Henry Bath, a warehousing firm and founding member of the London Metal Exchange in 1877, has been owned for about 40 years by traders or banks including Metallgesellschaft in the 1980s and failed U.S. energy trader Enron at the turn of the century. It now comes under the umbrella of JP Morgan, which bought the metals trading business of RBS Sempra Commodities in July last year.

Despite its rental income, Goldman's warehouse strategy apparently hasn't been enough to snap a slumping performance in commodity trading, with the company reporting a ""significant"" drop in revenues from a year ago in its latest quarter, the sixth time in the past 10 quarters that it has failed to expand.

CONSUMERS FUME

The long delays in metal delivery have buyers fuming. Some consumers are waiting up to a year to receive the aluminum they need and that has resulted in the perverse situation of higher prices at a time when the world is awash in the metal.

""It's driving up costs for the consumers in North America and it's not being driven up because there is a true shortage in the market. It's because of an issue of accessing metal ... in Detroit warehouses,"" said Nick Madden, chief procurement officer for Atlanta-based Novelis, which is owned by India's Hindalco Industries Ltd and is the world's biggest maker of rolled aluminum products. Novelis buys aluminum directly from producers but is still hit by the higher prices.

Madden estimates that the U.S. benchmark physical aluminum price is $20 to $40 a tonne higher because of the backlog at the Detroit warehouses. The physical price is currently around $2,800 per tonne.

That premium is forcing U.S. businesses to fork out millions of dollars more for the 6 million tonnes of aluminum they use annually.

It has also had a knock-on impact on the global market, which is forecast to consume about 45 million tonnes of the lightweight, durable metal this year.

Also pushing aluminum costs higher are bank financing deals, which are estimated to have locked up about 70 percent of the 4.4 million tonnes of the metal sitting in LME-registered warehouses around the world. LME inventories hit an all-time record above 4.7 million tonnes in May.

In a typical deal, a bank buys aluminum from a producer, agrees to sell it at some future point at a profit, and strikes a warehouse deal to store it cheaply for an extended time period.

The combination of the financing deals and the metal trapped in Detroit depots, means only a fraction of the inventories are available to the market.

Premiums for physical aluminum -- the amount paid above the LME's cash contract currently trading at $2,620 a tonne -- in the U.S. Midwest hit a record high of $210 a tonne in May, up about 50 percent from late last year. In Europe, the premium is at records above $200 a tonne, double the levels seen in January 2010.

The ripple effect into Asia has seen the premium paid in Japan increase 6 percent to $120 a tonne in the third quarter from the previous quarter, the first rise in nearly six quarters.

COLLECTING THE RENT

You won't hear banks like Goldman complaining. Rental income continues to pour in at the 19 Detroit area warehouses run by Metro as of June.

From the outside one recent afternoon, a depot in the Detroit suburb of Mt Clemens appeared to be deserted. But neighbors say the place is a whirl of activity in the early hours of the morning when metal is usually delivered for storage.

The LME sets the maximum allowable rent at 41 U.S. cents per day per tonne. At that rate, Goldman's warehouse operation in Detroit -- said to be holding more than 1.1 million tonnes -- could be generating as much as $451,000 per day or about $165 million a year in revenue.

An exact figure cannot be calculated because many clients negotiate lower rental rates and Goldman declined to detail its income from its warehouse business. But when Swiss-based trading company Glencore listed earlier this year it revealed that its metals warehousing unit generated $31 million in profit on $220 million in gross revenue in 2010.

LONG HISTORY

Caught between consumers and warehouse operators is the 134-year old LME, one of the world's last exchanges with open-outcry trading. Sessions take place in a trading ring with red padded seats while visitors can watch from a gallery. Traders juggle multiple telephones and use archaic hand signals to fill orders from consumers, producers and hedge funds.

The ring is a perhaps more civilized version of the tumultuous trading pits made famous in Chicago. Each of six major industrial metals including copper and nickel are traded for five minute bursts in the morning and afternoon. Only 12 firms have access to the ring, arranged in fixed positions in a circle, with many others involved via the ring dealers and on the LME's electronic trading system.

The biggest thing that contributed to my learning how to play the game was reading through strategy guides for the different classes.  Especially reading medic strategy guides helped me realize that for the new-player skill level, medic is probably the best class to play.

Granted, all the duties of a medic are intense, and it takes awhile to get used to them.  Meted down to the most basic tenets of medic play - you need to stay alive, heal everyone especially fellow medics, and know which classes to uber in which situations.  Pyros can be helpful to just push the other team backwards or to create chaos, demos are best when there are multiple enemy sentries to destroy, and heavies are best when the enemy is crowded around in a tight, open (in terms of line of sight) area. 

also, playing medic and determining which players are highly-skilled is the best way to play.  I had accumulated probably 400 medic hours before I started heavily playing another class.  I began to play demo simply because the map I favored was a demo-favorable map.  Thus, most of the time the very best players I healed were demos.  Simply put, if you're new to the game, play medic, and simply observe the players you heal and how they play.  Especially try to find the highly-skilled players, heal them, and figure out how and why they do the things they do.

Lastly, if you can't get above 10 fps, you're probably not going to get good at this game.  I have a fairly low fps compared to others who play this game, but I still get good enough to react to players around me.  10 just isn't high enough.  That said, if you're getting frame issues, the best classes to play are probably medic and engineer.  When I play on european (I live in the U.S.) servers, those are the classes easiest to play without losing too much of a competitive advantage.   

tl;dr Play medic, observe skilled players, and learn how to play those classes by observation.  Also, read class strategy guides.  I would recommend watching videos, but many of them are outdated. 

edit1: forgot the most basic tip - use a microphone, and communicate with (and listen to) your teammates. this is especially necessary when playing a medic, but it's helpful to you and your team to communicate no matter what class you play. ",t3_j5ytw,False,True,t1_c29jqxn,medicred,0,memphisbruin

If our government wasn't running a trade deficit and our population wasn't buying things off credit then the world would lose its biggest customer. Bye bye export economy Germany and China. I think people fail to see this because they ascribe some kind of moral position to a countries overall sovereign debt.

Having said that I do not agree with your analysis of China. China does not hold our debt. They hold Treasury bonds which haven't really been a denomination of debt for the US since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971. 

The reason China wants to hold these bonds has more to do with their domestic policy than anything else. By doing this they are able to keep the dollar strong thereby artificially keeping their currency weak. This allows them to be a net exporter to the US as they can produce low tech goods more cheaply. This is necessary to keep their huge low educated population employed and satisfied with their standard of living. Without that there is large possibility of massive unrest.

As a western European I have to be fair here. Transit countries like the Ukraine are to be blamed for this. They breached contracts with the Russians about prices multiple times, and tried to blame them of stealing gas destined for Europe although they were it themselves who took it.

What reason do the Russians have to destroy the demand in Europe for their natural gas? Showing that they are able to cut the supply only accelerates European diversification.

Oh, and could Joseph Smith have written the BoM? Absolutely. That book isn't that great. Here's a list of a few things off the top of my head that indicate that it doesn't take a genius to write the book. 

* Let's look at Nephi as a character. One common sign of amateur writing is the inclusion of a [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue), that is to say, where the author inserts him/herself into the story as a key character that comes up with all the good ideas while everyone else sits back and wonders what the hell is going on. Read the story of Nephi with this in mind and you'll spot this trope everywhere.
* Laman and Lemuel. How old were these guys? Older than Nephi, who was himself old enough to carry the plates and impersonate Laban. That means those two *had* to be at least in their 20s. If Lehi is as wealthy as the BoM suggests, he had to a merchant. There is nothing Lehi could have done to stop those two from staying. So complaining makes no sense when they could just stay.
* Oh, and Zoram. ""Sure, I'll go out and have my daughters marry your daughters! That sure will delay the incest by one generation, yesiree!"" (psst... the next generation will be reproducing through incest still)
* Lehi's dream. [I'll just leave this here](http://www.centerplace.org/history/misc/jsp.htm#14) and move on.
* One of my favorites... why could Lehi's family offer burt offerings if they couldn't cook their food for fear of being spotted? Not to mention that burnt offerings and similar ordinances were only to be performed by the Levites, whereas Lehi states that he was from the tribe of Joseph, which he learned from reading the plates. But how could he have used the plates to learn this if he didn't know his lineage to begin with? And what's more, how could someone living in a culture where your lineage is as important to you and recited as often as your surname not know what his lineage is? You could fumble around a dozen FAIR articles for convoluted explanations for these (most of which would not satisfy a skeptic in the least) or you could take the simpler explanation that Joseph Smith simply did not know Hebrew culture that well and put Lehi in the tribe of Joseph rather than the more logical Levi where the prophets were likely to come from because of his narcissism.
* Oh, and speaking of the tribe of Joseph, if Lehi really was in that tribe he would have been captive in Babylon in 600BC. 
* Speaking of the supposed 600BC time frame, much of the plagiarized chapters in Isaiah were written at around 500BC, after Lehi would have left. That is also assuming that you ignore the known translation errors that exist in the King James Bible verses that are found in the Book of Mormon word for word. Yes, the same errors exist there too.

I could go at this all day, but I'll stop there before the list gets too long. However, I can't end this without bringing up the mindfuck that is the journey of the Jaredites. They supposedly brought over nearly a dozen plants and animals that never existed in the Americas before the Europeans arrived, such as horses, sheep, bees, etc and never mentioned any of the most important foods that sustained the Natives such as sweet potatoes. They left from the Tower of Bable whose existence anthropology has pretty thoroughly debunked, entered barges with only one hole for air so the inhabitants will suffocate, and travel a distance that they could not possibly have packed enough food for and in a time period where they could barely seal a small boat from leaks much less a submarine.

Want sources for all this? Check out the page on [Mormonthink](http://mormonthink.com/book-of-mormon-problems.htm), they have a much bigger list than I do and cite everything. Best source ever. While you're there, be sure to read about the places where JS plagiarized parts of the BoM from. There's even bits from Gulliver's Travels in there. Good times.

In no EU state debt exceeds the combined assets of the citizens, so it's doable everywhere... albeit you'd want to only slice half of the debt or so in some countries.

Sorry, I've misunderstood you, but now I'm even more confused! The border *within* the Schengen area to be policed is of course zero, by definition. On the other hand, the *edge* of the Schengen area is huge and presumably comparable to the US/Mexico border in size.

Moreover, the difference between either side of these two borders is similar too? I'd assume the wealth/stand of living/whatever of Germany/USA on one side and Ukraine/Mexico are similar?

Yet, these borders manage to live without massive fences and relentless patrols? I'm not sure why that is.

Ah, well, only if you read the Daily Mail, the newspaper of choice of the middle class British xenophobe!

The truth is porous borders brought a great deal of man power to the UK - free movement of labour (like free trade) did the building trade a lot of good. Particularly before 2008 the building industry was booming and facing a [skills shortage](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-10473801-labour-shortage-hitting-builders.do), migrant labour filled that role and once it disappeared [many left](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/3248852/Polish-immigrants-leaving-Britain-What-the-Poles-did-for-us.html).

Don't get me wrong, I know many British builders who feared the ""Polish invasion"" as it lowered wages and increased competitions for jobs. I also know smarter ones who employed the Poles there by reducing their costs, growing their businesses and later specialising, etc, to increase margins again.

I end up wondering why America - the land of the Free Market seems so keen to place protectionist controls like this. But then you explain it well in your later paragraphs (that I won't quote for brevity).",t1_c29kd5s,False,True,t1_c29kgw9,,0,ChetManly

The worst part was that the mob passed, some of them said they'd go and 'volunteer' for something. Military, or cleaning up something. I don't know.

I watched one of them get into a military flatbed, and I realised that he was one of my colleagues a few years back.

Then, there were several more vehicles (or individual, I can't remember) with severely fucked up people getting pushed along on stretchers, with IV drips attached, probably victim to the incident i described earlier.

My parents and I got along for the first... 10 or 11 years of my life. And then I started questioning what they have taught me, being brought up in the church and all. At 15 or so, I stopped going to church. My dad is a priest, and I'm an atheist. There has been such hostility between my father and I for the past... 15+ years now. I can't even discuss a topic like assisted suicide without my dad going off the handle on me. I had a medical ethics course in the beginning of the summer, and we watched ""You Don't Know Jack"" starring Al Pacino. I was only 7 or 8 when Kevorkian was on trial for those ""murders,"" so I wasn't informed of what he actually did. I just thought he was a crazy Doctor who killed his patients. But as an adult now, I can see what he stood for, and I agree with what he did. I talked about it, and he gave me the passive aggressive bullshit for a week.

He claims he won't come to my wedding (justice of the peace) when my boyfriend and I decide to get married, because it's not in a church done by him. He keeps trying to get me interested in his prison ministry, because he has been invited to speak at functions all over the country and in Canada and next year I think he's going to some place in Europe to speak about what he does at the prison, and when I politely declined to hear about it as it didn't interest me, again he freaked out. I can't even sit in the same room with him for an extended period of time without a fight about something or other coming up. It's frustrating because I'm accepted to a point, but then the gloves come off and it's perfectly OK to start yelling at me for whatever reason. I yell back because I'm just sick and tired of it all. We're such polar opposites, we just don't know how to talk like a normal daughter-father. I wish I had a normal relationship with my parents, or something that resembled normalcy.

Then came Pepin the Short, who started a new dynasty in France. An important part of his power came from an alliance with the Pope. He basically laid the groundwork for his son Charlemagne to expand the borders of the Frankish kingdom to much of modern France and Germany.

This is really when European expansion began. Second born Frankish nobles had no claim to their father's estate and so had a strong impetus to seek their fortune through conquest and adventure. A Norman noble (William) conquered England in 1066. German princes essentially colonized eastward into central Europe. The reconquista of Spain began as the Muslims were slowly repelled. And of course there were those (mostly Frankish) knights who went East. Not just to conquer the Holy Land, but also Sicily, Malta, and other places.

&gt;You say: ""Socialism is a big tent yes, but economically speaking, they're all the same. Central economic planning, which means government ownership of the means of production.""

&gt;You are correct up to a certain point.....""government ownership of the means of production"" To a degree you are correct, yet what kind of government? ......A workers government, and a government that puts workers first AKA the masses the people first.

&gt;I just want to point out why I think this is important in your debate: It is vital to point out what kind of government in the same vain as a packet of crisps, but what flavour?

It doesn't matter what kind of government.  They are all subject to the same critical flaw that prevents them from being rational and productive, namely, an absence of a price system for the means of production.  A ""worker's government"" that ""puts workers first"" cannot overcome this limitation.  The USSR, communist China, Cambodia, Cuba, North Korea, were all examples of governments ""putting the workers first.""  Just because the RESULTS were exactly counter to worker interests, that doesn't mean the intentions were not ""worker"" oriented.  You need to learn the difference between intentions and results.  Then you need to learn that in order for socialist central planning to even be maintained, the central planners MUST be tyrannical and brutal, for if they weren't, then individual civilians across the country/society will make their own investments and plan for their own futures according to their own needs and desires.  This is incompatible with socialism, because in socialism, individual civilians cannot own and control their own means of production.  If the central planners are peaceful, then individual civilians across the country/society will rightfully consider the central planners to be a bunch of arrogant, pompous demagogues who fallaciously believe themselves to know what's best for other individuals over and above the individuals themselves.

You don't know what I need and desire and what costs I am willing to incur.  Any attempt by you to ""plan"" my life will be met with my hostility and rejection, and the more you insist, the more I will defend my own goals and desires as superior to your goals and desires for me.  Thus, the ONLY way you as an individual other than me can ""plan"" for my life as a central economic planner, would be if you threatened me with violence, so that I will be coerced into capitulating to your attempt to control me, over what I produce, over what I trade for, over what I own, and thus over what I consume.  If you aren't willing to use violence, then I will simply thumb my nose at you and consider you a nuisance, while I go about living my own life and planning for my own life external and separate from your desire to control my economic life.  Thus, ""nice socialists"" could not maintain socialism.  Socialism requires violence in order for one or more individuals to control the economic lives of all other individuals.

&gt;The difference between a socialist government and a capitalist government is very different flavours. Currently the governments in power now represents a Capitalist government who are the minority in economic terms for example: 10% of the worlds population have 63% of the worlds wealth, therefore leaving 90% of the population with 38% of the wealth. The 10% minority are the Capitalists capitalising on the worlds wealth they rule and govern now.
Who made that decision on how wealth should be distributed in this way??  Obviously not the majority or a mathmatician. 

A number of problems here.  

One, we don't have a capitalist government.  We have a welfare/warfare, social democracy government.  The fact that most of the means of production in our economy are privately owned does not make the US government a ""capitalist"" government.  Most of the means of production are also privately owned throughout all of Europe.  Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and every other ""socialist"" country are in fact ""capitalist"" using your own treatment of capitalism in the phrase ""capitalist government,"" because most of the means of production in these societies are privately owned, not state owned.

Two, it is in fact the majority that created what we have today in this country.  The majority of people do not want a separation between economy and state.  The majority wants an official state economy, through welfare and warfare.  The majority wants the minority of individuals to be members of the official state welfare/warfare economy, and if they don't like it, then they have to move some place else.  Thus, when the majority wants a welfare/warfare government, the result is massive wealth transfer, from both poor to rich, and rich to poor, depending on whether it is warfare or welfare that is being preached and practised.

Three, wealth disparity increases the more government interferes with civilian's economic lives.  This is especially true when money production is controlled by the state.  When you can print your own money, and give it to your friends, you and your friends can become wealthy without even working for it, thus living as parasites off of the productive, that is, those who do have to work to earn their money.  Couple that with the increases in government spending relative to GDP all around the world, and the regulations which supposedly help the weak and vulnerable but in reality hurt them by preventing them from competing, and the result is expected.

Fourth, socialism is not ""worker oriented.""  Socialism is command and control oriented.  That command and control is based on violations of individual property rights, and it is individual property rights that is the ONLY ""worker oriented"" system there is.  Every ""group"" based political system necessarily contains one group exploiting another group.  Only a system based on individual rights and freedoms can ensure no inherent exploitation will take place.  The problem with you socialists is that you believe there is an inherent exploitation taking place in voluntary profit-seeking.  As long as individuals are free to trade and earn profits by selling goods for more than the money costs in producing them, the more other people are not ""receiving the full product of their labor.""  So you advocate for government guns, to ""right the wrong"", to exploit the profit earners, by either taxing them 90%, or forcing them to pay a wage that is above the market rate.  Since no individual wants to be exploited, the capitalists have responded to the newly created government power, generated by the majority wanting that power to exist, by utilizing that power themselves.  So we now have the poor exploiting the rich, and the rich exploiting the poor, and in the process, everyone's standard of living declines from where it otherwise would have been.

Fifth, and most importantly, wealth disparity is not inherently evil, as long as it is a product of differences in individual performance as judged by their fellow individuals in a context of free trade.  To make blanket condemnations against wealth disparity is to believe that one can obliterate the connection between an individuals choices and actions, and the consequences of those choices and actions.  One individual who works hard and saves, and earns more than another individual who is lazy and doesn't save, is not an injustice.  That is justice.  As long as neither the hard working individual nor the lazy individual initiate force against the other's person or justly acquired property, then ANY wealth disparity no matter how large, is fully justified and moral.

To understand the geopolitical climate of the world you must understand that it is no longer controlled by nation states. There is of course the *appearance* of superpowers but these superpowers tend to correlate well with the wealth held by their citizens. 

World affairs are now primarily influenced by a *plutocracy* which exists in rich nations such as the US, Canada, and the EU (primarily the UK). This was the intended result of globalization. If you consider the US the center of world wealth (and thus power) it is important to understand how the elite came to dominate the US. This is best explained in “Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich”.

It is not *purely* about wealth but wealth *disparity*. The gulf between the richest and the poorest in the world is now larger than it's ever been. The rich continue to become richer while the poor continue to become poorer. This is by design and primarily executed by those who control (and purchase) political influence.  The beauty of this power grab lies in the perceived assignment of blame to political parties thus freeing the elite from blame in the minds of the proletariat. The top 1% of the nation now controls 40% of the wealth. This is not well understood by most because it is difficult to grasp what exactly it means to wealthy today. If the wealthiest in the US held their wealth in US currency notes ($100.00 each) they would have far more cash than would fit into most middle class homes. One billion dollars weights 29,160 Kg. The wealthiest however own tens of billions of dollars or more.

Because the US is a two party system and *both* parties influence policies that support vast wealth creation it becomes difficult for US citizens to enact democratic policies which might change this power imbalance. 

tl:dr: The world not controlled by nation states but by the wealthy, most of which originate from the US. This is a *class* issue rather than a political issue.

The pope said: ""Ok, in this case killing is allowed and you'll score extra points for getting into heaven"".

Around the same time Christianity split up in two parts. In the west they followed the pope. In the east, in the Byzantine Empire, they followed the Patriarch. They became enemies but didn't really fight. 

However, about 20 years later the Byzantines were in big trouble because the Turks attacked them. Their boss asked the pope for help. 

The pope had become pretty strong around this time and had been fighting with the emperor about things like appointing bishops. He now had a chance to play the boss over the emperor. Also, pilgrims to the Holy Land (Palestine) were attacked and now they could pretend to protect them.

The pope said: ""Ok, we'll help. And killing is allowed, you get bonus points for getting into heaven if you go and if you die you go to heaven right away"".

The First Crusade started in 1095. It was a war against non-Christians. In Germany people killed a lot of Jews before they went east. Then they fought the Turks in Turkey and the Arabs, Palestinians, Jews and other non-Christians in Palestine.

They did pretty well, they conquered Syria and Palestine. But after only 150 years they were kicked out and Palestine was under control of Muslims until the First World War.

There were other crusades too. There were crusades against Muslims in Spain. There were crusades against pagans in Russia and the Baltic states. There was a crusade against the Cathars in south France because the pope said they weren't real Christians. And during the fourth crusade they just plundered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantines!

Basically, when the Christians in Western Europe got strong enough they united and kicked out anyone they didn't like - especially Muslims and Jews. They figured they couldn't beat the Turks but fought on in Spain and eastern Europe. The conclusion was that the Christians completely reconquered Spain in 1492.

One big problem with the atheist/religious debate, as I see it, is that both sides are so accustomed to arguing against specific canards that they tend to react with knee-jerk responses, even when those responses aren't totally germane to the discussion. If I had written, ""Militant anti-religious policies in Albania and Revolutionary France prove that atheism motivates repression,"" you might have had a point. As it happens, all I suggested was that there are forms of militant atheism that go beyond writing books. And there are. The fact that there's a command hierarchy involved doesn't change that fact.

(As it happens, atheist, deist, anti-clerical and secularist violence in Revolutionary France didn't require ""large trained military forces,"" or a rigid command hierarchy, though it did, at times, have one or both of those behind it. Nor, for that matter, did the radical anarchist violence in early 20th century Russia and Eastern Europe, which was largely propogated by the small groups who were, as far as I can tell, were the first to use the term ""militant atheist.""

The most important thing that I did that no one else did was figure out how to get money. 

If you don't have one already, open a Bank of America checking account. You will be able to take money out of any Barclays ATM (the largest bank there) for free (with a 1% for changing from pounds to dollars). A credit card will likely charge you 2-3%. Many other debit cards will charge you up to 5$ per withdrawal+any fee the ATM charges.  

Also, your debit card may come with a 6 digit PIN. Use a BofA ATM to change that to a 4 digit PIN that does not start with a zero. Some European ATMs will not take longer PINs or PINs that start with zero. If you are only there for a semester, you will not be able to open a bank account in London, so don't try that.

Your BofA card will also allows free withdrawls from several other banks in Europe, which is useful if you travel on the continent. However, it is only free for the bank in the specified country (for instance, you will see Barclays ATMs in other countries, but you only get free withdrawals from the Barclays ATMs in the UK.) 

A lot of my friends didn't check this stuff and ended up pay hundreds in ATM fees or were stuck without access to money for the first few weeks (having an ATM card with a PIN that didn't work or trying several banks before realizing they weren't able to open an account at all).

I actually have cut a lot of them out of my life. All of them, in fact - save for my awesome Dad, whom i love very much. He rocks.

A lot of people might give us both hassle for this emotional divorce - ""OMG they're your family"" - sometimes you have to make a tough decision. There's no point in being a willing punching bag for your family.

&gt;I just assume everything I remember is through rose-colored glasses.

Oh dear god this is a good attitude to have. Not only will you not have treasured childhood memories ruined, you may end up pleasantly surprised. Most of the stuff i liked was good when watched later (Biker Mice and Swat Kats come to mind), but like you said - some of it was **unremittingly shit**. Like Conan &amp; The Young Warriors. What shows did you find good or bad upon review?

(Were these 3 examples i gave an early sign of my extreme homoness, or was 80's animation just full of big, attractive dudes?...hmm)

&gt;...World of Warcraft, which I used to play more than 40 hours a week

That is why i have never attempted to play this game - friends said i'd like it, i imagine i would. I'd probably get DVT from it. Kudos for managing to cut it out of your life.

The problem with weight loss is that we live in a world where calorie-loaded food is both desirable and accessible. It takes a fair amount of willpower to eat below maintained. It seems you're doing well with it - it's a good attitude to have! 

The only way i can do it is by not buying the stuff in the supermarket. That was fine up till 2 months ago, when my dad moved in with me - he has the fridge filled with chocolate and beer. If it's there, i tend to eat/drink it. Then i have to buy more the next day to replace it... 

People you spend your life with tend to reinforce each other's behaviour. If you have 2 circles of friends, try and watch how you act around them, and how you change in subtle ways.

To be honest, you're probably one of the few people this isn't true of. You're more true to yourself, i think. It's easier to be yourself around earnest people too, which is probably why i like to spend time around people like you.

Being provocative and being purposely aggravating are different. With comp sci friends, you get to see both kinds! The very fact that you're asking yourself, 'would this be good to say to these strangers' pretty much shows what side you're on.

&gt;I'm also not the best for telling when a person is joking, until they make it clear.

Know how that feels. Former housemate had this deadpan sarcasm - i eventually had to ask him if he was joking or not. Half the time he said yes. It *is* hard to know with some people.

&gt;The idea of asking a question to a person that you don't want answered is almost foreign to me.

LOL, apparently straight men have this problem with women all the time. Women talk about their problems, not as an invitation for feeback or problem solving, but as venting, a need to be listened to. This thinking is alien to me also, but i do it for my women friends sometimes - it's empathetic, and really does make them feel better.

&gt;Oh and Geoff confirmed he does not prefer to be my space heater, and would rather the roles were reversed. He really hates being cold.

I wish i could give one of you my metabolism, or whatever it is that keeps me constantly too warm. I sleep in a 2.5 tog duvet, even in winter. It's the right temperature, but it's insubstantial - not ""cozy"". I see films with people snuggled up in a huge thick blanket and a hot water bottle, cup of hot chocolate beside the fire... I think, 'That looks so cozy and comfortable'. If i tried it i'd look like i had a fever.

It's actually a concern of mine should i enter a relationship - i don't think i could fall asleep with someone else under the same blanket - it'd be too warm. 

&gt;The major appliances are all circa 1970,

Christ, we were the same - even had a vacuum cleaner from that era too - it would be classified as ""industrial"" by modern household standards.

After 9 months of this we decided Fuck it - got a loan (this was 2006, lol), got a new fridge, hoover, dishwasher, washing machine and an induction hob. Our electricity bill fell to a little above half of what it was. It was insane. We never did the math properly, but we saved the money back through the electric bill for sure. Since it was a rented house, we sold back the new stuff to the landlord when we left and got some money back through that too.

2 of the guys actually complained about how cold the fridge was, till we got a fuckton of beer that weekend. That beer was the coldest, crisp refreshing beer i've ever had. Till the next beer out of that fridge.

That was the same week we realized that milk lasts longer than 1 day.

&gt;Nothing but fat people rolling around drinking their meals from cups. Then again, I'm a bit cynical and pessimistic about the future of humanity.

[What a](http://jokephotos.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb15.png) cynical, [dystopian view](http://www.lionsdenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/fat-15.jpg) Steve!

Heh, i'm pretty pessimistic too, the only bright spot i can see on our horizon is technology and science solving problems at the same pace as up to now.

I look at the US and EU, and think yeah - there's a fuckton of really bad shit going on - but it has been worse. Especially for our kind..heh.. The recession really threw everything off, but hopefully in 10 or 20 years, things will be better.

That view is tainted by the fact that people seem to be more selfish and swayed by rhetoric than ever before. Seemingly intelligent people vote for Bachmann and Palin. Oh well...

&gt;My eyes already tend to get bloodshot and dry, and the lenses only made it worse. :-(

OH NO! I'm sorry to hear that. Even the newer daily disposables that are 75% water?

Glasses aren't a total turn-off for me, but those nightmares were quite vivid, and they were recurring too. There was one guy i liked who wore glasses. Just the one tho :P The irony is that i too wear glasses on occasion, but mostly contacts.

Look at the structural adjustment fund investment in Romania and Hungary from the EU that shows the growth in local economy infrastructure spending  can present. That increases the ability to purchase as well so imports/exports can increase, works well all round. So it really isn't a cut and dry argument that taxpayers and/or the fed will pay everything back.

Long answer: It is hard to explain and takes a lot of reading, researching, and learning from others to find out what tricks there are to make it work.  A good place to start is [FlyerTalk](www.flyertalk.com)

*EDIT: For example.  You can fly from the US to Europe in mid-January for ~$800 all-in.  I just threw one trick at the flight and got it down to $675...and that is still leaving $200-$300 on the table that could possibly be shaved off.  If I spent more time on it, there is a possibility of getting that flight for ~$4-500 all-in.*

*EDIT 2: ...and if you are a frequent flier, that flight would net you 8836 EQMs, which is ~7cpm...and that flight could get as low as ~4.5cpm depending on how low it can actually be reduced.*

He is also a liberal, but he makes no bones about it, and is happy to discuss economic pros and cons of various policies. On inflation, Krugman was one who called out the inflationistas before QE2 occurred. He said that the type of easing proposed by the Fed would not be as good as spending the same money on job creation/infrastructure, and was not large enough, but would be better than not easing. I think he was right on all counts. 

Now we are on the precipice of the next round of quantitative easing. Again. America would be helped by a job creation/infrastructure stimulus, and again Congress will not do the job, and again the Fed will be required to perform quantitative easing because it is better than nothing. 

In fact, going back to the beginning of the crisis when Bush was spending a trillion dollars to save banks, few have gotten the future economic path of the USA and Europe more correct than Krugman.

The British Empire extended from what is now the UK, through to northern India (to be fair, we didn't even learn about this, so this could be bullshit as well) and lots of colonies in the new land far west where Pocahontas was set.

So anyway.  It was a pretty big gig, but not everyone loved it. A few colonies. Enough to successfully challenge the British forces in the new land. Say like 9 or 10 or whatever were like, ""FUCK THIS SHIT!"" and banded together. They all sat around a desk for a while and thought of some catchy names. After rejecting ""Colonies United Against the British Pig Dogs"" they finally settled on ""The United States of America"" and started a civil war.

During the time of this Civil war, they changed things like ""Tomato"" to ""Tomayto"" and ""Rubbish"" to ""Trash"" to seem ""hip"" and ""individual"" and eventually forced the British to GTFO.

1. Working out at a more serious gym will surround you with people who inspire you and can teach you more about lifting/diet. You'll probably get bigger/stronger just being in this new environment.

2. These guys will see that you're serious about doing things the right way and can mentor you, but they're not going to waste their time for another yuppie off the street who insults them by thinking that 'anyone can get huge on steroids.' Steroids are powerful and dangerous, but can be done relatively safely if you're in the right hands. This isn't the sort of thing you want to learn from failure in. These guys have been here before and their knowledge will help you do this the right way. You need more than just a hookup, you need someone you can go to with questions.

You didn't equate socalists to Stalin. But saying all socialists have a stalin-sized plan is silly. I think most American socialists believe a blend of capitalism and socialism is the most effective way to approach it, like how they have done in Europe. There are certain things that clearly function better when they are socialized, such as healthcare and food quality regulation and environmental regulation, police forces, fire department, traffic lights, highway systems, etc. But on the other hand, there are certainly things that function better in the free market, such as development and sale of technology, or retail sales to drive prices down. But then there's plenty of things that are not clearly better one way or the other... I think these are what people are really arguing about when they talk about socalism vs captialism in the United States. It sometimes seems people aren't even allowed to recognize social programs as socalistic systems in the US, we have to pretend like they're something else. Socialism is a dirty word, akin to communism. It doesn't deserve to be like this, but it has become that way because of decades of propaganda against the USSR, and reactionary defense mechanisms by extremely wealthy capitalists, who happen to control a large portion of the media that so heavily influences public opinon.

I think you miss my original point and are very quick to argue numbers rather than ethics.  The Red Army conduct was inexcusable, and so was Stalin's encouragement of it.  I would also argue that by the time the Red Army reached Berlin, they no doubt had much better communications than during the disastrous 1941 invasion.  Control and supervision would have been much easier.

And there are precedents for genocide and ethnic cleansing.  Someone else mentioned the Armenian genocide, you could also throw in ethnic cleansing of Jews in Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella.  Stalin himself killed 3.2 million Ukrainians through starving, and yes it was genocide.

The rape number is as high as 2 million.  Beevor himself stated this, source: 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1382565/Red-Army-troops-raped-even-Russian-women-as-they-freed-them-from-camps.html

Here is Stalin encouraging it:  ""When the Yugoslav Communist Milovan Djilas protested to Stalin, the dictator exploded: ""Can't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?""  Yes, rape was a common occurrence in war, but it was still seen as inhumane.

Furthermore, the LEVEL of rape committed by the Red Army is almost unprecedented.  You may argue that rape was common in war, but I doubt that it was in the millions, like it was in the waning days of WWII.  The 2,000,000 figure is also backed up by an interesting figure; ""The scale of rape is suggested by the fact that about two million women had illegal abortions every year between 1945 and 1948.

I'm an American who came to the UK five years ago for a university degree, and stayed on after (I have about a year before I have to find a very good reason for them not to kick me out). Let me, if I may, give you some advice that I think is relevant and hopefully helpful. As some other people have stated, don't believe that the grass is necessarily greener. 

First, even as an American, unless you hold a second passport (and depending on what that passport is) or have a substantial income that you can provide evidence of for the 12 months before you make your visa application, coming here at all is rather difficult. If you can line up a job with a company that can sponsor you, great (you will be bound to that company for the duration of your visa — three years for the first visa, two after its renewal, until such time as you can move to a non-sponsored visa through a higher salary or prove yourself a sufficiently established person who can be self employed as an artist/writer or freelancer).

Second, and I can only speak to London in this respect, the job market is not fantastic. On finishing my university degree I was incredibly lucky compared to many of my friends and was able to find my way into a (paid!) internship within four months of graduating, and after about six months of that was able to get an entry-level position at a small company. It's a good job, but the salary is relatively low, London is very expensive (rent, depending on where you live, adds up fast and transportation costs are high — buy a bike, learn to cycle safely).

Third, back to immigration issues for a minute, it is getting harder and harder to stay in the UK as a foreign, non-EU national. In addition, depending on your sector of professional expertise, government cuts are affecting a lot of businesses and organizations (I hope you aren't in the arts in any capacity). Some sectors are doing well, and there are jobs to be had, but the more well established and impressive your CV the better. Rocking up to these shores with a degree and a desire, however sincere, to live here will not get you very far on its own.

Lastly, 'free healthcare' ain't free. You will be expected to pay national insurance (Social Security, basically) from the get-go, and taxes are reasonable, but not exactly low. As a percentage of income, depending on what state you're coming from, you may find them a bit higher. That's kind of a guess, because I've never worked in America, but do still have friends/a brother who do, so hopefully I'm not completely making that up.

The UK economy is not all peachy, though it is doing okay right now (partly thanks to not adopting the euro). The job market, especially in London, is very competitive, and both employers and landlords will consistently have the upper hand and the boon of choice to hang over you. If you accept these conditions, and are willing to navigate a gordian knot of a visa system, I encourage you to try. It's good fun over here, and the people are (sort of) nice.

(IANA[I]L, but I can point you in the relevant direction and give a rough outline of visa processes and on what basis you could apply based on first-hand experience if you have any questions.)",t3_j6sus,False,True,t1_c29opga,uk,0,lordofkullab

The sloppy journalism doesn't help either:

- ""this little-known member of the European Union"" 
Iceland is NOT a member of the EU

- ""attracted many English and Dutch small investors."" 
BRITISH and Dutch. England is just one part of Britain.

- ""Kapthing""

Geir Haarde was Conservative/Independence Party, the Social Democrats were the junior member of the coalition.

Some of the article contains certain truths but this so much of this has been simplified and dumbed down ridiculously when covered by the ""foreign press"".

In regards to the Constitution, this has been on the cards for years. It wasn't as a result of the crash.

I hate to see liberals (again, I am one) paint all Icelanders as the stoic heroic elves of the North after this.

These same people were the ones who were loudest in refusing to cover the foreign investors' deposits in Icelandic banks because they, the foreigners were ""greedy"" and ""should have known the risks"".

I admit I have not done any research on the sources.  But several historians back up these sources.  Timothy Snyder himself states that ""the outburst of violence against German women was extraordinary.  Men who tried to defend daughters of wives were beaten and sometimes killed...In some villages, every single female was raped, whatever her age."" Snyder, Bloodlands, 317.  Even if the number was not as high as 2 million, it was still exorbitant.  I'm not sure why we are arguing numbers, but the behavior may have not been encouraged, but it was not stringently deterred, which is very close in practicality.  

Krisztian Ungvary also backs up Beevor's sources.  ""Of the 1,4 million inhabitants of Berlin at least 110,000 were raped and 1,156 subsequently gave birth."" The Siege of Budapest, 354.  Does that not seem a bit more believable? 

""In Hungary similar statistics could be prepared only in towns temporarily recaptured by German and Hungarian troops.  In Lajoskomarom 140 of 1,000 women residents sought medical treatment, and in Szekesfehervar 1,500 women were reported raped, but the estimated number was between 5,000 and 7,000, or 10 to15 percent of the entire population - all this after a Soviet occupation lasting 30 days.  In Budapest...about 10 percent of the population were raped...Significantly, in territories occupied by the Red Army (for example Germany) - the number of people suffering from venereal diseases had grown by a factor of 20.  In Hungary a compulsory treatment center was set up in every town with more than 10,000 inhabitants...In Budapest after the war 35,000 to 40,000 clandestine prostitutes were known to the police, apart from those listed in official records.  This number is also more than 20 times the number before 1945 (obviously caused by rapes and a combination of helplessness and need)."" Siege of Budapest, 355.  He continues to state that ""The rapes are only partly explained by the fact that the soldiers wanted to satisfy their sexual urges...The soldiers could hardly have  derived much pleasure from these violations..."" (355)

""Mass rape as an archaic army rite was much more common among the Soviets than in any other European army...The better organized an army, the less likely its soliders to obey such archaic urges (which refers back to what I said about communications and command structure)...That is why the German or Hungarian soldiers' way of indulging in such excesses was completely different from that of the Soviets...

""A horrifying picture is painted by a variety of reminiscences and reports, the youngest rape victims were less than 10, the oldest over 90."" (356)

To be honest, I looked at the notes, and Ungvary quotes Sander and Johr.  Yet, his Hungarian statistics are comparable.  10% of the women were raped, and he quotes ""Documents of national Chief Inspector"" as his source.  When we combine German and Hungarian figures, the two seem fairly similar and are backed up by much higher venereal rates and eye witness accounts.  Maybe the number was not 2 million, but I doubt it was lower than 1 million.  Furthermore, if 10% of the Hungarian population was raped, do you not think the Soviets would have been tougher on the German women?  Ungvary also backs up my argument that Soviet rape behavior was a distinctly Soviet experience forced on Hungarian and German women.

So, by convention, a power called King-in-Parliament is supreme. This is Parliament's laws enacted. Yes, the Prime Minister is *conventionally* a member of parliament (specifically the House of Commons, though many earlier Prime Ministers going back to the 1960s were members of the House of Lords on or just before appointment).

There is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which replaced the Lords Appellate Committee of the House of Lords which did the same thing, except in a different place.

There are checks and balances except that, in theory, the Government can overrule courts finally. Now, the practical exceptions are that we've taken to prioritising (or entrenching) laws and we honour our treaties. So if a court rules that the Government has violated the Human Rights Act of 1998, then the Government tends to change its attitude rather than outright amend the Act. We accept to a degree the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, so it may overrule our laws (though this is consensual).

The Monarch last made a significant political decision about 100 years ago when the King refused Lloyd-George's request to flood the House of Lords with Liberal peers (i.e. people who'd support his bill to limit the Lords' powers). The King demanded a General Election before he'd do it. These days, that wouldn't happen. Though the Monarch is in regular contact with the Prime Minister (weekly audience) and the fact that this current one has been on the throne since 1952 I believe that they listen to what she has to say (though they're not practically obliged to).",t1_c29ou8s,False,True,t1_c29p227,,0,SamEmbleton

But we don't really even need to question it. Maybe we dont need to question income taxes. Maybe the patriot act should be renewed. Maybe sometimes you have to hurt bad people.


So, short answer? History and culture have created protections (whether they're adequate or not) against the public body of the government, to prevent tyranny, but there arent enough rules about the private citizen.

They must rescue an allied unit left behind on the European warfront. Apart from Akane, the credits include Shigeru Morita (Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, Blood+), with Takahiro Kimura once again adapting CLAMP's original character designs for animation (as he did for the previous Code Geass anime).

They were, in effect, betting that the tax payers of EU will bail them out.

0.27%. They must have been damn sure about this, despite of the Treaty of Maastricht explicitly ruling it out. Especially compared to all the other investments that they could have made, which would have yielded higher returns without relying on a bailout.

&gt; This is why Greece should just default. The parties most hurt by it are the parties who are responsible for this mess.

Apart from the Greeks themselves, the ones who would get hurt the most would be the people of Portugal and Ireland, and those of Spain and Italy shortly after, along with European tax payers in general. There is, AFAIK, not a single non-Greek bank that isn't already under government control which would even notice a complete loss of those investments any more than their CEO would notice if he ran over an orphan in his limousine.

The banks aren't threatened by this. I think Commerzbank is the most exposed, at less than €3bn, and they have more assets than the GDP of Greece, Portugal and Spain *combined*. It's what it would do to the interest rates of other peripheral counties that everybody is afraid of.

1. iGENEA didn't actually do any tests on King Tut's DNA. They didn't even get their hands on any of his DNA. Their conclusions are based on footage from a Discovery Channel show which followed certain investigations done on mummy DNA from King Tut as well as his family, and which contained footage of computers supposedly showing some DNA tests. Nobody has established where those screenshots came from, whether they were actual mummy DNA or whether they were just something set up for the cameras.

2. iGENEA is private ""ancestry testing service"", and is milking the story for cash. Besides the massive popularity and name recognition they get from the story appearing in hundreds of newspapers, they are using it to sell their product. As the story says, they are now ""testing to find the closest match to King Tut's DNA"". What it failed to mention is that this is not a scientific undertaking, they are just [flogging ads on their web site](http://www.igenea.com/en/index.php?c=62), asking European men to buy their DNA testing kits for €129 or €399, and **if** they happen to come up with a match they'll refund your money. In any case, the money will be refunded for the ""closest match"", which is 1 person, while they take the money from thousands who will be tested.

3. iGENEA has a piss-poor reputation in genetic testing, or even in ""ancestry testing"" circles, which have much lower standards. They will routinely tell you which ancient lost tribe or which Biblical figure or whatever you are related to. This kind of stuff is impossible to determine from a scientific perspective, so basically they are taking your money to sell you a report that tells you whatever you want to hear.

So I personally wouldn't take their word for it just yet. I'd like a scientific laboratory, not some commercial ""ancestry testing service"" to examine **real DNA** that came from the mummy, not some unprovenanced screenshots from a Discovery Channel show.

The Belgians revolted however and declared independence in 1830. Before Napoleon's invasion, Belgium had been under Austrian, and even earlier Spanish control. Even further before that Julius Caesar said that of all the Gaulish tribes the Belgae were the toughest. Belgian national identity is connected to Belgium, not the Netherlands, even though we share a language. If anything Flanders and Wallonia will become independent of each other, though I expect that further federalization will happen before they'll shut down such a powerful brand as Belgium.

The other question is, why would we (I'm Dutch) want Flanders to join us and why would they want to? We're already in the Benelux group and the European Union, we already reap the economic benefits. Adding Flanders would just give us a comparatively impoverished province with people who claim not to be part of the nation; we've got enough of those. I'm sure Flanders, and especially Antwerp, aren't very enthusiastic about joining the Netherlands, seeing how we have a history of blocking off the Belgian port in favor of our own Rotterdam. Not only did we blockade the canal that goes from Antwerp to the North Sea (it flows through Dutch territory) for centuries, but in the Twentieth Century the Flemish have only barely prevented Dutch efforts to close off the Westerschelde. Even right now the Dutch government is involved in a dispute about the waterway, constantly changing it's promises to the Belgians. I am sure they are not eager to trust and join this great country.

As for France and the Walloons, who would want to be a part of France anyway?

If you are looking for a few years of a laid back, beach based lifestyle, then NZ is a great choice. I don't think you can save money to pay off debts on a teacher's salary. The salaries are very low and the cost of living is very high. NZ's market is just too small and the imported stuff obviously is more expensive. We pay between 10-20% more (than in Europe) for everything, even dairy, fruit and vegies: locally produced goods..... But the salaries are easily 30% lower. 

People with graduate/university degrees are leaving in droves (just have a look on the website of the NZ Herald to read about that) because there are very limited opportunities here. That is part of the problem. A lot of ambitious, well educated Kiwi's (the people, not the birds) leave for Australia: better pay, better lifestyle and way more interesting jobs to choose from.
The culture of mediocrity that I am talking about is the other part of the problem and this has to do with the fact that a lot of standards and practices quite frankly are decades behind Europe and the USA. Developments are slow, resistance to change is high and for people who have worked in different countries, it often feels like you're being transported in time.

People in Europe live a similar / higher quality of life then in the US have better economic equality, better education, stronger democracy and health care.  They also have higher social mobility meaning that parent wealth is not as great of a predictor of future economic success as in the US.  True meritocracies.  It is also easier to open in a business in countries like Denmark and several other European countries are ranked better locations for entrepreneurship.

For some reason, neither party really seems to want to team up with the other, and I can think of various reasons for that, economic, political, and social.

The US still has a sense of being the ""best"" in the world and thinks it can recover in time to beat China in terms of technological development (which will probably drive economic development, since production standards are increasing increasingly with new technologies, and innovation has a more globalized effect, which means any radical innovation, like the PC will be adopted faster and by more people) and doesn't need Europes help in this.  The US is also scared of the downfall of the Euro, a failed currency that doesn't make sense since monetary policy differs from country to country and having a constant currency between countries in different economic climates will doom them to failure.  The US also doesn't want to end up like Germany, picking up the pieces of shattered economies and countries like Spain, Greece, and soon to be more.  On the political front, a lot of Europe has a more socialized democratic system, and I think a lot of people on the right wing of the US wouldn't like to become extremely friendly with them since they are using systems (usually pretty successfully) to which they are ideologically opposed.  

Europe doesn't want to inherit two costly wars that are going nowhere, and the largest economic debt/deficit in the world, along with a country that has the biggest GDP and is on the brink of another collapse (potentially).  Right now, we are in the swing of austerity, something that hasn't treated Europe very well recently in some parts, and I don't think they would be too appreciative of that.

""In a sense, all American Presidents have been cut from the same bland consensual cloth. But in another sense, American public policy obviously changes from time to time often in important ways. I suppose someone could say that Stalin and Brezhnev were basically the same: Avowed Communists who sold out Marxist internationalism in favor of Sovet/Russian imperialism. Or Mussolini and Franco.

At least, that's what it's like at most colleges.  It's definitely what it is like where I graduated, and that's a small university in North Carolina.

Hell, even my Religion class at the local community college started with the professor emphasizing, ""Your beliefs are yours, but this class is not studying your beliefs.  If a single person raises their hand to argue that the Norse were wrong to believe in Odin, then there will be a problem.  Especially if you follow it up with 'Because God is the only god.'""

One thing that characterized most of the classes, however, was an insistence that no religion is wrong.  While inconsistencies in the text or the culture could be relevant, they had to be relevant for a reason other than ""So that proves that ancient Jews/Babylonians/modern Mormons are  stupid.""  

In the more advanced classes, especially where we were translating the source texts, it was much more likely for the professor to make insightful, witty remarks about the apparent bizarreness of some groups' acceptance of horribly translated passages as literal truth.  But even in the lower classes, discussion often had to do with things like, ""Why would this group be interested in banning this practice?  Why would this group want Moses to look like a bad guy?  Why would this other group want him to look like a hero?  Can we find any evidence of textual changes, where Moses might have been inserted into good or bad situations for that group's political gain?""

There were several people in the major that were somewhat disappointed, as they were hoping for much greater viciousness against religious practitioners.  In a seminar about modern American beliefs, this one guy would have trouble keeping himself from sneering as we discussed people who said things like, ""I can feel Elvis.  He's always with me.  He keeps me on the right path.""  But while the class in *no* way pushed the belief systems we studied, it also was respectful of them.  I explained it to my girlfriend thus: ""Would you respect a European Culture class that talked about how stupid Europeans were?""

(There's a lot of people like that.  Seriously, worship is the only way to describe it.  ""With Jesus on my left shoulder, and Elvis on my right, I can do no wrong.""  ""I think that God sent us Elvis, like he sent Jesus.  To connect with the people, through God's chosen instrument: the guitar.""  If you go to Elvis's tomb, you can see that people leave various mementos and offerings for him.  Pictures of their dead children, money, teddy bears from their dead children, their own childhood toys, incense, jewelry, locks of hair, etc.)

There's a lot of overlap in Religious Studies and Theology, but Theology assumes a certain religion (obviously in most cases, at least in the US, Christianity).  Most of the overlap occurs in the study of texts from the Abrahamic religions.  As my Hebrew professor said, it's important to remember who wrote what you're reading, but in the vast majority of cases, even when the paper you're reading about a certain ancient translation of Judith is a Catholic professor of Theology, there's very little bias.  There can be some, but it's generally not that significant.  That surprised me, but definitely in a good way.

One of my favorite professors focused on Asian religions, especially Indian ones.  He *loved* India, and went there every Christmas break.  He got incredibly into his descriptions of their culture, history, and religions.  It genuinely shocked all of us when we found out he was a active Southern Baptist minister, whose church was just a few miles down the road.  From watching him teach, everyone (both theists and atheists) had just assumed he was an atheist.

It was fun watching him *go the hell off* on the asshole ""campus preacher"" who liked to stand out in the courtyard and scream at people about how they were going to hell.  One time he started screaming that the professor above was going to go to hell for teaching blasphemy, and the professor just turned around and let him have it.  It was awesome.

1) Like others mentioned, it's basically just normal variation in human preferences. Sexual selection can't occur without individuals preferring slightly different things. 

2) I'm not sure what you mean by pronounced, but a brief overview, off the top of my head, of different populations and sexually selected female characteristics, on average:

West African &gt; West Eurasian &gt; East Asian when it comes to size of female breasts and buttocks. The human female fat deposits along the hips and buttocks are unique among the animal kingdom. 

East Asian &gt; West Eurasian &gt; West African for female facial neoteny. Neoteny suggests youth and is preferred by men; human females are more neotenous than human males. 

West Eurasian &gt; East Asian, West African on phenotypic variation. The wide variety of hair colors and eye colors is an advantage when competing for the attention of males. There are more women with naturally light-colored hair and eyes than there are men. 

West Eurasian &gt; East Asian &gt; West African when it comes to lightness of skin color. Ceteris paribus, men prefer light skin, and women are lighter than men. This preference existed long before the colonial era so it isn't some product of European imperialism or whatnot. 

I don't mean to use &gt; signs to indicate superiority in any way, just amount or degree just like 3 is greater than 2 but isn't necessarily superior to 2. I shouldn't need this disclaimer but people tend to get sensitive sometimes when talking about population differences. 

Why do these differences exist? r-K selection differences, differences in male to female effective population size, and/or differences in historical male to female breeding ratios (1.4, 1.3, 1.1 for West Africans, Europeans, and East Asians, respectively), could all have something to do with it, or not at all. I don't know. 


3) I don't know about fast twitch muscles, but buttocks are definitely involved in sprinting and jumping.

Parking - not a problem at all in Lille. Ive never had to drive around for more than 3 minutes to find a spot.
The great thing about Lille is that its not as big as Paris or Lyon at the same time its not a tiny city with nothing to do. Its just the right size , so you don' end up getting stuck in traffic.

About the neighborhoods - got to watch it. Wazzemes is cool to visit and shop, they have one of the largest open air markets in France or western Europe, but I wont stay there. I had a colleague that did and it was not cool. Relatively poor neighborhood with lots of Arab and North African immigrants living there. Nothing wrong with them, but there tends to be some social issues and they(the ones from economically not so good situations) straight up don't like outsiders - this is just my observations and experiences. 

Vieux Lille is very beautiful, as the name goes its the old Lille. St. Maurice is just outside the center on the way to Tourcoing and Roubaix; Its on the tram line and about 4 or 5 stops from Lille center. 

If you are looking to stay in the center and have access to good night life, then here are your options :
* Carmontagne (a bit away from the center - cycling distance) and walking distance from Wazzemmes. i stayed here for a couple years. and liked it alot.
* Republic beaux arts
* along Rue National
* neighborhoods aound the Parc Citadel
* St. Maurice
* Vieux Lille
* St. Andre
* Lots of little quarters on the Tram Line - Brosollete, Romarain, etc.
* You can also look for places along the Tram and Metro lines as there are some nice neighborhoods and you can travel easily.

My best suggestions, what I did, was to look on websites where they announce houses for rent. pic as many as you can and make appointments before you actually get here. then find a hotel thats not to expensive. you can get a descent room for about 40 - 50 euro a night. get here and check out the neighborhood and visit the houses.
It took us about 4 days of traveling around and visiting places non stop. Its important to visit the neighborhood yourself and get a vibe for the place.

I recently found that near the Catholic University on rue National (i think) there is this student housing/service apartment kinda place. very nice studios for not to expensive. My in-laws spent a week there while visiting us. so you can work something out for a month or 2 while you decide.

If you have doubts or want to run something by me please don't hesitate.

If we reach a tipping point, no. The US has already exhausted two rounds of Quantitative Easing, same for the European governments. 

After 2008 we collapsed because of massive market imbalances. The governments stepped in to (rightly) prevent a total meltdown and soften the landing. The problem that remained was that where they softened the landing, they still propped up market imbalances that continued today. 

For example, in the US, there is still no reason why a 2 bedroom house constructed with $20,000 worth of materials should retail for $250,000. 

There's also no reason why a CEO needs to make 600x what one of his regular worker makes. There are limits on productivity and ""value added"".

The US economy is almost 70% consumer spending and that can't sustain itself when the top 0.05% of the population are hoarding productivity and wage gains for themselves. 

Price levels in the US need to fall dramatically and real wages need to rise for average workers at the expense of the top tier. Otherwise we'll never pick up. 

Now... the bigger issue is. How can a US worker honestly expect their wage to rise when someone in India or China will do their job for pennies on the dollar?

It's a messy situation with an equally messy solution. We have to start finding incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and slash CEO wages at the same time.

People's rights and Internet freedom is defended by the most leftist parties like Enhedslisten and Socialistisk Folkeparti, but they are not helpful with regards to the military in particular. And the military really doesn't have the defenders in Folketinget that they should have. We have obligations to NATO (spend around 2% of BNP on the military, but we're spending 1.4% according to an overview I saw a few months back), but every talking head is mentioning further reduction which is beyond silly and irresponsible. Just like it is idiotic to talk about ending having a military. I am sorry to say this folks but I think the world is heading for an unstable period (due to changes in world power, oil getting more expensive, water problems, climate change changing available arable land and so on) in which Europe might need to defend itself and change internally which to me means that we shouldn't be as dumb as we were before the 2nd world war and not weaken ourselves. I know we're small but that is just such a crap excuse. We need a functional military and navy (to handle arctic issues in particular) in my opinion.

The tax reduction hawks are the Liberal Alliance and Konservative. Most parties agree that the tax pressure is high, but there is very little most can do at the moment as the big expenses are in areas no politicians is willing to cut (pensions and healthcare costs will be huge budget items in the near future). And most of the right of center parties seem to be more in bed with corporate interests and so are not looking for a way to take real taxes from the multi-nationals in particular who have been fucking with the Danish tax system (and pretty much everyone else's too). They're getting the benefits of the danish society of highly educated, mobile workers that are easy to both hire and fire (check how hard that is in some other countries in Europe) but they are fighting tooth and nail to not pay the very low (comparatively) tax rates of Denmark that help finance this without thinking (of course) about the fact that this will (like outsourcing of jobs) erode the system and a market for their products (if fewer are working fewer have the money to buy anything). I doubt too many parties want to raise taxes either as Denmark is already regarded as abnormal in this regard (never underestimate Enhedslisten for strange suggestions though). 

Job creation is a wash as every single party has a strategy or claims to have one and there is such a mess of constant suggestions and policies that I couldn't point to one party and explain it.

I'm pretty good at cooking most middle eastern, indian, various european cuisines, so yea, I guess I suck right now when it comes to japanese.

Well, for ""realz"", back...  I think we're both quite characters.  Good on you for starting to learn to cook Japanese food.  I am starting new nationalitie's foods all the time, as well, and if you want compare notches, which it seems you do, I am well versed in european, african, indian, asian and mexican cuisine as well.  Are we measuring dicks here, really?

&gt;But honestly, you don't really know what you are talking about. You talk about the west like it's this uniform thing, I guess you live in Japan? There are some fatties here, quite a few actually, but there's also an extreme amount of variety - tons of people that still cook at home in thousands of different cuisines. 
Also, I still eat whatever I cook, and I learn a little bit along the way. There's no waste.  This method of cooking happens to be enjoyable for me. I work about 70 hours a week getting paid minimally to get a PhD in CS, and when I come home I want to do something else that is fun. I like to tinker with shit, and some shit I enjoy tinkering with is, surprise, food.

This is where you lose me, and honestly piss me off.  I actually DO know what I am talking about, and although you like to play the card that ""i'm a PhD in CS, so the fact that I can experiment with cooking means I'm worthy of praise.""  The fact that you're getting a PhD in CS is even more insane to me...  Would you think it admirable of someone who wanted to learn about computers/computer science by just tossing a desktop onto the ground and digging into the peices, to figure out how to make one?  Wouldn't that seem quite silly to you, as someone who actually put time and effort into learing the science of it?  Sure, you might have poked around in a computer, when you were a kid, but if there are books and many resources available, and someone still chooses to ""tinker"" in a tower, wouldn't you suggest they crack a book or ask someone?
Regardless, we both put in long hours in endeavors not related to food, which makes it seem that much more retarded to me to waste any time trying out a dish when blueprints are available easily.
And yes, as a north american, I know there are tons of fatties, and there are tons of people wasting food all over.  And the idea that ""well, if I make shit-food, at least I eat it, no matter how many times I make it shitty.  Who needs a recipe? "" seems like a pretty shitty approach t food, or anything one sets out to do...  but we disagree...

&gt;I'm sorry you don't like that, but it's worked pretty well for me in the past, so I will keep on keepin on.

Exactly my point.  If you want advice, or help, take it.  If you just want people to slobber over a bad picture of decent food, so be it.  I'm surprised that someone who's a user on reddit longer than I wouldn't get this fact yet.    
 &gt;Maybe you should get out more around the world, talk to some people and actually listen to them, and learn that people can still be successful without doing everything your way.

But again, (I don't want to sound like a really old guy) but when I was 21 i already had 2 civil wars behind me and was somewhere in Europe trying to get away from shit and find a way to support my family (yeah, it sounds like cheesy movie - but it is) Throughout my adventures I met tons of people. From literally crazy ex-con and war criminals, to people nice as saints. You have no idea what's creepy. (hint: its  not someone crying in their pyjamas. A someone pointed out, I found it more funny then anythign else)

Also, when I was 21 I thought I was mature (imagine yourself that you have to find a way to fed your parents ans siblings) but years later I find that I wasn't.

Also as 20yr old, and no matter how mature you are,  you are inclined to have norms defined by your peers. What is love, what isn't. What's her normal behavior, whats yours normal behavior. etc. (for comparasion: in early 20 th century to sing a serenade on balcony of your beloved would be consider romantic and normal,  today you'll get a restraining order)

But anyway, don't get me wrong here, I am not trying to offend you or put you down (in fact you sound as realy articulate and smart  guy), just put some things into perspective and for the sake of argument 

He build a shrine?

I hate to go to technical. But for me a shire is a very strong word
[shrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine)

from wiki
&gt; ... is a holy or sacred place, which is dedicated to a specific deity, ancestor, hero, martyr, saint, daemon or similar figure of awe and respect, **at which they are venerated or worshipped.**

he build a fucking tree with photos; a collage you might say...fuck me yeah back then i woudl find it creepy. now? shit  - I wish  :)

Without her permission?

Now, again, maybe  because I am a bit older but if parents let him do it I don't consider it as creepy. Sure it was without her knowledge, but the way I look at  It's like when a parent gives a toy of their 5yr old to another kid and their kid starts to cry and goes mental ""why did you give out my toy??"". 

I know I am oversimplifying this but considering that her BOTH parents give permission I wouldn't jump to creep bandwagon so quick. That's why I think that she overacted. Now, granted, maybe I  give to her parents to much of the respect. 

&gt;It is in fact a disturbing early sign of obsessive behavior

Again I don't want to oversimplify but I look at it as when a kid losses his favorite toy.  Starts bitching about it. Is that a sign of a obsessive behavior? It could to you...  but to me is not. Please take a note here that I am taking a fact that her parents liked him and let him lived with them. 

And yes I had  very strange experience in my life, hence I am not jumping to quick on this story. As mentioned getting presents in your mail box, postacrds, or having a girl/guy crying in pijamas  over your photo is not as creepy as guy a with a AK47 with staring at the candle with empty look in his eyes, talking some rubbish about god

So to sum up: Yes,  he acted immature (by any standards)  However, I also do think that her fear was also the sign of immaturity as well.",t1_c29sv0d,True,True,t1_c29t3bl,,0,metamorphosis

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icesave_dispute#Legal_arguments

&gt; The Member States of the European Union contest the interpretation of the Icelandic government, and consider that a sovereign ""guarantee of last resort"", similar to the role of central banks as lenders of last resort, is the only way of ""ensuring the compensation or protection of depositors"" as required by the Directive. The ruling of the European Court of Justice in Peter Paul and Others, the only case to have considered Directive 94/19/EC, begins: ""If the compensation of depositors […] is ensured, …"".[66] The ECJ then went on to uphold the immunity of the German authorities from civil liability for alleged failings in banking supervision (as per Recital 24) given that the depositors had been compensated up to the minimum set by the Directive.
&gt;
&gt; The Directive imposes a minimum guarantee of €20,000 per depositor; moves to increase this minimum to €50,000 or even higher had been agreed politically before the Icelandic crisis, but had not been incorporated into EU law, much less into EEA law. The Tryggingarsjóður guarantees 1.7 million krónur on the basis of a fixed euro–króna exchange rate, equivalent to €20,887.[64] The Netherlands and the UK have higher guarantee levels, €100,000 and £50,000 (approx. €60,000) respectively; Landsbanki was a member of the Dutch and British compensation schemes for the purposes of guaranteeing this difference in cover, an arrangement known in Britain as the ""passport system"",[68] and commonly used by banks throughout the EEA. In addition, the UK Treasury has exceptionally guaranteed retail deposits in excess of £50,000 which were held in Icelandic-owned banks in the UK at the time of the crisis, at a cost of some £1.4 billion (€1.7bn).
&gt;
&gt; The dispute over deposit insurance is not without some irony. In April 2008, Landsbanki launched a scathing attack on the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) after the FSCS had implied on its website (without specifically mentioning Icesave) that depositors guaranteed under the ""passport system"" might have to wait longer for their money in the event of a bank failure than depositors with banks which were completely under the FSCS. Landsbanki went as far as accusing the FSCS of breaching European law ""by letting savers believe this falsehood"".[68] A second irony is that FSCS had raised its guarantee level from £35,000 to £50,000 on the very day that Landsbanki went into default, a move that does not affect the liability of the Tryggingarsjóður under the ""passport system"" but which has considerably increased the cost to British banks and building societies (independently of any action by the Icelandic authorities).

Also the Iceland government is in breach of EEA law on non discrimination

&gt; The second, if not primary claim of the British and Dutch governments is that Iceland is in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the EEA Agreement which prohibits ""any discrimination on grounds of nationality"",[70] echoing Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome.[71] The contention is that, by guaranteeing deposits at Icelandic branches but not at overseas branches, the Icelandic government is unfairly (or ""illegally"") favouring Icelanders, be they individuals or corporations.

Drug decriminalization in Portugal is a failure, despite various reports published recently all over the world saying the opposite.

There is a complete and absurd campaign of manipulation of Portuguese drug policy facts and figures, which some authors appear to have fallen for.

The number of new cases of HIV / AIDS and Hepatitis C in Portugal recorded among drug users is eight times the average found in other member states of the European Union.

""Portugal keeps on being the country with the most cases of injected drug related AIDS (85 new cases per one million of citizens in 2005, while the majority of other EU countries do not exceed 5 cases per million) and the only one registering a recent increase. 36 more cases per one million of citizens were estimated in 2005 comparatively to 2004, when only 30 were referred "" (EMCDDA - November 2007).

- Since the implementation of decriminalization in Portugal, the number of homicides related to drug use has increased 40%. ""Portugal was the only European country to show a significant increase in homicides between 2001 and 2006."" (WDR - World Drug Report, 2009)

""With 219 deaths by drug 'overdose' a year, Portugal has one of the worst records, reporting more than one death every two days. Along with Greece, Austria and Finland, Portugal is one of the countries that recorded an increase in drug overdose by over 30% in 2005"". (EMCDDA - November 2007)

The number of deceased individuals that tested positive results for drugs (314) at the Portuguese Institute of Forensic Medicine in 2007 registered a 45% raise climbing fiercely after 2006 (216). This represents the highest numbers since 2001 - roughly one death per day - therefore reinforcing the growth of the drug trend since 2005. (Portuguese IDT - November 2008)

- ""Behind Luxembourg, Portugal is the European country with the highest rate of consistent drug users and IV heroin dependents"". (Portuguese Drug Situation Annual Report, 2006)

- Between 2001 and 2007, drug use increased 4.2%, while the percentage of people who have used drugs (at least once) in life, multiplied from 7.8% to 12%. The following statistics are reported:

Cannabis: from 12.4% to 17%
Cocaine: from 1.3% to 2.8%
Heroine: from 0.7% to 1.1%
Ecstasy: from 0.7% to 1.3%.

At the end of the day, America really does have the highest standard of living in the world, in terms of material wealth anyways. Most people take for granted how cheap and readily available things are in the US; if you want to buy some groceries you can go to the local store which is open 24/7. Here in Belgium if you want to buy anything after 6pm (some supermarkets 8pm) or (heaven forbid) on a Sunday, you're out of luck. Another example is internet services (online shopping, local websites etc.), I'd say we're a good 3 years behind the US. Innovation starts elsewhere and slowly washes to the Old Continent. On Reddit there's been some complaining about Netflix raising their prices to $7.99 a month! Our Netflix-clone charges about $11 for 2 DVDs a month and about $44 for 12, unlimited doesn't exit and offering a streaming service just isn't possible because all our internet connections are capped. Two silly examples, I know, but it gives an idea.

What people often see as the big advantage of European countries is the social provisions; health care, education, infrastructure etc. and we do indeed get those at a heavily subsidized cost and they are of a decent quality but they are hardly the best in the world. Take education for example, yes you can go to university for (almost) nothing but if you look at the world rankings of universities, it's American universities dominating the top 50. The actual cost price of a student per year is roughly the same in the US and Belgium, except we pay for it indirectly through our taxes. I'd rather be able to pay for the best directly than be forced to pay for a mediocre service indirectly.

I read in a study recently that our take-home-salary is 45% of what the employer pays; just think about that, if the employer pays you $100, you take-home $45 the other $55 goes to the government, (and then everything you buy has 21% VAT tagged on of course). Giving up 55% of your salary for average quality schools, health care etc. is a great deal for many people who are (or want to) work an average number of hours a week for an average salary but becomes a worse and worse proposition as your salary moves away from average. I am somewhat career driven and want to work more than 38 hours a week and want to earn more than an average salary.

I'm not someone who has read too many Horatio Alger stories who wants to blindly chase the American Dream. I understand that if you're poor (or even average) in terms of wealth, America a terrible place to be but if you are qualified and hard working it still is 'the land of opportunity'.

It fits on a bumper sticker and conjures up images of jack-booted thugs on every corner.  And technically, it's true, *if* you understand certain definitions of violence and personal freedom.

These definitions can be counterintuitive, though.  ""Violence"" includes health regulations, food safety regulations, anti-discriminiation legislation, you name it.  This is widely understood in poli-sci circles, and almost always acknowledged that some level is necessary.  But the lay reader might not understand it, and this rhetoric isn't designed to explain it.

Meanwhile, ""personal freedom"" includes anything from child labor to hoovervilles to indentured servitude to outright confinement on one's property.  In some cases it even includes slavery.  After the Civil War, it certainly looked that way to the South, especially after some of the tragic abuses that happened during reconstruction, and I believe this is one origin of much of the radical conservatism in the US today.  

So it's not quite that simple.

Moreover, there is the practical effect of this rhetoric, which preys on liberal anxiety over the drug war and the late Bush administration, convincing them that government can't work.  What this does is cause them to stay home on election day, or vote 3rd party, and the practical effect is a TEA-Party controlled Congress.  

We start out with the assumption that government can't work, then we elect people who will prove it.  This ignores the principles of democratic socialism saying that government *can* work, and often does work.  I think it works better in Canada and Europe than here, and it requires making some changes, but I know electing the TEA party is the wrong direction here.

Finally, we *need* to get some sort of universal health care program in place.  What's going on in the US is nuts.  There's no excuse for all these bankruptcies, it's hurting real people, and it simply doesn't happen in other countries.

Topless sunbathing is unusual in the UK, but not unheard of.  We also have a few fully nude beaches (e.g. in Brighton, although I only saw a couple of naked men there on the one occasion I happened to visit, perhaps because it wasn't particularly warm that day).

The same (lack of great beaches, weather and/or topless sunbathing) could be said of many other European nations, particularly those in the North.  But that's more a function of climate than culture.  Women from those colder countries (e.g. UK, northern France, Germany, Netherlands, etc) are generally quite happy sunbathing topless when they travel to the warmer parts of Europe to visit the beach.  Some do, some don't.  But few would bat an eyelid at others doing it (the men usually expend great effort in not batting an eyelid, especially when in the presence of their significant others).

It can be a little unusual (speaking as someone from the UK) when you holiday with female friends (e.g. wives/gfs of friends, friends of wives/gfs, etc) because it often means that you get to see their breasts in all their naked, wobbling about on the beach, glory - an intimacy to which you are not usually privy to in rainy old blighty.

The only reason people didn't take that more seriously is that the crash took longer to arrive than expected. Most people who thought there'd be a crash thought it would start in 2006 or 2007.

But, anyhow: there was enough of a belief in the idea  that a crash was coming that the Dutch, U.K. and other European governments should have been extremely energetic about warning citizens about chasing high interest rates by depositing cash in big banks in little countries.

Even in the United States, it's pretty well-known, for example, that a bank that pays very high rates on savings is probably a shaky bank. Any adult with 50,000 euros to deposit who sees a bank in a little country is paying a very high rate of return should understand that there's probably a big risk premium built into that rate of return. 

Also: I wonder who down rated my post? Why would anyone think it's reasonable for governments and businesses to commit taxpayers in their home countries to take on absurd levels of financial risk for the benefit of well-to-do and rich people who live in other countries?

Sure, the United States and other countries take on large levels of debt, but they're taking on the debt so that we people in those countries can have roads, bridges, armies, space stations, etc. Not so that a retiree in another country who still has a fortune stashed away in other places can live it up.

And I understand, from reading the other posts here, that people in Iceland actually do plan to make good on deposit insurance arrangements, on their own terms, and it seems as if that's about all anyone can really expect from another country's deposit insurance arrangements, especially if, on the face of it, those arrangements are absurd.",t1_c29t3vx,True,True,t1_c29tnxo,,0,podkayne3000

Of course. First you think I didn't know it. Now you say I didn't read it.  So cogent.

The fact that Plan Dalet was implemented before the ""six armies"" attacked Israel in 1948 debunks your whole argument about who started what. 

&gt; Palestinians aren't our hosts. The nature of our relationships with Palestinians is not that of hosts and guests. The longer the Palestinians pretend that they are sole and rightful owners of all of the land in Palestine the longer the conflict will persist.

That's what all colonialists say. The French said it. The Boers said it too. Why would you be any different? Denying this fact (by a minority in Israel) is the reason why the conflict persists. 

Whatever you said above, it does not change the fact that Ashkenazi Jews still accepted injustice and ran away from their homes and properties in Europe. You just ran away from a bully to become bullies yourselves in another region.

I'm not saying *all* priests rape children, obviously.

I also wouldn't say that *all* computer programmers like ice cream. There are always exceptions to any blanket statement.

We're getting away from the point: I just want to know what the acceptable amount of child rape is for priests. I'm not saying that the priest doing the AMA has actually raped children yet - he's only been a priest for two years. My question is simply: at what point does the Church call the cops, instead of trying to cover it up? 2 raped kids? 10? 200? What's the threshold?
