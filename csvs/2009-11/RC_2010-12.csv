I do understand how Wikileaks publishes information, but I don't necessarily agree with their methods of publishing that information. They knowingly broke the law, as did PFC Manning. I do, however, approve of the censoring of certain names on the documents they have released. But I often wonder if they are just sharing what they have on the U.S. and withholding information they have that has been sent from other nations. How would we know? I don't mean to seem to you that I am defending my country like a dimwitted patriot, as I disagree with many policies we have, namely Iraq. I was deployed there for 18 months, and I still don't fully understand why we had to go in and do what we did.

That's my opinion, anyway, and I know there are many people strongly disagree with me, and that's okay.

The cables were communications between diplomats, not the general public. Some are unclassified, and I don't see how those would really affect anything. They are just boring field reports that diplomatic missions in ""safe"" nations send to Washington to let them know all is well. In my opinion, the most damning cables are the ones concerning the Middle East (especially Iran) and North Korea. Our government is working with other governments and sharing information to deal with these regimes, and letting the world know what they are talking about could lead to strained relations, ""disappearances"" of certain individuals, and who knows what else. Time will tell if any of these scenarios happen; it's still very early in the game, and not all of the cables have been released. Personally, I hope nothing happens.

If there was a need to disseminate information to the public, I believe my government (or France's, the United Kingdom's, etc.) would do it in a timely fashion as to not create panic. Perhaps I am too trusting of my government in your eyes, but so far, my government has been pretty good to me. I've had a decent standard of living since I was born, as have my parents, and hopefully my children, if and when I have them, and I trust my leaders to do what they can to maintain that.

I promise you, if Athletic Bilbao suddenly started playing 150% better and winning the title, you'd see the TV money change as well. Plus, titles bring in money, which they could use to buy better players, i.e. extending their good run.

What you mention here is why I am saying a cap could possibly help leagues. You say it yourself, because some clubs don't have the funds they cannot compete with top level clubs. How are teams supposed to start winning/ gain prominence if they are at such a severe disadvantage when spending money leads to the ability to spend more money and win more matches? With a cap that disadvantage is limited.

I do think a salary cap is not feasible for European Football because of its international nature, but I do think MLS is creating a good competitive environment for itself. Yes clubs will grow slower, and not be able to buy young talent from other clubs, but at least if my club makes good decisions, they have a decent chance at making a run for the title.    

Regarding relegation:
&gt;I really like your argument, relegation is something that would likely won't come to MLS, but it surely spurs bottom of the table teams to play. The anxiety of relegation and excitement of promotion really would add to the league.

&gt;It just doesn't seem fair to me that some teams get to compete for the championship year after year, while other clubs may never get that chance (or have very outside shot of getting the chance), or only compete for other things (compete to avoid relegation, compete to get into European championships, compete to win derbies/rivalries). I'm not saying these competitions don't make for exciting contests, but the fact that these are their most important battles for many or some clubs as opposed to battling for championships seems odd or unfair to me.

&gt;For example, I can understand feeling content or good after a season if my club beat their rivals handily and generally played well, but didn't happen to make a title run that year. But for that to be the ultimate goal I could hope for year in and year out as opposed to just a positive aspect of the season would frustrate me. If someone would explain how they feel about this to me it would be great.

If people walk away from their business, others take their place. The marketplace benefits from more motivated businesspeople.

&gt;the underlying premise that plowing money back into your business is a good is not sound

Okay, so your position is that business investment is bad? We should encourage businesses to shrink? Unemployment is great?

&gt;...that would lead to serious mis-allocations of resources.

If businesses misallocate resources and malinvest, other businesses will do this better and prosper. Losers die.  The marketplace benefits. 

&gt;Assuming your presumption is correct, wouldn't this lead to even more business failures?

Nobody is telling businesses they have to expand - or to take profits. These are business decisions that everyone will make differently. You're taking my argument too far.  A tax incentive to reinvest is exactly that - just an incentive.   So it will tip a few more businesspeople toward reinvestment - hopefully when it's sound to do so.  Somebody that malinvests deserves to fail, frankly. A better business will take its place.

&gt;if high marginal tax rates to some threshold spurs economic growth wouldn't the EU and other high tax areas be buzzing with start-ups...

&gt;you mentioned th 50's and the high tax rates. Correlation does not determine causation... Those rates were also in place during the Great Depression.

(unless you play losers ball, in which case you're just a nasty red commie socialist) 

Salary caps will never work in Europe, and should never be implemented. Just look at the difference between Real Madrid, a team with a glorious history (9 CLs, 31 La Ligas), in the bustling metropolis of Madrid, 80.000+ capacity stadium that's almost always full, close to a million official Madridista card holders (or Barca, or Man Utd, or Bayern, or AC Milan) and compare that team to e.g. Villareal, a team that plays in a town with a population of 51.000 (2009 census) and regularly fills a 25.000 seater stadium (that's 49% of the town's population) , and got to the semi's in the CL recently btw...poor Riquelme. The difference between the club's past history and their location just makes a salary cap completely impossible. Most clubs here in Europe have over 100 years of history, and the truly great clubs have built their name up over many decades of ups and downs. MLS is a new league, and there is simply no comparison what so ever to the European Leagues. MLS teams lack tradition, history, fan culture, supporters, and most importantly, trophies.  

The Danish league, where FC Copenhagen have a 40.000 seater (avg. att : 23000), and then a club like FC Nordsjælland gets a 1.017 attendance last weekend. You have to understand that the bigger the stadium, the bigger the revenue of tickets, concession stands, merchandise, etc etc... Obviously, the clubs with the most cash can be the most competitive ones, and you only get that cash injection by performing well and attracting supporters and sponsors, qualifying for Europe, winning titles, getting bonuses, developing players and selling them for a high price, etc... Inequality is needed, because when FC Nordsjælland then beats FC Copenhagen one day (as they sometimes do), it's a much sweeter victory than if they beat e.g. bottom table SønderjyskE. 

The MLS model might work well for you guys over there, but it will never, and should never work in Europe. While sometimes, the financial inequalities here are staggering, it also adds something to the excitement of the game. Yes, Man City is dogshit for trying to buy a trophy, but look at how even the haters are following their progress and wondering what will become of the oil-money funded project. Currently they're 4th, while Liverpool, England's most successful club, is struggling to remain mid-table. That's some exiting shit right there, regardless of what team you support. 3 weeks ago Chelsea seemed certain to stroll towards a back to back, but now people are wondering if they'll even get a top 3 finish. A season is a long campaing where a team has to prove it can compete over 38 games, and to have that hard work shattered in the playoffs is just insane (E.g. LA Galaxy wins all their games in the season, but due to bad referee calls in the first playoff round they dump out 0-1 and watch the team that finished 20 points below them become the champions... where's the justice and fairness in that?)

I like the European leagues and their format. You guys seem to like the MLS format. Let's just leave it as it is, eh? I'm sure that once soccer becomes more popular in the states, and more teams pop up, you will also get divisions, relegation battles, League cups, etc, but for now, I think we're good as we are.

True,1291179233,"As a student, I visited a monastery just outside of Vienna, in Austria; I had been living in Germany at the time.  You guessed it - military brat.  I'm neither now, nor was I then, particularly interested in or swayed by religion.  However, I quickly came to realize that this was the place that some clever fucking dudes hung out.  

Our tour guide, himself obviously of the cloth, but doubtfully himself a monk, was quite the skilled narrator.  As it were, he said, during the Napoleonic times, the Tiny's cronies went around fucking shit up for various reasons all across Europe.  Why they opted to hit this particularly well-hidden monastery was very likely explained to me in the most patient tone the German/Austrian language allows for, however, I simply do not recall, though it is irrelevant: They did, and it was ugly.  The monks, it was explained, ]were a proud people, who treasured their monastery and the surrounding land.  Of particular interest to them, as with all monasteries and the therein contained, was the once-great library contained within the walls of this fortress in ruins.  

Of course, the library, and all of its contents, were mercilessly destroyed, as was wont to happen in a siege such as that which took place.  Compounding this already grievous situation was the impending visit by one of the church's higher ranking dignitaries, purportedly sent to assess damage.  The proud monks, faced with the embarrassment of being unable to defend the walls that had protected them for so long, did what any man or men lacking the luxury of careful contemplation would do - they tried to hide the extent of the damage.  They rebuilt walls.  They addressed felled trees by removing more to create the appearance of intent.  They cleaned.  

Our guide knew his story like I know my keyboard.  It was explained to us that when the dignitary finally presented at the foot of the monastery, he was greeted by the proud people he wasn't sure to expect - heads held tall and all too eager to take the luminary on a tour to remember.  The grounds.  The brick path atop a wall over a hundred feet tall yet as broad as the shoulders of a slight man, which remained conspicuously unequipped with any kind of protective railing, that served as the sole connection between the two main buildings, loudly but beautifully overlooking the rushing river below.  

Now, the glorious entryway.  The ceilings, rebuilt and connected flat to the walls no differently than any cookie-cutter townhouse, but painted such that, from any possible angle appeared to gently and seamlessly slope from wall to ceiling.  Our guide explained *how* the monks achieved this effect, and I saw it with my own eyes, however, even when our guide showed us with a long pointing stick where the hard edge where the wall met the ceiling, it was impossible to *see* it.

The spiral staircase, appropriately ornate, but whose underside was spectacularly painted with a typical scene of religious ceremony - people draped in cloths, wine being drunk, food plentifully scattered across the table - such that when standing in the center, looking up, when one relaxed ones eyes and stared, the painting created the illusion of a flattened image.  

The library.  Being at the time young, I'd never been in a library that *smelled* as much as this.  Leather.  I now know that there is a not a whisky in the world that would not have tasted better in this room.  I do not believe these were trappist monks, nor do I believe there was ever a whisky-swilling equivalent, but I can only imagine.  

These walls, demonstrated the monks, as well as by our robed raconteur, were were lined floor to ceiling with the collected knowledge and history of a noble people whose very lives were dedicated to learning and preserving the word of their creed and the teachings of those who followed it.  The guest, adequately impressed, especially, as our guide pointed out, with the thickness and grandeur of the shelving, was led on, and eventually provided a feast and some repose.  

Our guide, now equipped with a shit-eating grin the likes of which I'll never forget, showed us what the monks could never show their dignified visitor.  He reached over, and pulled from a curiously clean section of an otherwise dusty span of shelf,  (clean likely because our guide stopped at the same location during the same part of a tour he'd clearly given many a time before), one of the thickest, tallest, and gloriously hide-adorned books I'd ever seen.  He said ""Knowing that you Canadians likely speak limited German, allow me to read to you the title of this book - 'Leather Bound Oak, volumes III'"".  We were silent.  He reached for another.  ""'The saga of the pinus nigra' - you may not know"", he said, ""but the pinus nigra is the proper name for the Austrian Pine.  This one - 'The Cold Travels of a Fir with no Fur"".  Still, not but silence.  Our teachers and parental chaperons, thankfully, shared our dumbfoundedness.  

Reaching out to one of the smaller girls, likely for effect, he offered her the book, asking her to open it to the third chapter.  She pulled back the cover, and the sound of 20 gentle gasps lit up our guide like he had finally solved, after months of trying, that damned Rubic's cube.

False,1291180407,"That's a pretty broad question, so I can't help you out specifically. To help you out broadly, however, here is the general rule:

* go to Latin America if you want to make almost nothing or pay to teach (seriously, some programs are like that)
* go to Asia if you want to get paid
* Europe is a toss up
* there's pretty much nothing in Africa

I graduated from college with an English degree. I thought about going to Latin America for a LONG time. In the end, I didn't, just because of student loans. Though you can't make as much money there (and often the things you are paying for is the certification programs, which I found tend to be required more in the Latin America region) I don't think that's a total ""no."" If you studied Spanish in HS and college like me it's a huge draw, and the culture is great.

I went to Asia, specifically Korea. BLAST (and no cert. required). Not what I was expecting, but it worked out well. The basic breakdowns for those are: 

* Japan: expensive living, better pay
* Korea: moderate living, moderate pay
* China: cheap, cheap

&gt;Which is not reality of the cost of nuclear.

Information derived from the International Energy Agency is reflective of real-world cost in developed countries, not just of nuclear, but of other forms of power as well.  Their data is used by energy companies worldwide, including renewables companies.

&gt;Comparing energy sources that have been massively subsidised and deployed for half a century / two centuries.

Even if you're just discussing renewables, you absolutely need to understand the importance of dollars spent per MWh.  To be clear, this is relevant when we're comparing between wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro, even if we take nuclear out of the discussion.  I'm not making this point out of intrinsic favor for one power source or another, I'm just pointing out an economic question that needs to be answered when considering plant development:

How much energy will we get per dollar over the life expectancy of a given power facility?

It's a spectacularly relevant question when choosing which specific technology to develop for a given location, and has incredible relevance to how quickly coal, oil, and gas can be replaced.  Replacing fossil fuels is my chief goal.

Even if you don't like nuclear owing to fear over its externalities or the potential for cost overruns, this is a concept you *must* understand if you are going to be able to adequately compare different sources of renewable energy.

&gt;you refuse to absorb evidence and arguments that do not fit your preconceived beliefs and wishes. 

I'm not operating with preconceived beliefs or wishes.  Frankly, I don't care what we use, so long as we can make it quickly and get rid of coal and oil.  I've made an assessment based on the evidence I've found.  I have absorbed the evidence you presented and added it to my own and found it to indicate the following:

* The most important thing is to stop using coal immediately.  It releases radiation into the atmosphere and results in massive release of greenhouse gasses.

* Generally, the most cost effective way to reduce CO2 emissions is to improve efficiency, particularly heating efficiency and transport efficiency. (This is actually the most salient point I derive from MacKay, has nothing to do with power generation, and seems to fit into your worldview)

* Drops in subsidies for renewables, despite lowering short-term growth rates, have the potential to stimulate development of cheaper technology.

* The cheapest form of renewable energy at the moment is wind power

* The next decade of research and product commercialization will confirm or deny the viability of widespread solar development.
 
* Nuclear power costs vary widely across the world.  Should new nuclear projects be undertaken in the US or Europe, I hope that better cost analysis is performed and that techniques are shared with countries like South Korea.  

* If cost analysis for a particular nuclear plant is unfavorable, I would not want it constructed.  I will not deny the technology out-of-hand, however I will approach it skeptically on a case-by-case basis.

Now I don't want you talk about me having some sort of 'nuclear fantasy' just because I don't have the same reactionary stance that you do against nuclear power.  I'm not beating the drums to build new nuclear power plants.  I'm not donating money to nuclear PACs.  I'm not envisioning some kind of 50's nuclear-car dreamland.  I'm not here to pick a side.  I am highly cognizant of the heated nature of the nuclear debate, including the history of public opinion regarding nuclear power.

You can tell me that I misunderstood some of the data, or that I don't understand the politics, but I have simply assessed the information I've found differently and remain skeptical, one way or the other, regarding modern fission technology.

The fact remains, you're not the only person with a strong opinion about nuclear power, and there are people who disagree with you who are able to cite numerous valid technical sources.  I have to listen to both you and them.

For anyone who does not feel like clicking:

Bullet points: 

""¶ A dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel: Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, “if the local media got word of the fuel removal, ‘they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan’s nuclear weapons,’ he argued.”

¶ Thinking about an eventual collapse of North Korea: American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the North’s economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode. The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would “help salve” China’s “concerns about living with a reunified Korea” that is in a “benign alliance” with the United States.

¶ Bargaining to empty the Guantánamo Bay prison: When American diplomats pressed other countries to resettle detainees, they became reluctant players in a State Department version of “Let’s Make a Deal.” Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in Chinese Muslim detainees, cables from diplomats recounted. The Americans, meanwhile, suggested that accepting more prisoners would be “a low-cost way for Belgium to attain prominence in Europe.”

¶ Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When Afghanistan’s vice president visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money “a significant amount” that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, “was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money’s origin or destination.” (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.)

¶ A global computer hacking effort: China’s Politburo directed the intrusion into Google’s computer systems in that country, a Chinese contact told the American Embassy in Beijing in January, one cable reported. The Google hacking was part of a coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government. They have broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002, cables said.

¶ Mixed records against terrorism: Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the “worst in the region” in counterterrorism efforts, according to a State Department cable last December. Qatar’s security service was “hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals,” the cable said.

¶ An intriguing alliance: American diplomats in Rome reported in 2009 on what their Italian contacts described as an extraordinarily close relationship between Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and business magnate, including “lavish gifts,” lucrative energy contracts and a “shadowy” Russian-speaking Italian go-between. They wrote that Mr. Berlusconi “appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin” in Europe. The diplomats also noted that while Mr. Putin enjoyed supremacy over all other public figures in Russia, he was undermined by an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignored his edicts. 

¶ Arms deliveries to militants: Cables describe the United States’ failing struggle to prevent Syria from supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has amassed a huge stockpile since its 2006 war with Israel. One week after President Bashar al-Assad promised a top State Department official that he would not send “new” arms to Hezbollah, the United States complained that it had information that Syria was providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the group.

¶ Clashes with Europe over human rights: American officials sharply warned Germany in 2007 not to enforce arrest warrants for Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in a bungled operation in which an innocent German citizen with the same name as a suspected militant was mistakenly kidnapped and held for months in Afghanistan. A senior American diplomat told a German official “that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.” 

Other: 

...it has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of Al Qaeda. But a cable’s fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, is breathtaking. 

...press reports detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session last year.

Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the aging monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan.

Speaking to another Iraqi official about Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, King Abdullah said, “You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not.” The king called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan the greatest obstacle to that country’s progress. “When the head is rotten,” he said, “it affects the whole body.”

The American ambassador to Eritrea reported last year that “Eritrean officials are ignorant or lying” in denying that they were supporting the Shabab, a militant Islamist group in Somalia. The cable then mused about which seemed more likely.

As he left Zimbabwe in 2007 after three years as ambassador, Christopher W. Dell wrote a sardonic account of Robert Mugabe, that country’s aging and erratic leader. The cable called him “a brilliant tactician” but mocked “his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics).”

False,1291197606,"Here's the thing, the French peasants (or the Russian peasants, or the Chinese peasants, take your pick) *felt* that they were being screwed by the elites. First, they recognized that they *weren't* the elites, second they recognized that the elites were treating them badly, and third they recognized that the elites weren't going to treat them any better just because they played nice.

In America, your typical white middle class voter recognized none of these things when they happen. First, he's so terrified of blacks/immigrants/muslims/whoever taking away what he has, he doesn't notice that he has practically nothing. In being preoccupied with losing what little he possesses, he is essentially taking the mindset of the rich, the mindset of ""maintain the status quo no matter what, because I have a vested interest."" No, average middle class white voter, you don't. You have a variable interest rate 50 year mortgage and a 60 hour/week job you hate. You've got little more to lose from revolution than the Mexicans you're so terrified of. But it's long ago been established that middle class whites will vote against their own interests if you convince them they've got a lot to lose, and scare them about all the nasty people who want to take it from them. Second, this typical voter doesn't notice how poorly he's being treated. 90% of the economic growth in the last thirty years has been concentrated in the top 10% of earners. We lose more and more of our slice of the pie while we work longer hours, lose our unions and our benefits, and if you point out how ludicrous our system is compared to the Europeans, most Americans will just scratch their head in bafflement, as if it was nonsensical to compare other states with America as if they were real countries. Finally, the myth persists that if we just trust the rich, they will reward us, that if we give them our money they will return it to us with dividends. The average voter has been told, and still believes, that his employer creates wealth, and all he does from 9 to 5 is push it around for him. We've been waiting 30 years for that trickle down effect to happen, and so far the opposite trend has persisted.

Go back to the 1780s. Successfully convince a typical Sans Culottes that 1) he could be an aristocrat if only he'd wash behind his ears, and look what a nice shack you have now, don't throw it all away, 2) the king's court has only his best interest in mind, and 3) that if he'll only go back to work and stop all this foolishness, the government will surely make the bread prices go down.

&gt; I'd rather take the La Liga two horse race, where the two horses include the best goalkeeper, the best defenders, the best midfielders, best attacking players in the world and is mainly composed of players from the World Champions, than a balanced MLS where playoffs decide who wins and players from Europe only see as attractive when they are at the end of their career and know they will profit in America and be an undisputed starter, where as most clubs in Europe would have them on the bench.

Maybe *you* would.  This is, though, in no sense objectively the case.  I loved watching el Clasico, but what made it so thrilling to watch - the teams as you described them - is also in some ways a serious problem.  I mean, you're not seriously suggesting, I hope, that it is in some sense actually *good* that two teams in La Liga have, between them, 10 members of the World Cup winning team, and almost all of the regular starters.  Take a look at the current Spain international squad.  Atletico Bilbao has a few, Villareal has a few, and the Premier League sides have a few.  No one else in the *world* has *any*.  Not a *single player*.  Do you honestly think it is preferable, that it is something to be striven for, something born of Europe's long football experience, that two clubs should so completely monopolize the talent of the country in which they play - and that a handful of clubs should so completely monopolize the talent of the entire world?

MLS is decades behind the European leagues in skill and experience, perhaps (although not *all* of the European leagues, not definitely).  But it's not skill and experience that has created the enormous imbalance in the European Leagues.  It's simply laughable to suggest that Europe, in its superior wisdom and with its decades of practice, *decided* to create leagues in which only a half-dozen clubs would ever be treated as serious contenders; leagues in which those clubs have so *much* more money and prestige than the rest of the sides in their respective leagues that deep systemic changes will need to be made if any of the lesser sides are *ever* again to become contenders.  Quite the opposite, in fact - as I've sad, the problems with European Leagues raised in this article are problems *fans* of those leagues raise regularly, problems people regularly suggest are in dire need of repair before it's too late.  To suggest that Real and Barcelona are better than 90% of the world's sides by an order of magnitude because European football *wanted* it that way is to indulge in a simple fiction.

This isn't about who has the better players - Europe, although buying the best players from literally everywhere else on Earth helps.  This isn't about who plays the most attractive football - Europe again, although the same caveat applies.  This is about who has the more balanced league, and whether having a balanced league is a good thing.

At this point you can add liquid to the mixture if you want, you don't need to but I'd suggest you do. I'd stay away from water, as it doesn't bring any flavor to the party.  I like olive oil; I think it makes it rich and delicious. You really need to eye-ball it, because the moisture content of butter will vary from brand to brand.

After 2 minutes of whipping, stop the mixture and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and restart the whipping for another minute or two until it’s where you want it. You’ll notice a change in texture and a change it color making it lighter. Store your newly whipped butter in an airtight container.

 I’d suggest storing it in the refrigerator, but others may disagree. Often American butter is high in moisture content, making it more prone to spoilage than European butter. Butter by itself is made up of a lot of saturated fats, which are better protected against the unsaturated fats in olive oil.  It will keep for a few days at room temp, but more than that I’d pop it in your chill box.

They don't have the network to provide every user with continuous 6Mbps which is what you are asking them to deliver.  Best guess at the subscription cost if you want that level of service is 20x your current fee.

The reason for the current conflict is that the cost of providing video is primarily on Comcast.  Expanding the data center to deliver the video to the peering point is relatively cheap compared to digging down cable.

So, Akamai solves the problem by placing CDN nodes inside Comcasts network.  They pay for the privilege, but they pay less than if they used L3s model where the servers have to cross a peering point because the impact on Comcasts network is less.  Think of it as a financial incentive to build the right technical solution.  And Akamai's solution is technically much preferable to L3's.  L3 took the easy route, trying to take the money while leaving the cost to Comcast.  Incompetence or from malice, who knows.

War is an act of aggression committed by governments.  This has nothing to do with individual gun ownership for self protection.  

&gt;It may be that firearms don't shoot themselves and that regular tools like knives and hammers can be used as weapons, however it's a weak argument since they cannot cause the psychological and physical damage a gun can cause.

As someone who's been slashed at with a knife, I have to call bullshit again.  If you are ever threatened by someone with a knife, hammer or screwdriver, and you believe the person is fully capable of using said instrument, then you will see how much psychological or physical damage can occur. 

&gt;First, firearms are ranged weapons.

That take skill and training to use properly.  You think someone with no experience with firearms is going to have much success hitting anything more than 20 feet away with a 9mm?  Not likely.  It takes practice to learn how to aim and shoot properly.  

&gt;If someone attacks you with a knife or a hammer, it's not unthinkable to evade or disarm the attacker; the same can't be said about guns, targets are defenseless.

Again, this comes down to skill and training.  You really think an untrained individual will be able to disarm someone with a knife?  Not likely.

&gt;I don't think many would attempt to rob a store with a hammer.

Heck, I've seen video of someone trying to rob a store with a palm tree.

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean that only people that passed a long-ass test to get a patent.

What kind of tests?  Who determines the tests?  Who says who is allowed to own a firearm?  Why should someone be able to tell me whether or not I can own a means of protection for myself, my home and my family?

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean to destroy all the unauthorized firearms around, so that they don't get in the wrong hands, and not to allow anyone but people that are trained and authorized to carry guns to buy them.

Hahaha...wow, what an impossible utopia you paint here.  You really think you could 'destroy all the unauthorized firearms around'?  That is impossible.  Inmates in maximum security prisons (tightest controlled environments around) have gotten their hands on firearms.  

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean that every single bullet sold is linked to its buyer.

You do know that people can make their own bullets...right?  Plus, with these laws, all you are doing is disarming law abiding citizens.  You think criminals give a shit about gun laws?  Hell, even in countries with the strictest gun laws, the criminals still have guns.

Correlation and causation are two separate things.  I can also compare the US to countries like Canada and Switzerland.  So what?  Its not the access to guns that is the problem.

False,1291235596,"I am responding to [this request](http://www.reddit.com/r/BooksAMA/comments/e1qel/request_someone_whos_read_eating_animals_by/) by blackstar9000 for a non-vegetarian viewpoint on this book.  I have a family background in farming and have personally avoided industrially-produced meat since I read The Omnivore's Dilemma a few years ago.  I do try to support local farms and I do buy organic / healthy meat.  My diet is about 90% vegetarian, but I do enjoy humanely produced, organic meat and fish as a source of protein.

My dad grew up on a very large multi-faceted farm.  His dad was uneducated, ambitious and greedy.  He worked his family into the ground - at a certain point my grandma's knees gave out from all the work.  At one point I wondered how my grandpa made so much money, and my dad admitted he used strong fertilizers to maximize his crops, back before they were illegal.  Still, they all worked very hard.  My grandpa equated money with love and pitted his sons against each other to earn the family inheritance.  My dad got out, but the other 4 brothers have had stints in mental facilities.

My dad credits the book-mobile for showing him a world outside of the farm.  He rebelled and went to college, majored in agronomy, lived in Europe for a while, and taught high school vo/ag classes when he moved back to MN.  Then he got a masters in Econ and started a tax practice for farms and farm corporations in his area.  He bought the small hobby farm where I grew up and always planted bountiful gardens, rotated crops in the fields for tax breaks, raised Christmas trees, and occasionally cared for a few turkeys or chickens.  He's a hunter and fisherman, and knows the names of every plant and animal.

I helped slaughter turkeys a few times, and there's nothing fun about it, but it was honest work.  We always grew sweet corn and pumpkins and I would sell them on the side of the road for school clothes money.  

My mom grew up on a ranch in rural eastern Montana.  Her parents started the ranch from nothing on the deserted prairie.  They lived in a tar paper shack until they could afford a house.  The barn came first.  They had 7 children, and passed the ranch down to their youngest son, who continues to raise Angus steer.  My grandparents were incredibly hard-working and frugal.  My grandma had an enormous garden, did a ton of canning and freezing.  She made all of their bread, most of their clothing, and mended tarps and things for the ranch.  She had a chicken house for eggs and meat.  She still complains about what a dirty job cleaning it out was.  She also complains about how chicken and eggs just don't taste right anymore.  Our family gets free beef from the family ranch and until I left home I didn't realize how much better tasting it was than what's commercially available.  

What amazes me most is that in choosing to avoid industrially produced meat, I am part of such a tiny minority.  The book ends with a discussion of turkey production, which was timely as I finished it over the Thanksgiving break.  My boyfriend brined and roasted an organic local turkey to perfection.  However, my dad bought a turkey from Willmar, MN where he grow up.  Willmar is the largest producer of turkeys in the country.  I tasted a little bit of it out of curiosity, and you know what?  I couldn't taste anything wrong with it.  The misery and hormones pumped into the meat is undetectable, to me at least.  I choose not to eat it for other reasons, but I can see why most people choose to remain blissfully ignorant.  

It's a socially contentious thing for me, avoiding inhumanely produced meat.  My friends and family don't usually want to eat at the local food veggie-heavy restaurants I suggest - they want wings and nachos and ribs.  I start to feel like a jerk, but it's too important to give into their ignorance.  I'll keep trying, and hope to influence them.

You can get C_(t+1) on the left side of the equation and everything on the right will be measurable now (and from past data) and the value on the left can be measured in the future. You can use the model now to predict the future, then measure the error after measuring real consumption in the future. You can test the model's error this way.

It looks like a very simple/naive model. Sometimes simple models perform very well (usually when the behavior or a system is dominated by a few variables. The other ones don't matter much). Of course, sometimes simple models are terrible. Also, the ""performance"" of a model is relative. It depends on what you are trying to do with the model. Sometimes a simpler model with poorer error is sufficient for the task at hand. Of course sometimes it really isn't.

Let say, for example, that this model is being used to figure out how to tweak interest rates in order to increase consumer spending vs. saving in order to stimulate the economy. Let's also say that the strategy is failing, and that through some other means we know that the strategy is failing because of errors in the model (interest rates aren't the only driver of consumption after all). If that is the case then the European central banks using the model surely deserve some criticism for it.

However, at no point will that criticism lend support to Austrian economics. That's not how it works. Discrediting the model doesn't somehow give credit to the alternative economic theory of your choice. At the end of the day, Austrian theory barely makes any predictions.

If youll look at 1905 with me, on page 67 and going as far as you want to go youll find that even 100 years ago more women were going to high school than men and MORE WOMEN WERE EARNING DEGREES than men (now to get this second number you have to add the BS degrees from co-ed institutions with the ones for women-only institutions).  So Im going to assume that youre talking about some kind of patriarchy before 1904.

Thats about as far back as I can go in the records.  So, unfortunately, I cant really ""prove"" that a patriarchy didnt exist (realistically you can never prove a negative and the burden of proof would be on you to begin with)  Just like I cant prove theres no God.

From that Im going to plead with you to please reconsider my position.  That maybe, just maybe, the things that you have been told about male oppression and the patriarchy are not really based on any kind of facts or figures.  

That maybe, just possibly, an entire generation of women have grown up mistrustful and resentful of men for no real reason.

But there are the datasets.  Thats the data.  If you find something absolutely PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  It doesnt have to be today, it doesnt even have to be you.

False,1291251247,"&gt;If not, I'd start with James Q. Wilson's “Bureaucracy”.
Huh, does HE define the term in there? Because that would be nice.

Bureaucracy is a term that has been used by social scientists for more than a century, since at least Max Weber.  It's relatively well defined.  You can start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy 
&gt;I repeat, have you ever made systematic study of the behavior of large organizations? Because I have, in fact, it's what I went to school for.
Did you start this conversation thinking I had? I find it odd that you imply an argument from authority at this point in the discussion.
That pattern of failure of the USSR is interesting...

Arguing from evidence is not the same as argument from authority.  My point is that you seem very convinced that planning can work.  WHY do you think that?  WHERE did you get that idea?  My opinions have come from my study of these issues.  On subjects I haven't studied (15th century Slavic love poetry, brain surgery) I tend not to have strong opinions.  If you haven't studied these topics, isn't it possible that your strong opinions come from emotion rather than logic and evidence?
&gt;I've given a couple justifications. A) Markets rely on smaller organizations. Walmart is the largest employer in the world and it has less than 2 million employees and most companies are far smaller. You're talking about a planner that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the largest company in the world. B) when market operators get too large or inefficient, they tend to be eliminated by their competitors. No such automatic mechanism exists for a central planner. C) These exact arguments have been made for more than 100 years and yet numerous attempts at central planners have consistently failed to outperform markets over the long run, and many of them have ended in starvation, genocide, and ecological devastation. This is strong evidence that what you assume can be done cannot. D) At the most basic level, every man hour you spend planning is a man hour that can't be spent producing. Since you're anticipating a planning body of millions, if not tens of millions, you're starting in a deep hole.
A) Yes, it will be big and you've given zero justification that a large organization can't be more efficient, given the proper structure. Or are you going to bring back the Second Law?
My second law metaphor says that organizations will tend to get less efficient over time, not that a given organization cannot be efficient.  However, information theory does says that large organizations tend to be less efficient.  So does almost every book on corporate governance, bureaucracy, management, or organizational theory ever written.  Now, it's true that these books argue that the advantages of size (more capital, economies of scale, etc.) can overcome the inherent disadvantages, but no one argues that growth doesn't impose large costs.
&gt;Further, even assuming it must be inefficient, you've offered no metric, not even approximate, to compare how inefficient it would be relative to a market as a whole. (not a single small efficient organization)

What metric would you like me to use? 

&gt;B) Your use of 'automatic' again pretends reliable free decisions. There is no reason a system internal to the planner could not be every bit as 'automatic' as market forces.

Automatic does not mean free.  Individuals and corporations have expenses, which means they are constantly bleeding money.  In order to survive, they have to take positive action to bring in more money.  Capitalism is like an ocean with a giant whirlpool populated by boats.  If the captains of boats do nothing, they'll eventually sink.  If they waste fuel (i.e. money) steaming toward whirlpool rather than away (i.e. offer the wrong products at the wrong prices) they'll sink.  Large boats might sink slower than small boats, but they're also a lot harder to turn in a new direction.  
In a centrally planned system, nothing is supposed to happen that the planner does not will to happen, which means that the The Bureau of X will do whatever it does until someone actively decides to eliminate it.  The default is survival, not elimination.    
Now, you're probably saying, “so what, the planner can just eliminate what he wants when he wants to”.  And sure, in theory, there's no difference.  But in practice the difference is huge.  Eliminating sub units in a large organization tends to be exceedingly difficult.  In any large organization the people at the top cannot know about the existence of all of the units below them, much less how they are performing.  And even if your central planner is omniscient, the people in the sub units will scheduled for elimination will likely resist, for both selfish and noble reasons.  They won't want to lose their jobs, but more importantly they will probably believe that they are doing good work.  Most people won't readily admit, even to themselves, that what they do every day is totally useless.

What's even worse is that can actually we worse than useless.  A market gardener that killed his customers plants quickly stops getting hired, but a centrally planned killer gardener will keep coming back until his superiors reassign him.  An impossible example you say?  Just look at the history of collectivized agriculture.  Over the course of the 20th century, just about every communist country tried to collectivize agriculture at some point.  The result was almost invariably famine, massive peasant resistance, and crop failures.   Yet new governments kept trying to collectivize agriculture on the grounds of increased efficiency.  Some even collectivized, were forced by peasant revolt to back down, then tried again!  By the end of the USSR the 3% of the land that was in private plots was producing ten times as much per acre as the collectivized land, and even the official soviet figures admitted that their farmers were, on average, only 20% as efficient as American farmers.  Before WWI, the Russian empire was Europe's breadbasket.  The USSR took over and spent enormous sums on agriculture, had an enormous amount of good farmland, and a lot of land relative to it's population, but still somehow managed to have constant food shortages and had to rely on importing grain.",False,True,cassander,,0,0,,TheAgora,0,1,,t1_c16vdw9,t3_e7qre,c17knva,t5_2s584,t1_c17knva,1426606196,1

  It's primarily a difference between Greek and Latin roots.  Both words use the Latinate -naut for the end, which essentially has to do with sailing (e.g. nautical, duh).  Astro- comes from the Latin aster, star, while cosmo- is from the Greek cosmos, universe.  So the words have subtly different connotations: an astronaut sails around among the stars, a cosmonaut sails around the entirety of the universe.  I know very little Russian but my sense is that it's more inclined to Greek than Latin forms of Indo-European words, although I could totally be imagining that.

Right, because that's totally the same thing. 

From my experience it works like this. Scandinavian countries let in large numbers of people as ""refugees"" from the middle east and africa, mainly from Muslim countries. They are given benefits and housing, usually in a place with lots of other immigrants. Since Scandinavian societies are actually very insular but have generous benefits they tend to stay on benefits and develop a fierce hatred for the ""Svens"", i.e. the native Scandinavians. In Sweden there are areas [which are a majority immigrant with a huge unemployment rate, high crime and which the police or even the fire brigade won't visit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosengård)

http://exilen.eu/showthread.php?1771-Financial-Times-skriver-om-den-svenska-m%C3%A5ngkulturen...

&gt; In Herrgarden, kids from diverse backgrounds do mix. But at schools composed almost wholly of migrants, they find it hard to feel an attachment with wider society. “My passport says I’m Svensk, but in the apartment, no,” says Lulli’s Turkish pal Nihad. “In Herrgarden, if someone has a problem, we help him. The Swedes, they are very cold. They shake hands. We kiss. Not like gays, like brothers.”
&gt;
&gt; Fuelled by resentment against native Swedes, some go into town on a Friday or Saturday night to indulge in a little light mugging of what they call “the Svens”. The police think only about 150 youths are involved. At least these youngsters speak Swedish. For their parents, it can be much harder. Cushioned by social security but imprisoned by linguistic inadequacy, many of the unemployed hardly go out. The migrants are here physically, but many have not made the mental leap.
&gt;
&gt; “It’s OK here,” says Nihad’s father, Sala, who still works in Turkey. “But it’s cold, and it’s not home. Nihad, though, he has more chance.”

Now the other model of immigration would be the US one. Immigrants tend to need to find jobs to be able to get in because benefits are not so generous. They tend to melt into the local population and there is no great problem culturally. Vietnamese and Chinese people don't have as high a cultural barrier in integrating into Vancouver as Muslims do into Scandinavia.

I.e. if you let people in to work, you will have no problem. If you let people in as refugees and let them live on benefits you will have a huge problem.

&gt; I don't think that's a problem with the population being too foreign, it's not like the kids are talking in Arabic at his school. Kid just dosen't know how to make friends, maybe he has assburgers?

Let's see we have two competing theories here - one is that the kid has ""assburgers"" and won't make friends anywhere.

&gt;*Israel used cluster bombs in Lebanon in 1978 and in the 1980s. Those weapons used more than two decades ago by Israel continue to affect Lebanon.[41] During the 2006 war in Lebanon Israel fired large numbers of cluster bombs in Lebanon, containing an estimated more than 4 million cluster submunitions. In the first month following the ceasefire, unexploded cluster munitions killed or injured an average of 3-4 people per day.

True,1291295402,"&gt; ...just focus on the economics of price per MWh. 

That's a snapshot of only one component - and not enough to determine the 'winner'. I've already provided several others which I won't repeat again.

&gt; It's a concept that is incredibly important even if you're just comparing different forms of renewable energy.

It's not as important as many think - and certainly not the only one, although I understand why it looks so persuasive to people who haven't read widely on the subject.

&gt; The only way in which the historical curve of technological investment matters is in how it affects future learning-curve trends. 

Nope. 200+ years of investment and deployment of fossils has created a global infrastructure that gives fossil an embedded advantage. Similar for nukes. And yet both still receive massive subsidies. Renewables are just getting started and need the playing field levelled in order to compete.

&gt; In other words, how much less will a solar panel cost 20 years from now? 

It's going down. That's an absolute certainty. The efficiency is going up. And the capital cost today is not the only factor that determines solar's viability. Again: you cannot put nukes on your roof or in a remote village in Africa.

&gt; ...not cost after research hurdles have been met decades down the line.

Not research is needed for solar to work today. Deployment will drive down costs further and improve the technology.

&gt; Capital cost - Financing is included in cost per MWh.

You're missing the point. I could build a wind farm for $100 million and have it grid connected in a year or two. Then I could do another. Same for solar plant. Or I could do like Germany and have a continuous stream of deployment on the roofs of every house in the country.

I'd need $10 or $20 billion and 10+ years for a nuke - with a high chance of project failure in a market where energy costs are falling for renewables. By the time it's complete it might be *very* uncompetitive. These are some of the reasons nukes are not being built.

&gt; Most renewables aren't generated at the point of consumption. 

But they can be and they are. See wind in Denmark. See solar in Germany. Nukes cannot - and offer large, single points of failure.

&gt; The smart grid concept involves sharing power across a wider area 

Yes, it's needed - and another selling point for renewable - a much more stable, resilient grid with millions of energy generators.

&gt; ...if I invest $10 billion dollars into solar thermal power today...

But that's not how it works. You invest $100 million and have a power plant online within a couple of years. The next plant will cost less and be completed more quickly. Or mandate a FIT scheme and MWs a day can be connected on thousands of roofs - with all the economic benefits that brings in terms of employment (see Germany).

&gt; At the end-of-life for a given plant, how much energy did my money get me?

Hopefully you can now see that is not the only or necessarily most important factor.

&gt; Wind produces cheaper power than solar, so wind gets developed more heavily.

In most places, yes. So install wind. But you can still do both and take the long-term view and invest in the infrastructure to compete in a market that is forecast to grow massively over the next decade - see Germany, see China.

&gt; Once you understand why energy costs are important...

Once you understand that snapshot $ / kWh costs - often based on historic numbers and estimates - are not the only or necessarily most important factor, you will realise why renewables are being deployed everywhere and nuclear is not. That trend will continue and accelerate as renewables fall further in cost.

You'll also understand why there are projections, such as: European Commission report projects that 41% of all energy installations in the next 20 years will be wind. Another 23% will come from other renewables like solar, biomass and hydro. 17% of new capacity to come from gas, 12% from coal, 4% from nuclear and 3% from oil. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/09/wind-and-solar-the-action-continues?cmpid=rss

True,1291311678,"Complete and utter greedhead horseshit (TM). You really don't know what you're talking about, or are merely repeating Union Carbide's talking points. How's that feel?

Union Carbide placed the plant there specifically so they could reap the enormous monetary savings from not having to deal with safety regulations, and to not have to train and pay workers prevailing wages elsewhere.

Court documents indicate the Union Carbide CEO and others new EXACTLY what conditions were like at the plant. Shithead CEO Warren Anderson is still awaiting manslaughter charges in India, but America won't extradite him.

Every element, from the ‘unproven’ Alpha Napthol unit down to the MIC plant, had been designed by UCC, or else approved by design engineers in the US.

All over Europe the maximum permissible storage limit for the chemical MIC was half a ton. At the Bhopal plant, the US company’s management overrode the wishes of its local managers and kept the storage capacity hazardously high at over 90 tons. On the night of the disaster, 67 tons of MIC were stored in two tanks.

In an affidavit given to a court in Manhattan, Eduard Muñoz, who had been Union Carbide’s managing director of the Indian subsidiary, said that the Carbide engineering group responsible for designing the Bhopal plant had recommended installation of three large tanks for storing MIC (methyl isocyanate). Muñoz opposed the plan because ‘only token storage was necessary, preferably in small containers, based on economic and safety considerations.’ Munoz was overruled. According to independent experts, like the Centre for Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, the excessive volume of MIC stored in Bhopal was the most critical factor in the disaster.

Safety audits at the Bhopal plant were performed by UCC’s American engineers and after a 1981 phosgene leak killed a worker, Ashraf Khan, it was the management committee in New York who decided what should be done. A ‘business confidential’ safety audit in May 1982, identified 61 hazards, 30 of them major and 11 in the dangerous phosgene/MIC units.

**As a result safety measures were improved at Union Carbide’s MIC plant in West Virginia but not Bhopal.**

In February 1984, a safety audit of the West Virginia plant raised major concerns that a runaway reaction could occur in one of the MIC Unit storage tanks, and that there would be no way to prevent catastrophic failure of the tank. **The warning was not passed on to Bhopal.**

True,1291313410,"&gt;Islam is extremely responsible for almost all of modern science. 
I'll let the terrible grammar go for a second and make a counterpoint based what you've attempted to say here.

Islam isn't responsible for any science, the things Muslims have discovered aren't solely because of Islam, just in the same way I wouldn't say Atheism 
is responsible for the invention the calculator, just because the inventor or discoverer of something holds certain religious or non-religious beliefs, doesn't mean their beliefs are responsible. The Qu'ran, if anything, would have intellectually held Muslims back. Muslims even to this day teach creationism and stuff like 'salt water and fresh water do not mix together' just because it says so in the Qu'ran, and this kind of thing is happening in developed countries like the UK

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3lwa8faV9s

Skip to 8:00 and forward for what the Qu'ran teaches on salt and fresh water (in a UK school).


&gt; Speaking of space travel, guess who reverted to Islam? Neil Armstrong.

He didn't revert to Islam, as he was never a Muslim in the first place, and isn't now.

&gt;Muslims knew poor health came from being unwashed back in the 6th 
century, before any European ever stepped into a bath.

I guess you've never heard of the [Roman Thermae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae) then?


&gt;when christian europeans met pagans they killed slaughtered them or turnes them into slaves. As the founding fathers of America such as jefferson admired the tolerance of Islam and used it as the basis for their society.

Wait what? Jefferson was a slave owner.

&gt;Womens rights started in Islam as well. never before in western history could a woman own land, a business, slaves or investments.

Research Paganism, which you were talking about above.

&gt;The world had benefitted so much from Islam and still has much more to learn.

Undoubtably, followers of Islam have contributed to much of the science which modern science is built upon, but Islam, like all religions is incapable of lability and that is what fundamentally makes religion itself (not its followers) incapable from contributing to science.

It's been 10 years now, I've gone from being a depressed anti social high school kid with no plans to being an anti-social adult with hopes and dreams. I'm top brain in an extremely high level of tech support (people pay me extra to figure out non company problems, although I don't like taking their money to do it) :(

I used to grind my teeth, cry alot, and would have killed myself if I had stronger willpower (had a crazy parent, was raised to be extremely self critical and strive to work really hard following guidelines people always told me I should). Then I got high, people started to be able to spend time around me without me pushing them away. I made friends, lost weight, got laid when I wanted too, and lived my next ten years in sweet fuckin bliss.

I've been their awhile, and now I've started looking at the other things people tell me with a new eye, and I wonder how much of my life and my potential I have wasted because of the values I grew up with.....

Recently kicked weed to help me kick cigarettes, and work on my diet (getting older and getting fat again :) still cant shake the cigs, much more addicting).


WARNING: THIS COMMENT DEGRADES INTO A SHAMELESS RANT FROM THIS POINT ON, BUT I ENJOYED IT AND FOUND IT THERAPEUTIC SO FUCK YALL :D (sent that reader a smiley, readers love smileys{this feels so good to express that I'm getting giddy})

Other lies I feel have hurt me. Ive spent months now trying to learn where I was wrong (this is what brought me to reddit).

How about American dietary science? Heart disease, obesity, and diabetes run rampant in our country, but it must all be from sedentary lifestyles huh? I mean, our ancestors were so health conscious, they ate mostly vegetables and did several hours cardio every day, with perfect hygiene to boot. I definitely feel the guilt reaction when the doctors who advise the population tell me I'm a shitty lazy person who should be ashamed and work harder. Fuck you. I spent 5 years washing streets for a living, I'm always moving furniture or fixing a car or something, If working a 5.5 hour shift moving loads of cargo at FedEx (eating 1000 calories of mostly carbohydrates.) cant make me lose weight, somebodies lying to me. I hurt all the time all over from trying to do what they told me would make me a better happier healthier person.

Surely its not the carb/fat/protein ratios we've been told to eat since 1955. Surely fat and cholesterol are what makes us fat and clogs our arteries with cholesterol. It cant be the fact that were spiking our blood sugar with high percentages of highly processed carbohydrates we were never evolved to metabollically process. (4 days into an Atkins diet (kicked weed at the same time) {later shifting to lifelong hypoglycemic diet, and lots of tasty buds to keep me calm}, kicking carbs was like kicking drugs. Now that the headaches and hot flashes are gone I feel great, and have to force myself to eat enough to keep my metabolism burning hot.{of course it's only been a few days, long term results may vary})

How about America the great, where we're all so strong and great. And everybody Loves us. Fuck you again. We spend our lives Idolizing the people we wish we could be, so we can be independently wealthy, perfect, and always happy. You know why video games are so popular here? cause we all have to spend high percentages of our time escaping ourselves or we'll go nuts. We have been trained to react with hostility if anyone mentions a form of government or organization that give's a voice and validity to people who work for a living. Every other country in the western world has political parties and organizations that protect the rights of the masses, and have a much higher standard of living than us. 

I mentioned considering moving to Europe to my grandparents and they thought I would be throwing myself to the dogs. They voted republican of course, thinking that we need to give money to the rich so they can protect themselves from having to give to the poor( If you think the republican party is trying to protect you from big government and socialism, your a fucking idiot; we've been social animals since before we were human, and the reason a rich powerful man wants a smaller government is because it increases his own power over the powerless {btw most people I speak to who are against social support have claimed unemployment, government college credits, and bought a house so they could get that nice homebuyer's credit}). 

BUT

I believe these things are coming to a head, and people won't stand by much longer (see the youtube video commented on here today where a soccer stadium mobs a group of security guards who beat a protester they have pinned to the ground, It gives me hope.)

I hope it will either get better or worse, and that right soon.

Trinidad was probably the hottest world cup before this, and the average summer temperatures are no where close to the average temperatures for Qatar.

The decision to hold the world cup in Qatar was political, and I am ashamed of FIFA for doing that. Sure, they want to diversify the faces that are seen in the footballing world. I just don't think putting players' health at risk is the right way to do it. The europeans are just going to melt in the heat lol

Having said that, the UAE (similar temperatures to Qatar) regularly host countries like South Africa and Australia during cricket tournaments. Not to mention their domestic football leagues, international football matches. Fun fact: Foreign players like Gabriel Batistuta, Fernando Hierro and Romario have played in Qatar before.

In terms of security, holding a world cup in South Korea or South Africa is almost the same as holding a world cup in Qatar. South Africa has a lot of domestic problems, ad South Korea is more politically unstable.

True,1291317002,"&gt;The Turks took over most of the inventing after that

I guess.. the Turks WERE and still ARE mostly Muslims. I never referred to Arabs in my comments.

&gt;banishing the guy who invented flight in Turkey

The first recorded flight attempt by any Muslim was made by Abbas Qasim Ibn Firnas (Armen Firman) who was an Andalusian. This man made 2 flight attempts in his life that were almost 40 years apart. The ""guy"" you r speaking about however was Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi. in the writings of Evliyâ Çelebi: he said ""First he practiced by flying over the pulpit of Okmeydani eight or nine times with eagle wings, using the force of the wind. Then, as Sultan Murad Khan (Murad IV) was watching from the Sinan Pasha mansion at Sarayburnu, he flew from the very top of the Galata Tower and landed in the Doğancılar square in Üsküdar, with the help of the south-west wind. Then Murad Khan granted him a sack of golden coins, and said: 'This is a scary man. He is capable of doing anything he wishes. It is not right to keep such people,' and thus sent him to Algeria on exile. He died there"". This says that it had nothing to do with the ""God would not want us to fly, or he would have given us wings."" nonsense you mentioned.

&gt;Many heavy artillery guns were invented by Europeans hired by the Turks, using technology from the Chinese

According to Guinness book of world records: The world's oldest dated cannon in existence, is the Dardanelles Gun, cast in 1464 for Sultan Mehmet II in Turkey. It is made from bronze, weighs 16.8 tonnes (37,037 lb), measures 5.2 m long (17 ft) and had a range of 1,600 m (5,249 ft) when firing a 600-mm diameter, 304-kg (670-lb) projectile. The bombard is currently on display at the Royal Armouries, Fort Nelson, Hampshire, UK. 

Hasan al-Rammah, was another Muslim Engineer who wrote a book called ""Kitabul Furusiya wal-Muhaseb El Harbiya"" around 1275 AD, on battle techniques and weapon development. This included designs of rocket systems and torpedo-like bombs. Also, as mentioned in [this paper](http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/rocket_technology_in_turkish_history1.pdf), ""Still, it is understood from the following information, again from old Chinese sources dating back to the Kubilay Khan era, that the Turkic-Islamic world was more advanced than China in manufacturing explosive materials and ballistic weapons. Between 1271 and 1273, Kubilay Khan had requested Abaka Khan (Chinese transcription Apu-ko wang) to send Muslim engineers in order for his own army to win during the siege of the Chinese cities Hangshow and Hsiang-yang. Again according to Chinese sources, Abaka Khan sent two Muslim engineers, Alaaddin and Ismail, from Turkestan. It is obvious that these engineers, who were Muslims and from Turkestan, are Turks. These two Turk Muslim engineers built machines of a ballistic-weapons nature before the besieged city of Hang-show. I don't see the ""European/Chinese Innovation factor"" in any of this.

&gt;and it completely stopped after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century

Yes a big dip of civilization happened after the Mongols attacked the Muslim states, but innovation never stopped at that point. The reason for this dip was mainly because the Mongols demolished Baghdad and its library, and made bridges on the Euphrates by its books. Baghdad was one of the major centers in Islamic civilization but it wasn't the only one, there was also Andalusia, Cairo and the West-Arab lands in Africa. You should not also forget that the Mongols were a threat to all form of urban/civil life, and if it wasn't for the Muslim soldiers lead by the Egyptian Sultan, they would've take over everything civic in this world.

&gt;Governments of Islamic countries nowadays ARE more religious than they should be.

You mean in Saudi Arabia where the princes dry the people off their livings and go spend the money on hookers, or in Iran where they bow for a single man neglecting the basic form of real Islamic principle which is ""bow for no one other than God"". Or maybe you meant the Alawites (NON-MUSLIMS) who run Syria, and who exterminated a whole town that saw a rise of Islamic politics. The core of Islam is fairness, and whole jurisprudence in Islam goes around this concept. If Islam was really implemented by any of the Muslim governments, none of them would be called ""Dictatorships"".

""The Albanians of Kosovo do have a very high birthrate: the highest in fact, in present day Europe. They are still a mainly agricultural society and life in the villages is strongly traditional; the tradition of huge families developed through many centuries as a response to the death of disease and blood feuds on the one hand and the general conditions of insecurity in the other. *What has happened in the 20th century is that mortality has been sharply reduced, while the tradition of large families has eroded much more slowly.""*

""In the post-WWII war years  the Albanian birthrate in Kosovo has come down from the forty six births per 1000 head of population in the early 1950s to roughly 29 in the late 1980s. What these overall figures conceal, however, that birthrates vary among the Albanians, as among any moder population, in accordance with the socioeconomic status of the mother: in 1981 rural housewives would have on average 6-7 children, but urban working women only 2.7.  *The idea that albanians breed as part of a political campaign is rather neatly disproved by this evidence,  since the urban couples are much more likely to be politicized than their counterparts in remote villages.""*

""In the 1981 census showed that a Serb woman in Kosovo would have average 3.4 children by the end of her children bearing years, while her equivalent in inner Serbia would have only 1.9. In these matters, as in many others, the Serb population in Kosovo had a traditional way of life quite similar to that of the Albanians. In the 1950s the Serbs had an equal rate to that of the Albanians, and since their mortality rate was in fact lower, their net rate of growth was actually greater (2.7 per cent growth per year,over Albanians' 2.1) ... *While Albanian women were hostile on religious and cultural grounds to abortion,  it had become an accepted part of cultural normality among the Serbs (for every 100 live births amongst Serbs, 214 were abortions.)""*

""Quite simply, Serbia had already lost Kosovo - lost it, that is, in the most basic human and demographic terms. The Serbs who lived in Kosovo remained a small minority; and the vast majority of Serbs in the rest of Serbia had no wish to go and live in this already densely inhabited territory. *The Serb birth´-rate had continued to decline during the war (when, according to one Serbian gynecologist, out of every 100 babies born in the whole of Serbia, sixty four were non-Serbs), and it was now being predicted that my the middle of the 21st century the Serbs would be a minority in the entire Serbian republic.""*

False,1291324966,"&gt;Here's a post from a blog referencing Barro's work on the subject. Barro is the most cited economist on economic growth.

I have a few quarrels with this guy's analysis. First of all, he compares the US to the EU 15. This is kind of a foolhardy thing to do because whereas the US fiscal policy is pretty homogeneous at the national level, the EU is not. There are 15 separate fiscal policies. What this means is that the growth of some countries with significantly more liberalized economies (Czech Republic, Poland, Germany) may average out with those economies that are usually sluggish (Spain, Italy, France). 

Second, Barro says *more government consumption, faster growth*. What is his measure? GDP. What does GDP contain? Government spending. So what he is saying is that when the government spends money, GDP goes up. Well woop-tee-doo, what a finding. Lets not even get into the weak indicator that GDP can be. Spending =! growth. 

&gt;Basic science, such as the structure of the atom cannot be patented but such knowledge produces a lot of positive externalities and so is underfunded. It is the existence of such market failures that provides the economic justification for government.

A non sequitur. Who are you to decide what is and is not well funded? Second, the possible existence of a market failure does not justify government intervention. The costs of government failure far outweigh a failure in markets. As some economists say, markets fail, use markets.

&gt;If the possibility of state capture exists, then instead of spending money of private investment, individuals will spend money of lobbying which will result in an inefficient allocation of resources.

The possibility of state capture increases the larger the government becomes and the more resources it commands. So if you want to limit state capture, you need to limit the amount of control and resources the state has.

&gt;Why is this nonsense? You seem to not understand the difference between maximum growth and optimal growth. You might want to take a look at simple economic growth models such as the Solow model to understand this better.

How could you even call it maximum growth? If the US government today put everyone in the country to work to build giant pyramids, then that might provide an uptick in GDP but that cannot by any rational view be thought of as *growth*.

The notion that everyone is better off looking after their own self-interests is what put us in this mess to begin with. The way out is not more of the same bullshit.

You are totally missing the point.  People don't go to work and build buildings and homes and make products each day thinking ""wow, I am doing something for the common good.""  If they did, the USSR would still exist and still be a powerhouse.

&gt; No, that honor would go to capitalism. Socialism is what has raised the standard of living around the world, 

You are, quite simply, wrong.  There is a very easy test.  Look up the Index of Economic Freedom for every country.   Graph that against any measure of well-being -- including life-expectancy -- that you want.  Get back to me.  This one isn't even close.   More socialism = more death, pure and simple.

True,1291331188,"Actually you will find that capitalism has lead to a more equal distribution of wealth over the planet. The downturns/stagnation we're seeing in standards here reflect our increasing inability to push around foreigners and make them do our bidding. As the worlds economy becomes more balanced we will are seeing a big shift in economic power away from Europe/America to formerly developing nations. So while we're seeing a stagnation in the rapidly rising social standards we have enjoyed in the west over the last century or so, globally less people are living in poverty. Our rapidly improving quality of life was built on our foreign policy, and as we see in Iraq we are still prepared to kill millions of people in order to secure cheap oil (without which we are fucked). So the fact that we're not going to be able to do this any more will impact our quality of life more than anything else over the next century. Basically, we'll have to share more.

Yes, those who have can coerce those who have not into doing their bidding.  That is a repeating theme in human history.  But here's another theme in human history:  when those who have not are laid so low that they have nothing to lose by opposing those who have, violent revolution takes place.  Those who have are forcibly removed from their wealth (and usually their lives) and those who have not loot the remains.

It doesn't have to be that way.  I'd prefer to avoid it myself, even if I'm not among those who would be impacted by the proposed tax system.  What we can do instead is use a little bit more of the resources from those who have to provide means and opportunity for those who have not so they're not so motivated to rip the ten-thousand-dollar suits off the rich so they can have something warm to wear for themselves.

The thing is, civilization requires cooperation even if you buy into the bullshit that everybody is only out for themselves.

It really, really isn't.  Look up Marx's comments on Marxism, and why.  Read up on what socialism really is, and why the Communist regimes never actually achieved it.

True,1291332596,"Yeah, but what he said makes a lot of sense in this case.  He recounts correctly that attrocities towards the Albanians only started after Nato began bombing Serbia.  Before that, there was a civil war which involved skirmish between Serbian forces and the UCK and burning of Mosques by the Serbians and burning of churches by the Albanians.  Civilians fled but were not directly attacked by either side.  After NATO started bombing Serbia, Serbs started to attack Albanian civilians.  The US wanted to attack Serbia, not to protect the Albanians.  They did because it was the only and last part of the Balkan that was under the influence of Russia and not converging towards a transatlantic partnership and integration with the rest of Europe.  The US forged documentation about a supposed massacre in a soccer stadium with feigned aerial photographs.  The US also planted misinformation about how supposedly Serbian soldiers killed Albanian civilians with gas.

Most of Europe grants freedom of expression but there are inherent limitations much the same as the US.

You can hate people of a different race/creed but publishing materials and attempting to rally others to incite violence and hatred to these groups is punishable by law. No-one's saying you aren't free to exercise your right to be a dick and hate someone, simply that you cannot incite violence and hatred in others towards that end.

False,1291334492,"ok, now lets come back to reality. Want to know why FIFA selected Qatar? Money(you need a hell of a lot to build infrastructure, etc...), Sepp Blatter's Legacy(first to award Africa, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern WC) and Qatar's bid. Qatar played the bidding process very well, they put together a very impressive, immensely funded bid and played the game. 

They included stadiums that could be broken down and shipped to poorer nations(huge incentive for votes). 

Here's another point, those that attend the World Cup in Qatar will likely see many more games(assuming they can afford tickets etc...) than they could in the states. The trip between the northern most stadium and southernmost is only an hour and a half. 

You WILL be able to drink, get around to games, and Qatar's time zone will be more favorable to European audiences. 

Australia is the nation that really needed this world cup, it could have been to them what '94 was to the US, an incredibly important moment for the sport. 

Saying this solely came down to money/gas etc.. is lazy, uninformed and ultimately insulting to a Qatari bid committee that played the game extremely well.

False,1291344309,"&gt;You are working with the second definition, whereas I am working with the first.

Well, I was working rather freely with both, but granted, you are right: definition 1 will be our operating definition.

&gt;...discrimination is negative because it draws attention to race in a negative manner, that is, it has the potential to make members of that race view their own ethnicity in a negative manner...

Going back to the operating definition we're using:
&gt;...a distinction in favor of or against a person or thing on the basis of the group, class, or category to which the person or thing belongs rather than according to actual merit...

How does a favorable distinction make someone look negatively on their heritage? Nepotism is a form of discrimination, does this make the relative view the benefactor or his or her family in a colder light?

&gt;Race is a construct meant to distinguish difference and justify some really horrifying things such as slavery. There is no such thing as a black person, except that we have constructed the idea of a black person, and that idea persists.

Race was not invented by slavers in order to oppress, it was invented by people who found group of people who were different from them yet homogeneous. 

Back to dictionary.com since we're using it:
&gt;Race (definition 2)
&gt;1. a group of persons related by common descent or heredity.
&gt;2. a population so related.
&gt;3. Anthropology .
&gt;a. any of the traditional divisions of humankind, the commonest being the Caucasian, Mongoloid, and Negro, characterized by supposedly distinctive and universal physical characteristics: *no longer in technical use.*
&gt;b.an arbitrary classification of modern humans, sometimes, esp. formerly, based on any or a combination of various physical characteristics, as skin color, facial form, or eye shape, and now frequently based on such genetic markers as blood groups.
&gt;c. a human population partially isolated reproductively from other populations, whose members share a greater degree of physical and genetic similarity with one another than with other humans.
&gt;4.a group of tribes or peoples forming an ethnic stock: the Slavic race.
&gt;5.any people united by common history, language, cultural traits, etc.: the Dutch race. 
&gt;etc...

First off, the Anthropology definitions are off. Definition (b) is not *race*; anthropologists tend to use the term *ancestry* for physical characteristics of individuals and their affinities to larger populations. Race implies culture in anthropology. When an archaeologist finds human remains with features that belong to one ancestral group, he or she does not assume that that person is of that race (see: [Kennewick Man]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man)). In fact, some choose to not use the term ""race"" at all because it's been used erroneously by laymen and misanthropists and carries heavy connotations because of this. Moving on, it's clearly put that definition (a) is archaic and completely obsolete. But its obsolescence does not prohibit it from being used frequently for racist assumptions as I’m sure you’re aware. 

Notwithstanding this: ancestry is as equally salient as race. We *should* make testable observations on a person's physical characteristics. To not do so is to do a disservice to knowledge. I’m sure you may have read that there is a physiological reason why most footrace winners are from West African descent and why most swimming race winners are from European descent, right? [(It's apparently all in the belly button.)](http://current.com/news/92541856_proof-blacks-make-better-runners-than-whites-but-whites-are-better-swimmers-according-to-duke-university-study.htm) We *are* different stocks of people not only in our individuality, but in the genes we carry which form our physical shape. If we were to deny research such as that done by Duke University due to fear of offending, then our political correctness has terrorized our better sense. And even in our institutions this is a constant battle. We should be celebrating the difference of ancestry and race, not burying the facts of our being and diversity. 

I think these may be among the last years of these differences. I think there will be one day when people will be amazed at the diversity that the human race once had. Shouldn't we record our differences and celebrate them while we have them? Simply because we have treated our differences badly in the past when we were more ignorant than we are today is no reason to not celebrate our differences today and discover what exactly those differences are. If we should ignore the very differences we see so clearly among ourselves we may never get to know ourselves as a species; further, we might just end up becoming an entirely different sort of ignorant in our attempts to thwart our own ignorance.

The clergy were the only ones who had the time and means to copy all the Roman/Greek books. And the Greek books were translated into Latin by the Romans.

Furthermore, This was before the printing press. Books were handwritten, and hard as hell to make. It made no sense to translate a book into a bunch of languages for the masses.

If a page may be taken from *Beowulf*, a king was considered good if he didn't kill all of his childhood friends in drunken revels.

The Anglo-Saxons decided that Denmark wasn't enough, so they sailed over to Britannia and made war upon the peoples there, setting themselves up in several kingdoms across the iland, known now in such names as Sussex, Essex, Wessex, among others. They fought the peoples around them. They fought each other. They killed, reveled, and enjoyed themselves, generally, until the Norman French bastard Guillaume conquered Brittany and turned it into a French fiefdom.

They still fought each other.

This French rule culminated in Richard Coeur de Lion, known in English as Richard Lionheart, who led Anglo-Saxon armies under Norman feudal lords to ravage and rape their way across Europe and Palestine until his death.

One roomie was a straight guy, single and another a gay guy but he says he ""gave up his creds.""  That is to say he's been single for a few years and stopped going to gay bars, etc.

That was just a few people gathering up; at the Christmas party the mix will be even more interesting.  A whole gaggle of BDMS, the rare appearance from our 20-somethings-with-kids crowd, the military guys.  We're all Gamer Geeks.

Overall there's only two gay guys that regularly hang out with us and no lesbians at all.  They would be welcome but they come and go without sticking around.  Actually all of the lesbians I've known were all uninterested in being friends with this larger group.  Anyway it's the most open minded group of people you can imagine; we collect the fringe, with lots of geeks and nerds, many many European's living in our city seem to like us as well.   Still the classic All American Gay community never seem to stick around.

False,1291360231,"The American Conservative aggregates opinion from those who, as far as I can tell, identify as conservatives but explicitly ""not neoconservatives.""  These include quasi-isolationist, anti-war paleoconservatives and even those who lean libertarian (Jack Hunter, ""The Southern Avenger"").

These are not the first Conservatives to see the Drug War for what it is: big, intrusive government.  The flagship American Conservative magazine of the 20th century was [The National Review](http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/images/2008/02/27/national_review1.jpg), which did an issue on ending the drug war in the middle 90s (it was about this time I actually went ice skating in hell.)  

One of the most consistent problems the legalization movement has faced is getting conservatives on board, in part because, well, social conservatives (the kind who are obsessed with sex) cannot be moved.  And secondly because the pro-legalization message isn't often written in such a way that conservatives can relate to it.

However, there are those who need no convincing, and you will find them scattered around the libertarian and anti-government fringes of conservatism.

For conservatives, it is best to attack the drug war on the basis of the rights of the individual, governmental intrusion into personal affairs, and the massive waste of taxpayer dollars on ""another inefficient, wasteful government program.""

You will never convince most conservatives that marijuana is ""mostly harmless,"" and for god's sake don't bring up European countries because many conservatives think Europe is full of ""a bunch of fags."" (sorry)

You sell legalization on the basis of government intervention and ""government colonization of bloodstreams and lungs of American taxpayers"" and you put an American flag on the hemp industry and talk about free markets and all that stuff.  As much of the pro-legalization movement tends to lean left, they have problems writing about this persuasively. 

As for the ""social harm"" factor, I find this is also a dead end with conservatives because most simply don't give a damn what happens to ""drug addicts,"" who they perceive to be criminals, thieves, and so on.

All of this is if pro-legalization people want conservatives on the bus.

Otherwise, carry on as normal.

(*) I became pro-legalization as a young conservative, before I ever smoked cannabis, on the basis of much of the above.  I have moved sharply left in subsequent years but I still find the conservative/libertarian/free market arguments most persuasive: government should not have the power to regulate drug use from an individual rights/Constitutional perspective.

&gt;It is a serious risk to national security to repeal DADT without first investigating thoroughly – in public hearings – the effect of the proposed repeal.


The Pentagon did that. Oh, sure, they didn't hold public hearings at which every neocon Congressman could stand up and mumble about how it's not about hating queers, but rather about....uh....something. The Pentagon is in a much better position to judge combat readiness than a bunch of overpaid paper-pushers in Washington.


&gt;We are engaged in a war on many fronts. Our troops are in harm’s way in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. This is no time to experiment with social engineering of the military.


Virtually every one of our allies in this war on many fronts has a fully integrated military—pretty much every EU nation aside of Greece (irony), for starters. Israel, for the clincher. They seem to have zero difficulties.


&gt;We are also gravely concerned about the effect that repealing DADT will have on religious freedom.


None at all, unless you define ""religious freedom"" as ""the right to make other people follow your religion's tenets.""


&gt;One senior army general, Lt. Gen. Thomas Bostick, said that those who oppose repeal are guilty of unacceptable attitudes that he reportedly described as “bigotry.”


He's absolutely correct.


&gt;Additionally, **expert analysts** have warned that a “non-discrimination” policy for sexual minorities will have broad-reaching effects on religious freedom.


Uh-oh, the dreaded EXPERT ANALYSTS...when religious kooks start talking about EXPERT ANALYSTS, I start making popcorn. Who are these analysts? What is their area of expertise? They wouldn't happen to be ""expert analysts"" such as the sham organization American College of Pediatricians, who the AFA, NARTH, and AFTAH delight in quoting, would they? Given these people's track record of creating impressive-sounding dummy organizations to spread utter fabrications as research, I demand credentials.


&gt; It is conceivable that chaplains will be forbidden to preach or speak about their denomination’s position on homosexuality.


Downside: none.


&gt;The Defense Department report on the likely effects of repealing DADT was not released until November 30, 2010. There is simply not enough time between then and adjournment to investigate and deliberate about this very important issue. For that reason, any consideration of repeal should be put off until next year.


...when we can de-rail it properly...


&gt;Moreover, we are deeply concerned about the methodology of the DOD report and survey. In view of General Bostick’s disturbing comments and Admiral Mullen’s and Secretary of Defense Gates’ unseemly cheerleading on this issue, we believe it behooves the next Congress to investigate whether proponents of repeal tried to create a climate of not-so-subtle intimidation in the Pentagon.


...by changing the fucking subject, and levying criminal charges against anyone with whom we disagree.


&gt;The rush to repeal DADT by January of 2011 is a slap in the face of the American people who are tired of bully politics.

On my first trip, I decided to hitchhike down to Montenegro (which had still been a part of what was left of Yugoslavia), and I stopped by Priština for two nights. I didn't have much money, or anyone to travel with, so I just hung around the city and hopped on a bus to Montenegro after 2 days.

The second time, a friend and I proposed a project at the Eastern European Studies Center at our university. This was just a few months after Kosovo had declared independence, and we wanted to see what the situation was like on the ground as far as inter-ethnic co-existence goes. We went to a variety of places: Kosovska Mitrovica (a town split in two), Priština (the predominantly Albanian capital), Djakova and its small Serb enclave, and Štrpce, an elongated Serb enclave in the South that runs along the Macedonian border.

We mostly talked about their relations with the ""others,"" and whether there was any hope people could live in peace side by side. We met some people with really interesting identities, like this one Gypsy in Štrpce. Normally, Gypsies in the area are shunned by Albanians, who consider them to be on the Serbian side. But this Gypsy happened to be a Muslim Gypsy, yet he was shunned by fellow Muslims. So he lived in the Orthodox Christian, Serb-dominated enclave in the South. While still a Sunni Muslim, he identified very strongly with Serbs, spoke Serbian, celebrated Orthodox Christmas and Easter (but Ramadan, as well).

There's some pictures from that trip in my flickr feed. [The one with the roadblock and the EU sign with bullet holes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arcsi/2551873628/lightbox/) is at the military checkpoint at the eastern end of the enclave.

&gt;In the latter half of the 20th century, saudade became associated with the feeling of longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from an emigratory trend from the motherland, historically speaking saudade is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called 'Golden Age', synonymous with the era of discoveries, Portugal undeniably rose to the status of a world power, and its monarchy was one of the richest in Europe at the time. But with the rise of competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of saudade, aptly described by a sentence of its national anthem - 'Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal' (Let us once again lift up the splendour of Portugal).

False,1291388811,"Why do I think that?

I don't think of the world of 1899 in 2010 terms.  Doing so involves the historical fallacies of [Presentism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_historical_analysis%29), [Chronological snobbery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery), and [The Historians Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy).

So, in the world of 1899 when the European powers and a newly emerging Japanese Empire was carving up the last bits of Africa and claiming every island in the South Pacific, here was an island chain that had just started the process (yet was unsuccessful in defeating the Spanish until 1899 with the help of the US) of declaring its independence in the area, but would have had no ability to defend itself from another foreign power that would have used the thinnest pretext of an excuse to invade the Philippines.

So, the US as early as 1899 had already determined that it in no way wanted to colonize and annex the country, but that the nation did not have the ability to properly self govern a fractious (and still sectarian) island chain.  It simply lacked the experience of government, the economy was barely more than a plantation system, and the vast majority of the population were illiterate farmers.  As early as 1902 the first of thousands of teachers from the US arrived to educate the population.

In 1902 the US government handed all but heavy military operations over to the Philippine constabulary, established a parliament with Fillipinos making up the lower house but was replaced by a fully self-determining one in 1916.  They eliminated the Catholic church as the state religion, and educated the merely 10% literate population.

True,1291389790,"A couple of points here. First. Are you aware of the residential schools debacle? That's not about their ancestors - it's about THEM. In the mid 20th century, the Canadian government took all the children from their traditional ways, and 're-educated' them in boarding schools. They were abused physically, sexually and emotionally. They were taught that every aspect of their culture, being and who they are was wrong and had to change. This included their language, practices, religious traditions - everything. 

If you were ripped from your parents and abused for 13 years, taught that you were basically worthless, what do you think the psychological effect would be? These social problems have more to do with what we did to these people in recent history. 

That said, I work with many band councils, and governance is a major problem. Like in any government, concentrated power corrupts, and so leaders need to be accountable. It's too bad your experience with a few bands is negative, but there are many successful bands who have held to their traditions and managed to modernize, along with providing for their people.

I don;t know what your background is, but remember, they are FIRST Nations - meaning, they have treaties that entitle them to the lands the Europeans stole. Therefore, these treaties provide entitlements based on these agreements, as they were here first. To change it, we have to renegotiate the treaties - that's not going to happen unless we take away these rights by force. Unless that's what you are advocating?

Also, be careful in your generalizations. There are a lot more First Nations people living across the country that you may realize - I work with several high ranking folks in my organization and unless they tell you, you'd have no idea. I think there are more 'exceptions' than you may realize.

EDIT - I am open to my points being criticized, and would like for those who disagree to use their words in addition to the down arrow.

This is a product of capitalism.  If any monkey can do your job then your wages will reflect that.  Americans as a whole do not have a problem with this.

&gt;60+ hours a week might be normal in the US, but in France, you're not allowed to work more than 35.

I wouldn't say 60+ hours a week is normal, though obviously that depends on a lot of different factors.  Working more hours is part of the American culture, and it always has been.  You could argue that it's one of the reasons why America became an economic superpower and France did not (obviously it's only one of hundreds of reasons).

&gt;Americans are giving up their rights at every turn

Most Americans don't fly on a regular basis, and the Patriot Act has had zero effect on at least 99% of the population.  It's no surprise that people don't care about things that have no effect on them whatsoever.  Americans are not unique in this regard.

&gt;The Pilots Union threatened to ground planes, and are now exempt from screening. Since they don't give a shit about their customers, they won't stand up for their rights.

The Pilot's Union got their way because you can't possibly make the argument that screening pilots makes flying safer.  Their situation was just absurd.  You can't really argue with the fact that the new scanners and pat downs do indeed make flying safer (just like a full strip search and cavity search would make flying safer), and many Americans honestly feel that it is worth it to them to give up some privacy in exchange for safety.

&gt;It's clear and obvious that Americans want to live in a police state. If that weren't the case, they wouldn't keep giving up control of their lives to the government.

I would then reduce the role of the federal government to something similar to the EU, causing each different conglomeration of states to become its own small country that just has to agree on a few rules for things like interstate commerce and border crossing.

Once the country is split up into isolated geopolitical regions, people will be able to simply vote with their feet, and the failure modes of democracy that involve the tyranny of the majority will not be able to affect as many people at once because everything is significantly more decentralized. Allowing anyone in the union to easily move between these smaller countries as citizens with full rights to live and work in whichever nation they want is essential, and would be one of the few extra things that the continental-level government would need to do. This should allow people to choose which set of laws they want to be governed under.

True,1291398511,"Some people prefer it, but if you look at the term's origin you find that it's a lot more vague and general than the way it's used today.

""Latin"" relates to [Romance languages.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages)  The most widely spoken ones include Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian but there are many more.  Because of Spain and Portugal's colonization, their respective languages became dominant in Latin America starting in the 1500s.

Based on this history we could fairly say that French, Italian and Romanian people are as much Latin as the people of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, etc.  

Here's another [historical connection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_america#Etymology_and_definitions) for this term between Europe and America:

&gt; The term Latin America was supported by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico, as a way to include France among countries with influence in America and to exclude Anglophone countries, and played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire.

For this reason, many people of Latin American ancestry are ok with the term ""Hispanic"".  It may sound racist to some and it doesn't acknowledge the Native American portion of their background.  At least it focuses on the Spanish part of their heritage and makes a distinction between Europe and the New World.

Does anyone else think it's odd that the term ""Latino"" (a Spanish word) is used to describe this ethnic group in the US?

On a stretch of forlorn beach on the north coast of California, I used to while away my school break summer days, generally doing what a 13 year old boy does when left to his own devices.

Not brave enough or clever enough to go right up and just ask for an onion, I decided to sneak. And sneak I did, crawling like a horny little snake, hoping the driftwood would provide adequate cover.

But I don't want to have that conversation. 

The important point here is that none of these western european countries have to spend money to protect themselves, the US does it for them.

Clogging commercial transport lines will make the price of normal goods and utilities skyrocket.

2 - That's kind of already slowly happening, but it has been hamstrung by the fact that the majority of roads in the US are maintained by state DOTs. So, OK.

3 - You know how we have a ton of really ignorant, seemingly unintelligent people running for office these days? Think that, times 1000.

* I have no actual data to back this up, but I can't imagine that a large percentage of Americans feel they are being treated unfairly in the work place.  When they feel otherwise, they *do* protest.  Just a few days ago I walked by a group of labor protesters near where I live.  Apparently the cafeteria workers at a nearby university are not happy with their wages, and they are protesting because of it.

* You make a good point here.  The American economic system is not purely capitalist (far from it, in fact).  It's not perfect, but we accept the flaws in the extreme cases so that everybody can get a chance to eat.

* Americans are paid less to work more hours?  That may be true in extreme cases, but on average that is simply [not true](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wages).  Also, France spends money on [bailouts](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/funds-and-etfs/funds/the-insiders-guide-to-europes-debt-crisis/article1822949/) and [wars in Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployments_of_the_French_military) (the pointlessness of that war is still up for debate and will be settled later with hindsight).  My point is that America is not unique in wasting government money.  Also, there have been tons of protests against the wars we are involved in and the bailouts as well.

* I agree that the new regulations are wrong and need to be changed, but [most Americans don't](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/22/AR2010112205514.html).  With that said, once again there are plenty of Americans protesting the new TSA procedures.

* That's exactly the problem here.  The balance between security and freedom is a very difficult one to achieve.  The main problem is that everybody draws the line somewhere different.  As I just said, most Americans do not draw the line at the body scanners, though about half draw the line at the enhanced pat downs.

* It is completely legal for you to record a police officer in most US states.  There are about a dozen states that prohibit it, but that number changes frequently and it's hard to keep track of.  Regardless, if that qualifies a country as a police state, then we have different definitions of that label.

True,1291403802,"&gt; Wait, so are you saying that because nature does not feed and clothe us by default, that this state of nature places a burden on others to feed and clothe you? Think this through.

I'm saying that because nature does not feed and clothe us by default, the task of feeding and clothing the members of our communities falls on the community members.  I'm saying that when we are without food and clothing, we're desperate enough to accept any conditions -- no matter how exploitative -- if it means we'll be able to survive.  Your ""voluntary consensual agreement"" society results in laments like this:

&gt; Work 60 to 80 hours a week for crummy $300.00 paycheck, go home do cleaning, panic over bills that are never caught up , sleep, ( during sleep of course obsess about bills.) Repeat daily until severe mental depression wins.

That comes from a state that passed ""Right to Work.""  In every state that's passed it, they've learned it really means ""Right to Starve While Working.""

&gt; Nobody ever said it would, just that it will get much much closer than any other system -- and the historical record is clear on that fact.

The idea that the free market will correct this or any other problem has one fatal flaw:  it's *never happened, and never will.*  You can't point to a single example where the free market, when given more latitude, has done anything but further enrich the wealthy and create poverty and suffering for everyone else.  The only time social and economic mobility was the rule rather than the exception was when a government maintained strict regulation and oversight into market affairs.

&gt; OK, in the absence of force, give me a single example of a voluntary consensual transaction that does not benefit both sides from where they would be without that transaction. Just laughing it off isn't an answer, it's a dodge.

Oh, you were serious.  I'm sorry.  You made a statement that was so amazingly laughable, so absolutely invalid in terms of human history that the only response I could provide was laughter.

&gt; You seem to be missing the difference between voluntary cooperation for our own good and forced cooperation -- an oxymoron if ever there was one. The results between the two speak for themselves. The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Cuba is dying. North Korea is a hellhole. How many times do we need to run this failed ideology through the ringer before people finally give up on it.

Yes.  All those *military dictatorships* are dead or dying.  They are not representative of their people which is a **core principle of socialism.**  Socialism is about the rule of the people, not the elite.  Better to say, how are the socialist democracies of Sweden, France, Germany, Denmark and so forth holding up?  Because those are examples of socialism brought in -- admittedly gradually rather than by revolution -- by the will of the people instead of by fiat under military rule.  Socialism does not work when imposed from the top down.  This is a principle that Marx emphasized repeatedly until he died, but the military junta within the Soviet Union and Communist China didn't get the message.  Western Europe did.

&gt; They are protesting the removal of the appropriation of other people's money.

Ye gods.  They're not protesting the fact that their lives were made richer through democratically approved socialist policies.  They're protesting the fact that the elite made a grab for their money and they're not going to stand for it.  Of course, that doesn't fit with your anti-state message so of course you have to revise it somewhat.  You enjoy that, but the rest of us will stick to reality.

Existing tests are largely focused on European/Western/industrialized societies; a person in, say, a tribal culture living out in the woods/desert/jungle/Outback, while perhaps being extremely intelligent within his own framework, wouldn't have a clue about the answers to most IQ tests currently in existence.  *Maybe* he could handle spatial/shape reasoning -- except that *those* test components tend to be expressed using abstract geometrical shapes, which recent research suggests aren't processed by tribal/nature-living people the same way they are by industrialized people.  I know for sure that *I'd* fail an ""IQ test"" designed by a forest tribesman and including such basic tasks as being able to spot an animal in thick underbrush, track an animal, etc.

Other research suggests that even *psychology* doesn't carry over from Western/European countries to e.g. African villagers.

So there are a lot of variables to be considered even if we agree to *try* to measure IQ across these various boundaries...  ",False,True,redweasel,,0,0,,AskReddit,0,1,,t1_c17pjwm,t3_efks1,c17r9r7,t5_2qh1i,t1_c17r9r7,1426609315,1

False,1291410007,"Economics student here, at my University we've had to go through a mandatory course about the financial crisis. 

Disclaimer: I would be on the left of the political spectrum in the US, but more in the Center in Europe.

Warning! This is not a cut and dry topic, wall of text incoming (skip to TL;DR if you can't be assed to read)

Basically here is what happened:

1) Because of low US interest rates, speculators looked for another product which could give a guaranteed profit (like bonds - bonds are basically you lending money to the government at the government interest rate). The product they found was essentially US mortgages, and this started a bubble. Basically people started over-investing in houses and soon the price of a bundle of mortgages was not really based on the true value of the bundle of mortgages.

2) When the bubble burst investors started pulling money out of the economy to cover their losses. This caused something we call the money multiplier to run in reverse (the money multiplier is the idea that when you place money in a bank and the bank lends it out, its effectively increasing the amount of money in the economy. There is some pretty strange math involved in this, so I won't go into detail about it. Basically - money goes into bank and is lent out, lender still has the same amount of money but the person taking the loans gains money, so money is added in the system.). This caused the banks to need to trim their loans to retain their minimal capital requirements (basically a government mandated amount of cash they have to keep on hand to cover losses). The supply of money fell, and people looking for loans couldn't find any. This caused a credit crisis.

3) Once we fell into this credit crisis, people couldn't find loans and the world economies ground to a halt. This was partly due to a lack of information on all sides, as banks didn't know who to trust and didn't want to get burned. We started sliding into something called a savings trap (a savings trap is a controversial idea which is highly debated, so here is probably where most of my bias comes in). The basic idea behind a savings trap is this. A generally accepted fact about economics is that savings MUST EQUAL investment, again some complicated economic theory explaining all the details, but basically what you save is reinvested in some way, mainly by banks. However, at this point people were saving and as were banks, leading into a savings trap; everybody was saving too much at the same time. To cover this government has to step in to ensure that savings does = investment, and has to step in for the private sector when it comes to investing. This has been done in different ways across the globe, with mainly Europe and parts of Asia directly investing and the US choosing to go a more indirect route. Now these are highly controversial moves, something which I come to in the next phase.

4) This is the phase we're in right now, the debt crisis. A lot of governments owe a lot of money since they've attempted to keep their economies going, and now an age of austerity is being pushed. Again, there is a seriously right left debate here, were the right tends to believe that government is crowding out private investment (pouring too much money into the economy) and the left generally believing that cutting spending now could push the world back into recession.

**TL;DR: Clusterfuck in homesmarket, shit hit the fan, banks got broke, lending stopped, governments spent money and people want them to stop spending money now**

False,1291410083,"&gt;What if the practice weren't Chinese foot binding, but a tribal ritual involving the rape and torture of young girls? Would you continue to say ""Who are we to judge?""

I'm not even saying 'who are we to judge' about the Chinese foot binding. What I am saying is that besides involving Children it doesn't seem too far from cosmetic surgery that people undergo here. I think a pretty quick parallel could be drawn between this foot binding and corsets or some other painful device. 

You are certainly free to judge, though. I'll gladly join you and condemn the widespread adoption of Chinese footbinding here in the west. But what I wouldn't say is that these women are forcible victims of torture. It seems much more likely to me that these women are just like women in the west, women in Europe, women in Africa who go through painful often permanent and often debilitating procedures in order to fit in with accepted society. 

And they do it willingly, because they have a deep seeded desire to fit in with the standards of beauty. Whether its lasering the hair off of your face or using brass rings to stretch out your neck. From that point of view it's fascinating, and this case, although somewhat extreme, isn't unprecedented with what you see everywhere else in the world. 

That doesn't mean it isn't bad. That just means that the sense of victimization is more complicated than a purely feminist point of view will allow. 

&gt; Going to the prom, though it may be cruel and unusual, is not objectively as bad as female circumcision. 

I think it would be more appropriate to compare female circumcision to a face lift. One is certainly more appalling to 99% of westerners, but the other is also a painful invasive procedure that leaves a certain level of long term disability for a short term cosmetic gain. Facelifts, or body tucks or cheek implants are far far far more acceptable by our own standard (not that they are perfectly acceptable, as much as I would assume in China foot binding isn't perfectly acceptable) than the standard as its applied to other cultures.

I haven't looked at the various models of how to define taxable vs non-taxable goods to know how good they are about not being recessive. If you know of any links, I'd be glad to read them.

My state has no income tax and only a sales tax. It is still pretty progressive though in the fact that most grocery items are exempt and there is a [state sales tax holiday every year.](http://tn.gov/revenue/salestaxholiday/) Also most of the other revenue is made off of property taxes, which the poor are usually exempt or pay far less because of obvious reasons. There is definitely a way to set it up to keep most of the burden on those who can afford it. You also bring in much more money from tourist and people just passing through. 

A national sales tax is something that is always being discussed by democrats it is just they discuss it as an additional tax to the income tax which is unacceptable. The reason is they try and say it will start off small, as it did in European nations, but then once they have it they bump it up to 20 percent and soon half or more of your earning are gone to the goons in Washington. I am sorry I look at the economic models of Europe and they are not even on the same playing field as the wealth being generated in the U.S. and their taxation models I think have a lot of play in that.

True,1291420379,"&gt;Once the land is occupied, though, then what do you do? German doctrine was equally indistinct on that topic.

If you look at the eastern front, with it's untermeschen (sp) policies, it becomes clear what the doctrine was. Kill the population base that supports the insurgents. However, it's not fair to say this was limited to that regime, as this was how almost every invading/colonizing force achieved their goals before that. 

The U.S. never beat the indian warriors. They were too elusive. The U.S. just neutralized their population base i.e. trail of tears, infected blankets etc. They did the same thing in the Philippines. Pretty much all colonial powers did the same thing. Reward those who went along, while killing the partisans. You can't hide among the civilians if there are no civilians. That part is nicely buried in history thanks to the lack of modern media. That's now impossible. Hell the Germans failed to do so in Russia only because there were too many Russians, although they (despicably) tried valiantly. If they took advantage of the fact that many ethnic groups subjected under the USSR would have joined them, things could have turned out very differently.

Your point on Hitlers mismanagement is also valid. Kursk is a great example of the Command working within the confines of Hitlers retarded plan. It was pretty much doomed from the start, and they still managed to do pretty well considering they faced the largest defensive lines ever created. 

And to say the U.S. won because of the determination of it's people just doesn't make sense. As if the German people were defending Berlin against all hopes because Hitler wanted them too? If anything the German people were more determined than we were...If anything is proof of that it's the fact that we voraciously adopted the German propaganda line of ""holding back the Russian hordes from Europe"". Even at the battle of the Bulge Patton rightly commented that we could still lose the war. 

It doesn't even make sense to compare the U.S. and German military at that time considering 80% of German losses were on the Eastern front. As far as the Germans were concerned, the Russians were the enemy, not us. As you said, the difference between the German and U.S. was that we were liberating, on both fronts, and didn't have to worry about partisans behind the front. Now we do, and we're facing the same problems.

Netbook I'd only take if you can't live without your own computer - you really don't need it, computers are everywhere in Europe.

I'd research a bit for the initial period when you settle in and make sure to have a friend at home that'll track a bit where you are going. This way if you ain't sure about hostel for the next city and don't have time to research yourself, you just message your friend and they'll help you out. Keep in mind that Hostels are also well connected and there are many more travelers around so really this will not be much of an issue.

If you solely speak English, you could start out in a country where the young people speak it pretty well (Uk, Scandinavia, Netherlands, Germany). This will help you settle in.

I'd also highly recommend Couchsurfing. If you start networking early, you will have a chance to meet great people from around the world - and get to know them before you go.

Regarding valuable things, as someone mentioned already, hostels always have a way to store valuables - usually those lockers. Worst case, you'd fall back to lockers at the train station (which often is close to your hostel).

Also regarding your age &amp; being female no need to worry. Just act responsibly like you would in your own country (e.g. don't get drunk/take drugs at a party where you have no one you can trust).

No doubt he would fight extradition to the United States and by default no country in europe will extradite him to the USA unless there is a declaration from the Obama administration saying they will not go for the death penalty (which is a possible punishment for that law IIRC.)

Before that even happens the Justice Department has to convene a grand jury to issue the charges. Then they have to submit the arrest warrant to Interpol. Then whatever country he is in has to pick him up and review their agreements with the United States for extradition and receive an agreement from the US that they will not seek the death penalty. Then Assange and his team of lawyers will fight extradition. Then he will be brought to the USA. Then they will do pretrial proceedings where a team of extremely experienced civil liberties lawyers will fight absolutely everything the Justice Department does. Then they will have to go to a trial where the Justice Department tries to convince a jury to convict a foreign national on a vague law from WWI. If he is convicted (and that is a big if) there will be immediate appeals which will work its way up every court level with briefs issued by every press organization in the country trying to make sure that any appeal doesn't restrict press protections.

After your example of dogs: A dog that is half German Shepherd and half Rhodesian Ridgeback (to name a European and African breed) isn't called any of those races, it's called a bastard (perhaps crossbreed). If the process of pairing up different looking dogs goes on long enough and a dog emerges that someone likes enough to get it recognized as a new race of dogs, a new race is born; one that can't be called a German Sheperd even though one of his ancestors was one. That is what is happening in America with people right now, and have been going on for hundreds of years. 

Right. All that nonsense about crossbreeding people is irrelevant anyway, because if you have to classify people on those terms, use ethnicity. That's whats really important. It gives people similar languages and cultural traits. It binds communities (not saying that multi-ethnic communities aren't good or tight). 

The whole problem is this: physical appearence ('race') and ethnicity used to be about the same throughout the whole of human history.

tl;dr Both the government  and the air traffic controllers are dicks, the traveller are paying for their mistakes.

-The air traffic controllers (ATC) are not asking for a rise.
-The government set on January, the maximum hours for a ATC/year to work are 1670 hours. They can't do more hours than those, no for extra money, anything, is forbidden.
-The ATC wants the government to hire more people, the claim they are not enough workers, the government refuse to hire more since 2006.
-The ATC advice that legally they won't be able to work (second point), they don't have enough hours.
-So these days the ATC already full fill their hours and the air space is close because there is no ATC in the control towers.
-The Home Secretary, José Blanco notice today that that law was a big screw. So the solution is to make a bigger fuck, basically, the upper boundary for hours is no longer in use SINCE THIS MORNING.
-The ATC say fuck you, we won't work
-The government replay, ""really?, so we make another law TODAY that from now the ATC are consider military personal"". So if they command to the ATC either they follow order or they go to jail by martial court.

So far, we can conclude that this was the most fascist measure taken in Spain since democracy was establish 40 years ago. Commanding civilian under military orders and make it legal in the parliament in some hours during the morning.

Meanwhile, the ATC have a incredibility well overpay work, with great conditions and everything. Even that, they are always on strikes. People hates them. Today they are not making a strike, today the 90% of the ATC has declared them self sick to go to work, while they are united in a hotel in Madrid talking about their conditions. Meaning that, you have all the right to go strike, but you can't just fake an illness and stop the air space of a country, specially like Spain that bypass a lot of traffic between Europe, America and Africa. That punishable by law in Spain with or without today's new laws.

False,1291430233,"The problem isn't a GS500-specific problem, it's a problem with diaphragm carburetors that has mystified the riding public since the factories were forced by environmental pollution problems to
replace the older slide valve carburetors in the 1970's.

The rider had direct control of the slide valve, and, if he whacked the throttle open when the engine vacuum was too low, the engine would bog, but when he rolled off the throttle a little engine vacuum would increase suddenly and the slide valve carb would suck too much fuel out of the float bowl.

Diaphragm carbs had already been used on European cars to control emissions in the 1960's, so that's the type of carb that would work to meet environmental protection agency standards.

The diaphragm carb takes direct control of the high speed circuit away from the rider and uses engine vacuum to control the vacuum slide that lifts the jet needle out of the needle jet and richens the mixture for power.

If the engine doesn't produce enough vacuum, the slide doesn't lift and the carb runs off the idle jet, which is usually larger by a factor of 2 than the idle jet in a slide carb.

Riders of medium or large displacement motorcycles are typically cruising down the highway *economically* using only 1/8th to 1/4 throttle.

False,1291430638,"Several factors. Our voting system, naturally favoring a 2 party system, allowed for entrenched power and political machines to develop. The slow strengthening of the federal government over the last 2 centuries. Our religious freedom encouraged oppressed religious groups to emigrate here, which while good also had the unfortunate side effect of making a particularly zealous brand of christianity become powerful (the effects of which I'll discuss in a moment). 

But more important that anything else was the 20th century. WW2 saw the popularization of intense nationalism, following directly on the heels of WW2 was the Cold War, which allowed the military industrial complex to arise. The Red Scare, the sudden importance of the CIA, and the anti-soviet fervor cause a couple of things to happen. 

* immensely powerful corporations, subsidized and contracted by the government, now had a say in the creation of policy. They had the products (arms, missiles, airplanes, ect.) the government needed, giving them leverage over it

* Nationalism and religion got mixed. Because the Soviets were atheists, the US had to be christian. This made xenophobia (already prevalent) ok because it wasn't referred to as xenophobia. This also lead to the ""if you don't like it you can get out"" attitude. 

* The government started spying on it's citizens. Bush didn't start this practice, the Cold War did. Espionage became an industry. 

* The Baby Boomers. Because of the largest economic boom we've ever seen and have yet to see again, the government could get away with a lot more. Sure there were protests against Vietnam, but when was the last time you saw a protest against the dictators and death squads we propped up (and continue to prop up) in South America and the middle east? Historically our government has usually only been pushed hard enough by the citizenry to reform when the citizenry is suffering. But instead they were enjoying a standard of living never before seen

* naturally because of the boom corporate america became increasingly powerful, powerful enough to buy congress. But less obvious than when the Robber Barons did it. 

All of these things (and several others) lead to a general shift to the right. Even though the founders of the country were left-wing radicals who prized enlightenment era egalitarian values, no one seems to be taught that. Our ""left-wing"" party is farther to the right than most of Europe's conservative parties. When you have a constant fear of outsiders, coupled with an increase in religiosity and constant war, the far right is inevitably going to pull the country in their direction.

True,1291451346,"Okay, we are reaching an impass at property rights. We will have to clear that up before we can answer these questions.

In an ancap (anarcho capitalist) society, people have the right to exclude others from using something (another way of saying property). The only way you could have a system where all property is shared (considered to be owned by everyone) is by forming a group of people who all agree to that situation. You couldn't force anyone to join, so naturally there would be people that didn't belong to that group, and could own their own property.

Now, I should probably get to how I arrived at ""private property rights"" as a concept. There is a whole school of thought called [praxeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxeology), but I'm not even going to go there. I will approach it from a less a priori viewpoint. This comes from a very basic decision. The decision is this: Do you or do you not completely own yourself? That is, are you able to make decisions about what happens to your person or not? Can you decide to not be raped, to be a slave, to be beaten, etc.? Do you own your organs? Do you own your brain? Do you own the blood coarsing through your veins? If you can say that you can own your body and decide what happens with it, then you have agreed to a basic property right. All such rights stem from property rights. The 'right to life' is actually the right to own your body as a piece of property and not have it harmed or destroyed against your will.

You must recognize some property rights, though. It would be impossible not to. For instance, only one person can digest a particular amount of food. Only one person can digest a perticular amount of water. Only one person can wear a typical shirt at any given time. You wouldn't want multiple people using the same toothbrush, etc. In order to have this discussion with me, you'd have to use a computer, which you'd have to at least temporarily exclude someone else from using. So you must recognize *some* kind of property, even if you want to create something like 'temporary property' or some other contrivance, which is just private property limited by necessity or some other factor. This might qualify as Proudon's mutualism that you mentioned before. I would argue that there is no fundamental difference between owning your left lung, or the oxygen being processed therein, or the water in your stomach, or an apple you picked from a tree you grew, or a shovel you traded some crops for. 

I'm probably glossing over a bunch of important points, but this post is already going to be super long. I'll move on to your points now, but if you want a simpler, more concise explanation of what I've been talking about, check out this short video called [The Philosophy of Liberty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muHg86Mys7I).

&gt;Why would they only have enough resources to make one or the other? Why would a group not be able to make wool shirts, and another group make cotton shirts?

I was trying to keep the scenario simple. Since there aren't infinite resources, choices *do* have to be made. They can't possibly make anything anyone could ever want. So I'm simplifying all the possible choices down to an A vs. B situation.

&gt;The minority group is free to refuse to work

Wait, what? Are they still going to be entitled to the results of the work that they didn't help with? If yes, then you've got a huge incentive to choose not to work. If no, then you've got a capitalist economy, because you'd see sub-groups of people who are all in agreement with what to do helping each other, and then they'd likely need to trade with the groups who agreed to make other things. Again, I assume resources are limited, so it would probably be prohibitive for multiple small groups to make the same things as each other.

&gt;but why would they when it would be to their detriment?

Some people are stubborn pricks who need to get their way, and others simply don't want to work for the gains of others, perhaps because they *rarely* get their way, and others usually get theirs. If one person is always on the losing end of the voting, they may eventually get fed up with it. 

This is neither here nor there, though. I'm talking about the system of distribution, which is a form of governance in this situation. It's a device whereby one can exert authority over another.

&gt;Lets say there is a Walmart in an 'anarcho'-capitalist society. Am I free to take from the Walmart as I please, without paying? If not, the Walmart has access to resources that I do not, creating a hiearchy between me and the people who own the Walmart. Why are they entitled to those resources?

No, you are not free to take from Walmart as you please, since the people who own the Walmart own the stuff inside the building. You would have to engage in a voluntary transaction with them. You would have to offer something in exchange that they want more than the stuff that you want from them. When both parties agree to terms of exchange, you make the exchange and are both rewarded by receiving something you wanted for something you didn't want as much.

If you belong to a communist collective, you would have to arrange for your group to exchange something that Walmart wants for the stuff you want from Walmart. Basically, your group would act as one entity in a transaction with the people working at the Walmart all acting as another entity.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say there is a hierarchy preventing you from taking the stuff. There are *property rights* preventing you from morally taking the stuff. Why would you think that you have equal claim over a shirt inside Walmart as them? Walmart paid someone to make the shirt, and now hold the shirt as an asset, which they can sell for (hopefully) a profit, allowing them to invest in more shirts. And as they sell more shirts and make more profit, eventually they can pay a new person to make pants so they can sell pants, and keep growing this way.

&gt;I thought you said that if a homeless man attempts to claim your property, they are beyond their rights?

Everyone equally has the same right to own property. This is not the same as saying everyone has the right to own the same property. Person A can own *a* shovel, and so can person B, but this doesn't mean that person B can own the *same* shovel as person A, it only means he can also own *a* shovel.

&gt;How do the poor and the rich have the same right to own property?

The only difference between a ""rich"" person and a ""poor"" person is the amount of stuff they possess. This has no affect on what rights apply to them. They both have the right to own something (albeit not the same exact thing unless they both agreed to this arrangement). They both have the right to not be the victim of unprovoked violence. They both have the right to not have to perform labor at the whim of another. 

Being able to exclude the use of a specific piece of property goes both ways, though. While a rich person can exclude the poor person from driving his Bentley, the poor person can exclude the rich person from swimming in his backyard pool. Being able to exclude the use of property by others gives you a higher incentive to maintain the property, and it makes maintenance much easier to perform logistically.

&gt;Everyone is equal, some are just more equal than others?

No. That is you conflating equal amounts of stuff with equal rights.

&gt;If a certain amount of capital is a prerequisite then you are not describing a right.

I don't understand what you mean here. Can you give me an example of a specific amount of capital being a prerequisite to having a right?

&gt;Ah, so if I find something unowned, I can claim it, yes?

Yes, but within reason. This is an area that requires a degree of common sense. You need to be able to reasonably utilize any natural resource you take or use. That said, there isn't a whole lot of unclaimed land left.

&gt;Does the majority of the United States belong to a group of native American tribes?

I don't defend how property was stolen from Native Americans. Their ancestors came across from Asia and claimed some of that land long ago. Certainly there was land that was not being used that could have been claimed. And had there been enough Native Americans with enough resources to utilize all of the land, then Europeans couldn't justly claim it. It would be like the Chinese coming over the Pacific and claiming someone's beach-front property in Oregon.

&gt;What if Ugnac claims all of the food available to the community of cavemen?

In this section, you seem to be getting to monopolies. The smaller the scope you are looking at, the more likely there will be a monopoly. So for instance, if we look at your body, we see that you have a monopoly there. No one else can use your muscles or brain to accomplish work. Now if we looked at your home, we'd see that your family has a monopoly over it. And so on. But you brought up one person claiming all the food available. I've already said you can only reasonably claim what you can possibly use. Now, if we say that Ugnac *can* possibly use it all, this means there is a dangerous level of scarcity. If food is so scarce that one person is able to claim all of what is available, it would mean that the area cannot support the population, and they need to move to an area that can accommodate them.

&gt;I am not aware of any documented claim to the rest of the Universe, so should your proposed economic/political system come to pass, I should have ownership of the entire universe, minus the sun and earth, yes?

You can, indeed, take a spaceship and claim an unclaimed area of land on another planet that you are reasonably able to use.

If you'd like to revise that claim that's fine.

You need to realise that all companies are seeking to maximise profits but that due to competition this results in low prices and the true market rates for goods. If you use government force to push up labour sure they will get paid more but now the price of goods will go up. There has been no increase in wealth because those same low paid people will now have to pay more for all the goods and services they consume. But more than that it's a net-loss because, like I said, it destroys those jobs on the margins that can't exist at the higher rates.

My claim comes from from public hospital employed plastic surgeons. Here in Europe that means that they don't do superfluous stuff unless backed up by evidence, and the fact that they're working in a hospital and do reconstructive surgery (as opposed to aesthetic) to me at least makes me trust them and their motives a little more. To put things in perspective (for an american) about how public/private doctors work here, when a patient gets seriously ill in a private clinic they get transferred to a public hospital (private medicine over here is mostly about better customer service and doctors bending a bit to the will of the patients when it comes to treatments and stuff); and similarly the sufferers of capsular contraction very often end up coming to the public sector surgeons to fix the issue (sadly I don't have the numbers of that, but it's so typical it's ridiculous), so I think they know quite a bit about it.

False,1291464071,"&gt; I assume sexual urges are normal. Seeking to satisfy those urges through consensual sex or me-times is also normal. Repressing them is not.

Having sex through marriage is not repression.

&gt; Debatable, lol. Premarital sexuality is repressed.

Premarital sexuality is something to be repressed. It leads to all sorts of unwanted things in society, which are destructive to society, and thus challenge humanity's basic biological imperative... to reproduce and live in harmony with the environment. These factors include unwed pregnancies (broken families), STDs, the cultural fallout of having a sex-obsessed culture that is ripe for political/corporate manipulation, all of which everyone knows about.

&gt; What's more ridiculous is preventing anything that would lead to or allow it.

Thus is the nature of the sexual instinct in humans. People can agree to not have premarital sex all they want, but as soon as they are exposed to the things which lead to it, they will also wind up indulging in it, despite their own wishes. People really can't control themselves.

&gt; Many Islamic historians consider that little period of sexual liberation as a ""fall into debaucherous"" ways to justify the current state of repression. 

No, they don't. Source?

&gt;  A society that had a way better grasp of humanism than the current ""Islamic"" one preceding the renaissance's humanism by decades. 

The current one isn't Islamic, and the ancient one wasn't humanist. It was Islamic back then.

&gt; It very hypocritical to fawn about the past civilization when modern scholars disapprove of its very fundamental principles (Humanism, reason to name a few).

Bullshiiiiiiiiiiit. Source?

Scholars love, even idolize (not lierally, of course), past Islamic civilization.

Source?

&gt; Saudis disagree. Forever segregated (much worse imo).

Bullshiiiiiiiiiiit.

You really claim that people would rather never have sex, *ever* than get married and have sex with one person?

Bullshit.

&gt; +Marriage is a romantic relationship. 
&gt;
&gt; +You believe the basis to every romantic relationship is sex. 

I don't think you're understanding what I mean when I say ""basis"". I mean that is literally the base, or foundation, of the relationship. You can build a bloody skyscraper that reaches into the heavens on top of that foundation that has nothing to do with sex, but the foundation is, again, that biological connection.

In fact, the same hormone establishes the emotional connection between sexual partners as between mother and child (oxytocin).

Just like the foundation of familial relationships are the blood relation. Biological foundation, but that's all it is... a foundation.

&gt; Segregation encourages treating women as sexualized commodities. The ""law"" basically tells males that they have no business making female friends because women are only for sex ? This is what the whole thing actually means.

Then men would also be treated as commodities. Why don't you defend the men? That's the first indication that you have a lopsided view.

Secondly, women are not only for sex. That's why they're segregated. Because men will instinctively pursue personal/private contact with women only for for sex and on a sexual attraction basis.

Women are treated as sexual commodities in the West and you would be hard pressed to find a Westerner who disagrees. They criticize themselves on these grounds all the time. Women have been turned into sex objects there. In Islamic society, the idea is to do the opposite.

Do you know how many redditors would agree with the statement ""there's no such thing as 'just friends' between men and women?""

Do you have any idea? Damn near all of them. There's truth to that statement. But there's also truth to those who say friendship is possible. But you cannot deny the truth behind the former.

The whole thing actually means telling men they have no business making female friends because we know you just want to get in their pants, and they know it as well, and women are for more than sex.

Which view is more realistic and corresponds to reality? Your ideal does not correspond to reality as much as the Islamic ideal. Also, few Westerners share the ideal for their own culture that people such as yourself (who are relatively new to it) do. Those of us who were born and raised in the West, Muslim or otherwise, view our culture with far more cynical eyes.

&gt; And yes, rape goes unreported in Muslim countries ? You know why ? because the charges gets dropped if the guy marries the victim. That's one reason.

How often does this happen? Stats?

&gt; Feel free overgeneralizing and correlating random facts about rape in ""Western"" societies. 

Uh, citing RAINN is not overgeneralizing or correlating random facts. If you are going to trash talk RAINN, you're offending a huge chunk of Western society, including many victims of rape.

&gt; Maybe you should think about how In Sweden sexual assaulters are 4 times more likely to be Muslims. I dont enjoy correlations of these types.

Maybe you should think about how in Sweden, Muslim immigrants are way more likely to be poor and uneducated refugees compared to Muslim immigrants to North America (where many were professionals, doctors, engineers, scientists, etc).

Stats for Muslims in North America, not surprisingly, don't correlate to Europe's Muslims.

[Sociology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology).

&gt; Contrast that to what I said: How are you supposed to pick your partner when you cant even mix up with them in the first place 

And this is while we were on the subject of sex, so obviously one has to conclude your defintion of ""mix up"" was about sex.

&gt; Now that's a quite interesting Freudian slip.

No, I was pointing out your slip.

&gt; So you dont believe you can mix up with the opposite sex without the promise of sex.

Actually, regardless of what I believe, most Westerners would believe that. You don't know Western culture too well, it seems.

&gt; You seem to be making these slips often. Coincidence? I think not. 

I'm pointing out your slips and in your effort to mask your own slip, you try and accuse me of them. When my original post (and yours) is right there for anyone to see. I don't see the point in such an endeavour? I say again, **my original post is still there**. People can scroll right up and read it.

&gt; You keep making the same mistake in the next few paragraphs confusing sexuality for personal traits so I wont address them specifically.

I was pointing out the fallacies of *your* mistake, because *you* confused sexuality in that manner.

&gt; But to clarify, I was simply referencing how it would be impossible to get to know a person without being able to socialize privately with them in the first place.

And my goal by that was to get you to do exactly this, clarify your stances. Thank you.

There's no correlation between your view and the Islamic view, which is that you get to know the person after marriage.

After all, in Western culture, people hook up for sex and start dating usually without knowing a damn thing about the other person. People don't become friends first. Ever heard of the friend zone? Most redditors have.

The vast majority of Westerners do **not** want to get to know the person that well before having sex. Their first interaction is courtship. Essentially foreplay starts with the first date until it culminates in sex. Then after the sexual relationship is established, only then do they start getting to know each other (usually delaying this as long as possible).

You really aren't familiar with Western culture.

&gt; If you consider dating to be purely a series of sexual experiences then you're quite wrong my friend. That would be just sex.

You *really* aren't familiar with Western culture.

&gt; Considering how much sex Saudis are not having, why is KSA still screwing themselves and the middle east? Shouldn't it be a country of highly developed individuals who dont waste time pursuing sex ? Or are you going to argue they're having too much sex ? 
&gt;
&gt; Yes yes lets all ignore stuff like education by all means. Weak to say the least.

**You** ignored the issue of education. **You** are the one who implied people grow as individuals just from sexual experiences. You're refuting your own statements.

I don't think that it's a big issue among the middle/upper class.

Luckily, anyway, there are enough white people in SA (something like 20%) to where you don't stick out too much, but it can still be assumed that you are middle or upper class if you are white, which probably makes you a slightly more likely target for robbery, carjacking, etc.  You would have to be extra careful with your expensive camera gear in cities, for example.

I have not been to South America, but from what I read/hear I get the impression that the situation in Brazil is somewhat comparable to South Africa.  Instead of favelas, though, it's townships, and skin color is probably more important in SA.  In both places, the middle/upper class live in homes protected by razor wire, electric fences, etc.  In both places millions go about their lives without any problem, but a few unlucky people encounter serious trouble.

What I'm trying to say is that the risk is very real, and greatly increased compared to living in the US/Europe, but it's still pretty small.  So if you are okay with a little bit of added risk and stress in your day to day life, by all means go for it, you will have a fantastic time in an incredible country.  But just don't say you weren't warned if you are one of the very unlucky ones.

For comparison, murder rates by country:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate

...I will also add that I would absolutely go back on a temporary basis if there were a good opportunity to do so (up to a couple years I suppose), but I can't really imagine staying there permanently, raising kids there, etc.

edit:  I must respectfully disagree with anyone who says that Cape Town is safer than any American city, homicide statistics are fairly trustworthy.  Also, the idea that the crime is only in the townships is a common fallacy.  There is very good reason that the rich suburbs are full of big dogs and big fences and security patrols, it's because everybody knows that rich people have more valuable stuff, and they make good targets.

Islamic scholars do idolize past Islamic civilization but they tend to forget that it was a society where reason triumphed over faith (for a period of time) and where sexuality was not as stigmatized as it was in the rest of Europe. I suggest you read into the Caliphate's rule of Andalusia and how liberated society was in addition to the well documented debaucherous lives of poets and rulers. The paradigm shift from favoring reason to favoring faith (im not sure if you're familiar with Al Ghazali's ideologies, during his Sufist period) lead to an intellectual stagnation that eventually caused, in addition to other factors, the Islamic decline. I didnt think we were going to split hairs here over history.

God probably could. However, the Bible was not written by God. It was written by men. And these men used the best tools available to them.

In American sports, teams aren't punished for losing because losing is its own punishment. There is not a single person, player, or fan in the world that enjoys losing.

Why should they drop to a lower league? That won't make the team any better or provide for any lasting inter-league rivalries. It'll just make everyone have to do things a different way, it's a huge inconvenience.

&gt;How welcome will homosexuals, Jews, Christians, feminists and so on and so forth be in Qatar as they no doubt taint the beliefs of the local populace? How will all these new stadia be built? By people like you or waged slaves like in Dubai and Saudi Arabia?

Homosexuals exist in Qatar, believe it or not, and are not prosecuted. There are tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of Christians here, with their own churches - both private and government sponsored - a Jewish synagogue is under construction to cater for the small amount of expatriate Jews here, and feminists have had huge advances within the country. They work in every field, and several government ministers are women. Your arguments are baseless. 

&gt;How will all these new stadia be built? By people like you or waged slaves like in Dubai and Saudi Arabia?

By labourers who have come here on their accord to earn wages higher than they would back home. Their situation is indeed sad, and I believe more should be done for them, but Qatar is not the UAE.

There are worse offenders in the Middle East but I think you're just pretending that none of this is happening and it's so much easier to say that anyone who is against the World Cup being held in this nation is an ignorant bigoted racist.

I'm saying you are an ignorant, bigoted racist because you are simply using stereotypes that do not hold true to attack a country you know nothing about and have never set foot in, simply because you have a preconceived notion of what a Arab and Muslim nation is like.

Modern football in the US has been around for maybe less than 40 years. I am being generous with that number since the NASL is the first league that made any headway with the game in 1968. But then failed because they overreached in 17 years time. So really football has only been around for a total of 31 years. You can not build legacy that fast. Give it time. 

The MLS of today will not be the MLS of tomorrow. I do not think the English Football scene in the '40s looked at all similar to the football scene of today. English Football did not even have the Premier League. Give it time.

Yes some MLS teams have legacy building from their NASL roots. You speak of the Red Bulls. I am a fan of theirs, but I agree the name sucks, but it does not change that they are a good team, they are no different than Man City of the EPL. You have a cash cow owner and they are trying to win the league. It does not change the fact that before the Red Bulls bought the then NY Metrostars, the team has been present since 1996. Same team with just a different name. Could of easily have been the NY Cosmos but the then Metrostars were not able to buy the naming rights.

Relegation? Possible. I even believe the Commissioner of the league said it is possible. Lower leagues? US Soccer just allowed NASL to become the 2nd tier in US Soccer with MLS at the top, and United Soccer League becoming the 3rd tier. So teams could one day be alternating between the three. 

Salary cap? That is going to go away in due time. It is going to be raised every so year or so.

Edit: Forgot to mention the draft system. That is going to go away in good time as well. That is simply there to give the league some homegrown talent. But teams already have schools in place to build from within. Its just something to supplement the league. Once soccer becomes on par with either Major League Baseball or National Basketball Association the MLS and lower tiers will be able to get a lot of raw talent. 

I see the MLS being similar to the EPL in every way the only difference might be our playoff style. The worst teams still might be relegated but we will not have a single table format.

False,1291531900,"&gt;""we have to get over the idea that any country is exceptional or the premier superpower. We have to level the playing field diplomatically.""

It's not that I disagree with you entirely, because I think we'd agree on a lot, but I wonder if you are willing to take this all the way (it's something I ask myself from time to time). Will it be alright with you if the United States pulls all of it's soldiers out of South Korea and walks away from the North Korean issue (and by ""walks away"", I mean remains involved diplomatically, but no more than the next involved nation, because right now we are unilaterally guaranteeing S. Korea's security if N. Korea invades)? I assume that you want us out of the middle east. That sounds good to me (we can pull our troops out of foreign nations like Germany and S. Korea, cut back our military spending, invest that money into cheaper energy for ourselves, and kiss oil, and every problem that comes from dealing with the middle east, good-bye). Who will back up Israel, in that case, because I see a lot of nations saying they support Israel, but if they knew the US wouldn't get involved *any more than the average nation would in terms of troop deployments* should a war break out, would they be so quick to commit their own forces?

There was once a time, not so long ago, when the Western world was (more or less) happy that the US had a huge military (and dumped so much cash into it that we are now lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of social services for our own people) and stood between certain less friendly nations (read: nations with competing interests) and the Western world. Not more than three decades ago, Western Europe was encouraging us to compete with the Soviets on military spending. If the rest of the world sees us as a monster now, many of these same nations encouraged the monster when it was in their interests, and they continue to do so today...when it's in their interests.

Here's an example: In 1994, when Rwanda was on the front page because one faction was wiping out the other in what was clearly genocide, countries around the world attack the US verbally for not dropping combat troops into Rwanda and stopping the genocide. Who else wanted to go in? No one. Sure, many of us had soldiers deployed by the UN, but that wasn't even a peace-keeping force and it had no teeth. And the problems of Africa are a direct result of European colonialism. Rwanda was Belgium's mess. Where were they?

When people need the US, they complain if we don't come. You have to understand that this creates a certain attitude among many Americans. ""They want us when they need us and they complain if we protect our own interests like any other nation."" (And no, Iraq is not a case where this complaint is valid. That war was a mistake sold to us with lies and misplaced fear, and I'll point out the the UK helped us sell the lies and gave Bush cover. This does annoy me when I hear people from the UK pretending they are nothing like the US. Tony Blair was Bush's lapdog and helped him get into Iraq.) The UK once had the same attitude multiplied by...well, a lot.

My country isn't perfect. We make mistakes and some of them have recently shamed us, but we are not the monsters we're very frequently made out to be, and we've certainly not been the monsters that many European nations were just two generations ago. If we do have an empire (and the very thought of that makes me sick because that's not what I want my country to be), it's a kinder empire than many others that scaled themselves back in the 19th and 20th centuries. That's not an excuse or a justification, just a fact. There is no excuse for having an empire that subjugates others.

And that Star Trek universe...we aren't holding the world back from that. Human nature is. If you honestly believe that the next biggest or most powerful nation would not fill the vacuum we'd leave on our way out, I just don't think you're being honest with yourself. Russia, China, the UK, etc...who do you want at the top, because someone *will* assert their own authority. This is just a fact of life, at least for our lifetime.

False,1291549499,"Yeah, that's the misconception I was afraid of. While it's a very logical thing to think, and it's a very widespread story, the origins of Zwarte Piet actually lie elsewhere (for as far as we know, of course, since these kind of things  rarely have one clear basis).

The tradition of Zwarte Piet has its roots before slave trade ever began. In the middle ages, the devil was seen as someone with entirely black skin (while moorish people are generally, well, brown) and one of his many nickames was ""zwarte piet"". It is said that on Saint Nicholas' eve the saint triumphed over evil and bound the devil, turning him into his servant. Originally, there was only one Zwarte Piet. In some Eastern European countries there is still folklore about a white bearded man with a devil-slave giving presents to children. The tradition with the black make up stems from this era; on the Waddeneilanden young men would paint their faces black to scare the the people once a year.

Later on, in the Golden Age, the Zwarte Piet got racial connotations, and he did indeed turn into a moorish slave. His costume with the big collar stems from this era. The Zwarte Pieten punished children who had been bad, and were something to be feared. 

In the modern Sinterklaas celebrations Zwarte Pieten are kind and funny, and the explanation for their black skin is the soot from the chimneys, probably because a story about them being devils that were shackled by Sinterklaas would be a tad too scary. 

TLDR: While Zwarte Piet does have some influences from the era of slave trade, it's origins lie in a devil story.
