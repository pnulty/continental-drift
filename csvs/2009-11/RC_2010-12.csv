I'm French but I live in the UK (Scotland). Yup, I'm under the snow!

Yes a lot of what you say makes sense. I think what bugs me the most about capitalism, regulation or not, is the *fabrication* of demand, through marketing. I have resolved to live my life free of advertising. So although I do own a telly for video gaming it is not cabled or antenna'ed, so I do not watch the tv. I do pay the license fee though simply because I watch BBC programs on the IPlayer. Only ads I end up seeing are in the paper (Guardian or Independent) and on the internet, and then it feels like an insult to me than anything else - someone trying to convince me I absolutely need something I absolutely do not require. We need to find a way to tame the current system of marketing that is out there - especially ads that assault our kids. 

I think social democracy is a good way forward. 

You mention the patenting system, which needs, absolutely needs, to be revised. It is halting progress, not aiding it, in its current form. How we can find a balance though I do not know. 

You also mention stability, and it does seem that in a globalised economy social democracy seems destined to fail... which is why I'm convinced we need to reintroduce strict import tariffs. 

It's absurd that the Spaniards import tomatoes from Morocco for their own consumption and produce tons and tons of them for export to France and Britain (and the rest of Europe - and I wouldn't be surprised if you could find them in Japan Oo). It's totally absurd!! I come from Brittany and my Mum's town is a fishing town, mainly sardines, and they have canning factories there. Today, the sardines which are canned are driven all the way up from Morocco too in refrigerated vans, cause it's cheaper than paying fishermen decent wages. WTF? It makes economic sense, but makes no sense at all otherwise.

The lack of tariffs is why we have to subsidise European (mostly French, the English rant) agriculture to keep it alive. If we don't it dies. But if we impose import tariffs, our production makes sense and subsidies decrease if not disappear. We can eliminate tariffs when a country has decided to play on an equal footing. I know it sounds harsh, but I see no other way. 

International trade needs to make sense. If your country cannot produce tomatoes (such as in the UK) then don't eat tomatoes, or be willing to pay a decent price for them. In scotland all my friends who grew up here say that 15 years ago, tomatoes were a luxury. 

Concerning the financing of research programs, yes public funding must, absolutely must continue, and increase. Not just for energy, but for medicine (no-one seems to give a crap about tropical diseases because it wouldn't be profitable), physics, climatology, cosmology, etc. Science should be central to our World-views, regardless of profit. Otherwise, what is the point to all this?

One last point before I sign off: the way I see wealth. To me wealth and property is not really something that is *mine*. Simply because I will die one day and it's not coming with me. No matter your idea about death (I am an atheist, but works for religious/spiritual folk too). So I *borrow* wealth for a time, I work for it and in exchange get the means to life and pursue knowledge and happiness, but that is all it is. It is meant to be exchanged or spent on meaningful things, not hoarded up in huge sums, or spent with the sole purpose of making more, and more, and more. I think that is an abuse of the concept.

&gt; I'm not an American soccer fan, but a European football fan, and if the above is true, then American soccer fans are daft and bonkers.

You honestly don't see his point here?  That watching unknowns from a largely disinterested nation become international talents can be more exciting than watching born powerhouses - carefully nurtured for years and millions of pounds by decades-old clubs - perform at the level everyone already knows they're capable of?  I don't think this is a completely ridiculous notion.

&gt; I'd take the excitement of Espanyol-Barca or Atletico-Real Madrid over any MLS game any day of any year.

I think the author would suggest, with some credibility, that these games are often foregone conclusions.  Yes, there is the occasional upset, but the disparity is truly immense - no gap anywhere near this large appears in MLS.  Some people enjoy watching a truly gifted side dominating an obviously lesser one, with no chance of a reversal.  Others enjoy watching a genuine competition between two reasonably well-matched sides.

&gt; So Chelsea-Man Utd is the only important game in the EPL too then?

This is unfair.  Everyone knows the Premier League is better-balanced than La Liga.  With that said, it still has its traditional Big Four who rarely vie for the top spots with more than two or three other teams.

&gt; Why must the ""american stuff is better than the rest"" mentality also infiltrate soccer now?

I think it's fairly clear at this point that you're getting defensive out of a wider ideological point about American hegemony.  I don't think that's called for here.  Nobody's going to seriously suggest that MLS are anything but underdogs on the stage of international football.

I do understand how Wikileaks publishes information, but I don't necessarily agree with their methods of publishing that information. They knowingly broke the law, as did PFC Manning. I do, however, approve of the censoring of certain names on the documents they have released. But I often wonder if they are just sharing what they have on the U.S. and withholding information they have that has been sent from other nations. How would we know? I don't mean to seem to you that I am defending my country like a dimwitted patriot, as I disagree with many policies we have, namely Iraq. I was deployed there for 18 months, and I still don't fully understand why we had to go in and do what we did. But that's a discussion I don't want to have, as that horse has been beat a thousand times over. Besides, I do like living in my country, and I don't think it's as bad as everyone says it is. That's my opinion, anyway, and I know there are many people strongly disagree with me, and that's okay.

The cables were communications between diplomats, not the general public. Some are unclassified, and I don't see how those would really affect anything. They are just boring field reports that diplomatic missions in ""safe"" nations send to Washington to let them know all is well. In my opinion, the most damning cables are the ones concerning the Middle East (especially Iran) and North Korea. Our government is working with other governments and sharing information to deal with these regimes, and letting the world know what they are talking about could lead to strained relations, ""disappearances"" of certain individuals, and who knows what else. Time will tell if any of these scenarios happen; it's still very early in the game, and not all of the cables have been released. Personally, I hope nothing happens.

If there was a need to disseminate information to the public, I believe my government (or France's, the United Kingdom's, etc.) would do it in a timely fashion as to not create panic. Perhaps I am too trusting of my government in your eyes, but so far, my government has been pretty good to me. I've had a decent standard of living since I was born, as have my parents, and hopefully my children, if and when I have them, and I trust my leaders to do what they can to maintain that. If not, I'll move to Canada or Europe. I've done my time for the U.S. (currently waiting on my medical discharge from the Army) and wouldn't think twice about moving.

However you hardly give MLS an objective look yourself. 

It really is exciting to watch Juan Agudelo score a goal at 17 for the US national team when he is a homegrown product of my club, I have more tied to him then I do Messi. That is not to say I'm bored by Messi schooling a millionaire midfield or completely decimating the tactics of Mourinho, on the contrary, I think he is the most skilled player in the world, but watching Agudelo come onto the world stage meant something much more to me.

Borg's main argument is for parity in the league. Every team should have a decent chance at a title run, it makes it more exciting for fans of every team. This is in opposition to non-salary cap regulated leagues like La Liga or most European football or American baseball for that matter. In La Liga, since 1984-85 Barcelona and Real Madrid have won the title  85% of the time. 

You mention:
&gt;I'd take the excitement of Espanyol-Barca or Atletico-Real Madrid over any MLS game any day of any year

What about a match between two perennially middle of the pack teams fighting for neither relegation nor silverware? I acknowledge that dominant teams are important or necessary for exciting competition. Even in a salary-capped league there can still be perennial dominance by teams, but they must be smart about spending their money, and other clubs are much more able to build up and make title runs with smart decisions. 

Playoffs come down to taste, and whether you want to force excitement at the end of the year (at the expense of the regular season), or want to hope for an organic race. Personally I like a playoff system, but to each their own and I understand your argument.  

I do not think MLS is the beacon of competitive sports, the league is run downright stupid sometimes. However just because something is different or not the same level of quality does not make it suck. You are insulting people who are trying to enjoy the same game as you. Football is football and it will be beautiful wherever it is played.

I've already given you links which explain the differences. Do you not understand them? Do you not agree with them?

A ""counterpoint""? What does that mean? How about some evidence? Wind turbines are not the same as windmills - no matter how many people misuse the terms.

You've obsessed over this detail and ignored many of the other criticisms I made.

&gt; Precisely what I might say to you.

No, you really do seem upset that I have dared criticise the mighty Mackay. It's the usual response. You've failed to acknowledge the glaring error I pointed out and simply produced a bizarre defence that it was OK because there are sources available that refute it.

&gt; I am willing to pay some attention to him because I understand that he is simply providing an estimate that I can verify or falsify by checking government and industry studies. 

After a certain number of errors and flawed assumptions, any rational person rejects a source. It seems you are happy to accept far more than I believe is reasonable.

&gt; You seem angry with him 

You can try to personalise this as much as you want - but it's a weak tactic. I reject his work because of the errors in it.

&gt; ...because of some inconsistencies in his book and because he occasionally uses emotive phrasing. 

Not ""inconsistencies"" - glaring errors and flawed, uncited assumptions. And a theme throughout the rating that should make it clear to anyone with reasonable grasp of English that it is someone with an agenda.

&gt; This seems to have led you to scrap him entirely as a source and go overboard by nit-picking specific terms like 'windmill'.

Your obsession with that one issue does not alter the wide-ranging criticisms I have made.

&gt; I enjoy a rational scientific dialectic, such as that provided by your data analysis, not baseless speculation over nounal peculiarities.

It's easy to lie with data - by cherry picking and omission - but language gives much away.

&gt; ...a few reactors that have suffered from cost overruns. 

It's not a *few* - it's a consistent pattern as well as the simple fact and reality that nukes are not being built. I'm describing reality. Many people are evidently upset about that.

&gt; ...cheap nuclear reactors currently being built...

Not in Europe. Not in the US. And multiple credible analyses predict that's how it's going to stay. Excellent.

&gt; ...nuclear has historically provided cheap power. 

Not true. Nuclear has been massively subsidised and its lifecycle costs handed off to future generations.

&gt; The modern political reality is 

You keep referring to this vague concept of ""politics"". It's meaningless. It's like ACC deniers who keep saying climate science has been ""politicised"" and thinking they've hit on a winning argument.

&gt; Windmills are...

You're using the wrong term. It's not difficult: wind turbines produce electricity.

&gt; ...only a little more expensive than nuclear and coal...

Wrong. Wind is cheaper than nuclear and cheaper than fossil with externalities included.

One component of civil debate is not making stufff up.

&gt; The political reality is that renewables receive heavy government subsidies in industrialized countries. Take this EIA report, for example (pdf): in terms of dollars per megawatt produced...

Wrong. Again. Fossils and nuclear have received far more subsidies than renewables. The $ / MW is a misleading comparison - renewables have only just begun to be deployed with all the upfront costs. Nuclear has had half a century of investment, fossil two or three.

&gt; ...those heavy subsidies are part of why there's a market for renewables. 

If it were only one or two countries you might make that argument stick, but it's not. It's practically every country on the planet. Renewables are receiving massive investment and deployment because they work and offer the best solution. If you stop trying to look for excuses and conspiracies, it should become obvious.

&gt; If nuclear received relatively higher subsidies, the story would be different, 

It has! For half a century - and still cannot stand up on its own. See France - even the French no longer want nuclear because of its expense and leaks and accidents and waste.

&gt; but nuclear isn't as politically viable, so politicians who are worried about getting reelected don't push for nuclear subsidies.

You really need to lose your obsession with this vague ""political"" thing. It's meaningless.

&gt; ...the final at-the-outlet cost of wind is pretty good, but so is that of nuclear. 

Nope. Nuclear is not. Proven over and over again. And until the South Korean, Chinese, Indian governments provide full disclosure of funding and costing for lifecycle costs, I'll take the reports of their reactor costs with a pinch of salt.

&gt; ...we don't really have a comprehensive, financially plausible energy solution where we stand right now.

Fair enough...  I tend to wander off track at times. :-)

&gt; The incentives I have written about are pretty clear. When marginal tax rates are high, and you own a business, you have a choice: if I take profits that exceed the high marginal tax rate, I will lose much of that money to taxes.
Or, I can reinvest the money in the business, grow the business, and retain the value of all that money in the net worth of my business.
What would you be motivated to do?

If these folks are indeed rich and successful, then that means that their demand for work is relatively inelastic.  They would likely either stop working, work less, find a tax shelter, or they might plow some of that money into their business (whether it was wise to do so or not).

I think the underlying premise that plowing money back into your business is a good is not sound that would lead to serious  mis-allocations of resources.  Let's say I'm a boomer about to retire who has taken a beating lately in the market.  He wants to wind down his business (maybe he can't / doesn't want to sell it).  These policies would force him to misallocate resources and deny the market much needed liquidity.  Also, one of the leading deaths of small businesses is expanding too quickly.  Assuming your presumption is correct, wouldn't this lead to even more business failures?

Also, if high marginal tax rates to some threshold spurs economic growth wouldn't the EU and other high tax areas be buzzing with start-ups and the entrepreneurial spirit instead of the relatively low taxed US?

Finally, you mentioned th 50's and the high tax rates.  Correlation does not determine causation...  Those rates were also in place during the Great Depression.  The 50's were also a period of time where the government to GDP percentage was around 12-15% (my memory could be a little off).",True,False,,infamia,0,0

I promise you, if Athletic Bilbao suddenly started playing 150% better and winning the title, you'd see the TV money change as well. Plus, titles bring in money, which they could use to buy better players, i.e. extending their good run.

What you mention here is why I am saying a cap could possibly help leagues. You say it yourself, because some clubs don't have the funds they cannot compete with top level clubs. How are teams supposed to start winning/ gain prominence if they are at such a severe disadvantage when spending money leads to the ability to spend more money and win more matches? With a cap that disadvantage is limited.

I do think a salary cap is not feasible for European Football because of its international nature, but I do think MLS is creating a good competitive environment for itself. Yes clubs will grow slower, and not be able to buy young talent from other clubs, but at least if my club makes good decisions, they have a decent chance at making a run for the title.

&gt;I really like your argument, relegation is something that would likely won't come to MLS, but it surely spurs bottom of the table teams to play. The anxiety of relegation and excitement of promotion really would add to the league.

When it comes to quality of opposition faced in the league, EPL sides come first (obviously), distant second being Serie A and even more distant third being La Liga. If performance in Europe is the metric, then EPL sides have been doing as good if not better than Spanish sides. There is no way you can come to the conclusion that Barcelona/Madrid are playing the best in all of Europe.

Your precise words were ""the game carries some major importance in determining the Spanish championship,"" while I'm saying No this game does not in any way determine who will win the league since it is too early in the season and only two points separate the sides. I agree that the game was important in that it would give bragging rights to the winner but that's a given for any long-standing rivalry.

When the regulation, therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters.](http://books.google.com/books?id=rBiqT86BGQEC&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;ots=Zx86RjTPLZ&amp;dq=%22Whenever%20the%20legislature%20attempts%20to%20regulate%20the%20differences%20between%20masters%20and%20their%20workmen%2C%20its%20counsellors%20are%20always%20the%20masters.%20When%20the%20reg&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)


Regulation should exist - and does exist in many cases - to prevent companies that are monopolies from abusing their dominate position in the market place and being anti-competitive as that is really being anti-capitalist. It is a manipulation of free market forces. That is the proper role from government, ensuring fair, transparent, competitive markets. Because when market forces are in place in many industries, you really can see why capitalism is an amazing economic model. Even more so when policies allow for companies to also look long term (which is also a by product of being competitive). I used to not think it was a good model, now I now believe it just needs good active regulation to keep market forces alive and working for the overall economy in a majority of industries. Some markets just don't suit well to market forces, such as health care services because essentially you'd pay anything not to die (treatment for say an operable brain tumor) and the pricing model doesn't seem to work as well there. Getting back to telecommunications, the telecommunications policy in this country has been screwed up for well over a decade or two. Telecommunications Act of 1996 reduced competition in media and helped spur this in part. An even more important part is how we handle our telecommunications infrastructure.


This is the real solution to the problems we face. Creating open networks in the form of line sharing. Also line sharing isn't done for free. Those providers who are sharing the lines compensate the company that built the lines out. It is still enough incentive for the company to build and maintain those lines or you wouldn't see it work in other countries.

We met a group of local students in the first week I believe, and they were great people, we went on trips to Austin, to restaurants, cliff jumping, bowling etc, but then suddenly one of the girls gave us pocket versions of the bible, and invited us to come to a bible study, she told us what pages to read. It totally blew my mind. For one, I had never heard of a bible study, but I could guess what it was of course, and I could hardly believe these young, fun, people would have them regularly. We (a group of 4 friends) didn't decline out of politeness however, but none of us even considered reading those pages. Not out of principle or anything, but it all just seemed rather ridiculous to us. 

We went to meet them in the big house they lived in and it was one of the most awkward meetings ever. We told them we didn't really got around to reading the pages, and we quickly went into a discussion about religion in general. This type of conservation was one that would be unthinkable amongst Dutch students. The thing that amazed me most that most of the simple arguments we mentioned seemed completely new to them. For example, after they talked how you only get into heaven if you accept Jesus etc, I asked how that was fair for the people born in places like the middle-east, where you would never even learn about the Christian God or Jesus. These kind of arguments seemed to kind of stun them. They didn't get angry or anything, I think were just as surprised as us as to how people their age could believe stuff like this. 

After the bible study, they didn't really try to convert us anymore, although they started to do random kind things. The best one was this one day we came to our dorms and all the laundry we had hung out to dry was in neatly folded piles in front of our door, and when we asked them about it, they first said they hadn't done that, but later admitted they did.

We also went to church with them once, and this could be interesting for all you Europeans that wonder what it's like from a non-US point of view (all churches I had been to up to that point were catholic ones). The first thing that was weird to me is that almost every church is a separate entity, like they all have a slightly different religion. This particular church focused way more or Jesus than God, I don't know if that's common. The building looked like a warehouse on the outside, and inside there was just chairs and a podium. The mass consisted of two things that alternated: a band playing Christian rock (another first time) and a guy in regular clothes preaching. I don't remember too much about what he said except for one part. The mass of that today was about disciplining your kids, and what the bible had to say about that. Turns out, the bible says you use a rod. Then there was sort of a Q&amp;A where younger parents could get advice from older parents on how to raise their kids. One of them asked if it was ok to discipline your child in places like the Walmart, with lots of people around. The answer was that if your child was not behaving in places like that, you should take them back to the car, where you should keep a rod, and discipline them there. Another young father asked about his 4 year old daughter, who didn't want to come to church, not even when he had used his rod to 'convince' her. He was told to be patient and persevere using the rod, and his daughter would change her mind soon enough. I was quite disgusted after that day.

Another thing I heard later was that the girl I mentioned earlier, had not been part of that church for very long. She and her parents had been part of another church for a long time, but their parents got a divorce. On top of the stress of the divorce, they got cast out by the community to which they belonged for years (divorced people are evil apparently). She told us she went into quite a severe depression for a while after that, until she was accepted into her current church.

This trip really made me realize how completely different religion is viewed between the Netherlands and parts of the US. I haven't even mentioned that the girl was going to Africa for a year to be a missionary, or how it was not strange at all for people younger than us (early 20s) to be married with 2 kids.

It is hard to describe how religion is viewed amongst people my age or younger in (my part of) the Netherlands, mostly because it is such a tiny part of our culture. Most kids go to (catholic) church for Christmas, Easter, weddings and funerals, and that's it. I don't think there are many people who consider themselves atheist, simply cause they haven't even thought about it, religion is such a small part of their lives. The vast majority won't believe in God, but the question is never asked, certainly not amongst people of the same age, and there is pretty much no discussion about religion in the media (like evolution vs creationism in schools). If I would tell my parents I'm an atheist, they would probably think I'm drunk or something, it would be like going up to them and telling them I don't like cucumbers (things are fucking nasty), ie they probably couldn't care less, and would think I'm weird for even mentioning it. I think that in 20-30 years or so, when my generation is getting old, religion will have died a quiet death. There will still be churches, and people will go to them for funerals and weddings for the sake of tradition, but the amount of people actually believing in God will be a few %.

1. Know the invoice of the car. (Trueprice.com or edmunds.com)
2. How much people are paying in your area (usually below invoice is a good deal, again see trueprice.com and edmunds.com)
3. Know exactly how much APR (over X months) the car dealer will give you vs. what you can get from a credit union or bank. I found that car dealers will give you outstanding APRs compared to banks if your credit is good. Be sure to check out hondamotors.com or whatever car model's website to know if they're having specials.
3a. I emailed 6 dealers for their costs in my area within a 50mile radius. You should have at least 5 different price quotes.
4. Know how much you're willing to pay Out The Door. Edmunds.com has a loan calculator that can help you with this. I used this extensively whenever figuring out how much out of pocket to expect.

#4 is the most important. If you can't afford the car based on #4, then you should either leave the dealer and find another, or buy a different car. #4 can only be calculated if you know #1-#3a.

They will possibly try to throw these sales pitches at you when you sit down in their financing department:

1. dent repair coverage
2. paint coverage
3. accessories (clear bra, etc)
4. oil/maintenance plan
5. extended warranty
6. leather/cloth protectorant

You don't need all of these provided you either have a place to do all the work yourself or just simply don't need it. Most if not all cars come with a 36k mile/3 year warranty, and I believe Toyota and most European cars come with a free oil/maintenance plan. I carefully figured out the costs and weighed them against what they were offering, and found out the oil/maintenance plan they offered was cheaper after talking to my mechanic. I got my clearbra installed somewhere else because it was cheaper and also got windows tinted all for the cost of what they were offering me. 

You just need to do your research and crunch some numbers. I have a google spreadsheet of my research if you're interested in seeing how I did the calculations.

If people walk away from their business, others take their place. The marketplace benefits from more motivated businesspeople.

&gt;the underlying premise that plowing money back into your business is a good is not sound

Okay, so your position is that business investment is bad? We should encourage businesses to shrink? Unemployment is great?

&gt;...that would lead to serious mis-allocations of resources.

If businesses misallocate resources and malinvest, other businesses will do this better and prosper. Losers die.  The marketplace benefits. 

&gt;Assuming your presumption is correct, wouldn't this lead to even more business failures?

Nobody is telling businesses they have to expand - or to take profits. These are business decisions that everyone will make differently. You're taking my argument too far.  A tax incentive to reinvest is exactly that - just an incentive.   So it will tip a few more businesspeople toward reinvestment - hopefully when it's sound to do so.  Somebody that malinvests deserves to fail, frankly. A better business will take its place.

&gt;if high marginal tax rates to some threshold spurs economic growth wouldn't the EU and other high tax areas be buzzing with start-ups...

I said it could, not that it absolutely will. If it's a small effect, it would be hard to pin down. Mainly, tax rates have very little effect on business growth. Because all business expenditures are tax deductible.

&gt;you mentioned th 50's and the high tax rates. Correlation does not determine causation... Those rates were also in place during the Great Depression.

This does not refute my argument that high marginal tax rates do not hinder business growth. We can see good growth both under low and high tax rates. Tax rates don't really matter.

1. For all the salient points he aims to address, the fact is that he's taking a small league with a lot of potential and attempting to compare it with a genuine world-class footballing masterclass. While talk of this match should focus on how great Barcelona were, he tries to make it about how well-matched the MLS sides are. Sorry, it just comes across as sad. 

2. Attempting to talk down others to big up your league. The MLS deserves more respect than it probably gets, but a big part of why that doesn't happen is because people elect to compare Tim Ream to the players we saw on display today. What's more amazing than watching a club take an 13-year-old with a bone deficiency and turning him into the best footballer of his generation? 

3. I think he's as guilty of ignoring the rest of La Liga in the same way he accuses the rest of the world of doing. It's easy to criticize the league for being a two horse race, it's just as easy to actually take the time to enjoy some of the spectacular football on display from the other 18 clubs. The writer chose to practice the former and very likely neglected the latter this weekend. 

4. The 7th-placed team in La Liga currently hold a European trophy. While there's a gulf in class between them and the absolute best in Spain and Europe, they've still been able to win a title befitting of their place in European football. Meanwhile, a team in the US got a lucky draw and won a trophy that dilutes the actual league winner's achievements.

You're just wrong. 

&gt; Nice hyperbole. Nice ignoring the fact that the Islamic world has done the same shit and for far longer.

Not remotely at the same scale. Muslims pretty much integrated into the societies they conquered. So it didn't make sense for them to plunder, torture and rape the societies that came under their control. Heck, most of the middle east, North Africa and even Spain *wanted* Muslims to come and rescue them from their evil Byzantine overlords (and in the case of Spain, Germanic invaders from the North). So did low caste Hindus in South Asia.

&gt; As if the Islamic world never did the same?

Not remotely at the same scale. Muslims almost invariably treated the people that came under their control with respect and dignity. Westerners on the other hand engaged in mass-murder, rape and plunder. The only genocide I can think of committed by Muslims was the Armenian genocide but that was perpetrated mostly by secular Turkish nationalists influenced by the various European nationalist movements at the time. So the West can be held responsible for that too. 

&gt;How is this racist? 

I bet you think calling black people monkeys and apes isn't really racist either. In any case, my ancestral origins are in East Asia, so your constant references to camels is misplaced. Most Muslims aren't even Arab or from the middle east. Read some books.

I am also a female (23) and have done quite a lot of solo travelling in the past 2 years (Canada, USA, Iceland, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Monaco, Italy, Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia/Herzeg, Croatia, Albania, Greece, Turkey, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya). 

I have a few continent specific recommendations: 

In Europe: 

* Definitely make use of hostels (hostelworld.com, hostelbookers.com, hihostels.com). You will meet so many amazing new friends, both from your country and from many others. If you're feeling shy about approaching people, remember that they are there to make friends too! I spent 4 months traipsing about Europe last summer and never *once* had someone turn up their nose at my friendly overtures. The people I met in hostels absolutely made my trips what they were - amazing. 
* For each new locale, make a list of the things you 1) MUST see 2) Would like to see 3) Wouldn't mind seeing. Try to get to the first two, but don't sweat it if you can't make it everywhere. You need a reason to go back, right? 
* Don't get too caught up on your ""itinerary"". Supposed to go to Florence but met some really cool people in Venice who are headed to Verona? Go with them! 
* On the above note, try not to book hostels or trains/flights too far in advance. It's an awful feeling to miss out on an experience because you *have* to get your train. 
* If you are considering a rail pass, try to figure out where you actually will and will not use it. It may be cheaper to buy point to point tickets if you need to use many high-speed trains or you cannot book in advance (they only reserve so many seats on trains for pass holders). 
* For longer hauls, flights are often cheaper. In Eastern Europe, I recommend Wizz Air (I got from Split, Croatia to London, UK for 60 euros), and in the West either EasyJet or (reluctantly) Ryanair. Buses can also be great - Eurolines brings you from Brussels to Paris for 20 euros! 
* If you are a student, BRING YOUR STUDENT CARD or ISIC. You will receive discounts at many sites, and it is absolutely worth it. 
* Every now and then, trust to the kindness of strangers. I know... you are a girl alone and are (rightly) concerned for your safety. But I cannot tell you how many times I was guided (yes, not just directed but *guided*) to my hostel or to a site by a friendly, albeit strange man. Most people are friendly and it served me well to remember that. 

The Middle East: 

* Don't listen to what others might say about a lone foray into the Middle East... it is *incredible* and perfectly doable for a single female. 
* A caveat to the above... the only countries I have been to in the Middle East are those that cling to Saudi Arabia. Ergo...  some of the more moderate ones in the region. However, with a bit of discretion and *respect* for the culture, they are incredibly enjoyable. 
* First things first... men WILL stare at you. As a lone, porcelain-skinned blonde girl, I stood out. A lot. However, try not to feel threatened or ill at ease. In all my time in the UAE, Oman, and Qatar, I was NEVER harassed by a man (which is more than I can say for home) - though I was once (incredibly amusingly) propositioned openly on the streets of Doha. He took my refusal like a gentleman :) 
* The shopping is as incredible as they say. Nothing else for this point, I just thought you should know...
* Please, PLEASE... respect the culture. I was in the UAE in June. It was 45-50 degrees most days. I wore sleeves to my elbows and long skirts/trousers. This is even more important when you plan to visit a religious site (e.g. In Dubai, you can visit the Jumeirah mosque even if you are not a Muslim). It doesn't matter whether you are religious yourself (I'm not), everyone deserves respect. 
* Middle Eastern hospitality is incredible - I have never felt more welcome than when dining at restaurants in the region. 
* Many of the people in these countries are immigrants. Most of the people I met in the UAE, for example, were actually Indian or Pakistani and simply working there for the time being. Lucky you! You have the opportunity to experience the host culture and that of the majority of residents. 
* Perhaps one of the most important things for me was the incredible beauty in contrast that I found: the buildings of the past few decades - unbelievable triumphs of glass and steel borne out of the minds of some of the most gifted architects of our time crest the swelling dunes of a desert whose boundaries fade into the periphery of sight... a woman at a restaurant, who at first glance appears to be clad in traditional garb and separated from the male patrons, is revealed to be talking international law on her iPhone while sifting through her recent purchases from Chanel... etc. 
* A special tip for the ladies - in many places, the male:female ratio is heavily skewed toward cock. Consequently, there are often ""ladies nights"" at bars (read: hotels... often the only places where there is a liquor license). At home (Canada for me), this often means no cover or cheap drinks before 11. In the Middle East, this often means you drink free... all night... whatever your drink of choice. 

Africa:

* In all my travels, I have **NEVER** met more friendly, helpful, and welcoming people than I have in the majority of the African countries I have visited. I *wish* that I had known straight away how genuine their kindness was. I was on guard for probably the first few weeks I lived in Ghana and it was completely unfounded. 
* Troubling to learn a few words in the local language will get you far. Most people really, really appreciate it. One word you will get to know for certain (if you are anything but black yourself...) is the local word for ""white person"". This applies also if you are brown or asian. Please try not to be offended... especially if you are off the beaten track, you may be a novelty! This applies doubly for children. 
* If you are staying any length of time... *please* don't sell your experience short by bonding only with other expats/travellers. This applies for any place, really, but Africa seems particularly prone. 
* Tourist scams can happen. Be on the lookout (just like any other place!). Keep in mind the difference between the real price and the non-African price of an item. In bargaining, try to shoot for halfway between what they offer you and what you wished they had asked. This is especially important for big ticket items (e.g. safaris). That being said, please don't debase yourself by haggling for what amounts to pennies. I know that you might view yourself as a ""poor backpacker"", but travelling (no matter the ostensible squalor of your accomodations or transport) is a luxury that most in the world will never experience. I wish someone had stressed this to me sooner. 
* A litre of beer is usually less than a dollar. A litre of palm wine can be less but the chance of going blind is slightly higher. I'm not here to babysit, so just give it the obligatory try and move on :) 
* Everything will take longer than you expect. Often 2-3 times as long. The faster you get used to this idea, the more pleasant your time will be. 
* When overlanding, remember that the borders and their regulations are somewhat... more lax than you may be used to. Go with the flow (and hey, you may end up with handwritten visas in your passport!) 
* Be aware of the shift that occurs with varying religions. The north of Africa is predominantly Muslim. Act respectfully toward whatever religion you encounter (African people, on the whole, seem more devout to me than many others). 
* As a female: other women may be surprised by your nerve, try to see it as a compliment (though it may not come across that way);  you may get a lecherous stare here and there, but I was never openly harassed by a man... EVER (and yes, I was in some of these places for months).
* I touched a warthog. Full palm contact. That's not advice, I just tell everyone who will listen. Nevertheless, I recommend it. 

Overall:

* Enjoy travelling alone! It is (in my opinion) the BEST way to travel because your desires, must-see sights, etc. are the only ones that matter! Travelling alone is a luxury of youth (and affluence... sorry to be a downer)! 
* If you are feeling lonely, friends and family are just a Skype call away. Everywhere I've ever been had internet cafes. Keeping in touch is simple. 
* Be outgoing, be yourself (Hopefully I'm not espousing contradictory ideas there... but I doubt it). 
* The standard: Pack half as much as you think, and bring double the money... 

If you want any specific details or recommendations, feel free to PM me! 

TL;DR Travelling alone is incredible. Seize the opportunity, and be open to other cultures and new friends. **Bring condoms.**

What's the point of competing for the ultimate prize when you know that some lucky-ass club might beat you to it in the end? With success comes the financial reward, which makes the team more of a threat in the following seasons, granted it doesn't fall to mismanagement, both tactically and financially. When you play 1on1 basketball, and you score, who gets the ball at the top of the 3 point line the following point? You! Because you scored, and you get rewarded. (unless you play losers ball, in which case you're just a nasty red commie socialist) 

Salary caps will never work in Europe, and should never be implemented. Just look at the difference between Real Madrid, a team with a glorious history (9 CLs, 31 La Ligas), in the bustling metropolis of Madrid, 80.000+ capacity stadium that's almost always full, close to a million official Madridista card holders (or Barca, or Man Utd, or Bayern, or AC Milan) and compare that team to e.g. Villareal, a team that plays in a town with a population of 51.000 (2009 census) and regularly fills a 25.000 seater stadium (that's 49% of the town's population) , and got to the semi's in the CL recently btw...poor Riquelme. The difference between the club's past history and their location just makes a salary cap completely impossible. Most clubs here in Europe have over 100 years of history, and the truly great clubs have built their name up over many decades of ups and downs. MLS is a new league, and there is simply no comparison what so ever to the European Leagues. MLS teams lack tradition, history, fan culture, supporters, and most importantly, trophies.  

The Danish league, where FC Copenhagen have a 40.000 seater (avg. att : 23000), and then a club like FC Nordsjælland gets a 1.017 attendance last weekend. You have to understand that the bigger the stadium, the bigger the revenue of tickets, concession stands, merchandise, etc etc... Obviously, the clubs with the most cash can be the most competitive ones, and you only get that cash injection by performing well and attracting supporters and sponsors, qualifying for Europe, winning titles, getting bonuses, developing players and selling them for a high price, etc... Inequality is needed, because when FC Nordsjælland then beats FC Copenhagen one day (as they sometimes do), it's a much sweeter victory than if they beat e.g. bottom table SønderjyskE. 

The MLS model might work well for you guys over there, but it will never, and should never work in Europe. While sometimes, the financial inequalities here are staggering, it also adds something to the excitement of the game. Yes, Man City is dogshit for trying to buy a trophy, but look at how even the haters are following their progress and wondering what will become of the oil-money funded project. Currently they're 4th, while Liverpool, England's most successful club, is struggling to remain mid-table. That's some exiting shit right there, regardless of what team you support. 3 weeks ago Chelsea seemed certain to stroll towards a back to back, but now people are wondering if they'll even get a top 3 finish. A season is a long campaing where a team has to prove it can compete over 38 games, and to have that hard work shattered in the playoffs is just insane (E.g. LA Galaxy wins all their games in the season, but due to bad referee calls in the first playoff round they dump out 0-1 and watch the team that finished 20 points below them become the champions... where's the justice and fairness in that?)

I like the European leagues and their format. You guys seem to like the MLS format. Let's just leave it as it is, eh? I'm sure that once soccer becomes more popular in the states, and more teams pop up, you will also get divisions, relegation battles, League cups, etc, but for now, I think we're good as we are.

The broken dreams of a lost generation will breed a new wave of extreme nationalism, pushing the already fragile democratic process onto its knees.  In the U.S the final blow comes from the emergence of an extreme right wing religious movement who come into power by their strong protectionist stance and the promise of swift action.  Hard fought freedoms are gone overnight.  Corporate power spins out of control with ties to almost every major national leader.  The left wing continues to remain divided until it is too late. 
 
Across the world, with the threat of economic collapse, a China fat off the previous decade’s gains decides to flex its muscle in the region by using the failing DPRK to launch an all-out attack on Seoul.  By this time the U.S has had to recall much of its power from the region due to the growing discontent back home.  While the government is preoccupied with splinter groups and renewed and a newly united left wing movement the NK army spreads out and finds itself on Japanese soil with plans to reach out further.

The looming decay of the EU is held at bay as the Russian Bear turns its eyes westward, quickly taking the eastern nations, and quashes the caucuses with brutality not seen since the early days of the Iron Curtain.  The fighting that breaks out in Europe ensures that the Chinese enabled DPRK is able to continue its spread on the eastern front.  Everyday China's own role grows stronger and more apparent, until it reveals its takeover of the governments of its newly captured territories.  

The end of the decade sees an attack on Iran by a coalition of forces.  Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and others move forward, anticipating Iran’s entry into the “new Axis” alliance which has surprisingly been long coming.  While not a full out civil war in the U.S, there are a great groups who have named the government complicit in treasonous activity and continue to gather support every day, expecting  a potential long and drawn out struggle to restore the fallen republic.  Little do they and their oppressors know that the Bear, the Dragon, and Cholimma will come soon come knocking at their door.

&gt;From what I understand if you have a Polish ancestor then by blood rights you have Polish citizenship automatically.

&gt;To use this citizenship and do things like get a passport you first need to get CONFIRMATION of Polish citizenship. Talk to the Polish consulate in your country to find out about doing this.

&gt;But if your ancestor or anyone in the chain renounced their Polish citizenship then the chain ends and you aren't Polish. There are a few other complications too - search on this forum about it because this stuff is asked all the time.

&gt;Also the process can take a number of years, so don't expect to get an EU passport from this any time soon....

so, from this, as long as your great grandfather didn't officially declared that he was no longer Polish, you should be golden.

The only reason I know that bananas have potassiums is because of the 105 bus. It's the bus I would take from my apartment to go to school, or go do groceries, or pretty much go anywhere.

One day, there was an old lady, sitting up front, next to the door, chatting with the driver. She must've been well into her 60s (if not 70s or more), plump, and looking like one of those wise, stocky Eastern European grandmothers. She was brandishing a single banana. As I walked on, she held it out towards me: ""Eat, eat! It has potassium! You must get your potassium!"". I smiled politely and took my seat. Crazy lady.

I sat down, and she held her banana out to every passenger entering or leaving the bus. Every time, the same spiel: ""Eat, eat! It has potassium!"".

Then, this drunk, scruffy younger guy (late 20s) gets on the bus, carrying a case of beer. He drops his case of beer under a seat, and plops himself down, not too far from the old lady.

She turns to him to give her usual advice, holding out the banana: ""Eat, eat! It has potassium!"".

The drunk guy wakes up just enough to start berating her. ""I bet you ate a lot of bananas back in the day! Word is you were a real SLUT! You probably sucked AL CAPONE's dick, didn't you? Back in the day! That's what they all say, that you were a big SLUT!"".

Then, a French lady gets up and walks to the front of the bus, to get off at the next stop. Upon walking past the drunk guy, she curls her nose at his boozey odor, and spits on the floor of the bus in disgust, before getting off.

You guessed it - military brat.  I'm neither now, nor was I then, particularly interested in or swayed by religion.  However, I quickly came to realize that this was the place that some clever fucking dudes hung out.  

Our tour guide, himself obviously of the cloth, but doubtfully himself a monk, was quite the skilled narrator.  As it were, he said, during the Napoleonic times, the Tiny's cronies went around fucking shit up for various reasons all across Europe.  Why they opted to hit this particularly well-hidden monastery was very likely explained to me in the most patient tone the German/Austrian language allows for, however, I simply do not recall, though it is irrelevant: They did, and it was ugly.  The monks, it was explained, ]were a proud people, who treasured their monastery and the surrounding land.  Of particular interest to them, as with all monasteries and the therein contained, was the once-great library contained within the walls of this fortress in ruins.  

Of course, the library, and all of its contents, were mercilessly destroyed, as was wont to happen in a siege such as that which took place.  Compounding this already grievous situation was the impending visit by one of the church's higher ranking dignitaries, purportedly sent to assess damage.  The proud monks, faced with the embarrassment of being unable to defend the walls that had protected them for so long, did what any man or men lacking the luxury of careful contemplation would do - they tried to hide the extent of the damage.  They rebuilt walls.  They addressed felled trees by removing more to create the appearance of intent.  They cleaned.  

Our guide knew his story like I know my keyboard.  It was explained to us that when the dignitary finally presented at the foot of the monastery, he was greeted by the proud people he wasn't sure to expect - heads held tall and all too eager to take the luminary on a tour to remember.  The grounds.  The brick path atop a wall over a hundred feet tall yet as broad as the shoulders of a slight man, which remained conspicuously unequipped with any kind of protective railing, that served as the sole connection between the two main buildings, loudly but beautifully overlooking the rushing river below.  

Now, the glorious entryway.  The ceilings, rebuilt and connected flat to the walls no differently than any cookie-cutter townhouse, but painted such that, from any possible angle appeared to gently and seamlessly slope from wall to ceiling.  Our guide explained *how* the monks achieved this effect, and I saw it with my own eyes, however, even when our guide showed us with a long pointing stick where the hard edge where the wall met the ceiling, it was impossible to *see* it.

The spiral staircase, appropriately ornate, but whose underside was spectacularly painted with a typical scene of religious ceremony - people draped in cloths, wine being drunk, food plentifully scattered across the table - such that when standing in the center, looking up, when one relaxed ones eyes and stared, the painting created the illusion of a flattened image.  

The library.  Being at the time young, I'd never been in a library that *smelled* as much as this.  Leather.  I now know that there is a not a whisky in the world that would not have tasted better in this room.  I do not believe these were trappist monks, nor do I believe there was ever a whisky-swilling equivalent, but I can only imagine.  

These walls, demonstrated the monks, as well as by our robed raconteur, were were lined floor to ceiling with the collected knowledge and history of a noble people whose very lives were dedicated to learning and preserving the word of their creed and the teachings of those who followed it.  The guest, adequately impressed, especially, as our guide pointed out, with the thickness and grandeur of the shelving, was led on, and eventually provided a feast and some repose.  

Our guide, now equipped with a shit-eating grin the likes of which I'll never forget, showed us what the monks could never show their dignified visitor.  He reached over, and pulled from a curiously clean section of an otherwise dusty span of shelf,  (clean likely because our guide stopped at the same location during the same part of a tour he'd clearly given many a time before), one of the thickest, tallest, and gloriously hide-adorned books I'd ever seen.  He said ""Knowing that you Canadians likely speak limited German, allow me to read to you the title of this book - 'Leather Bound Oak, volumes III'"".  We were silent.  He reached for another.  ""'The saga of the pinus nigra' - you may not know"", he said, ""but the pinus nigra is the proper name for the Austrian Pine.  This one - 'The Cold Travels of a Fir with no Fur"".  Still, not but silence.  Our teachers and parental chaperons, thankfully, shared our dumbfoundedness.  

Reaching out to one of the smaller girls, likely for effect, he offered her the book, asking her to open it to the third chapter.  She pulled back the cover, and the sound of 20 gentle gasps lit up our guide like he had finally solved, after months of trying, that damned Rubic's cube.

* go to Latin America if you want to make almost nothing or pay to teach (seriously, some programs are like that)
* go to Asia if you want to get paid
* Europe is a toss up
* there's pretty much nothing in Africa

I graduated from college with an English degree. I thought about going to Latin America for a LONG time. In the end, I didn't, just because of student loans. Though you can't make as much money there (and often the things you are paying for is the certification programs, which I found tend to be required more in the Latin America region) I don't think that's a total ""no."" If you studied Spanish in HS and college like me it's a huge draw, and the culture is great.

I went to Asia, specifically Korea. BLAST (and no cert. required). Not what I was expecting, but it worked out well. The basic breakdowns for those are: 

* Japan: expensive living, better pay
* Korea: moderate living, moderate pay
* China: cheap, cheap

As for Asia (which is the only one I should really comment on since its all I have first hand knowledge off, besides check out **DAVE'S ESL CAFE** -- great resource for everything, esp. Latin America) Asian countries tend to hire people through recruitment agencies. These are exceptionally easy to find on the internet, just type in ""teaching English in (whatever country) recruitment agency"" into google. Usually they are free -- they represent schools and act as a go between between with you. You send them all your info, they get back to you with a couple choices.

Even Iphones etc will pick up a v6 address when connected to wireless with v6 suport and work fine.  Also seen demos of a Slovakian mobile provider who support v6 over 3G etc.

Pretty much all OS/Router vendors support v6 out of the box, as a network admin the problems getting quality connectivity, but its available from most transits/IXs now and you should be getting an allocation and starting to test it unless you want to be left behind.

As an end user, it really shouldn't matter, you'll not notice, its transparent.  I see it becoming a problem a few years down the line, when some new 'killer app' launches, cant get v4 space and is v6 only you'll need v6 support from your ISP to access it.

The problem for end users is the CPE (cable modems/routers) support and lack of ISPs providing access, but that will change as it becomes more widely needed.  

See http://labs.ripe.net for a list of supported CPEs and more articles on v6 adoption in Europe.

K8s are similar to Delphins, except for they're a bit topheavier and have a poly dowel.  I would also recommend staying away from them when learning 5.

PX3s are garbage.  They're basically knockoffs of Henrys clubs (with the ""Pirouette"" = ""Henry's Pirouette"", the ""Quantum"" = ""Henry's Delphin""...)

I bought a set of PX3s when I first started working on 5 and sold them in short order.  Ew.

Henrys Pirouettes are pretty great (however kind of pricey!) - a nicer weight than a Delphin, and are comparable to Renegade 85s.  Henrys clubs are made to an objective standard weight, too, rather than Renegade's subjective one.  That is to say that if you compare two sets of Renegades that are bought separately, they will likely differ in weight.  Henrys dowels go through an insane mechanized sorting process that insures that clubs of each design will have weights within .1g of each other (think that's the number.  At any rate - it's a German company, haha.)

That said, though, I'd suggest you go with Renegade 95s for a variety of reasons.  Renegade has a lifetime repair policy (Henrys does, too, but will only repair clubs at festivals they attend...  And they only go to European fests.)  The 95 is a relatively standard club for passing in the US - if you already have 4, then you'll have a full passing set!  95s are also a relatively wide-bodied club.  If you learn to juggle 5 with them, you'll come out with a much cleaner pattern than you might with a different club.

Some in the world are already worried about so much power concentrated in one place.
A Bloomberg Report this week stated that silver exports from China, one of the world's largest, may drop about 40 percent this year as domestic demand from industry and investors climbs. China is the third-largest producer after Peru and Mexico. It is expected that reduced exports will boost prices. Industrial applications for silver, including electrical conductors and batteries, represent about half global demand. Silver has rallied 44 percent this year, outperforming gold and copper.
Eldora Gold Resources Canada News - In addition, China, which has been blocking shipments of crucial minerals to Japan for the last month, has also halted some shipments to the United States and Europe. These rare earth minerals are crucial to manufacturing many advanced products such as radar, cell phones, high-powered magnets and mini-hard drives in laptop computers. Chinas control of them and its willingness to flex its economic muscles seem certain to further intensify trade and currency tensions. The bad news is China mines 95 percent of the worlds rare earth elements. If restriction on exports of these minerals continues, it could force multinational companies to produce more of their high-technology goods in China.
Speaking of mining, let's take a look at the long-term XAU chart. The XAU (gold and silver stocks index) Index failed to break into new highs - as visible on the very-long-term chart above. Although we see it presently at a declining support level, we don't expect this level to hold given declining gold, silver and stock prices.
Eldora Gold Resources Canada News - Support levels such as the lower border of the trading channel, previous local tops, and multi-year support levels are also in play. The declining, short-term trend line has been broken recently most likely due to the USD Index rally. The area around the 170 level appears to be the probable bottom for the current decline.
In a recent Market Alert sent to our Subscribers, we discussed the possibility for Traders to bet on lower prices using options. Lower prices in mining stocks may be the way to go due to their lower volatility. Their close trading range has caused a decline in option premiums.
Eldora Gold Resources Canada News - In the research section of Sunshine Profits website, Predicting and Taking Advantage of Corrections in Gold is an essay, which is perfect for our current situation. Options traders should be sure not to miss this instructive piece.
Summing up, it is likely that mining stocks will eventually rally but we will probably first see a corrective period. Lower prices are likely to be seen in the short-run with a rally to follow perhaps before the end of the year.

Yemen was the most obvious. I highly doubt that any media report pre-wikileaks failed to mention US involvement. Besides, Yemen has come under significantly more scrutiny in war-on-terror reporting. Everybody knew this, and now we have definitive proof.

China becomes a superpower despite numerous bubble bursts and shaky moments.  

End to the Isreal/Palestine conflict.  Many Arab nations unify into an EU-like entity.  

EU sucks in the rest of mainland Europe, including Switzerland, and parts of northern Africa.  The Euro is the most powerful currency on the planet and replaces the dollar as world reserve currency.  

Reunification of Korea.  Korea continues to become a massive Asian economic power.  

Half of all service sector jobs replaced by robots an/or other automated systems.  

More wealth in the world than is conceivable today.  Five times the amount of billionaires as we have today.  Overall standard of living worldwide is drastically higher.

Most of the world's remaining nuclear weapons have been disassembled and have found use in power generation.  Fusion power supplies electricity to over half the planet's power grids.  

Fewer boom/bust cycles.  Economic stabilization programs have ended major volatility in world markets while simultaneously creating more opportunities for wealth creation.  

English spoken by the majority of humans.

Discoveries of new resources and advances in technology have slowly done away with fossil fuels.  Almost nothing is powered by petroleum byproducts.  Global Warming fears are shown to have been overblown.  Coral reefs worldwide, as well as rainforests have almost fully regenerated due to technological advancements and diminishing disruptive human activity.  

Internet is incredibly fast, stable and widespread by today's standards.  90% of the world connected in some way.   Computers continue to evolve, will become almost unrecognizable to people of today.  

America maintains superpower status through the decade, although has become more of an economic superpower as opposed to a military one.  The nation experiences a renaissance of industry and embraces immigration as it once did as national borders become less and less relevant.  More personal freedom and much less crime than ever.  

Armed conflict almost completely non-existent; has all but faded due to geopolitical restructuring, technological advancement and wealth creation. 

Africa becoming developed on a widespread scale.  Half of all of Africa has an equivalent GDP to Brazil by 2020.  

AIDS, Cancer and most other major communicable and heredity diseases have been eradicated and are curable.  

New York to Tokyo in under two hours.  High-altitude hypersonic aircraft now comprise over 98 percent of aircraft in service.  

Average lifespan in the developed world (now comprising over 85 percent of all countries) reaches 120.  

The majority of cars on the road are fully electric.  

Gene screening and prenatal gene therapy cheap and widespread for all expecting mothers in most countries.

Almost all land mines worldwide have been removed and destroyed.

&gt;Are they going to take the panels off their roofs?

That's an odd question... did you read the article?  Basically, a drop in subsidies will cause a drop in growth; there will be fewer new installations than there otherwise would have been.  It's basic economics: less money = less stuff.

&gt;Despite the errors and flaws in his book. That's an irrational position to take

It's rational to confront factual evidence on a case-by-case basis, as I have.  Discovery of errors in his work merely requires skepticism of other information he presents, not a discarding of his work entirely.

&gt;You do appear very defensive

I don't believe I have exactly defended him.  I have even agreed with you that there are some factual errors in his work.  I agree that some of his language is specious, though you view it more negatively than I do.

&gt;Which is not reality of the cost of nuclear.

Information derived from the International Energy Agency is reflective of real-world cost in developed countries, not just of nuclear, but of other forms of power as well.  Their data is used by energy companies worldwide, including renewables companies.

&gt;Comparing energy sources that have been massively subsidised and deployed for half a century / two centuries.

Even if you're just discussing renewables, you absolutely need to understand the importance of dollars spent per MWh.  To be clear, this is relevant when we're comparing between wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro, even if we take nuclear out of the discussion.  I'm not making this point out of intrinsic favor for one power source or another, I'm just pointing out an economic question that needs to be answered when considering plant development:

How much energy will we get per dollar over the life expectancy of a given power facility?

It's a spectacularly relevant question when choosing which specific technology to develop for a given location, and has incredible relevance to how quickly coal, oil, and gas can be replaced.  Replacing fossil fuels is my chief goal.

Even if you don't like nuclear owing to fear over its externalities or the potential for cost overruns, this is a concept you *must* understand if you are going to be able to adequately compare different sources of renewable energy.

&gt;you refuse to absorb evidence and arguments that do not fit your preconceived beliefs and wishes. 

I'm not operating with preconceived beliefs or wishes.  Frankly, I don't care what we use, so long as we can make it quickly and get rid of coal and oil.  I've made an assessment based on the evidence I've found.  I have absorbed the evidence you presented and added it to my own and found it to indicate the following:

* The most important thing is to stop using coal immediately.  It releases radiation into the atmosphere and results in massive release of greenhouse gasses.

* Generally, the most cost effective way to reduce CO2 emissions is to improve efficiency, particularly heating efficiency and transport efficiency. (This is actually the most salient point I derive from MacKay, has nothing to do with power generation, and seems to fit into your worldview)

* Drops in subsidies for renewables, despite lowering short-term growth rates, have the potential to stimulate development of cheaper technology.

* The cheapest form of renewable energy at the moment is wind power

* The next decade of research and product commercialization will confirm or deny the viability of widespread solar development.
 
* Nuclear power costs vary widely across the world.  Should new nuclear projects be undertaken in the US or Europe, I hope that better cost analysis is performed and that techniques are shared with countries like South Korea.  

* If cost analysis for a particular nuclear plant is unfavorable, I would not want it constructed.  I will not deny the technology out-of-hand, however I will approach it skeptically on a case-by-case basis.

Now I don't want you talk about me having some sort of 'nuclear fantasy' just because I don't have the same reactionary stance that you do against nuclear power.  I'm not beating the drums to build new nuclear power plants.  I'm not donating money to nuclear PACs.  I'm not envisioning some kind of 50's nuclear-car dreamland.  I'm not here to pick a side.  I am highly cognizant of the heated nature of the nuclear debate, including the history of public opinion regarding nuclear power.

You can tell me that I misunderstood some of the data, or that I don't understand the politics, but I have simply assessed the information I've found differently and remain skeptical, one way or the other, regarding modern fission technology.

The fact remains, you're not the only person with a strong opinion about nuclear power, and there are people who disagree with you who are able to cite numerous valid technical sources.  I have to listen to both you and them.

To reiterate, the only thing I really care about when it comes to fission is that we invest in thorium research, with the understanding that some technicians and scientists speculate that the thorium fuel cycle will prove to be uneconomical, and not to get my hopes up too high.",True,False,,elustran,0,0

Imperialism, with its dark plans of conquest and its robber alliances and deals, developed the system of secret diplomacy to the highest level.

For anyone who does not feel like clicking:

Bullet points: 

""¶ A dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel: Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, “if the local media got word of the fuel removal, ‘they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan’s nuclear weapons,’ he argued.”

¶ Thinking about an eventual collapse of North Korea: American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the North’s economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode. The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would “help salve” China’s “concerns about living with a reunified Korea” that is in a “benign alliance” with the United States.

¶ Bargaining to empty the Guantánamo Bay prison: When American diplomats pressed other countries to resettle detainees, they became reluctant players in a State Department version of “Let’s Make a Deal.” Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in Chinese Muslim detainees, cables from diplomats recounted. The Americans, meanwhile, suggested that accepting more prisoners would be “a low-cost way for Belgium to attain prominence in Europe.”

¶ Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When Afghanistan’s vice president visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money “a significant amount” that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, “was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money’s origin or destination.” (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.)

¶ A global computer hacking effort: China’s Politburo directed the intrusion into Google’s computer systems in that country, a Chinese contact told the American Embassy in Beijing in January, one cable reported. The Google hacking was part of a coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government. They have broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002, cables said.

¶ Mixed records against terrorism: Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the “worst in the region” in counterterrorism efforts, according to a State Department cable last December. Qatar’s security service was “hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals,” the cable said.

¶ An intriguing alliance: American diplomats in Rome reported in 2009 on what their Italian contacts described as an extraordinarily close relationship between Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and business magnate, including “lavish gifts,” lucrative energy contracts and a “shadowy” Russian-speaking Italian go-between. They wrote that Mr. Berlusconi “appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin” in Europe. The diplomats also noted that while Mr. Putin enjoyed supremacy over all other public figures in Russia, he was undermined by an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignored his edicts. 

¶ Arms deliveries to militants: Cables describe the United States’ failing struggle to prevent Syria from supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has amassed a huge stockpile since its 2006 war with Israel. One week after President Bashar al-Assad promised a top State Department official that he would not send “new” arms to Hezbollah, the United States complained that it had information that Syria was providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the group.

¶ Clashes with Europe over human rights: American officials sharply warned Germany in 2007 not to enforce arrest warrants for Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in a bungled operation in which an innocent German citizen with the same name as a suspected militant was mistakenly kidnapped and held for months in Afghanistan. A senior American diplomat told a German official “that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.” 

Other: 

...it has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of Al Qaeda. But a cable’s fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, is breathtaking. 

...press reports detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session last year. 

Explicit comments:  (frank opinions) 

Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the aging monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan.

Speaking to another Iraqi official about Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, King Abdullah said, “You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not.” The king called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan the greatest obstacle to that country’s progress. “When the head is rotten,” he said, “it affects the whole body.”

The American ambassador to Eritrea reported last year that “Eritrean officials are ignorant or lying” in denying that they were supporting the Shabab, a militant Islamist group in Somalia. The cable then mused about which seemed more likely.

As he left Zimbabwe in 2007 after three years as ambassador, Christopher W. Dell wrote a sardonic account of Robert Mugabe, that country’s aging and erratic leader. The cable called him “a brilliant tactician” but mocked “his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics).”

My understanding is that before you can claim your Polish citizenship (assuming your father did not acquire other citizenship before 1951), your mother would need to claim her citizenship and then you can claim yours. You're probably looking at a total cost of the best part of a thousand dollars per claim (application fee is US$450-odd and you will need to get lots of documents certified by the Polish consulate at $30 a pop). That price is assuming you have a sworn translator who'll work for free and don't hire a lawyer.

Deflation would be the absolute best thing for the American economy. TARP and the bailouts all = inflation, and a progressive weakening of the dollar. This hits the poor the hardest and the rich the least; it's an unseen tax, because now the poor's money goes that much less farther.

First, they recognized that they *weren't* the elites, second they recognized that the elites were treating them badly, and third they recognized that the elites weren't going to treat them any better just because they played nice.

In America, your typical white middle class voter recognized none of these things when they happen. First, he's so terrified of blacks/immigrants/muslims/whoever taking away what he has, he doesn't notice that he has practically nothing. In being preoccupied with losing what little he possesses, he is essentially taking the mindset of the rich, the mindset of ""maintain the status quo no matter what, because I have a vested interest."" No, average middle class white voter, you don't. You have a variable interest rate 50 year mortgage and a 60 hour/week job you hate. You've got little more to lose from revolution than the Mexicans you're so terrified of. But it's long ago been established that middle class whites will vote against their own interests if you convince them they've got a lot to lose, and scare them about all the nasty people who want to take it from them. Second, this typical voter doesn't notice how poorly he's being treated. 90% of the economic growth in the last thirty years has been concentrated in the top 10% of earners. We lose more and more of our slice of the pie while we work longer hours, lose our unions and our benefits, and if you point out how ludicrous our system is compared to the Europeans, most Americans will just scratch their head in bafflement, as if it was nonsensical to compare other states with America as if they were real countries. Finally, the myth persists that if we just trust the rich, they will reward us, that if we give them our money they will return it to us with dividends. The average voter has been told, and still believes, that his employer creates wealth, and all he does from 9 to 5 is push it around for him. We've been waiting 30 years for that trickle down effect to happen, and so far the opposite trend has persisted.

Go back to the 1780s. Successfully convince a typical Sans Culottes that 1) he could be an aristocrat if only he'd wash behind his ears, and look what a nice shack you have now, don't throw it all away, 2) the king's court has only his best interest in mind, and 3) that if he'll only go back to work and stop all this foolishness, the government will surely make the bread prices go down.

  * Porn (unless 90% of auditions specify Japanese actors *must* have small penises, African Americans must have very large, and white must have in-between.).  It seems to be true in amateur produced porn as well. 

  * I...actually have a friend who worked for a year as a legal prostitute in Nevada after graduating university (no moral qualms, high pay, was interesting at first).  She confirms the stereotype in her experience

  * Asian female friend who confirmed it in her experience for E. Asian vs. US white.  

  * I always hear from travelers to E. Asia that it's advisable to bring one's own condoms rather than use the local ones.  This often coming from people who travel often and seem to *love to break* stereotypes. 

  * No-one wants to do a study highlighting average racial differences.  What differences there are, are usually not talked about.  I didn't know until living in E.

I wrote a comment about this before of how flabbergasted I was when I found out the American competition model(No relegation, play off are the only thing that matter anyway, *teams can be moved to different cities!*:s) I guess it depends on what you grow up with.

&gt; No. It's not enough. Those who claim that should bring up some evidence.

You skipped the line that mattered the most. What I meant was that papers like those I mentioned regarding shouting are the same kind of evidence you have for corporal punishment. Both auditory and physical feedback can obviously be abused. But you have as much evidence or reason to think that all negative physical feedback is or is not harmful as you have for negative auditory feedback.

That said while I understand your point and you have no reason to trust me, but regardless of papers, this is not just my opinion. This is common knowledge for most Europeans, and very evident in our society. Just like some things are very evident in yours.  

&gt; isn't that ""a world of evidence [supporting capital punishment] in front of your eyes""

Again you missed the point. You have as much evidence or reason to believe that say, light negative physical feedback being harmful to you psychologically as you have for eating rice having that same effect. Do you want papers on that? People eat rice... they're fine, there isn't any reason to suspect they'd be psychologically harmed. What we can observe in all the people that are administered capital punishment is that they die.

Santiago rush hours always have major congestions

That means, you will have to get up 7:00, get ready and leave the house at least at 7:45.

After work, count on another hour lost in transit.

So, you'll get home around 20:00.

You will be enslaved from 07:00 am to 08:00 pm.

There is little or no culture in Santiago.

People work all day so there is really no energy left for anything cultural.

Maybe getting drunk after work in a local pub but that's it.

8 hour work day is non-existant in Chile.

You should ask yourself, ""Do I want to be enslaved? Am I that good that I can work half a day and still manage fine with the money I get?""

MySQL DBA is not very popular here. You might get to work for... I don't know... 650 mil pesos (1200 usd)...

Remember the work day in Chile is 9-10 hours, add two more hours for commuting and you get the picture :)

The crime is much worse than in Europe. You will need a car to get anywhere in a timely and safe manner.

A scooter might be a solution for the commute problem.

We have 9 months of sun and 3 months of cloudy weather, and... that's it.

There are NO CLOUDS over Santiago... It gets depresive with no clouds...

Contamination in Santiago is an atrocity. Almost never you can see the mountains that surround the city. It's all covered with red smog.

You have to pay for everything in Chile. There are just a few public spaces that you can enjoy without having to pay for them.

XIX century capitalist model society is what Chile is today.

Chileans are big hearted people. They deserve much better society than the one they have now.

We also have, as others have pointed out, the issue of whether it's too easy to get social care benefits (that is, economical support to the unemployed - due to injury or otherwise.)

* In Medicine, we have some (imo) serious issues with centralizing health care, as a result of budget cuts. Some hospitals are getting closed down and their employees and doctors either being moved to these centralized hospitals, or loosing their job altogether. This results in longer ambulance travel times, fewer jobs, more hospital beds in the corridors (aka more beds than rooms. Way more.) and longer queues to get operations done.

* Also, as a side note, we give a Juletre (Christmas Tree) to London each year as a ""Hey, thanks Allied Forces"" for helping Norway in WWII.

* I don't even care about Norwegian politics anymore, as the politicians promise let's say 5 major changes and fulfill about one of them. But even so, the politics are pretty good at what they do (also my opinion), and I'm pretty happy about how things are up in them thar politics.

* One major problem this winter will be the prices of Electric Power, as we are mainly a hydroelectric nation, and our water reservoirs have been pretty empty due to a relatively dry autumn, and now a very cold winter, the reservoirs are slowly freezing over. Also the fact that we export almost all of our electricity and buy from other places, among them Swedish Nuclear power. However the Swedish Nuclear plants are undergoing some checks and maintenance (they're old, inb4 Chernobyl :D), and we might not be able to import as much power from there as a result of this.

* EU directive on Data storage is an issue here

Finally, thank you.

&gt;Again you missed the point. You have as much evidence or reason to believe that say, light negative physical feedback being harmful to you psychologically as you have for eating rice having that same effect. Do you want papers on that?

You comparison is not very good. The problem is rice eating has never been harmful psychologically, while physical punishment has. Adding the word ""proper"" before ""physical punishment"" won't make it a good thing until someone comes with a definition (and a method) for proper physical punishment that is proven not to disturb kids mentally. Some people might even believe the word ""proper"" means ""lighter"" : 

""Well, instead of punishing little Timmy with cold showers, I will beat him with a belt : that's what I call proper punishment""

or

""Well, instead of punishment little Timmy with cold shower every day, I punish him with cold showers, only once in a while""

(Of course I am exagerating, because the word ""proper"" is so vague and must defined in every context.)

&gt;What we can observe in all the people that are administered capital punishment is that they die.

I was also using that example to demonstrate that saying ""it's obvious"" is not an argument. 

&gt;And what you can observe in these societies where pretty much all kids get their butt smacked, is that they're fine.

Evidence? You claim that, in these societies, the (yet-to-prove) fact that pretty much all kids get their butt smacked leads to kids being fine (evidence needed) AND is directly linked (evidence needed for the link) to strong family ties (evidence given).

If every team is on the same level, every game wil in theory be approached at the same level, parring rivalries or derbys, but i know for a fact you don't have many of those in MLS either. 

When Herculés beat Barca 2-0 in the opening game of the season, it sent shock waves through the world. Why? Because Barca is huge, arguably in the top 3 best clubs in the world right now, and Herculés just got promoted (a foreign concept to MLS) to La Liga this summer. If this was just a 2-0 game between Real Sociedad and Sporting Gijón, you think people would care? Of course not!. And this is where your MLS model fails, it takes a part of the passion to the game away. And let's be honest, passion is what you're missing in the states. If people were as passionate about soccer as they are about baseball (ಠ_ಠ) , MLS would be a powerhouse too. But they're not, and unless you get 1-2 clubs that truly dominate, have great players that could start in any team in Europe, great facilities, etc, people won't take MLS seriously. And you won't get that with the current model.

&gt; I'd rather take the La Liga two horse race, where the two horses include the best goalkeeper, the best defenders, the best midfielders, best attacking players in the world and is mainly composed of players from the World Champions, than a balanced MLS where playoffs decide who wins and players from Europe only see as attractive when they are at the end of their career and know they will profit in America and be an undisputed starter, where as most clubs in Europe would have them on the bench.

Maybe *you* would.  This is, though, in no sense objectively the case.  I loved watching el Clasico, but what made it so thrilling to watch - the teams as you described them - is also in some ways a serious problem.  I mean, you're not seriously suggesting, I hope, that it is in some sense actually *good* that two teams in La Liga have, between them, 10 members of the World Cup winning team, and almost all of the regular starters.  Take a look at the current Spain international squad.  Atletico Bilbao has a few, Villareal has a few, and the Premier League sides have a few.  No one else in the *world* has *any*.  Not a *single player*.  Do you honestly think it is preferable, that it is something to be striven for, something born of Europe's long football experience, that two clubs should so completely monopolize the talent of the country in which they play - and that a handful of clubs should so completely monopolize the talent of the entire world?

MLS is decades behind the European leagues in skill and experience, perhaps (although not *all* of the European leagues, not definitely).  But it's not skill and experience that has created the enormous imbalance in the European Leagues.  It's simply laughable to suggest that Europe, in its superior wisdom and with its decades of practice, *decided* to create leagues in which only a half-dozen clubs would ever be treated as serious contenders; leagues in which those clubs have so *much* more money and prestige than the rest of the sides in their respective leagues that deep systemic changes will need to be made if any of the lesser sides are *ever* again to become contenders.  Quite the opposite, in fact - as I've sad, the problems with European Leagues raised in this article are problems *fans* of those leagues raise regularly, problems people regularly suggest are in dire need of repair before it's too late.  To suggest that Real and Barcelona are better than 90% of the world's sides by an order of magnitude because European football *wanted* it that way is to indulge in a simple fiction.

This isn't about who has the better players - Europe, although buying the best players from literally everywhere else on Earth helps.  This isn't about who plays the most attractive football - Europe again, although the same caveat applies.  This is about who has the more balanced league, and whether having a balanced league is a good thing.  That's the ONLY aspect of MLS football that was being defended in this article, and the ONLY aspect of MLS football that it's relevant to attack.  Argue that a hugely imbalanced league like La Liga is a good thing if you want to, but don't pretend its one-sidedness was premeditated out of superior European experience.",True,False,5,ravniel,0,0

A Red Notice is *not* an arrest warrant, it's issued in cases where an arrest warrant or court order has been issued in another country (in this case Sweden) for 'provisional arrest' for questioning and investigation purposes, this is done in order to facilitate possible extradition. In some countries this is considered a valid warrant for 'provisional arrest'. 

Basically, England (where Assange is currently rumored to be hiding) has the right to decide whether they want to extradite him or not. 

Long Story Short - 

1. Red Notice is no big deal, the Interpol 5,020 of them in 2009. 

2. England is not obliged to arrest and extradite him, but maybe forced to if they arrest him under international obligations (like for example European Convention on Extradition).

3. This is only for provisional arrest. But I think it's safe to say if he goes in he won't be out for a while.

Only a few, though, and as successful as their academies often are, they're just as successful at buying the best players the world has to offer at prices no club from their home country can ever hope to match.  Unless, of course, we're suggesting that Ronaldo (Ronaldo, not C. Ronaldo) and Didier Drogba are the product of brilliant European academies.  The Premier League, La Liga, Serie A - all packed with foreign players, many from Africa and South America, drawn to their respective leagues by nothing more than money and prestige.  So let's not pretend that ""developing own talents"" is the *primary* strategy of clubs besides, say, Barca and Arsenal.

The rest of your argument, I think, is absolutely ridiculous.  You're actually saying that MLS *needs* to have one or two teams that completely run the show, or the rest of the world won't take us seriously?  That sounds like a problem with the rest of the world.  ""Oh, well, MLS has some good stuff going on, but I don't know.  More than 2 of their teams have a fighting chance at winning the Championship, and that's just a big turnoff for me.""

Furthermore, the notion that our smaller teams need bigger teams to motivate them to play well is...well, kind of comical, honestly.  You know we play lots of sports in the US besides football, right?  And at many of them our leagues *are* the best in the world, and in *none* of them do one or two teams win every single year.  Not a one.  Funnily enough, not having a juggernaut to unseat in an upset victory doesn't stop ""smaller"" teams (not that this is a real concept in other American sports - we have some richer and some poorer teams, but never by an order of magnitude) from playing their best, nor does it stop people from being passionate about the game - strange as it seems, people manage to get fairly passionate about *actually having a chance to win on their own merits*, even though they don't have the inestimable pleasure of slightly annoying one of the inevitable championship teams.

Lack of US interest in football has nothing to do with our league being too balanced.  To even suggest that is to take your argument to an absurd conclusion.

My problem with TARP is basically that it attempted to do what other countries have done with ""bad banks"" -- except without really fixing the underlying problems and separating long-term injurious elements from the market so they can be dealt with.  The way I view it,

- shitty decisions caused institutions to fail or nearly fail
- markets react as markets should, making credit more expensive for institutional fuckups
- those who nearly failed screamed for help, holding the rest of the economy hostage to their continued existence
- massive conflicts of interests (e.g. Bernanke, Paulson) obfuscate the decision-making process
- institutions are given huge loans on advantageous terms, interest rate is artificially sent to near zero
- a whole bunch of money is spent elsewhere on ""stuff"".  A bunch of this goes to financial institutions also benefiting from TARP
- institutions can claim, ohai, we have moniez, credit markets go, oh sure, credit becomes cheaper again
- institutions repay TARP, continue not lending, hooray, success!  \o/  Bonuses and cigars all around!
- Nothing is really fixed, economy keeps going to hell.

Yeah, of course it's an oversimplification, but I can't help but wonder whether the US would not have benefited more in the long run from a short, very sharp bit of pain rather than from the drawn-out agony it's currently going through.  But, like in Europe (I live in France, don't get me started on bad economic policy), that is politically suicidal.

Regarding AIG, it was not TARP -- it was a separate line of support, which was my point.  They basically funneled money to AIG, AIG paid its counterparties, which also received TARP money, counterparties repaid TARP money (leaving the government holding the separate AIG bag) and everyone shouted, yay, TARP worked!

Who said anyway, that there need to be previous climate related wars? How many times did the climate drastically shift in the last 2000 years to merit that? There's always a first time, you know. But nice straw man. (Btw: the Little Ice Age did have an indirect effect on the French revolution, which lead to the Napoleonic wars, also indirectly.)
Causalities: for now. Again. Straw man, as climate change hasn't happened yet. As if you were arguing that the (theoretical) 10km diameter meteor approaching earth is not an issue, as it hasn't killed anyone yet.
Breakdown of civilization: gigantic, very densely occupied areas becoming inhabitable (Pakistan, Bangladesh, East Coast, West Coast, Western Europe, etc) would trigger mass exoduses, wars, and whatnot.

Europe may be less bat-shit insane on first impression but under the surface people are just as prone to believe stupid shit as everywhere. For example a poll in Greece found that 90% of the people believe that 9/11 was either an inside job or a Mossad operation or a combination of both. The myth of the US being an invincible tech empire is largely taken as fact in Italy too. Italians also have a long tradition believing in conspiracies (some times rightly so, what with the P2 trials, the Vatican arm deals and Mafia connections) and they are convinced that Bin Laden is either an American agent or already captured and used as a strawman in order to have an excuse to make wars for oil. 

It is the same really but less Sci-Fi than the American conspiracies which are funnier with all the Illuminati, the NWO and the aliens.

IMO the main difference with the US is that usually people are ashamed to expose said beliefs to others who disagree with them. This attitude is evident in the media too that take great care to protect their image and serve their scaremongering in a moderate wrapping.

Why is that? Could it be because clean - no need for scare quotes - energy has only just seriously started to be deployed in the last few years? Despite that, the rise has been meteoric in places: 

* Renewables accounted for 60% of new power capacity in Europe in 2009; China added 37 GW of renewable power capacity, more than any other country in the world; Globally, nearly 80 GW of renewable capacity was added, including 31 GW of hydro and 48 GW of non-hydro capacity; Solar PV additions reached a record high of 7 GW; 83+ countries have policies to promote renewable power. ""China’s wind power capacity surpassed the country’s installed nuclear capacity in 2009, with just over 13.8 GW added to reach a total of 25.8 GW."" http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/g2010.asp

&gt; clean energy get huge amount of subsidy per unit of energy.

Apples and oranges. Rnewables are competing against fossil fuels that have been invested in for centuries and that do not pay for their massive externalities. And - small detail - fossil are running out.

Nuclear has been massively subsidised for over half a century - much of the subsidy hidden because of its military connection.

The costs for new technologies are obviously high up front. That's where renewales are now.

&gt; This ""fact"" is used to argue that renewable need more subsidy or that, renewable would be competitive if fossil didn't receive subsidy. Neither of such spins are true.

Again, scare quotes not necessary - facts are facts.

- US Energy Subsidy Scorecard: oil + gas took 60% of $725 billion in federal assistance between 1950 and 2003. Coal 13%. Hydroelectric 11%. Nuclear 9% - not counting liability cap subsidy which is impossible to quantify. Wind, solar, geothermal, and bio-fuels together got only 6%. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/11/the-federal-energy-subsidy-scorecard-how-renewables-stack-up + http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/blogs/republican/energy-subsidies-0312

My best advice is to get your hands on a couple of different brands and see which feels best in your hand. Global are sharp and light (sand-filled hollow handles to balance the weight perfectly) but they don't feature a protruding [bolster](http://www.chefschoice.com/images/basicknife.gif) to grip. As well, because they're so light, you really need to put some muscle into heartier cutting jobs. That being said, because the knife is sharpened to a 15 degree angle, it feels sharper and glides through food more easily. THAT being said, a 15 degree blade is more fragile, so if you do a lot of deboning or you're not careful with your knives, a more robust 20 degree angle (found on traditional European shaped blades, i.e. [Wusthof](http://www.wusthof.com/desktopdefault.aspx)) might be a better fit. My super biased opinion is neither Global nor Wusthof offered what I was looking for and after two years of working at my store, I finally flexed some brand loyalty and went with [Shun](http://www.kershawknives.com/searchresults.php?search_by=category&amp;search_value=22&amp;brand=shun). I found the knives solid, comfortable to grip, not too heavy, not too light, and really attractive. Also, Shun offers free lifetime sharpening for all of their knives. They also feature a D-handle which is formed to fit comfortably into your fingers (this feature makes the knives left- or right-handed, but a left-handed knife in a right handed grip is not uncomfortable, and visa versa). 

The profile of your knife will also play a large part in how you interact with it. The knife you're looking at has a European chef curve, which will allow you to rock-chop (your hand and forearm create a wave as your wrist bends). Flatter profiles kind of make you chop from the elbow, keeping your hand and forearm together as one unit. Getting a granton edge (quick-release pockets) on your knife is not essential, but if you do, make sure they're on the correct side of the knife (both sides would make the knife universal, only on the right side makes it a right handed knife, visa versa for left). The length of the blade is tricky and depends on which jobs you do most frequently and how large your hands are. I'm a little person and prefer a 6"" blade, but 8"" is widely considered the best. If you go to 10"", you'll really want to test it out first to make sure it doesn't feel awkwardly large. 

No matter what you choose, the best advice I can give you is to take care of your knives! Store them somewhere safe (a block, sheath, magnetic rail ... although metal on metal can damage the blade so I encourage bamboo covered magnets), hand wash them when you're done using them, and *hone them every time you wash them.* It sounds like a pain in the ass, but if you properly hone your knife a few times a week, it will stay factory sharp for years. Like, ten years.  Watch an [instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd7r-3RGpJA) for proper technique. If you hear a loud *ping* when honing at the tip of the blade, you're using too much pressure. You can keep a razor edge on even the crappiest of knives if you hone them frequently. 

TLDR: Global, Wusthof, Shun, and many other brands are all great, but the right knife for you has to feel right in your hand. Care for your knives by honing them everyday. ",True,False,,no_thumbs,0,0

Soften them on your countertop for a few hours, then whip when in your stand mixed.  Start at low speeds working up to a medium-high.  

At this point you can add liquid to the mixture if you want, you don't need to but I'd suggest you do. I'd stay away from water, as it doesn't bring any flavor to the party.  I like olive oil; I think it makes it rich and delicious. You really need to eye-ball it, because the moisture content of butter will vary from brand to brand.

After 2 minutes of whipping, stop the mixture and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and restart the whipping for another minute or two until it’s where you want it. You’ll notice a change in texture and a change it color making it lighter. Store your newly whipped butter in an airtight container.

 I’d suggest storing it in the refrigerator, but others may disagree. Often American butter is high in moisture content, making it more prone to spoilage than European butter. Butter by itself is made up of a lot of saturated fats, which are better protected against the unsaturated fats in olive oil.  It will keep for a few days at room temp, but more than that I’d pop it in your chill box.

It came about because of cheap paper and the printing press bringing bibles to the masses.  It used to be that a bible cost millions of dollars because they were copped by hand by the most educated people in society.   They were controlled closely by the clergy and kings.   When the printing press caused bibles to become mass circulated, people started to learn how to read and the found out that the Catholic church had become insanely corrupt and was doing the exact opposite of what the bible said in many cases.   At the time the Catholic church was not only a religions power, but a political military power, and like most such institutions became extremely corrupt.  For over 1000 years the Catholic church was able to control the masses by controlling the dissipation of religions philosophy and information, when the protestant reformation broke that control, it led to revolts and violent oppression all over Europe (and unfortunately over many native Americans in the new world)  

Today the government controls information in two primary ways.  They control it by controlling the mainstream media (mostly through FCC regulation and copyrights), and they control information by controlling the money, because in a normal market the money has real value and that conveys information about relative transaction costs and information about value over time, so by controlling the money they are really controlling information about value over time.   

As society births into the information age, the market is finding ways around both of these, and the days of government manipulated media and government manipulated money are over.

&gt;Wars: read what the Pentagon has to say about it. I believe the soldier boys. If they think a catastrophic climate change would trigger wars, then I believe them.

I've read it, if you are referring to the JOE paper.  One has to read the paper very narrowly to miss what they state will be the most likely trigger of war: energy.  As I said before, climate change is way down on the list, but you are correct that they do list it.

&gt;Who said anyway, that there need to be previous climate related wars? How many times did the climate drastically shift in the last 2000 years to merit that? There's always a first time, you know. But nice straw man. 

You misunderstand my point.  I am saying that there has been a continuous state of war *without* climate change being a cause.  To claim that wars will suddenly be about climate related problems ignores the character of our species.

&gt;(Btw: the Little Ice Age did have an indirect effect on the French revolution, which lead to the Napoleonic wars, also indirectly.) 

Interesting side note.  I've read about the disastrous march to Moscow, but hadn't really considered the climate as a *cause* for the Napoleonic wars.

&gt;Causalities: for now. Again. Straw man, as climate change hasn't happened yet. 

Not quite.  We know very well that cold kills a lot more people than heat.  The papers that have been written on the topic indicate that *net deaths* will actually decrease as the globe warms.

&gt;Breakdown of civilization: gigantic, very densely occupied areas becoming inhabitable (Pakistan, Bangladesh, East Coast, West Coast, Western Europe, etc) would trigger mass exoduses, wars, and whatnot. The whole commerce would collapse, along with the world economy. 

I take it you are referring to flooding due to sea level rise?  The current rate of rise is one foot per century, though some measurements in Australia are much lower than that.  The majority of housing that people will live in 90 years from now hasn't even been built yet.

France and the Europe in general are the birth place of the western accommodationalist view of religion(where religion and science coexist in the sense that religion is pushed into a corner and doesn't cause any trouble) and moves towards atheism, so it's not really surprising that they're less religious than the country colonized by people who ran away when they began changing. I remember reading an article on the Netherlands(or Sweden? let's just say ""Generic atheisty place"") where the opinions of the atheists regarding religion could best be described as quaint, but the religious people interviewed were nervous about mentioning religion around their peers; in a sense it seemed like the social pressure of a more religious country was reversed, so I tend to think that a place where no one cares whether religion is discussed is a place where people can comfortably say whatever they want about it publicly rather than one that is weirdly silent on the topic even though there are millions of people in the culture who consider it valuable in some way.

They can get pretty nasty on the way out.  The issue is that when you control people by controlling information, you can't shoot information with a tank, it's really hard to re assert control physically.  However, that didn't stop the 100 years war nor did it stop violence from breaking out all over Europe, but worst of all was when the Pope made an agreement with the king of Spain that he could be Pope of the new world if he forced the natives to convert to the church.  To this day, Latin America is totally fucked up because of that.   They also attempted to maintain control via heavy handed guilt trips. To this day, Catholics suffer from over guilt, and protestants over take the bible literally to the point of insanity, those events are part of the reason why.

Anyhow, when the government loses control, they will probably try to regroup and assert physical control, but that will be hard because it is way way more costly to maintain physical control than it is to control people by controlling information.   So their size will be way smaller, and that will at least leave the market a lot more room to grow.  After the financial chaises plays out, there will probably be a new era of prosperity.

While I believe that the banking cartel and the copyright cartel are as good as dead, unfortunately the patent cartel involves a physical presence and will likely not die, same with the enviro-cartel, same with the war on drugs.   (except for software and process patents)  IMHO, this is a problem because patents are pretty genocidal, like those massive recalls of damaging drugs, like suing African nations in the world court to not buy generic AIDS drugs, like how they retarded air bag and anti-lock brake development wile millions died in auto accidents.   Like the enviro ban on DDT causing 50 million to die of malaria.  Like the war on drugs incarcerating millions (my prediction is because of the cost, the gov will likely need to back off in the incarceration and massive police, but will likely not back off on the war)

This suggests a new vector of attack for the government.   And that unlike the information age revolt, it will be violent and genocidal.   They will be over environmental, over controlling on substances, and over patent everything.   Just as they extended copyrights to infinity, and brought on massive penalties to maintain control just as they were dying, they will likely go this way with patents too.

After the information age the gov will be looking to reassert control over markets and things like 3d printers and nanotechnology will bring manufacturing into the home, and that will likely be fought every step of the way with patents, environmental regulations, and probably in the name of stopping terrorism (keeping people from making guns, etc ...).

This has not yet happen, as according to him and his lawer (undeniably by the EU authority) his arrest order was given to the interpol without any alert to assange whatsoever, this is suspicious.

Further more, rape i.e non consensual sex is significantly worst then continuing sex with a broken condom. Yes it shows a mans lack of self control, but i can say with fair amount of certainty that some number close to 70% of men would not stop sex regardless of state of condom. That is not to say it makes it right what he (allegedly) did but it is in no way in the same boat as rape.

However the OP said 

&gt;&gt;Secondly, Redditors are quick to claim conspiracy whenever something bad happens to Assange.

Given the evidence conspiracy sounds more then likely.

Interpol would never be involved in a case such as this where even the fact that it is a rape is debatable.

Furthermore a normal civilian would be notified appropriately before being allegated and chased by police if it was not a smear campaign (the fact that he is being chased by the Interpol makes him look like a criminal even though at this stage he should definitely not have police after him.)

What puts even more suspicion on the fact that these allegations are fabricated by the women in question to tarnish his reputation (his word against theirs) is that these allegations always come to light at the exact moment of when a  major release is about to occur. In-fact last time these charges were dropped after the hype of the release went down, and the prosecutor dropped the case. This time when the release was done the charges were opened again this time by a different prosecutor. And this time with a second witness, with the same story.

Is it more likely that the US government (or Swedish government) is framing him or more likely that Assange happens to have condom malfunctions with two women he met at the same time, in the same conference.

Problem - i can't sell them to my own countrymen because american powdered milk is much cheaper. I decide to try and sell abroad, and so i try to sell to the US or Europe. 

In the US (for example) the first thing they do is slap an import tariff on my incoming milk, to deliberately make sure my milk is more expensive than american milk. Why? to make sure that americans won't buy my milk, but will buy american milk, in order to keep american farmers in good business. So i have all these resources, and i'm making a product, but im not selling very much. This applies to other industries in Jamaica as well.

The biggest problem is that if jamaicans can't sell products, they can't make money. If farmers can't sell products, not only can they not make money, but they can't develop thier farms with better technology, better crops, better practices etc. That way, when a drought comes along, farms have no strategies to cope and just fail - the country has no food production capability whatsoever; it has to buy all its food. But with what money? Nobody's making money. 

To your last point, this has been the problem with cash crops. Countries like the Ivory Coast base thier entire economies on one product (coffee), which they can grow but other countries can't.

The reason for the current conflict is that the cost of providing video is primarily on Comcast.  Expanding the data center to deliver the video to the peering point is relatively cheap compared to digging down cable.

So, Akamai solves the problem by placing CDN nodes inside Comcasts network.  They pay for the privilege, but they pay less than if they used L3s model where the servers have to cross a peering point because the impact on Comcasts network is less.

Everyone can be a gun owner. You always hear about kids playing with their parents' guns and accidentally getting shot. This of course could happen in any country, but then only in America it's that easy to get a gun.

The people saved from owning a firearm are zero compared to the people unjustly killed by them. War victims alone are a thousand times that number. 

It may be that firearms don't shoot themselves and that regular tools like knives and hammers can be used as weapons, however it's a weak argument since they cannot cause the psychological and physical damage a gun can cause. First, firearms are ranged weapons. If someone attacks you with a knife or a hammer, it's not unthinkable to evade or disarm the attacker; the same can't be said about guns, targets are defenseless. That's also a weak argument, since melee weapons can be as deadly and very few can counter them; still, I don't think many would attempt to rob a store with a hammer.

Availability of the sites has been spotty since Sunday, when it started to come under a series of Internet-based attacks by unknown hackers. WikiLeaks dealt with the attacks in part by moving to servers run by Amazon Web Services, which is self-service.

War is an act of aggression committed by governments.  This has nothing to do with individual gun ownership for self protection.  

&gt;It may be that firearms don't shoot themselves and that regular tools like knives and hammers can be used as weapons, however it's a weak argument since they cannot cause the psychological and physical damage a gun can cause.

As someone who's been slashed at with a knife, I have to call bullshit again.  If you are ever threatened by someone with a knife, hammer or screwdriver, and you believe the person is fully capable of using said instrument, then you will see how much psychological or physical damage can occur. 

&gt;First, firearms are ranged weapons.

That take skill and training to use properly.  You think someone with no experience with firearms is going to have much success hitting anything more than 20 feet away with a 9mm?  Not likely.  It takes practice to learn how to aim and shoot properly.  

&gt;If someone attacks you with a knife or a hammer, it's not unthinkable to evade or disarm the attacker; the same can't be said about guns, targets are defenseless.

Again, this comes down to skill and training.  You really think an untrained individual will be able to disarm someone with a knife?  Not likely.

&gt;I don't think many would attempt to rob a store with a hammer.

Heck, I've seen video of someone trying to rob a store with a palm tree.

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean that only people that passed a long-ass test to get a patent.

What kind of tests?  Who determines the tests?  Who says who is allowed to own a firearm?  Why should someone be able to tell me whether or not I can own a means of protection for myself, my home and my family?

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean to destroy all the unauthorized firearms around, so that they don't get in the wrong hands, and not to allow anyone but people that are trained and authorized to carry guns to buy them.

Hahaha...wow, what an impossible utopia you paint here.  You really think you could 'destroy all the unauthorized firearms around'?  That is impossible.  Inmates in maximum security prisons (tightest controlled environments around) have gotten their hands on firearms.  

&gt;Proper firearm laws would mean that every single bullet sold is linked to its buyer.

You do know that people can make their own bullets...right?  Plus, with these laws, all you are doing is disarming law abiding citizens.  You think criminals give a shit about gun laws?  Hell, even in countries with the strictest gun laws, the criminals still have guns.

Correlation and causation are two separate things.  I can also compare the US to countries like Canada and Switzerland.  So what?  Its not the access to guns that is the problem.

The reason why universal health care works in Europe is because all essential care is controlled by the government, so next time the pilot for your commuter flight loses vision in one eye he doesn't have to fear a premium hike to get it fixed, and all the ""complementary"" care is up to the insurances to handle (govt. won't cover your boob job, unless you had to have a mastectomy because of breast cancer for example).

I just don't think firearms have any use at all, except causing violence. If a knife-wielding psycho entered my house, he would have taken me by surprise and taking the gun would be the last thing on my mind, even if I had one. I'd be already dead. We obviously have different opinions and we obviously aren't going to change our minds about it. I think that there are better ways to protect yourself - also because I don't think many people go carrying around their guns and the greatest dangers are outside your house or store, not inside. I think it's better to prevent house-breaking than to kill the aggressors, I don't think most small-time criminals have murderous intentions. What a good government should do is prevent those criminals from getting the guns. Every nut can get a gun, remember Cho? No way he would have gotten armed to the teeth in Europe or Japan.

The former organize mainly through highly visible Anarchist Federations like the IWA, NEFAC or IWW. The latter work most prominently in the networks of the global social movement, networks like Peoples Global Action, which unites anarchist collectives in Europe and elsewhere with groups ranging from Maori activists in New Zealand, fisherfolk in Indonesia, or the Canadian postal workers' union. The latter-what might be loosely referred to as the ""small-a anarchists"", are by now by far the majority. But it is sometimes hard to tell, since so many of them do not trumpet their affinities very loudly. There are many. in fact, who take anarchist principles of anti-sectarianism and open-endedness so seriously that they refuse to refer to themselves as 'anarchists' for that very reason.  

What's really behind much of the Crimthinc bashing is an organized campaign by a few dogmatic anarchists to attack and denigrate any kind of anarchism that doesn't toe their party line. The fact that these same people attack other anarchists constantly illustrates where the root of this problem lies. It's one thing to engage in principled criticism of a project, quite another to project everything you hate about people onto a group which really doesn't have that kind of power.

And people just hate projects that are successful.

NEFAC started out as an anarcho-communist organization and then some of its members started pushing it into a platformist direction. Is there a contradiction between anarcho-communism and platformism? I think that most anarchists and anarcho-communists would say that there is a contradiction, as platformism is modelled on authoritarian communism. Just look at the history of platformism, including the covert takeover of the French Anarchist Federation in the mid 20th century, which led to a purge of platformists and the adoption of an anti-platformist policy.

Leaving aside the history of platformism, how does NEFAC express its politics these days? I think most people would agree that NEFAC comes across as more sectarian against other anarchists. It is more interested in promoting a “correct line” for all anarchists instead of just for their own organization. Any effort to promote a “correct line” in the anarchist movement runs counter to the open-mindedness of anarchism and its hostility towards intellectual rigidity. Some NEFAC members have been in active in sectarian debates against what they see as “un-anarchist” tendencies in anarchism, including primitivism, post-left anarchism and Crimethinc. They dismiss lifestylism in the movement, which they see as all anarchists who don't follow their narrow platformist line, in other words, 99% of all anarchists including anarcho-communists, who probably want no part of promoting leftist politics within anarchism.

I have a family background in farming and have personally avoided industrially-produced meat since I read The Omnivore's Dilemma a few years ago.  I do try to support local farms and I do buy organic / healthy meat.  My diet is about 90% vegetarian, but I do enjoy humanely produced, organic meat and fish as a source of protein.

My dad grew up on a very large multi-faceted farm.  His dad was uneducated, ambitious and greedy.  He worked his family into the ground - at a certain point my grandma's knees gave out from all the work.  At one point I wondered how my grandpa made so much money, and my dad admitted he used strong fertilizers to maximize his crops, back before they were illegal.  Still, they all worked very hard.  My grandpa equated money with love and pitted his sons against each other to earn the family inheritance.  My dad got out, but the other 4 brothers have had stints in mental facilities.

My dad credits the book-mobile for showing him a world outside of the farm.  He rebelled and went to college, majored in agronomy, lived in Europe for a while, and taught high school vo/ag classes when he moved back to MN.  Then he got a masters in Econ and started a tax practice for farms and farm corporations in his area.  He bought the small hobby farm where I grew up and always planted bountiful gardens, rotated crops in the fields for tax breaks, raised Christmas trees, and occasionally cared for a few turkeys or chickens.  He's a hunter and fisherman, and knows the names of every plant and animal.

I helped slaughter turkeys a few times, and there's nothing fun about it, but it was honest work.  We always grew sweet corn and pumpkins and I would sell them on the side of the road for school clothes money.  

My mom grew up on a ranch in rural eastern Montana.  Her parents started the ranch from nothing on the deserted prairie.  They lived in a tar paper shack until they could afford a house.  The barn came first.  They had 7 children, and passed the ranch down to their youngest son, who continues to raise Angus steer.  My grandparents were incredibly hard-working and frugal.  My grandma had an enormous garden, did a ton of canning and freezing.  She made all of their bread, most of their clothing, and mended tarps and things for the ranch.  She had a chicken house for eggs and meat.  She still complains about what a dirty job cleaning it out was.  She also complains about how chicken and eggs just don't taste right anymore.  Our family gets free beef from the family ranch and until I left home I didn't realize how much better tasting it was than what's commercially available.  

What amazes me most is that in choosing to avoid industrially produced meat, I am part of such a tiny minority.  The book ends with a discussion of turkey production, which was timely as I finished it over the Thanksgiving break.  My boyfriend brined and roasted an organic local turkey to perfection.  However, my dad bought a turkey from Willmar, MN where he grow up.  Willmar is the largest producer of turkeys in the country.  I tasted a little bit of it out of curiosity, and you know what?  I couldn't taste anything wrong with it.  The misery and hormones pumped into the meat is undetectable, to me at least.

Virtually all empirical evidence points to the fact that private enterprise is superior to government management of resources. I challenge you to back up your claim with this empirical evidence you speak of.


Here's a [post](http://www.asymptosis.com/an-open-letter-to-robert-barro.html) from a blog referencing Barro's work on the subject.  Barro is the most cited economist on economic growth.  Here's another [post](http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/bruce-bartlett/1249/europeanization-america) you might want to read making the same point.


&gt;What does this even mean? When taxes are lowered, the people who earn income are able to enjoy more of their money. They then use it in a way that benefits them, either through consuming goods and services or by investing in businesses that can increase their future wealth. The more money available to the people who earn the money, the more economic growth because those individuals will spend the money according to their actual demand. When the government confiscates the money through taxation, the money is forwarded not to to where it is most economically efficient but to areas where it is most politically efficient, i.e. politicians give money to special interests.


You seem to be mixing up demand effects with supply effects.  


&gt;This is complete nonsense. Private firms spend massive amounts of money on R&amp;D. Furthermore, you are just engaging in the broken window fallacy. You ignore the fact that the money was taken in the first place and that the money could have been put to other uses before it was handed out by politicians.


Basic science, such as the structure of the atom cannot be patented but such knowledge produces a lot of positive externalities and so is underfunded.  It is the existence of such market failures that provides the economic justification for government.  

I don't know why you think the broken window fallacy is relevant here.  This has to do with relative marginal rates of return to society.


&gt;You don't need to get into these issues, they are irrelevant to our discussion which deals precisely with the superiority of private enterprise over centralized direction of resources.


If the possibility of state capture exists, then instead of spending money of private investment, individuals will spend money of lobbying which will result in an inefficient allocation of resources.


&gt;Too bad you didn't open with this, I would have ignored your post altogether for blathering such nonsense.

Context is important, but if you think you can make your case without it, I invite you to try.

&gt;Tell me of the Wisdom you've seen demonstrated on this rock over say the last 30-60 yrs?

Arms reduction treaties, attempts to regulate uncontrolled capitalism to prevent the boom/bust cycle (see the current US administration), fewer nuclear tests, nuclear non-proliferation, an *attempt* at health care overhaul (not that the current overhaul is good), NHC in most other 1st world nations, reduction of capital punishment, increases in education in most 1st world nations (the US is an exception), the continuing demise of religion in Europe...  that's a good start.

&gt;The first hand-written English language Bible manuscripts were produced in the 1380's, The reformation or the renaissance out of the RCC's dark ages?

Irrelevant.  The aristocracy had education, the peasants did not.  The arrival of a hand-written bible isn't education, because the bible itself is not a useful source of information.

&gt;GMF is a problem, how has faired regarding cancer and all manner of disease over the past 100 yrs?

There is no established link between GM foods and cancer.  A few scientists have written articles about it, but none have been published in scientific journals, and thus none have passed peer review.  In short, I'll believe it when there is credible evidence to support it.

&gt;I could dig up a little pharmaceutical prophesy if you wish?

Prophecy bullshit is still bullshit, but if you must...

&gt;Its not just the drug pushers, it’s the hospitals, rest homes, salaries across the board, medical mfg's, the entire kit and kaboodle.

If you cut salaries, who will want to go through all that expensive schooling just to be dumping all their salary in to paying off their student loans?  Nobody.  No, you don't have any reasonable understanding of the health care industry.  You bitch and moan about it, but you don't understand it.

&gt;So one minute man does not follow GOD, but at the same time its all his fault, which might it be?

Your god's rules (in the OT) are immoral, as is his silence regarding slavery and misogyny - thus why I consider myself morally superior to your god.  Your god's followers can't decide whether to follow these rules or not, but generally they follow the bits they like and discard the bits they don't, usually to the detriment of some group or another (like homosexuals or women), which makes them equally repulsive.

&gt;For what, a quicker trip to heaven as their big reward? What were the kings and nobles after?

They didn't tend to die in battle - are you aware of how hard it was to kill a fully armored man back in those days, with the available weapons?  Their risk was small, especially considering they were worth more to the enemy alive, to be ransomed back, then dead.

&gt;Just a small glimpse of GOD's glory beginning to the end.

Unevidenced assertion - for this sentence to be correct you must first demonstrate the existence of this god character.

&gt;The Pope ordered Bernard of Clairvaux (in France) to preach a second crusade

Irrelevant - they still went along with it, thus it was still supported by the church (if not the pope himself).  Besides which, that's only one crusade of many.

&gt;What are the causes for secular wars, might it be greed that has far exceeded the (greed by extension) religious wars.

Every war would have to be examined on its own.  Regardless, you seem to be missing my point:  it's not a pissing match.

&gt;What might cause WWIIV?

Probably nationalism, if any such event happens.

&gt;What shall be the name of the secular peasant god that ye strive into WWIIV to die for?

I don't believe in any gods, so your question is idiotic.

&gt;Is a thing right before your eyes a conspiracy or fact?

You say it is before my eyes, I say you're seeing things that aren't there.  You've yet to provide any evidence to back your assertions.

&gt;Who much examination does one require to see the road to error is paved with good intentions?

I dealt with that issue and moved on.  A implies B and B implies C, therefore when you report that A implies C, you are not being misleading.

&gt;What evidence do you have to back your claims? I'm not saying it does or doesn't, but I have read a few books about the subject, and there is evidence that violent media has negative affects on children.

I've read similar books (probably the same ones actually, though there has been a large proliferation of them in the past few years, so I've been sticking to just keeping up with the research papers themselves.  You definitely need to read the books critically.  There are a great many which claim to have found evidence, but have done so with completely illegitimate experiments that have flaws which invalidate their conclusions.  Also common is proof of something small, but they generalize their conclusions to apply to many things which they never tested.  I've read a great deal, and continue to keep up on the subject, and thus far there has not been one single solid study that shows any ability for fiction to override any persons conscious mind, regardless of their age.  The more recent research, in fact, shows that children grasp the idea of fiction bearing no resemblance on reality far earlier than was suspected before.

Common flaws to look out for:  If they test a subjects response to a violent VIDEO and say ""this is the subjects response to exposure to violence"", they have invalidated their study.  In order to accept that response to violent IMAGES is the same as reaction to violence in real life, you have to accept that fiction is equivalent to reality, and that the brain cannot differentiate between them.  Fiction is not equivalent to reality.

Also, if they do not (and they rarely ever do, I've only seen it a handful of times) address the prior experience of their subjects with violent imagery, and also their prior experience with actual violence, their study is invalid.  There actually IS a VERY large amount of evidence and actual SOLID research showing that children exposed to ACTUAL violence have a great deal of problems.  If exposed to violence in the home, children suffer a much greater likelihood of carrying out violence in the future, even when socioeconomic variables are controlled for.  If your study treats a person who just got home from a 48-hour Halo LAN party, a person who has never played a violent game and avoids violent movies and TV, and a person who grew up watching their dad bitch slap their mom as all equivalent, then you're throwing out the entire premise before you have even begun.  If these things have effects, then those effects have to be controlled for.

Also, a really obvious one, is that the vast majority of the studies do nothing more than test subjects during or immediately after playing a violent game or watching a violent video.  We've known forever that watching someone commit violence, watching a violent video, even imagining violent thoughts, arouses people.  It stimulates the release of adrenaline (epinephrine if you're in Europe), tweaks the amygdula, etc.  So does imagery of ANY form of competition.  So does imagery of nonviolent physical activity.  So does erotic imagery.  If you want to claim that these short term effects on physiology accumulate or influence future actions, as most media effects researchers wish to do, it would be necessary to include every thing which induces these effects.

I would not simply ignore evidence to the contrary.  This is why I still read the research, even though almost all of it is performed by people whose livelihood depends entirely upon establishing evidence for effects.  But I will not accept flawed evidence.  No one ever should.  It is downright dangerous.  The issues of 'if it does increase violent tendencies, what do we do about it?' is an entirely different discussion.  

What I'd really like to see is more studies done on MECHANISMS.  Even if we find strong statistical phenomenological evidence, there will always be huge flaws and problems until we can determine the mechanism through which this works.  And it is clear that videogames do not differ in any meaningful way from all the media which have come before it.  Being an actor in a play should be, by the theories put forward by anti-game researchers, be outrageously psychologically harmful.  Actors which have participated in realistic scenes carrying out violence against other people should be crippled by post traumatic stress disorder.  Children who play violent videogames should be similarly crippled.  And, quite simply, they're not.

edit:  Oh, and most important, from a parenting perspective, is that if you believe your child to be incapable of ""handling"" a certain work of fiction, your first question (if you are interested in helping your child) has to be ""How can I make my child capable of handling this?""  If you simply believe that their capacity to deal with these things will come with age and growth, you are wrong.  We know the mechanisms through which children develop the ability to deal with emotionally involving imaginary images.  They have to have experience with dealing with them.  If they are never given that experience, or the experience is delayed until too late in their life, they will not mature emotionally and will never be capable of handling challenging fiction.  Though it is not very disabling in our culture, it is undoubtedly a handicap no parent should wish to burden their children with.  There is no virtue in being scared shitless of imaginary boogiemen (like the idea that certain 2D pictures or certain ideas can cause harm).",True,False,,otakucode,0,0

You can get C_(t+1) on the left side of the equation and everything on the right will be measurable now (and from past data) and the value on the left can be measured in the future. You can use the model now to predict the future, then measure the error after measuring real consumption in the future. You can test the model's error this way.

It looks like a very simple/naive model. Sometimes simple models perform very well (usually when the behavior or a system is dominated by a few variables. The other ones don't matter much). Of course, sometimes simple models are terrible. Also, the ""performance"" of a model is relative. It depends on what you are trying to do with the model. Sometimes a simpler model with poorer error is sufficient for the task at hand. Of course sometimes it really isn't.

Let say, for example, that this model is being used to figure out how to tweak interest rates in order to increase consumer spending vs. saving in order to stimulate the economy. Let's also say that the strategy is failing, and that through some other means we know that the strategy is failing because of errors in the model (interest rates aren't the only driver of consumption after all). If that is the case then the European central banks using the model surely deserve some criticism for it.

However, at no point will that criticism lend support to Austrian economics. That's not how it works. Discrediting the model doesn't somehow give credit to the alternative economic theory of your choice. At the end of the day, Austrian theory barely makes any predictions. Of those predictions, none can be measured for accuracy. Austrian economics apologetics comprises completely of bashing current models and asserting that Austrian theory is, by false dichotomy, correct. I could do that with anything.

Just for the record, our forefathers did not have their frostbitten gangrenous limbs sawed off without painkillers to establish a patriarchy.  They established rights.  But more importantly they established the framework of government to insure the rights of people.  Its fairly grievous to insinuate that the men who have sacrificed their lives during our history were only self serving patriarchs.  I mean really, thats insulting.  Your grandfather probably fought the nazis to end genocide and return a free europe.  I really hope you didnt sit down with him in his dieing years and chide him for advancing the march of the patriarchy over the oppressed women.

Instead I think you should look at the data that is available.  [This](http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/) is the oldest source of reliable data about occupations and education that I can find.  Im not going to go through each and every one of them and make a case this far down in a thread.  I just want to give you the information.

There are females represented in practically every single occupation (except I couldnt find prostitution listed).  Though just as I told you there is absolutely a glass floor (there is a glass ceiling too and thats a fair point and Im not dismissing that!)

Further I find that in [this dataset](http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1905-02.pdf) which is about the earliest I could find that had everything i wanted.  If youll look at 1905 with me, on page 67 and going as far as you want to go youll find that even 100 years ago more women were going to high school than men and MORE WOMEN WERE EARNING DEGREES than men (now to get this second number you have to add the BS degrees from co-ed institutions with the ones for women-only institutions).  So Im going to assume that youre talking about some kind of patriarchy before 1904.

Thats about as far back as I can go in the records.  So, unfortunately, I cant really ""prove"" that a patriarchy didnt exist (realistically you can never prove a negative and the burden of proof would be on you to begin with)  Just like I cant prove theres no God.
  
[This dataset is older if you are a subscriber, though it is incomplete](http://www.nhgis.org/)

From that Im going to plead with you to please reconsider my position.  That maybe, just maybe, the things that you have been told about male oppression and the patriarchy are not really based on any kind of facts or figures.  

That maybe, just possibly, an entire generation of women have grown up mistrustful and resentful of men for no real reason.

But there are the datasets.  Thats the data.  If you find something absolutely PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  It doesnt have to be today, it doesnt even have to be you.  Anyone can look at them and if they can pull some kind of patriarchy then definately point it out to me.

* The U.S. has the right to prosecute anyone for violating U.S. laws if the violation happens in the U.S. If the violator has already left the U.S., doing so in practice will require a successful extradition.
* What some in the U.S. want to do (but I'm arguing is clearly wrong and sets a bad precedent for everyone) is try to apply U.S. laws to non-U.S. citizens for acts that happen outside the U.S.

In particular, there is talk of trying to prosecute Assange under the U.S. Espionage Act. In the distant past this was applied to acts of speech on U.S. soil that impaired U.S. military operations, including recruitment.

Huh, does HE define the term in there? Because that would be nice.

Bureaucracy is a term that has been used by social scientists for more than a century, since at least Max Weber.  It's relatively well defined.  You can start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy 
&gt;I repeat, have you ever made systematic study of the behavior of large organizations? Because I have, in fact, it's what I went to school for.
Did you start this conversation thinking I had? I find it odd that you imply an argument from authority at this point in the discussion.
That pattern of failure of the USSR is interesting...

Arguing from evidence is not the same as argument from authority.  My point is that you seem very convinced that planning can work.  WHY do you think that?  WHERE did you get that idea?  My opinions have come from my study of these issues.  On subjects I haven't studied (15th century Slavic love poetry, brain surgery) I tend not to have strong opinions.  If you haven't studied these topics, isn't it possible that your strong opinions come from emotion rather than logic and evidence?
&gt;I've given a couple justifications. A) Markets rely on smaller organizations. Walmart is the largest employer in the world and it has less than 2 million employees and most companies are far smaller. You're talking about a planner that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the largest company in the world. B) when market operators get too large or inefficient, they tend to be eliminated by their competitors. No such automatic mechanism exists for a central planner. C) These exact arguments have been made for more than 100 years and yet numerous attempts at central planners have consistently failed to outperform markets over the long run, and many of them have ended in starvation, genocide, and ecological devastation. This is strong evidence that what you assume can be done cannot. D) At the most basic level, every man hour you spend planning is a man hour that can't be spent producing. Since you're anticipating a planning body of millions, if not tens of millions, you're starting in a deep hole.
A) Yes, it will be big and you've given zero justification that a large organization can't be more efficient, given the proper structure. Or are you going to bring back the Second Law?
My second law metaphor says that organizations will tend to get less efficient over time, not that a given organization cannot be efficient.  However, information theory does says that large organizations tend to be less efficient.  So does almost every book on corporate governance, bureaucracy, management, or organizational theory ever written.  Now, it's true that these books argue that the advantages of size (more capital, economies of scale, etc.) can overcome the inherent disadvantages, but no one argues that growth doesn't impose large costs.
&gt;Further, even assuming it must be inefficient, you've offered no metric, not even approximate, to compare how inefficient it would be relative to a market as a whole. (not a single small efficient organization)

What metric would you like me to use? 

&gt;B) Your use of 'automatic' again pretends reliable free decisions. There is no reason a system internal to the planner could not be every bit as 'automatic' as market forces.

Automatic does not mean free.  Individuals and corporations have expenses, which means they are constantly bleeding money.  In order to survive, they have to take positive action to bring in more money.  Capitalism is like an ocean with a giant whirlpool populated by boats.  If the captains of boats do nothing, they'll eventually sink.  If they waste fuel (i.e. money) steaming toward whirlpool rather than away (i.e. offer the wrong products at the wrong prices) they'll sink.  Large boats might sink slower than small boats, but they're also a lot harder to turn in a new direction.  
In a centrally planned system, nothing is supposed to happen that the planner does not will to happen, which means that the The Bureau of X will do whatever it does until someone actively decides to eliminate it.  The default is survival, not elimination.    
Now, you're probably saying, “so what, the planner can just eliminate what he wants when he wants to”.  And sure, in theory, there's no difference.  But in practice the difference is huge.  Eliminating sub units in a large organization tends to be exceedingly difficult.  In any large organization the people at the top cannot know about the existence of all of the units below them, much less how they are performing.  And even if your central planner is omniscient, the people in the sub units will scheduled for elimination will likely resist, for both selfish and noble reasons.  They won't want to lose their jobs, but more importantly they will probably believe that they are doing good work.  Most people won't readily admit, even to themselves, that what they do every day is totally useless.

What's even worse is that can actually we worse than useless.  A market gardener that killed his customers plants quickly stops getting hired, but a centrally planned killer gardener will keep coming back until his superiors reassign him.  An impossible example you say?  Just look at the history of collectivized agriculture.  Over the course of the 20th century, just about every communist country tried to collectivize agriculture at some point.  The result was almost invariably famine, massive peasant resistance, and crop failures.   Yet new governments kept trying to collectivize agriculture on the grounds of increased efficiency.  Some even collectivized, were forced by peasant revolt to back down, then tried again!  By the end of the USSR the 3% of the land that was in private plots was producing ten times as much per acre as the collectivized land, and even the official soviet figures admitted that their farmers were, on average, only 20% as efficient as American farmers.  Before WWI, the Russian empire was Europe's breadbasket.  The USSR took over and spent enormous sums on agriculture, had an enormous amount of good farmland, and a lot of land relative to it's population, but still somehow managed to have constant food shortages and had to rely on importing grain.",True,False,,cassander,0,0

Not sure why you picked just the IF category and not the overall rankings, since the entire purpose of the report was to get a list of ""most libertarian"" countries, and a large part of the libertarian idea is to have economic freedom.
If you actually look at the final list, instead of cherry picking, you'll get a better picture.

There are a few reasons that post is very different. 

For one, the women in that post are completely objectified and there is no particular indication that they are trying to be. You can't see their faces. They are not posing for the camera. If there is a legitimate reason to consider them whores or something, it's certainly not indicated in the context of the post.

They are a pair of whores and no mistake. I feel no need to justify that statement.""

It's sexist basically because of the attitude of everyone involved. The OP picked a random paparazzi photo of two female public figures together and said, ""I don't reaaaally care about who these women are, but because they are female and prominent public figures, they deserve to be evaluated publicly on their physical assets, but only those assets that give no indication of who they are personality-wise whatsoever.""

Having lived decades of my life in both New Zealand and Australia, I can attest to the notable difference in personal freedom between the two nations, which was your initial assertion, and is illustrated in the data (NZ having an individual freedom rank of 6, Aus being a 15).

Examples of areas in which Australia lacks are same sex marriage law, pornography and censorship law, the influence of religion on law, the handling of native people's rights, record of mistreatment and ongoing consequences thereof, the handling of refugees and immigrants, latent racism in urban areas, worsening internet censorship, the refusal of classification of entertainment that does not meet the strictest standards in the English speaking world, etc. All very impacting factors.

Understanding that this thread and the post has been filed under Anarchism, please understand that it is a multi-disciplinary topic/subject. 

Fractional Reserve Banking is a fraudulent ""Ponzie"" scheme thrust upon the ignorant through complex sounding terms and overly complicated &amp; unnecessary mathematics.  To better understand this scheme, consider watching the First part of the movie ""Zeitgeist-Addendum"" - Part one cogently and plainly explains ""**Modern Money Mechanics**.""

""The Secret of Oz"" [2009] is also currently available online for easy viewing.  This current offering by Historian Bill Still brings together many, many highly charged elements to the fraudulent modern money mechanics schema.

Way, way back in 1995 - **The Money Masters** a lengthy documentary, produced by attorney Patrick S. J. Carmack and directed and also narrated by Bill Still, discussed the concepts of money, debt, and taxes, and described their development from biblical times onward. 

It covers the history of fractional-reserve banking, central banking, monetary policy, the bond market, and the Federal Reserve System in the United States (as well as Europe). The film is widely available online (Google Video).

Yep, many HR people are terrible at their job.  That fact is more globally recognized than McGill University.

But yes, I will admit that I was using hyperbole when I said that they didn't know what the fuck that is.  I was hoping people would pick up on that.  But the issue is that they don't know how prestigious it is in the US.  Especially the more south you go.

There is very little cachet over when it comes to McGill in many parts of the US.  I would say it's like going to Asia or Europe with a Vanderbilt degree.  Vanderbilt is an excellent school, but many people haven't heard of it.  And for those that have, they don't equate it with similarly academically schools like a Berkeley or Michigan.

For example, in the west coast, University of Virginia, while a great school, has virtually no major network.  Even though UCLA is probably not up to par with of Virginia, it is much more recognizable and has a larger network here than in the east.  A UCLA grad would impress people here way more than a University of Virginia degree.  That is sadly the case.  

Like every University in the world, a McGill grad will want to hire a McGill grad.  So OP better hope you end up with a place with a lot of McGill grads.

After the war ended, it wasn't until the early 50s that CIA was even put together, and that was mostly to country KGB ops that were being run around the world and to gain information on what was behind the iron curtain.  At the time, there were a lot of people who didn't want the US to get involved in the spying business for the same ethical reasons that are being raised now.  What it came down to was they faced the hard realization that whether the US participates or not, the rest of the world has been and will continue to perform clandestine operations and to spy on us.

The current trend is that African-Americans hit puberty earlier than white-Americans, so some argue that genetics plays a role there, and children in the Southern part of the United States tend to hit puberty at an earlier age than those of their northern counter-parts, another research study showed that people from low socio-economic backgrounds hit puberty at an earlier age than those who are middle-class and upper-class in terms of their economic status.

Not to mention, European monarchs married their children off young and as someone mentioned, historically, children were married off at a younger age and it was only after the advent of the Industrial Revolution that marriages started to take place at a later age, but this trend only existed amongst those of the working class, while pubescent marriages still occurred amongst the upper classes.

Not to mention, there is a general trend in our current society, where children are experiencing their first sexual encounters shortly after they hit puberty.

I respect incorrect religious ideas every bit as much as respect incorrect historical ideas.  No one who believes that Stalin was a time traveler from 2300CE goes around demanding respect for their views, and if they did you'd think they were nuts.  I don't see religion as any different.

I agree it is valuable as a piece of literature, since it is so important to the history of western civilization.  After all, it sat it's ugly, evil buttocks astride the development of Europe and America for nearly two millennia.  If the people of Europe had been praying to Mother Goose, I'd be saying the same thing about that book, however.

The Bible isn't relevant because it's a good book.  It is a profoundly insidious and evil book.  It is relevant because it is responsible for more than a thousand years of social, political and technological stagnation.

Probably wont continue this discussion for much longer due to the all the downvotes making it pretty pointless, I'll just leave a little comment on a couple of bits of that one you posted. I also encourage you to read those articles I linked to elsewhere in this thread, and do a bit more of your own research. The article you link reads a bit like a shopping list for the far right of the debate. It's only one half of the story. Do what you will, but just letting you know that there is a whole world of knowledge to be had on this topic. [Science daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/news/fossils_ruins/anthropology/) is a great place to start for Anthropology related tid bits.

The problem I (and most anthropologists (me not actually being one, just interested)) have with the term 'Race' is demonstrated in this sort of thinking:

&gt;Does the Nigerian population represent all populations in the African cluster, or the European population represent all the populations in the Eurasian cluster? Of course not, but analyzing them certainly gives an insight as to what makes one population different from any other.

The fact is that to begin with, these people are looking for groups which look like the races they want to demonstrate, and in the process discard *a lot* of data. You will never see results from places like Afghanistan or in particular Brazil, where local populations are just really confusing. From the start, they are looking at the populations most representative of those groups they mean to study. The process is top down and leaves us with an extremely limited understanding of those groups which don't quite colour within the lines, and for an Anthropologist trying to study what makes us distinct, it imposes some very restrictive and very artificial limits. What we need when studying human biology is specificity and accuracy. Race is a shotgun when you need a scalpel. The thinking of the people above is that human diversity is like a line or a circle, you can pick a few extremes and you have yourself a representative sample. In reality, it's more like a big messy sphere. The existence of large groups does not prove linearity. Far too much interbreeding, human reproduction and genetics just isn't that easy to pin down. [These are two graphical representations of Cavalli-Sforza's work with mtDNA showing genetic relatedness between different groups](http://imgur.com/fvgmzl&amp;exnJ8). This data shows how complicated even such a simple measure as looking at mtDNA can get. The point I'm trying to make is that by saying Negroid or Black or whatever you want to use is always different from Caucasian or Asian in some meaningful and consistent way is simple to inaccuracy and an over-simplification of how the genetics actually look. It's not about being PC or nice, its about standards.

&gt;For other phenotypes like IQ or personality, if you’re inclined to react negatively, I say wait a few years before you get too confident; the study of human genetic variation is in its infancy, and once it hits adolescence it’s going to start becoming a real pain in the ass.

And this is where real problems start to emerge, though not just for Anthropologists, but for Psychologists and Sociologists as well. Putting differences in IQ and personality down to genes makes the discipline of developmental Psychology cry. Its just, quite simply, not that easy. Aside from the huge problems inherent in using IQ tests to measure cross cultural intelligence, language biases, cognitive bias associated with particular languages, cultural biases and with personality testing against alien cultural norms, all of this information entirely ignores the fact that how kids develop is more often than not just as much, if not more a question of where and how as of what they start with.

Point I'm trying to make is that when exceptions to a rule exist where you are trying to account for something that needs to be this specific, find a better rule. It's not about politics, it's about needing the standards to catch up with the science. ",True,False,,ookle,0,0

Only a fool doesn't know that European countries have a much stronger safety net than the U.S. And the majority here want it that way, regardless of what the media may tell them.

You don't have to bail out half the population when things like medical care and education are paid for with public funds. You don't have to do that when the economy isn't built on *negative* money (which is what debt is). And also, it's not that expensive to do that, even if you had to. It's just expensive to do if you throw billions and billions and billions at the military to go on misadventures around the world. 

People in the US don't want it because they don't understand what ""it"" is, how it works, or what it means. They are told that there will be taxes involved, and they shut down. That is because, to an American, ""taxes"" equals ""theft."" --And for good reason! The government takes our money and does... Well, virtually nothing we can see or benefit from.

In countries with strong social safety nets, you pay your taxes and you see affordable, quality healthcare. You see well-funded schools with teachers not scraped from the bottom of the barrel. You see your money at work, and you feel the benefits. Americans hate taxes because they don't understand that, under normal circumstances, that money comes back to them in really high-value services that the free market could not provide at that price.

Let's see... How many jobs have I ever had in the US that had paid sick leave... Uhhhh... Zero.

We shouldn't scrape any parts of the world, but (sometimes) ""sanitizing"" certain areas is in the interest of the greater good.

Both of these sentiments horrify me in ways I cannot even begin to describe. The implication is that if we had not committed genocide, we would have been killed. For the record, it was genocide, what was done to the Native Americans. For every instance of white woman abduction or farm raids, I can give you ten stories of health and succor provided to settlers by the natives, and I can give you 20 stories regarding the treatment given to the natives- deliberately annihilating their belief system with the Religious Crime Code and abducting their children and placing them in religious institutions to “Christianize” them- the last of which was only closed in 1954. To deliberately distributing smallpox-ridden blankets among a population we KNEW had never been exposed to it- to Andrew fucking Jackson spitting in the Supreme Courts face when John Marshall told him- “you don’t have the right to evict the Cherokee from Florida.” Jackson said, “Watch me.” And unilaterally marched the Army down there and evicted them. It was called the Trail of Tears, incidentally. Don’t you dare tell me that what we did to them was justified, or necessary.

For the other, “sanitize?” Seriously?!?  At the risk of invoking Godwin’s Wrath, I tell you that is exactly the wording Hitler used in the execution of the Holocaust. He was “sanitizing” Europe for the Aryan race.

Firstly, habeas corpus is not suspended.  The Bush administration attempted to suspend it, but the SCOTUS consistently overruled both the Executive and Legislative branches of the government on this.  There is separation of powers for a reason and this was a classic example of how things work.  Every time habeus corpus has come up for trial it has been defended.  (Well, outside of the Civil War, but given that was around 150 years ago I don't really see it as relevant.)  Finally, in 2009 Obama asserted that ""they have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus"" in reference to ""enemy combatants"" held at Gitmo.

Assassination of US citizens?  How about one.  Anwar Al Awlaki, who has repeatedly announced his decision to slaughter as many Americans as he possibly can.  I might add that there isn't really an assasination order out.  What is out is that the USG recognizes Awlaki as an enemy commander and will take him out if necessary.  I imagine you think there are no circumstances in which the US could ever justifiably kill one of its own citizens?  

Plenty of legislation protecting the wealthy?  Sure, but where is that not the case?  There are some countries that rank higher on social mobility scales, but the US is still in the upper bracket for this.  With hard work and lots of luck a great many people have improved their stations in life in the US.  Additionally, there is plenty of legislation supporting the working classes. Debtor's prisons?  No.  Work safety standards?  Yes.  Minimum wages?  Yes.  Are there as many protections as I would like for the poor?  No, but to pretend there aren't any isn't accurate either.

Our foreign policy bears no imprint of imperialism, at least not since the Philippines gained independence.  Put simply, there is no Empire.  We control no countries outside of the US (outside of a few Pacific Islands which are protectorates).  We do have military presence on the ground in a lot of countries, but that doesn't mean the US controls those countries.  Iraq is a case in point.  While the US currently has more troops on the ground, Iran has more sway with the government in power.  Certainly, the Iraqi government doesn't do what America wishes most of the time.  

Contempt for people?  Right because all the crap we did for Europe means nothing.  Or setting up the UN.  Or peacekeeping operations in Somalia (failed, but you can't say it was contemptuous of Somalis - well maybe Aideed), Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti, the list goes on.  Remember the 2004 tsunami?

Regardless of the crimes of early or more recent believers the world was no kinder a place before the Abrahamic faiths than after.  One of the most pervasive trends in human societies is that they are guilty of great injustice, at least according to our Judeo-Christian sensibilities.  From New Zealand to Norway (heading East or West) there is essentially no place and time that terrible things weren't happening somewhat regularly.  I see no reason to believe that the Christians were an innately peaceful people corrupted by an evil faith.  More likely people tend to do things that Judeo-Christian tradition deems evil and tries to temper.  

I'm not sure how the Abrahamic faiths set us back 1000 years.  Are you referring to the dark ages?  If so, you're referring to the golden age of Islam and, even if Christianity was responsible for stagnation in Europe, most of Europe was less stagnant after Rome than before.

That's disputable.  Before Christianity cropped up across Europe, they had republican governments, scientific institutions, centuries-old libraries.  I think Sam Harris is probably right when he says that if it wasn't for Christianity, we would probably have had the internet in 1200CE.

The value of the Bible is pretty much it's ancillary effects on culture.  Many other writings are enhanced if you have read the Bible.  References in Shakespeare are missed if you haven't read it, for example.

It was Muslim scientists that led the way in modern astronomy, physics and math, making such technologies as manned rockets and the algorithms essential for computer science possible.   Speaking of space travel, guess who reverted to Islam? Neil Armstrong.

There were also major advances in biology, germ theory for example, Muslims knew poor health came  from being unwashed back in the 6th century, before any European ever stepped into a bath. Also alcohol and pork weren't realized to be Unhealthy in the west until the 1970s or so,  Islam knew their dangers also from the 6th century.

Moral law also was advanced by Islam. When muslins encountered pagans they offered them conversion and formed new integrated states, when christian europeans met pagans they killed slaughtered them or turnes them into slaves. As the founding fathers of America such as jefferson admired the tolerance of Islam and used it as the basis for their society.

In the humanities the world admired islamic arts for its advanced sophisticationthe most important book of poetry of all time was written by a Muslim, the Rubiyat. Muslim designs were stolen and imitatated everywhere in the west, even the US Capitol building has a dome, an Islamic contribution so admired you see them on churches. 

Muslim Spain was the most advanced country Europe ever had until the 17th century, Europeans didn't catch up until the enlightenment, 200 years after Christian barbarians illegally occupied the last of  al Andalusia.

For all the islamophobics: Womens rights started in Islam as well, never before in western history could a woman own land, a business, slaves or investments, the Koran also requires men to protect and only marry a additional wives if he can treat her equally. It also doesn't permit men to use force except as a last resort, ever watch mad men? Domestic violence was acceptable in America into the 1960s when Islam regulated protection of women over a thousand years earlier.

Under islam all people of the book, Muslims, xians and jews are protected, yet in in the Jewish state only Jews have full citizenship, in European countries Muslims have limited rights to dress as they must.

The world had benefitted so much from Islam and still has much more to learn.

&gt;Right, so some troops are killers and some aren't... because troops get to choose whether or not they go to war?

sure they do. don't sign up, and you'll never go to war. next.

&gt;Like it or not, you sleep at night because of them.

I sleep at night because redneck joe helped torture prisoners of war and blew away a couple of civilians in a country thousands of miles away?

&gt;There are many people in the world that don't have that luxury and you probably don't even think it is a luxury.

all of western europe seems to be able to sleep at night without killing anyone for fun.

You are COMPLICIT in that killing.

I am. I am a murderer. I am not as big of a murderer as a soldier since I haven't directly killed anyone yet, but I am still part of it. does this mean my points are wrong?

&gt;If you don't want troops killing in your name, would you be willing to give up your car, the computer you're using right now and your fuckin ipod to live like 2/3rds of the world does?

again, you do not have to kill people to have nice things. I have had computers before the war in afghanistan and iraq. I think I would still have them if we didn't invade their countries as well.

&gt;You reap the benefits of our global dominance which is based entirely on our military being the biggest &amp; best in the world. It's not fair or right, but the fact is that we are on top because someone is on bottom. We are the 1st world only because the 3rd world exists, and if we weren't the 1st world someone else would be. I HATE that it's true but it's certainly not the fault of soldiers and marines.

actually, it is their fault. we are at the top. the position is secured. we no longer have to kill brown people to keep it there. in fact, the wars have only brought us down, not up. the country is going to shit after these wars. they haven't helped one bit. if they would stop signing up, the government wouldn't be able to keep up the troop levels. they'd have to leave or try a draft. if they tried a draft, nobody would go, especially after vietnam. that would be the end of it. the troops are the blood of this war machine.

&gt;I don't see many Americans giving up their 1st world comforts but I sure see a lot of douche bags blaming the troops. I'm sure any number of troops would love to show you how the bottom half lives, many of them have seen it all too often. You, however, don't seem to have a fucking clue how fortunate you are.

I was just as fortunate before the illegal war as I was after the illegal war. it didn't help me at all.

&gt;Our troops have the balls to fight for your sorry ass sitting on the couch. They fight and kill so you can stay in your comfortable little bubble while someone else does the dirty work of killing brown people a world away to maintain American hegemony, so you can watch dancing with the stars and eat pop tarts and feel morally superior.

What basis do you speak from? It's certainly not in the Qur'an and is not a mark of early Islamic histories. When Islam rapidly spread across the Arabian peninsula, forced conversion did not occur. In fact, conversions were not desired. Arabs wished to keep their status intact and thus there were still considerable Christian, Zoroastrian, and Jewish populations. From a political stand point, the early caliphs were never considered religious leaders. They were allowed to rule over anything not covered by the Qur'an. The rise of the ulema created a clergy that was distinct from rulers. Only Shi'a Muslims believe the caliphs should be religious rulers as well.

It was Muslim scientists that led the way in modern astronomy, physics and math, making such technologies as manned rockets and the algorithms essential for computer science possible. 

False. Islam was born of tribal culture and law that was the socio-political situation in Arabia. Their conquering army(under the Arabs) destroyed all who came in contact and resisted. The reason the muslims are credited for(erroneously) advancing sciences is because they were in the unique position(remember I am still talking about pre-turkic times) of possessing text from conquered lands(such as Persia, India and Greek regions). At this time Europe is still very much in the dark ages and Constantinople has not fallen. Then the mongols destroy Iraq. Turks usurp power from the Arabs and soon(200 years later) Constantinople falls. Which is promptly destroyed. Women raped and enslaved etc. Then the texts which survived are translated into Turkic languages.

It is very much Europe which created the modern sciences. After a lag of 500 years(Arab occupation of Spain). Because you see the desire and ability to do science is something a culture develops over time. BTW if was the Arab occupation of Spain which brought into contact not the texts only but the *idea* of aggressive expansion. The Spanish inquisition is but a mirror of the havoc caused by the moors when Spain fell. If Islam had to bypass an entire continent(Norther Africa) to reach Europe and rule it for 200 years then you can image what happened to cultures in the vicinity of Arabia. It is not called the Islamic explosion for nothing. First the Arabs and the the Turks.

Coming back to what galvanizes science is some resources(texts and food etc) and some support system for academics. If Islam was so scientifically advanced why did they not produce modern sciences themselves? After all they had a huge head start against Europe. The answer has two facets:
1) Inability to perform sciences(inherent discouragement in the cultures to question).
2) Europeans trumping them at what they are best known for:a) War and b) Slavery

What developments in science took place were in the sphere of military technology applied to society(something basic to sciences even today). If anything, Islam has taken the world back 1000 years by the sheer destruction of people and texts that their bloody expansion*s* resulted in.

|Speaking of space travel, guess who reverted to Islam? Neil Armstrong.

So much fail here. I detect some false propaganda. Not surprising since one of the things Islamic scholars of today agree on is the unreliability of Islamic record keeping for the muslims had a habit of claiming as Islamic things/theories they liked in the subjugated races.

| There were also major advances in biology, germ theory for example, Muslims knew poor health came from being unwashed back in the 6th century, before any European ever stepped into a bath. Also alcohol and pork weren't realized to be Unhealthy in the west until the 1970s or so, Islam knew their dangers also from the 6th century.

Europe was one of the last semi-nomadic places to settle down. So if you compare Islamic knowledge, which had ravaged Asia(the center of Civilization) ,and gained knowledge from these places, then is it surprising that there is merit in the argument? It is like saying the Arabs brought culture to the nomadic Turks of Central Asia. True but is it anything to brag about. Its like a newly homeless man teaching beggars on the street the benefits of insulation. 

| Muslim Spain was the most advanced country Europe ever had until the 17th century, Europeans didn't catch up until the enlightenment, 200 years after Christian barbarians illegally occupied the last of al Andalusia.

If it was so idyllic please tell me why they kicked the moors out. Because of wanton rape and pillage. The Andalusians may have been simpler people but the barbarians were the moors. The Spanish inquisition is nothing but a mirror of the barbarities perpetrated by the moors. What Islam succeed in doing was introduce the idea of aggressive expansion(a semi-nomadic philosophy extremely effective if the opponents are a settled people). Soon after Spaniards conquered Europe, they then went on to the Americas(and perpetrated untold barbarities). Very similar to the Islamic expansion don't you think? 

| For all the islamophobics: Womens rights started in Islam as well, never before in western history could a woman own land, a business, slaves or investments, the Koran also requires men to protect and only marry a additional wives if he can treat her equally.

False. Isn't it a fact that: 

1)Women cannot enter Mosques. Don't even try to say- 'in the Western countries they can.' 

2)Heaven is forbidden for Women. 

Just being born a woman excludes them from heaven. Off the top of my head. There are a few non-Islamic, or anti-Islamic scholars(from the 7th century) who survived the physical purges who comment that the position of women was woeful in pre-Islam tribal Arabia but in post-Islam barbaric Arabia they were reduced further to the level of cattle. For example, Mohammed's wife was a businesswoman who propped him up. How many business women exist in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia etc. *today*. Not too many I guess. The thing is that religious scripture can be interpreted according to convenience. What we must actually look at is the sociological situation at different points in time in Islamic lands. And from it's inception the women of lands occupied by the armies of Islam have been degraded to a great extent with shocking consistency. Who need to look at a 1400 year old book to realize that women are degraded in Islamic societies when the proof is before your eyes. During the Turkic period of Islamic expansion, homosexuality was the norm with the men(see Istanbul's boy brothels) but today it is heavily persecuted by Muslims themselves and the quran also condemns it. If you were born in Turkey 500 years ago could you say -""Read the quran, it forbids homosexuality"", and expect it to affect the ground situation in any way? Then why do you advocate reading the quran as a way of ending this degradation of women.

| Under islam all people of the book, Muslims, xians and jews are protected, yet in in the Jewish state only Jews have full citizenship, in European countries Muslims have limited rights to dress as they must.

I regret to inform you that while the notion of slavery existed in ancient  times, Islam made people(read women and children for the conquered  men were killed) currency in the form of slaves. It was slavery that fueled the war machines of Islam as they were the payment to the soldiers and to the caliphs after a successful occupation. 

| The world had benefitted so much from Islam and still has much more to learn.

I would rather stay ignorant than learn from the religion of *peace* if these are the lessons to be learnt. I suggest you go spout you Islamic apologist crap in the Islamic forums where people are less educated than here because you can't get away with blatant lies here.

I'm not saying they didn't loot or rape, but there definitely were rules and laws that were kept, especially among each-other, neutral city areas, where no fighting could be held, neutral ship-repairing areas where ships could gather wood, etc.

The history has portrayed Vikings as dangerous savages, because the history was written by Christians who needed the Vikings to look like the ultimate bad guys.

Right, because that's totally the same thing. 

From my experience it works like this. Scandinavian countries let in large numbers of people as ""refugees"" from the middle east and africa, mainly from Muslim countries. They are given benefits and housing, usually in a place with lots of other immigrants. Since Scandinavian societies are actually very insular but have generous benefits they tend to stay on benefits and develop a fierce hatred for the ""Svens"", i.e. the native Scandinavians. In Sweden there are areas [which are a majority immigrant with a huge unemployment rate, high crime and which the police or even the fire brigade won't visit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosengård)

http://exilen.eu/showthread.php?1771-Financial-Times-skriver-om-den-svenska-m%C3%A5ngkulturen...

&gt; In Herrgarden, kids from diverse backgrounds do mix. But at schools composed almost wholly of migrants, they find it hard to feel an attachment with wider society. “My passport says I’m Svensk, but in the apartment, no,” says Lulli’s Turkish pal Nihad. “In Herrgarden, if someone has a problem, we help him. The Swedes, they are very cold. They shake hands. We kiss. Not like gays, like brothers.”
&gt;
&gt; Fuelled by resentment against native Swedes, some go into town on a Friday or Saturday night to indulge in a little light mugging of what they call “the Svens”. The police think only about 150 youths are involved. At least these youngsters speak Swedish. For their parents, it can be much harder. Cushioned by social security but imprisoned by linguistic inadequacy, many of the unemployed hardly go out. The migrants are here physically, but many have not made the mental leap.
&gt;
&gt; “It’s OK here,” says Nihad’s father, Sala, who still works in Turkey. “But it’s cold, and it’s not home. Nihad, though, he has more chance.”

Now the other model of immigration would be the US one. Immigrants tend to need to find jobs to be able to get in because benefits are not so generous. They tend to melt into the local population and there is no great problem culturally. Vietnamese and Chinese people don't have as high a cultural barrier in integrating into Vancouver as Muslims do into Scandinavia.

I.e. if you let people in to work, you will have no problem. If you let people in as refugees and let them live on benefits you will have a huge problem.

&gt; I don't think that's a problem with the population being too foreign, it's not like the kids are talking in Arabic at his school. Kid just dosen't know how to make friends, maybe he has assburgers?

Let's see we have two competing theories here - one is that the kid has ""assburgers"" and won't make friends anywhere. Another is that he would make friends if he was in a school with people that were more like him culturally. Luckily we have an experiment at the end where he changes schools that should let us know which theory is correct.",True,False,,RabidRaccoon,0,0

Yes, it is.

Throughout the western world, fundamental liberties are being violated. Each incident, taken by itself, isn't all that bad. Together, they add up to something that is rapidly approaching the infrastructure for a police state.

Most of these things are currently only being used in a few western countries. But we know that it's only a matter of time before their ""success"" is cited to implement them in other nations, and taken together, they're really quite bad.

Imagine a single society that has all the following:

* The TSA (USA)

* No-fly lists (USA)

* Biometric passports (most of the western world)

* A national fingerprint database (The Netherlands)

* Cities with tens of thousands of cameras (the UK)

* Facial recognition on CCTV systems (the UK)

* Mandatory carrying/showing of proof of ID (The Netherlands)

* Arbitrary preventative patdowns (The Netherlands)

* Logging and storing the logs of all internet traffic (the EU)

* Website blacklists (several countries)

* ""Three strikes"" laws for copyright infringement (France)

etc.

Now, move a few years into the future: 

Everywhere you go, you're being watched by cameras, which identify you wherever you go through the data gathered when you got your mandatory ID card. All your movements are logged. At any point, a police officer can stop you, require you to show ID and give you a patdown.

Everything you do online is logged, stored and linked to all your other activities, such as your real-life travel, your shopping patterns, etc. Trying to use blocked websites or trying to circumvent the system may get you added to no-fly lists or have you be subjected to random searches.

When a Christian army failed, not always, but usually, would say ""Well, we must develop new technologies or strategies next time.""

This explains how Muslims were the inventors of heavy artillery guns, torpedo-like floating bombs and chemical weapons. In fact at those times, Muslims were like both the US and EU combined, the were the owners of the ""Lockheed Martin"" of the middle ages. The were the ones who invented money transfer and draft checks. They were also the ones who invented Algebra, Algorithms and enriched the greek geometric theories. They were the ones who invented the cam-shaft, explained how vision and eye-sight worked in a dark room called ""Qomra"" of which the word camera is derived. They had the first 3 successful flying attempts way before The Wright brothers' great grandfather was born. ALL this, because they stopped innovation and cared more about praying, thats what you think right?

There is a common misconception that the governments of the Muslim countries nowadays are more religious than they should be, and that why they r not developing... but the reality is that they r as far off religion as the sky is off the earth; in fact, they suppress any form of religion even though they pretend to follow it. Islam encourages science and discovery, unlike Christianity in its heart; thats why early Muslims who were much more religious than present ones were much more advanced.

On a political side note; the first Civil-rights constitutional state in the world was the one built by Muhammad in Medina in the 7th century AD. You should also consider reading about how ""Wahabism"", which is the most backwards form of Islamic faith, is actually a production of ""Mr. Hempher"" a famous British spy who had no ties with Islam whatsoever.

The real WTF is we've been through all this before.  When wikileaks published all that Iraq war information, they tried to smear him, but then [dropped all the charges back in August](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/abraham/detail?entry_id=70624).

So we don't hear anything about it, and then THIS leak breaks, and NOW suddenly they want him back for the same charges they already decided were invalid.  Except they aren't actually charging him -- they just want him physically in their clutches.

&gt; Despite his right to silence, my client has repeatedly offered to be interviewed, first in Sweden before he left, and then subsequently in the UK (including at the Swedish Embassy), either in person or by telephone, videoconferencing or email and he has also offered to make a sworn statement on affidavit. All of these offers have been flatly refused by a prosecutor who is abusing her powers by insisting that he return to Sweden at his own expense to be subjected to another media circus that she will orchestrate. Pursuing a warrant in this circumstance is entirely unnecessary and disproportionate. This action is in contravention both of European Conventions and makes a mockery of arrangements between Sweden and the United Kingdom designed to deal with just such situations. This behavior is not a prosecution, but a persecution. Before leaving Sweden Mr. Assange asked to be interviewed by the prosecution on several occasions in relation to the allegations, staying over a month in Stockholm, at considerable expense and despite many engagements elsewhere, in order to clear his name. Eventually the prosecution told his Swedish lawyer Bjorn Hurtig that he was free to leave the country, without interview, which he did.

&gt; Urbanization on an extraordinary scale is happening in Asia, whose megalopolises are absorbing millions of new residents every year. Perhaps surprisingly, the character of these rapidly expanding cities reflects less their regions' local traditions than the political conditions under which they have grown.
&gt;
&gt; One finds the most striking evidence of how politics shapes the new Asian megalopolises in the differences between Seoul, South Korea's capital, and China's leading cities. The Korean and Chinese cultures are similar. Both are founded on the hierarchical Confucian philosophy; both have been influenced by Buddhism. But Seoul is democratic. China's cities, by contrast, reflect the autocratic and corrupt rule of the Communist Party.
&gt;
&gt; The authoritarian Communist regime shapes China's capital city. Travelers to Beijing should not expect to find any traces of the ancient and beautiful imperial capital, whose debasement began immediately after the Communist revolution. In October 1949, from Tiananmen, the monumental gate leading to the imperial palace, Mao Zedong proclaimed the ""liberation"" of China and demanded that factory chimneys replace pagodas and temples. About 1,000 religious buildings, many of them hundreds of years old, were soon destroyed or transformed into belching factories. By the early 1960s, Beijing looked more like mid-nineteenth-century Birmingham than like the capital that European travelers had once nicknamed the ""Holy City."" 
&gt;
&gt; In 1979, the Communist regime inaugurated a new era of reforms designed to bring China into the global economy. But the reformers also completed Mao's destruction of old Beijing. The old city was a maze of neighborhoods made up of one-story houses built around square inner courts and separated by narrow lanes, or hutongs. These traditional neighborhoods could have been saved or modernized, but the reformers razed them in the name of hygiene (the official motive) and real-estate speculation (the real motive), erecting huge office towers in their stead. The government is now rebuilding a few of the original hutongs, characteristically seeking to please tourists in search of the authentic Beijing.
&gt;
&gt; Hoping to improve its undistinguished and often ugly cityscape before the 2008 Olympics, Beijing officials brought in some big-name architects from around the globe. The Netherlands' Rem Koolhaas designed a new office for China Central Television; the Swiss firm Herzog and de Meuron constructed an Olympic stadium (the Bird's Nest); the Frenchman Paul Andreu produced an opera hall, the National Grand Theater. Yet the buildings could stand anywhere in the world and bear no relation to China's culture or traditions. These expensive international trophies are absurdly underused. The Beijing opera currently has no program and the Olympic stadium has idled since the end of the games.
&gt;
&gt; Seoul, only two hours by plane from Beijing, was also an imperial city until Japan conquered it in 1910. Not much remains of the old Seoul, either, though what destroyed it was not revolution but the Korean War. The former king's palace and its extraordinary gardens survived, as did the city hall and the railway station, built in the Japanese ""imperial"" style of the twenties. Little else escaped intact.
&gt;
&gt; Old Seoul was located north of the Han River; the modern city has expanded to the southern side as well. Since the war ended, Koreans by the millions have flooded from the countryside into the city. The authoritarian South Korean governments of the 1960s and '70s, free-market and growth-oriented, welcomed this vast group of peasants seeking work, as did the big conglomerates—the chaebols.
&gt;
&gt; After three decades of spectacular economic growth under the rule of generals, South Koreans started looking for a better life. In 1987, civil demonstrations forced the military out of power, and democracy swept the country at both the local and national levels. Today, Seoulites elect their mayor, city council members, and 25 district mayors. Since June 2010, a conservative, Oh Seoon, has held the Seoul mayoralty, while the Left dominates the city council.
&gt;
&gt; Democratization has helped transform Seoul into a more livable city in an extraordinarily short time. Before democracy, the authorities pursued economic growth at virtually any cost: real estate operated with little constraint, the number of private cars swiftly exceeded street capacity, public transportation was shoddy, and public spaces were basically nonexistent. But Seoul's mayor during the 2000s, Lee Myung-bak—formerly the CEO of the Hyundai Construction Company—understood that Seoulites wanted a city center, plazas, gardens and spaces to shop and stroll, and he led a dramatic reshaping of the city, preserving what was left of the past but making huge improvements in urban amenities. He won the nickname ""Bulldozer"" for good reason. Popular changes helped propel him to the South Korean presidency in December 2007.
&gt;
&gt; With Seoul's population burgeoning and the city limits restrained by geography, where to put everyone? Mayor Oh's partial solution: skyscrapers. Tall buildings are everywhere these days, but what Mr. Oh envisions for Seoul is nevertheless unprecedented: several huge towers that would effectively be vertical towns. Three of these tower projects are currently planned for Seoul, with one, ""Seoul Lite,"" already under construction. Seoul Lite will be 2,000 feet tall, with 133 floors; it will hold condos, a luxury hotel, office space, malls, concert halls, schools, health-care facilities and other services, all in one building. About 20,000 people are expected to live permanently in the tower, with as many as 50,000 occupying it during the workday.
&gt;
&gt; These towers aren't the mayor's utopian dream but private business ventures, driven and managed by chaebols. Seoul Lite is a Daewoo project; another tower, south of the Han, has been proposed by the Lotte real-estate firm; and Samsung wants to build a cluster of tall buildings, with Daniel Libeskind as lead architect. 
&gt;
&gt; Will the towers and sky trains actually materialize? The Korean opposition on the left generally isn't enamored with any chaebol enterprise. But as Mr. Oh observes, ""eventually, the market will decide."" If Seoul does opt for the skyscrapers, he believes, the city could become a model for the booming megalopolises of the developing world.
&gt;
&gt; The firms behind Seoul's proposed towers would like to replicate their dream globally. A vision of São Paulo's or Jakarta's citizens driving Hyundais, watching news broadcasts at traffic lights on Samsung smartphones, and on their way home to Korean-built sky towers is typically Korean in 2010. And it is the ambition of free citizens.

If you want to point to former Soviet countries as ""racially pure"" societies that nevertheless suffer from high crime rates, then I would say that having been subject to rule from outside would more than negate the benefits of a close-knit, homogeneous society. Same goes for Africa; having been subject to invasion from Arabs and imperial abuses from Europeans for hundreds of years, it's no surprise what condition the continent is in. Now, if you point to some corner of Africa that has been somehow untouched by outside (multicultural) hands, then I would have to admit ignorance of why they have a high rate of crime (assuming they do).

My point is not that racial mixture ALONE will lead to higher rates of crime, but that it leads to an increased strain on society and, unless VERY carefully handled, does more harm than good to a society. But in terms of crime, it is one aspect amongst many.",True,False,,whathole,0,0

That's a snapshot of only one component - and not enough to determine the 'winner'. I've already provided several others which I won't repeat again.

&gt; It's a concept that is incredibly important even if you're just comparing different forms of renewable energy.

It's not as important as many think - and certainly not the only one, although I understand why it looks so persuasive to people who haven't read widely on the subject.

&gt; The only way in which the historical curve of technological investment matters is in how it affects future learning-curve trends. 

Nope. 200+ years of investment and deployment of fossils has created a global infrastructure that gives fossil an embedded advantage. Similar for nukes. And yet both still receive massive subsidies. Renewables are just getting started and need the playing field levelled in order to compete.

&gt; In other words, how much less will a solar panel cost 20 years from now? 

It's going down. That's an absolute certainty. The efficiency is going up. And the capital cost today is not the only factor that determines solar's viability. Again: you cannot put nukes on your roof or in a remote village in Africa.

&gt; ...not cost after research hurdles have been met decades down the line.

Not research is needed for solar to work today. Deployment will drive down costs further and improve the technology.

&gt; Capital cost - Financing is included in cost per MWh.

You're missing the point. I could build a wind farm for $100 million and have it grid connected in a year or two. Then I could do another. Same for solar plant. Or I could do like Germany and have a continuous stream of deployment on the roofs of every house in the country.

I'd need $10 or $20 billion and 10+ years for a nuke - with a high chance of project failure in a market where energy costs are falling for renewables. By the time it's complete it might be *very* uncompetitive. These are some of the reasons nukes are not being built.

&gt; Most renewables aren't generated at the point of consumption. 

But they can be and they are. See wind in Denmark. See solar in Germany. Nukes cannot - and offer large, single points of failure.

&gt; The smart grid concept involves sharing power across a wider area 

Yes, it's needed - and another selling point for renewable - a much more stable, resilient grid with millions of energy generators.

&gt; ...if I invest $10 billion dollars into solar thermal power today...

But that's not how it works. You invest $100 million and have a power plant online within a couple of years. The next plant will cost less and be completed more quickly. Or mandate a FIT scheme and MWs a day can be connected on thousands of roofs - with all the economic benefits that brings in terms of employment (see Germany).

&gt; At the end-of-life for a given plant, how much energy did my money get me?

Hopefully you can now see that is not the only or necessarily most important factor.

&gt; Wind produces cheaper power than solar, so wind gets developed more heavily.

In most places, yes. So install wind. But you can still do both and take the long-term view and invest in the infrastructure to compete in a market that is forecast to grow massively over the next decade - see Germany, see China.

&gt; Once you understand why energy costs are important...

Once you understand that snapshot $ / kWh costs - often based on historic numbers and estimates - are not the only or necessarily most important factor, you will realise why renewables are being deployed everywhere and nuclear is not. That trend will continue and accelerate as renewables fall further in cost.

You'll also understand why there are projections, such as: European Commission report projects that 41% of all energy installations in the next 20 years will be wind. Another 23% will come from other renewables like solar, biomass and hydro. 17% of new capacity to come from gas, 12% from coal, 4% from nuclear and 3% from oil. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/09/wind-and-solar-the-action-continues?cmpid=rss

Remember, Ireland had just been at war with Britain. The Old IRA (not to be confused with the modern terrorist organization of the same name), who had won that battle with Britain, were very much on the Germans side to the point of engaging in joint operations with them. 

&gt; Former Old IRA commander and founder of the Fine Gael Party General Eoin O'Duffy became a leader of the fascist Blueshirt organisation in 1932-33.[5] He was active in creating links between the IRA and German Nazi politicians. The pro-Nazi sympathies and anti-semitism of some Irish politicians during WW2 were once airbrushed from history, but Ireland is now beginning to acknowledge them.[6][7] In this context, it is relevant to note that two Irish contingents fought in the 1937 Spanish Civil War – but on opposing sides. O'Duffy's pro-Nationalist (Fascist) Irish Brigade fought with the Nationalists and the pro-Republican Irish contingent of the International Brigades fought with the Republicans, though neither had government support.

&gt; In the six months prior to the onset of war there had been an escalation of Irish Republican Army violence and a bombing campaign in Britain under the new leadership of Seán Russell. De Valera, who had tolerated the IRA as recently as 1936, responded with the Offences against the State Act, 1939. Upon the outbreak of the main conflict in September, subversive activity was regarded as endangering the security of the state. There were fears that the United Kingdom, eager to secure Irish ports for their air and naval forces, might use the attacks as a pretext for an invasion of Ireland and a forcible seizure of the assets in question. Furthermore, the possibility that the IRA (in line with the Irish nationalist tradition of courting allies in Europe) might link up with German agents, thereby compromising Irish non-involvement, was considered.[citation needed]

&gt; This threat was real: Russell, upon the outbreak of war, travelled to Berlin in order to press for troops and arms to be sent to Ireland.[8] In response, many German agents were parachuted into neutral Ireland. [citation needed]

There's a huge difference between having breed papers and being well bred. Animal shelters play a part in promoting the short sighted attitude toward dogs that has seen the diligent work of generations to produce great dogs be pissed away for designer knock off society.

Yes a great dog will have inbreeding in its background, but to focus the genetics rather than to produce as many similar looking dogs as possible. There's even a mathematical formula to calculate it called the percentage of inbreeding.

Animal shelters promote this short sighted view by providing a place to dump last season's breed and make people feel heroic for ""saving"" a dog when if they're honest, it's the dog who is saving you.

It used to be that when you owned a dog you felt a responsibility not just for the dog, but the breed. Now, most people can't keep just one dog for its lifespan.

Anyway, if your thinking of getting a new pet, curb your impulsiveness for the sake of the dog and wait until after the holidays. It's going to be crazy enough around your home with the holidays that you don't need to throw a new dog in the mix. Why set your new dog and yourself up to fail? 

If you're going to get a dog, do it right. Take your time to figure out what you're getting into and how you are going to do it for the dog, not your ego. I'm not expecting you learn the complex maths behind genetics, but do the numbers and realise that the price you pay for the dog is insignificant compared to the money you will shell out over the life of the animal. So do it right.

In the long run, it's cheaper to pay a few grand for a well bred dog than to cheap out on an impulse to get the latest popular ""send your vet's family on a European vacation"" breed or ""rescue"" someone else's mistake.

Thinking about it, you should start shopping for a vet before you even think about getting a dog. Having a good relationship with a trustworthy vet can save you a lot of money and heartache by helping guide you to the right dog and getting sound advice on how to best develop a healthy relationship with your animal. 

Dollars to donuts, no vet worth his degree would advise you to get a new dog for the holidays whether it be a mutt or an outstanding Lurcher from some wisened Irish Traveller.",True,False,,presidentGore,0,0

That is the core of why I think LoL has done the ""free to play"" thing best out of all other companies. With other such games, paying customers actually get some sort of advantage.

I practically own every champ i have an interest in playing, and about all the runesets I would like to own. Currently I have 5 runepages, and I would like to add to these.

All of the above i bought with IP. Not just because I didn't want to spend money on it, but because only after I had become level 25 or so did I find out there were seperate EU servers for LoL. (I'm from Europe)

So I didn't want to invest on the US account as I thought I would soon start on the EU servers for the lower latencies... but I just kind of delayed that indefinitely.

Now that I started from scratch on EU servers, I kind of remember how time consuming it is to get all of this stuff, but *again*, I really wouldn't say that people who spend reasonable amount of money on this stuff have any advantage over me. It is time consuming for them too.

When a Christian army failed, not always, but usually, would say ""Well, we must develop new technologies or strategies next time."" That is why the Ottoman Empire failed. That is why the Islamic golden age did not last long.""

1000% incorrect.  The Ottomans were known as the ""Empire of Difference"" expressly because different ethnicities and religions were tolerated much more fully than in other areas.  Until 1850, the majority of the Empire wasn't even Muslim!  

The Ottomans fell because they began emulating western imperialism.  Once they tried to apply European models to their tax law (by unifying religiously and under an ""Ottoman"" banner) they ended up riling up the many fringe groups in the Empire that valued their native identity (and personal wealth) over the protection of an old label.  Europe fueled nationalist movements in Ottoman and offered protection comparable to that offered by the Ottomans.  Outside western imperialism cannibalized the Ottomans and forced an increasingly extreme reaction towards Muslim ""Ottoman"" exclusivity.

Ottomans fell because they tried to become Europe, got into bankrupting debt as a result, separatist movements created by the new Ottoman ""unification"" attempt were egged on by Europe, THEN an extremely exclusive Muslim identity emerged (mainly only because there was no Muslim empire trying to lure away Ottoman separatists).

One caveat, before everyone responds and distorts it: Islam was the favored religion in the Ottoman Empire, though the small taxes other religions had to pay to freely practice their religion were negligible compared to the steady streams of oppression and outright genocides committed in other areas in the name of Christianity.  It acted as a recruiting tool (protection by new invaders vs almost certain death and torture) as well as a convenient taxing mechanism (again, less than half the empire was Muslim until 1850).

This is intuitive, but is it really true? Can we say that this rule applies to everything? Does this include god?

&gt; The Universe began to exist. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

Did god ever begin to exist? What caused god? Does god exist outside of the universe? If so, what created that? Is the thing that created that place greater than god? Is it just gods creating universes with other gods inside them forever?

&gt; basically you must have as much faith in that as you would a creator.

Nope. Science tests against claims. If we took the big bang as a matter of faith, then how do you explain [this?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)

What is religion's ""LHC""? Has any church ever banked billions of dollars and hired thousands of people to test against their claims?

&gt; Basically, how would you defend against this syllogism? to me it seems irrefutable with science.

You are doing it wrong. It isn't your job to refute every claim. The burden of proof rests upon the person making the claim in the first place. It's perfectly okay to say ""I don't know, we're still working on it."" when being asked questions like:

""Where did all of the matter and energy in the universe come from?"" 

""What is stuff made of? And what stuff is that stuff made of? And that stuff? etc.""

""What triggered the big bang?""

""Was there something prior to that event?""

Here's the thing about the cosmological argument: It's just the classic use of god as a place holder for things science doesn't yet explain thoroughly. Think of all of the supernatural explanations that have been used over the last couple thousand years of human civilization. How many of those supernatural claims stand well against our current body of scientific knowledge?

Can you think of any well-establish science that was later proven incorrect by supernatural evidence?

It's even worse than that though, because the cosmological argument doesn't have any way to ""pin the tale on the donkey"". Even if we were to discover that some ""thing"" caused the big bang and was the source of its energy and matter, what does that have to do with the Christian God? How could you possibly assign that particular god to this first cause without first considering all of the other gods? Maybe it was Apollo, Athena, Zeus, Hercules, Vishnu, Krishna, Thor, Xenu, or a Flying Spaghetti Monster? Saying that a god did something isn't a useful answer to big questions, it's just an excuse to not look any further, to ease your natural sense of curiosity.

Fuck that, I say. We have every right to investigate claims without apologizing for the knowledge that we gain.

&gt; if there are objective morals,

Let's stop right there. Who defines morals? Do morals exist in the absence of humans? What characteristics and standards can we agree upon to establish ""objective morals""? This term I'd argue is meaningless or subjective at best, let's move on.

&gt; there is a moral law there are objective morals therefore there is a moral law
if there is a moral law, there must be a moral law giver there is a moral law therefore there must be a moral law giver.

Huh?

Does your god endorse good morals because they are good? Or are the morals only good because your god endorses them?

For example, if your god were to endorse raping children (Catholic church, I'm looking at you...), would that act then become morally good? If the answer is no, then it must mean that your god only endorses the morals that are good independently of what your god favors. But if that is the case then morals are not classified as either good or bad by your god, but by their own merits.

This is easy... what else do you have?

&gt; through the KCA an uncaused cause is necessary. since that uncaused cause cannot be natural due to definition, it must be supernatural

Why? Who says that just because we observe something that is contrary to what we thought previously we must somehow assume that it is supernatural? When we broke the sound barrier for the first time, did we need to decide what god was responsible, or did we just determine that physics allowed for this barrier to be broken?

&gt; Some may ask, ""But who created God?"" The answer is that by definition He is not created;

Who's definition? Who gets to define your god? What observations support this claim?

&gt; He is eternal. He is the One who brought time, space, and matter into existence.

*He* has a penis for some reason, instead of a giant cosmic vagina.

Again, without any evidence to back this up, we're just talking out of our ass. Meanwhile, [somewhere in Europe....](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40438731/ns/technology_and_science-science/)

Put up, or shut up. Where is the equivalent research into the nature of your god to test its properties? Any recent discoveries? Any?

Hello?

&gt;  The concept of causality does not apply to God since it is something related to the reality of space, time, and matter.

He has one of those hall passes that lets him go home for lunch!

Why do you think god needs so many exemptions? A few more exemptions, and you might decide that since nothing in the universe applies to god, that god doesn't apply to the universe either. Your god made a universe filled with rules, but those rules don't apply to him.
Can your god make a claim so stupid that even he can't believe in it?

&gt; By definition, the Christian God never came into existence; that is, He is the uncaused cause.

Why couldn't this be true of the universe? Why can't the universe have the same exemptions that you offer to your god? What about all of the other gods that claim the same exemptions? Is there any more evidence that your god has the exemptions, but not others?

Try typing all of your argument out again, but this time, replace the word ""God"" with ""Lord Krishna, avatar of Vishnu"" and the word ""Christian"" with ""Hindu"".

If you still cannot defeat the cosmological argument, convert to Hinduism, and start reading the Bhagavad Gita.

It is well established that sea levels rose by about 120 meters at the end of the last glacial period.  I have often wondered what the earth would look like with sea levels 120 meters lower.  (There are various web tools [plus Google Earth plugins] that let us visualize sea levels *above* those of today, but none that do the reverse.)  For example, Florida would see a huge increase in land mass, while California would see relatively little.  It is possible that the Asian continent would extend to Malaysia and even Indonesia.

The reason for my interest has to do with human civilization.  Consider:

- Humans prefer to live near the coast.  In the past this was even more important because of access to fishing and transportation.

- Known civilizations appeared on various continents independently, and without knowledge, of each other.

- The most common element of disparate mythologies is a universal flood.

- Much of the warmest coastline from the last glacial period is now deep underwater.

Taken together this makes me wonder if there were, in fact, pre-holocene civilizations that are lost to us.

Governments of Islamic countries nowadays ARE more religious than they should be. To ignore this is a complete slap in the face to most historians.

Sure many inventions were made during Islamic times. That doesn't indicate a golden age if it happened once every 50-60 years.

The main scientific discoveries and enlightenment period was before the 11th century, and it completely stopped after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century. 

The Turks took over most of the inventing after that. But even they had set backs---banishing the guy who invented flight in Turkey because ""God would not want us to fly, or he would have given us wings.""

Forbidding the development of the printing press, ""because that is the devil's work."" 

Many heavy artillery guns were invented by Europeans hired by the Turks, using technology from the Chinese. The Turks were great at buying technology, not developing it, that is what led to the downfall of the Ottomans, the ""buying of ideas, rather than developing of newer ideas."" 

You cannot ignore the fact that religion was always the ball-chain slowing down technological progress for the Ottomans and the Arabs. It was only an encouragement during the golden age, and stopped after the crusades.",True,False,,executex,0,0

The fringe groups and ethnic groups riled up because of the global rise of nationalism fostered by Western Imperialist states. National propaganda and religious preaching is what fueled nationalist movements, age-old continued religious unfairness didn't help the Ottoman Empire either.

So I agree with you on the idea that imperialism caused most of the crumbling of the empire. I don't agree that it was Ottoman reforms that caused it as you implied, there's no evidence of that. Only evidence that Ottoman lack of reform exacerbated the problem. 

They should have become Europe far earlier, their problem was a reluctance and superiority complex developed over centuries of victories. They didn't fall because they tried to become European, that is completely false.

Union Carbide placed the plant there specifically so they could reap the enormous monetary savings from not having to deal with safety regulations, and to not have to train and pay workers prevailing wages elsewhere.

Court documents indicate the Union Carbide CEO and others new EXACTLY what conditions were like at the plant. Shithead CEO Warren Anderson is still awaiting manslaughter charges in India, but America won't extradite him.

Every element, from the ‘unproven’ Alpha Napthol unit down to the MIC plant, had been designed by UCC, or else approved by design engineers in the US.

All over Europe the maximum permissible storage limit for the chemical MIC was half a ton. At the Bhopal plant, the US company’s management overrode the wishes of its local managers and kept the storage capacity hazardously high at over 90 tons. On the night of the disaster, 67 tons of MIC were stored in two tanks.

In an affidavit given to a court in Manhattan, Eduard Muñoz, who had been Union Carbide’s managing director of the Indian subsidiary, said that the Carbide engineering group responsible for designing the Bhopal plant had recommended installation of three large tanks for storing MIC (methyl isocyanate). Muñoz opposed the plan because ‘only token storage was necessary, preferably in small containers, based on economic and safety considerations.’ Munoz was overruled. According to independent experts, like the Centre for Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, the excessive volume of MIC stored in Bhopal was the most critical factor in the disaster.

Safety audits at the Bhopal plant were performed by UCC’s American engineers and after a 1981 phosgene leak killed a worker, Ashraf Khan, it was the management committee in New York who decided what should be done. A ‘business confidential’ safety audit in May 1982, identified 61 hazards, 30 of them major and 11 in the dangerous phosgene/MIC units.

**As a result safety measures were improved at Union Carbide’s MIC plant in West Virginia but not Bhopal.**

In February 1984, a safety audit of the West Virginia plant raised major concerns that a runaway reaction could occur in one of the MIC Unit storage tanks, and that there would be no way to prevent catastrophic failure of the tank. **The warning was not passed on to Bhopal.**

You are simply exaggerating the more Christian-centric nations at the time. This was not true of England. But it may have been true for Spain or the Roman Empire. Once again you are ignoring the fact that this was a universal attitude of Islam, not just centered to specific Islamic rulers. This is also why they avoided the printing press for so long, because the emperor thought it could be the devil's work.

You cannot claim that Christian Europe was divided into several nations while in the same breath asserting the Caliphate was the sole, unifying power of the Islamic world. On paper this may be true, but in reality the Caliph only had nominal control over many regions. Many emirs merely paid the Caliph lip service while largely ignoring his authority. In many parts of the Islamic world the Caliph was not an authority figure. You are very persistent in generalizing the Islamic Caliphate while insisting Christian Europe cannot be generalized.

&gt;Being on the internet, it's easy to attack and criticize historians like Bernard Lewis, who've been researching these empires for decades. But you haven't seen the many archives he's spent years in.

Being on the internet, it's easy to attack and criticize historians like Edward Said, who've been researching these empires for decades. But you haven't seen the many archives he's been in. 

In fact, I'm very amused by your worship of Lewis while at the same time discrediting his critics. You can't have your cake and eat it too. 

&gt;Your same arguments were made during the 1930s of the Great Depression, and the same arguments were made during the 1970s oil crises, and the same arguments during the 1980s. Predictions are not scientific or intellectual, they are for fortune tellers and lunatics like Nostradamus. An economic recession does not equate to a decline of a civilization.

Of course not. There are many, many factors that are signs of decline within an empire or civilization. A single example does not mean the end is nigh. To ignore history, though, is dangerous. The U.S. exhibits many markers of an empire in decline. You can dismiss this claim, but it's not fear mongering. These are the facts of the situation.

&gt;And you make this prediction, knowing that if we last another 50 years, you'll say ""Well, I didn't mean the decline would happen overnight."" If we last another 100 years, ""Well, sometimes declines last hundreds of years."" If we last another 500 years, ""Well, we recovered a bit thanks to my fear mongering."" I didn't say or imply it was going to last forever. You implied that it was going to end, in an urgent sense, like within the next 20 years. That was delusional and a leap of logic.

You seem to be deathly afraid of decline while I merely claim there is a decline without any injection of emotion. European civilization has declined, yet things are going quite swimmingly for them.

It's been 10 years now, I've gone from being a depressed anti social high school kid with no plans to being an anti-social adult with hopes and dreams. I'm top brain in an extremely high level of tech support (people pay me extra to figure out non company problems, although I don't like taking their money to do it) :(

I used to grind my teeth, cry alot, and would have killed myself if I had stronger willpower (had a crazy parent, was raised to be extremely self critical and strive to work really hard following guidelines people always told me I should). Then I got high, people started to be able to spend time around me without me pushing them away. I made friends, lost weight, got laid when I wanted too, and lived my next ten years in sweet fuckin bliss.

I've been their awhile, and now I've started looking at the other things people tell me with a new eye, and I wonder how much of my life and my potential I have wasted because of the values I grew up with.....

Recently kicked weed to help me kick cigarettes, and work on my diet (getting older and getting fat again :) still cant shake the cigs, much more addicting).


WARNING: THIS COMMENT DEGRADES INTO A SHAMELESS RANT FROM THIS POINT ON, BUT I ENJOYED IT AND FOUND IT THERAPEUTIC SO FUCK YALL :D (sent that reader a smiley, readers love smileys{this feels so good to express that I'm getting giddy})

Other lies I feel have hurt me. Ive spent months now trying to learn where I was wrong (this is what brought me to reddit).

How about American dietary science? Heart disease, obesity, and diabetes run rampant in our country, but it must all be from sedentary lifestyles huh? I mean, our ancestors were so health conscious, they ate mostly vegetables and did several hours cardio every day, with perfect hygiene to boot. I definitely feel the guilt reaction when the doctors who advise the population tell me I'm a shitty lazy person who should be ashamed and work harder. Fuck you. I spent 5 years washing streets for a living, I'm always moving furniture or fixing a car or something, If working a 5.5 hour shift moving loads of cargo at FedEx (eating 1000 calories of mostly carbohydrates.) cant make me lose weight, somebodies lying to me. I hurt all the time all over from trying to do what they told me would make me a better happier healthier person.

Surely its not the carb/fat/protein ratios we've been told to eat since 1955. Surely fat and cholesterol are what makes us fat and clogs our arteries with cholesterol. It cant be the fact that were spiking our blood sugar with high percentages of highly processed carbohydrates we were never evolved to metabollically process. (4 days into an Atkins diet (kicked weed at the same time) {later shifting to lifelong hypoglycemic diet, and lots of tasty buds to keep me calm}, kicking carbs was like kicking drugs. Now that the headaches and hot flashes are gone I feel great, and have to force myself to eat enough to keep my metabolism burning hot.{of course it's only been a few days, long term results may vary})

How about America the great, where we're all so strong and great. And everybody Loves us. Fuck you again. We spend our lives Idolizing the people we wish we could be, so we can be independently wealthy, perfect, and always happy. You know why video games are so popular here? cause we all have to spend high percentages of our time escaping ourselves or we'll go nuts. We have been trained to react with hostility if anyone mentions a form of government or organization that give's a voice and validity to people who work for a living. Every other country in the western world has political parties and organizations that protect the rights of the masses, and have a much higher standard of living than us. 

I mentioned considering moving to Europe to my grandparents and they thought I would be throwing myself to the dogs. They voted republican of course, thinking that we need to give money to the rich so they can protect themselves from having to give to the poor( If you think the republican party is trying to protect you from big government and socialism, your a fucking idiot; we've been social animals since before we were human, and the reason a rich powerful man wants a smaller government is because it increases his own power over the powerless {btw most people I speak to who are against social support have claimed unemployment, government college credits, and bought a house so they could get that nice homebuyer's credit}). 

BUT

I believe these things are coming to a head, and people won't stand by much longer (see the youtube video commented on here today where a soccer stadium mobs a group of security guards who beat a protester they have pinned to the ground, It gives me hope.)

I hope it will either get better or worse, and that right soon. If it gets worse I'm emigrating out of America (think ill cross the mexico border going the other way and fly out from their, seems nicely ironic.) ",True,False,,SheffLord,0,0

Trinidad was probably the hottest world cup before this, and the average summer temperatures are no where close to the average temperatures for Qatar.

The decision to hold the world cup in Qatar was political, and I am ashamed of FIFA for doing that. Sure, they want to diversify the faces that are seen in the footballing world. I just don't think putting players' health at risk is the right way to do it. The europeans are just going to melt in the heat lol

Having said that, the UAE (similar temperatures to Qatar) regularly host countries like South Africa and Australia during cricket tournaments. Not to mention their domestic football leagues, international football matches. Fun fact: Foreign players like Gabriel Batistuta, Fernando Hierro and Romario have played in Qatar before.

In terms of security, holding a world cup in South Korea or South Africa is almost the same as holding a world cup in Qatar. South Africa has a lot of domestic problems, ad South Korea is more politically unstable. Also, for those that recognise the fact that people put aside most of their differences during a football match (evidence: I think it was in Nigeria that they agreed to a cease-fire because they wanted to see Pele play.

I guess.. the Turks WERE and still ARE mostly Muslims. I never referred to Arabs in my comments.

&gt;banishing the guy who invented flight in Turkey

The first recorded flight attempt by any Muslim was made by Abbas Qasim Ibn Firnas (Armen Firman) who was an Andalusian. This man made 2 flight attempts in his life that were almost 40 years apart. The ""guy"" you r speaking about however was Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi. in the writings of Evliyâ Çelebi: he said ""First he practiced by flying over the pulpit of Okmeydani eight or nine times with eagle wings, using the force of the wind. Then, as Sultan Murad Khan (Murad IV) was watching from the Sinan Pasha mansion at Sarayburnu, he flew from the very top of the Galata Tower and landed in the Doğancılar square in Üsküdar, with the help of the south-west wind. Then Murad Khan granted him a sack of golden coins, and said: 'This is a scary man. He is capable of doing anything he wishes. It is not right to keep such people,' and thus sent him to Algeria on exile. He died there"". This says that it had nothing to do with the ""God would not want us to fly, or he would have given us wings."" nonsense you mentioned.

&gt;Many heavy artillery guns were invented by Europeans hired by the Turks, using technology from the Chinese

According to Guinness book of world records: The world's oldest dated cannon in existence, is the Dardanelles Gun, cast in 1464 for Sultan Mehmet II in Turkey. It is made from bronze, weighs 16.8 tonnes (37,037 lb), measures 5.2 m long (17 ft) and had a range of 1,600 m (5,249 ft) when firing a 600-mm diameter, 304-kg (670-lb) projectile. The bombard is currently on display at the Royal Armouries, Fort Nelson, Hampshire, UK. 

Hasan al-Rammah, was another Muslim Engineer who wrote a book called ""Kitabul Furusiya wal-Muhaseb El Harbiya"" around 1275 AD, on battle techniques and weapon development. This included designs of rocket systems and torpedo-like bombs. Also, as mentioned in [this paper](http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/rocket_technology_in_turkish_history1.pdf), ""Still, it is understood from the following information, again from old Chinese sources dating back to the Kubilay Khan era, that the Turkic-Islamic world was more advanced than China in manufacturing explosive materials and ballistic weapons. Between 1271 and 1273, Kubilay Khan had requested Abaka Khan (Chinese transcription Apu-ko wang) to send Muslim engineers in order for his own army to win during the siege of the Chinese cities Hangshow and Hsiang-yang. Again according to Chinese sources, Abaka Khan sent two Muslim engineers, Alaaddin and Ismail, from Turkestan. It is obvious that these engineers, who were Muslims and from Turkestan, are Turks. These two Turk Muslim engineers built machines of a ballistic-weapons nature before the besieged city of Hang-show. I don't see the ""European/Chinese Innovation factor"" in any of this.

&gt;and it completely stopped after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century

Yes a big dip of civilization happened after the Mongols attacked the Muslim states, but innovation never stopped at that point. The reason for this dip was mainly because the Mongols demolished Baghdad and its library, and made bridges on the Euphrates by its books. Baghdad was one of the major centers in Islamic civilization but it wasn't the only one, there was also Andalusia, Cairo and the West-Arab lands in Africa. You should not also forget that the Mongols were a threat to all form of urban/civil life, and if it wasn't for the Muslim soldiers lead by the Egyptian Sultan, they would've take over everything civic in this world.

&gt;Governments of Islamic countries nowadays ARE more religious than they should be.

You mean in Saudi Arabia where the princes dry the people off their livings and go spend the money on hookers, or in Iran where they bow for a single man neglecting the basic form of real Islamic principle which is ""bow for no one other than God"". Or maybe you meant the Alawites (NON-MUSLIMS) who run Syria, and who exterminated a whole town that saw a rise of Islamic politics. The core of Islam is fairness, and whole jurisprudence in Islam goes around this concept. If Islam was really implemented by any of the Muslim governments, none of them would be called ""Dictatorships"". You want a real example; Malaysia is the most advanced Muslim country there is right now, and they are the ONLY truly RELIGIOUS.",True,False,,engai,0,0

&gt;FIFA's vision is about a global game, about taking the game to everybody -- that was shown by Sepp Blatter's determination to take 2010 to South Africa. If it is serious, Zidane said, it must come to Qatar. It must come to the Middle East for the first time, to the Islamic world.
Because of FIFA's decision to rotate by region, Qatar's bid also looks stronger than it might and its flaws look weaker, less exposed by powerful rivals. 2010 was in Africa, 2014 will be in South America (Brazil), 2018 in Europe (England, Spain/Portugal, Belgium/Holland, and Russia are theoretically bidding for 2018 and 2022 together but they will in principle only be considered for 2018). 2022 is between South Korea, the USA, Japan, Qatar and Australia. In terms of footballing heritage, Qatar is up against countries that have more history than they do but it is not up against a country like Argentina or Italy or Cameroon.
On the face of it, there are other advantages. Japan and Korea had the 2002 tournament; 2022 is largely considered too soon. The U.S. had 1994. That is also is too soon for some. And others within FIFA, obsessed with footballing legacies and a genuine need to ""break"" a territory feel that the take-off that USA94 promised has still not truly happened. Qatar, the Middle East, has never had the tournament. And the No. 1 sport in the Middle East, in terms of spectators at least, genuinely is soccer.

I would aim for the East Coast of North America where I would attempt to bring all of the tribes together as a weak federal Pastafarian Republic.  I would unify the languages and write a strong, peaceful constitution with equal rights and literacy for all, to keep the tribes from fighting amongst themselves and would predict the arrival of whitey in 3,800 moons and draw pictures of their boats.  It would be ingrained in each and every Native American that whitey's are savages and are only coming there to steal their gold, women and maize.

Once it was established, we would expand into South America and the Caribbean islands, Hispaniola first!  I would instruct them to build a large, white cross on the coast of Hispaniola where Columbus will land.  Once he lands, they will declare Columbus the Messiah and crucify him on the spot.

Also. The thing is, while Europe was stuck in the Dark Ages, burning everyone who was weird, Arabic society was flourishing, with advancements in literature, science, math, art, and so on. Islam supported this process, because in the beginning, seeking new knowledge was not seen as conflicting with religious teachings. And 500 years later, when Europe was finally getting around to science, everyone who came up with anything that would have changed the religious understanding of the times was ostracized, thrown in jail, burned, whatevs. Islam itself did NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, condemn advancement in the sciences-germ theory, medicinal practices, the scientific theory, etc. Not in the beginning, anyways. With the state of things now, it's the opposite. But it's important to understand that the way things are now is not the way they always have been.
Another fact about the beginnings of the spread of Islam: the Muslim armies did not vanquish all enemies and take over their culture. Quite the opposite. When Islam first began to spread, the armies did expand greatly, but part of the reason for this was their diplomacy. They gave the new people two options: either accept them as their ruling power, or be vanquished. Both options suck, obvioiusly. But here's the catch: in submitting to their rule, they could continue to live the way they had been. They paid taxes to the Muslim rulers, in exchange for the protection of the army. Sounds like a good deal to me.
It is not a fact that Muslim women cannot enter mosques.
It was not only Islam that supported slavery. The Torah and the Bible (New Testament included) both make reference to slavery, and they all implore slave owners to treat their slaves fairly. This is by NO MEANS my way of supporting the notion of slavery at all, I am merely trying to demonstrate that it was normal back then to have slaves. So you can't debase Islam for that, if it made sense in the context of the time. Also, it was not only Islam that used slaves as currency, as I'm sure you well know.

The US should NOT have gotten the WC at ALL, yes they have money and all that, but it is NOT a footballing nation, it wasn't after the '94 WC and it wouldn't have been by 2022. Qatar at least HAS a domestic league PRIOR to bidding for the WC, unlike the US in '94. Hell, the MLS didn't even start until 2 years AFTER the WC, so as far as ""Qatar's not a footballing nation!,"" shut it.

Also, the US JUST had it, so did Japan, but at least Japan brought something new to the table no one else could (3D hologram projections worldwide. It took Brazil more than 60 years to hold it again, and they're the best country in the world regarding football, yet the US deserves it again. 

The WC should also move around the WORLD, not just stay in it's rotation of Western Europe and the Americas. For those of you saying ""who's going to go there?!?"" prolly a lot more people than would've Australia, at least Qatar's next to Europe and considered a transportation hub. 

Also, England has ALWAYS had problems with FIFA, so I don't understand who's surprised about this. Ever since the first WCs, England has been at odds, hence first participation being 1966. Everything FIFA tries to implement, 5+6 rule for example, England has to argue about, come on! I'm not saying I agree with FIFA, which I do in that instance, but if you butt heads with the boss, don't expect if he passes you over. 

And lastly, Russia? What's the problem with Russia? The most money put forth, is going to build everything FROM SCRATCH, promised visa-free travel and free transportation between cities. How is that bad? The game SHOULD be hosted in Eastern Europe for the first time (since it HAS to be in Europe every other WC because if not UEFA bitches) and there's no other country better suited than Russia. And for those bitching about time zones and what not for Russia, I can assure you that the games will be held in the most important cities (as always) and will all be near each other and Europe. If Japan synchronized the games for the rest of the world, pretty sure Russia won't have a problem one bit.

All of you are forgetting what the WC is supposed to unite the world and bring the game everywhere. Would I have loved a England 2018 and a USA 2022, of course I would've, hell it would be awesome if the just had it switch between Europe and North America every year (who here thinks they would bitch if Mexico got it before the US?), but that's fucking selfish and I particularly believe it would disrespect towards what Jules Rimet wanted. Like it or not, they've replaced the Olympics as the most important sporting events, and as such, should be shared among us.

This is why it wasn't developed, because of the fear that God would not approve. Other sources confirm that he was exiled because flight is not something God would approve of. 

Just because you google'd something that doesn't say that exact reasoning, doesn't mean it isn't true.

I don't understand why you're so hostile. Many cannons were used in the Islamic empire, many of which were developed by foreigners, whether it be Chinese or European. Sure there were some who learned the trade and are Islamic engineers. It's not like I was saying Muslims are incapable of invention or engineering. I was talking about the political attitude of Islamic regimes that were careless about innovation, and this is true.

Gunpowder was invented in China, there's no way around that. Many original fire shooting weapons are from China. The Turks developed the biggest and most powerful cannons at the time, but they weren't the inventors of it.

The oldest cannon is actually Chinese in 1298. 39 years before the French bombard (which is also earlier than the 1464). 

There are carvings in Chinese caves, from 1128 of cannons.

Again this is not to say, the innovations of Turks were insignificant in cannon development. However, the Turks are famous for developing and modernizing cannons and gunpowder for warfare for the first time in Europe. They may not have been the first to use it in war, in the world.

Right the Mongols did destroy everything and would have destroyed more. But don't expect people to believe you to say that it was a golden age of Islam after the Mongol invasions. There were still periodic innovations--what culture doesn't innovate or invent for centuries at a time?

Islamic hypocrisy and misinterpretation does not indicate the governments are getting less religious. I can also cite to you many examples of extremism that have been expanding lately.

""The Albanians of Kosovo do have a very high birthrate: the highest in fact, in present day Europe. They are still a mainly agricultural society and life in the villages is strongly traditional; the tradition of huge families developed through many centuries as a response to the death of disease and blood feuds on the one hand and the general conditions of insecurity in the other. *What has happened in the 20th century is that mortality has been sharply reduced, while the tradition of large families has eroded much more slowly.""*

""In the post-WWII war years  the Albanian birthrate in Kosovo has come down from the forty six births per 1000 head of population in the early 1950s to roughly 29 in the late 1980s. What these overall figures conceal, however, that birthrates vary among the Albanians, as among any moder population, in accordance with the socioeconomic status of the mother: in 1981 rural housewives would have on average 6-7 children, but urban working women only 2.7.  *The idea that albanians breed as part of a political campaign is rather neatly disproved by this evidence,  since the urban couples are much more likely to be politicized than their counterparts in remote villages.""*

""In the 1981 census showed that a Serb woman in Kosovo would have average 3.4 children by the end of her children bearing years, while her equivalent in inner Serbia would have only 1.9. In these matters, as in many others, the Serb population in Kosovo had a traditional way of life quite similar to that of the Albanians. In the 1950s the Serbs had an equal rate to that of the Albanians, and since their mortality rate was in fact lower, their net rate of growth was actually greater (2.7 per cent growth per year,over Albanians' 2.1) ... *While Albanian women were hostile on religious and cultural grounds to abortion,  it had become an accepted part of cultural normality among the Serbs (for every 100 live births amongst Serbs, 214 were abortions.)""*

""Quite simply, Serbia had already lost Kosovo - lost it, that is, in the most basic human and demographic terms. The Serbs who lived in Kosovo remained a small minority; and the vast majority of Serbs in the rest of Serbia had no wish to go and live in this already densely inhabited territory. *The Serb birth´-rate had continued to decline during the war (when, according to one Serbian gynecologist, out of every 100 babies born in the whole of Serbia, sixty four were non-Serbs), and it was now being predicted that my the middle of the 21st century the Serbs would be a minority in the entire Serbian republic.""*

I have a few quarrels with this guy's analysis. First of all, he compares the US to the EU 15. This is kind of a foolhardy thing to do because whereas the US fiscal policy is pretty homogeneous at the national level, the EU is not. There are 15 separate fiscal policies. What this means is that the growth of some countries with significantly more liberalized economies (Czech Republic, Poland, Germany) may average out with those economies that are usually sluggish (Spain, Italy, France). 

Second, Barro says *more government consumption, faster growth*. What is his measure? GDP. What does GDP contain? Government spending. So what he is saying is that when the government spends money, GDP goes up. Well woop-tee-doo, what a finding. Lets not even get into the weak indicator that GDP can be. Spending =! growth. 

&gt;Basic science, such as the structure of the atom cannot be patented but such knowledge produces a lot of positive externalities and so is underfunded. It is the existence of such market failures that provides the economic justification for government.

A non sequitur. Who are you to decide what is and is not well funded? Second, the possible existence of a market failure does not justify government intervention. The costs of government failure far outweigh a failure in markets. As some economists say, markets fail, use markets.

&gt;If the possibility of state capture exists, then instead of spending money of private investment, individuals will spend money of lobbying which will result in an inefficient allocation of resources.

The possibility of state capture increases the larger the government becomes and the more resources it commands. So if you want to limit state capture, you need to limit the amount of control and resources the state has.

&gt;Why is this nonsense? You seem to not understand the difference between maximum growth and optimal growth. You might want to take a look at simple economic growth models such as the Solow model to understand this better.

How could you even call it maximum growth? If the US government today put everyone in the country to work to build giant pyramids, then that might provide an uptick in GDP but that cannot by any rational view be thought of as *growth*.

Let's take African-Americans for example.  Popular culture calls their race ""Black"" or ""African"" but their genes are a the most-mixed bag out there, because of miscegenation.  Their skin and facial features are ""black"", but they carry numerous European genes.

Classifying people by those terms does a disservice to their genome, basically. 

That's not to say we can't tell people apart genetically. In fact, we can tell people apart down to individual countries thanks to the fact that populations have been mostly sedentary since the Neolithic and little in-breeding has actually occurred. 

http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/11/european-population-structure-with-300k.html

So, when people say African-Americans have a higher-risk of heart-disease, it makes it sound as if the reason they have that risk is because of their skin color, and facial features, when in fact it's because they have a higher chance to carry a gene that originated in West Africa.  But that same gene can show up in a European. 

Here's a chart of genetic affinities:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Rosenberg2007.png
You can see there, that populations are really a gradient, that slowly morph into each other.

Though honestly, populations in the old-world are so unmixed, the 19th century racial classifications still pretty much work for Europe, Africa, and Asia.  Looking at the chart of genetic affinities though, it's clear that people from the sub-continent are genetically distinct from Europeans and Middle-Easterners, though they were grouped under Caucasoid in the 19th century. 

But really, for Northern India especially, skin-color based race is a joke.  I'm a light brown, my sister is a dark brown, and my brother (and a few of my cousins) is indistinguishable from an Eastern European.  So much admixture going on there. ",True,False,,jurble,0,0

I think the most influential thing you can do would be to go back to 11000 BC North America and introduce farming and how to domesticate animals to the people coming into America for the first time. The major reason why people in the Americas stayed as hunter gatherers is that they quickly killed off all the animals suitable for domestication (some people attribute this to envioremental changes, but since it also happened in places like Australia I say it's plausible that humans killed these animals off). It's thought that the reason why these people didn't domesticate animals like those living in Eurasia, is that large animals in America were not used to the presence of humans. Animals in Eurasia, on the other hand, had lived with humans for a long time, and were harder to hunt. Thus, people turned to domestication once they were advanced enough.

It's not inconceivable that North American people could end up becoming the dominating culture if they had developed farming and animal domestication at the same time as the people in Eurasia. Even the more developed cultures such as the Aztecs in South America had only developed metal tools a few centuries before the colonists started arriving from Europe, and used simple farming techniques. Had early Americans developed farming based societies like those of Eurasia, they would have attained this kind of technology much earlier. ",True,False,,[deleted],0,0

Some complains are just dumb, the weather for instance. Qatar summer is certainly very hot, probably too much for soccer games. However, the main point of their bid was their ability to cool down the stadiums so that games could be played with no dangers to the players. Reminds of how, for the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, people were complaining about the altitude (~7500 ft).

Christianity was definitely not born of tribal culture. It was a movement in a highly developed pagan culture *for* a pagan culture. It was essentially the bold claim of a self-styled prophet of approaching doomsday. That is what helped rally people around him(and later Constantine helped). The Christianity that existed post the Islamic interaction in *Europe* was of an entirely different nature. While the Romans indulged in expansion, Christianity came at a time when their power was in decline which is really an euphemism for the surrounding barbarians(around Roman territories) gaining the upper hand. The Christianity post the occupation of Spain reflects society as it existed in Islam. This is how societies affect each other.

Hinduism(as it is called today) and its sister philosophies(Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism etc) was definitely not born of a tribal culture. Whatever may the socio-economic condition be of India today, you cannot let that colour the true understanding of history. Ironically it was Islam which led to the decline(read death) of the greater Hindu kingdoms politically(from the 11th century to the 17th century)and finally Christianity(the British) which destroyed the nascent revival both militarily and economically. For individual humans 50 years is a lifetime(no 3rd world pun intended) but for civilizations it a much smaller time frame.

&gt; The thing is, while Europe was stuck in the Dark Ages, burning everyone who was weird, Arabic society was flourishing, with advancements in literature, science, math, art, and so on.
 
If you want to understand world history you must stop looking at things in retrospect. And especially not from a European perspective. I don't need to mention civilizations other that Bharat(India) and China but I will do so which also thrived and were scientifically more advanced that they are given credit for: Persians, Egyptians, Scythian and not to mention Rome. The real answer lies in understanding the success  and failure of Islam as a way of life. Islam is the most effective strategy in a state of dynamic equilibrium. The philosophy that you must fight for Allah(Jihad) and that is a life well spent(otherwise you live in poverty) works extremely well during times of war. What happens when the conquerable lands are won over and a part of society must *settle* down. Because of it's autocratic nature(essential for war) power strife is constant *within* Islamic society. To establish power the ruling families(in this case the Khalifs or Caliphs) move away from the central doctrine of Islam, i.e. Jihad. When that happened, you are rebuilding civilization from scratch. continuing ...


&gt;Another fact about the beginnings of the spread of Islam: the Muslim armies did not vanquish all enemies and take over their culture.

Therein lies the answer. The regions which surrendered, let's take the example of Persia, open up their society and homes to the conquering armies in exchange for their lives. So Islam is not bringing anything positive to these societies but rather destroys aspects of their culture which conflict with their central doctrines. So Islam cannot be given credit but the inherent developments of the original culture(as Islam bring only a destructive vacuum culturally). Since the ruling power now is Islamic, divorced from the original aims of the subjugated culture decline is inevitable *unless* the central doctrine has room to be implemented. And it did in the case of Persia. The neighboring regions of Bharat(Afganistan and North West Pakistan) fell to Islamic expansion and fueled the now Islamic pashas of Persia. How Ironic then that the original religion of Iran(Zoroastrianism) exists only in India(Bharat) today. So you see that resources flowing in in terms of money(loot) and   manpower(slaves) can galvanize the region culturally while the originally subjugated generation exists but once the next generation is born entirely under Islamic society amalgam, decline is imminent. But what really fucked the Arabs in the ass was their conversion of the Turks to Islam. The Central Asians being highly successful nomadic barbarians only needed a single banner to wreak havoc on the external world(read non-Islamic). That was what prevented Islamic society from becoming what Europe became 200 years later(from the 12th century approx).

&gt;It was not only Islam that supported slavery. The Torah and the Bible (New Testament included) both make reference to slavery, and they all implore slave owners to treat their slaves fairly.

While it is true that slavery existed in a large part of the world(it did not in Bharat) and especially in the Roman world whom the Muslims kind of hated/idolized BUT the treatment of humans was reduced to levels which I shudder to imagine. If the sheer number of slaves is so great that animals are treated better than them, I consider that the lowest a human society can reach. There are ills of society and then there is just depravity. The mountains which divide Afghanistan from the rest of Asia today are called the 'Hindukush' mountains. Kush means  slaughter/death in Persian. The sheer number of girls, women and boys that died when being transported from Bharat to Islamic lands on those frigid mountains resulted in them being given that ominous name. I cannot even imagine their anguish. From the European perspective Islam grew along with European culture(the latter lagging by a bit) and so a debate can take place on issues with certain rituals and cultures. But from the perspective of the old civilizations(and human society as a whole) Islam can only be viewed as a disruptive and malicious force. ",True,False,,sniperinthebushes,0,0

You are totally missing the point.  People don't go to work and build buildings and homes and make products each day thinking ""wow, I am doing something for the common good.""  If they did, the USSR would still exist and still be a powerhouse.   

People do those things to help their own little part of the world -- to feed their family, to get themselves a nice house, a nice car, etc.   It just so happens that each of these individual desires organizes itself into things that look pre-planned.  It's more efficient when people specialize, and in order for specialization to work, you need a network of other specialists.    Notice that NONE of this has anything to do with taking from the productive to give to the unproductive -- something that can only slow the above process.

&gt; No, that honor would go to capitalism. Socialism is what has raised the standard of living around the world, 

You are, quite simply, wrong.  There is a very easy test.  Look up the Index of Economic Freedom for every country.

The experiment has been run long enough.

&gt; The specific deaths you're referring to were due to Communism, a military dictatorship that paid lip service to socialism without actually obeying its tenets.

Ah, yes, the old ""it wasn't real socialism"" dodge.  The reason it's silly is because they are the same thing: the belief that the needs of the group is worth trampling the rights of the individual.

And they pay the price for their welfare state with reduced standard of living and a dependency on the US for innovation.

I love the WC, and football (soccer) in general, though the diving is a huge put-off when you see it. But random marginalized sports? Cricket and Rugby are some of the largest sports in the world, and Australia doesn't only dominate at the Commonwealth Games but do very well at the Summer Olympics as well. Our own version of footy (AFL) is an Australian-created sport which explains why it isn't played much overseas, but having such a game adds to it's appeal don't you think? Handball and Floorball are unheard of in many countries, but that doesn't mean those sports in themselves are flawed.

Again your final comment on our racism. I do see your point, and I know Germany is a pretty accepting culture, but some of the anti-immigration sentiment across Europe is pretty wide-spread. Sweden just voted in a party to their parliament that wants to not only stop Asian-immigration, but sent immigrants back to the countries they came from.

Your tainted breakfast could be solved if you personally ""deevolved"" and grew your own garden and raised your own livestock.  That's how my parents did it growing up in rural/coastal Spain.  Don't buy the mass produced food if you don't want it, but it's there for that..mass production...to make it available at every store in every town in every county in every state in the entire country if not continent if not WORLD!

Your little farm of corn can only reach your local community and it's fine and dandy if every community grew their own but how would they deal with disasters or infertile soil, or unfit temperatures/climates?  We need what we have to continue to be, especially because of our current population.

About unbiased news and commercials, how do you think technology is funded to have TV in the first place?  It's entertainment and it's there for you *if you want.*  I personally prefer the internet where I can find limitless information, different sources, and 2-way communication.

There have always been unstable people, why do you keep bringing up these food sources?  In countries where people raise their own food, they get even more diseases sometimes, and outbreaks just as well.  They have mentally insane people, it doesn't mean it comes from the food.  Sure those hormones probably aren't that good for you, but I don't think it causes the harm you speculate it does.

People love money.  this goes back to history.  Pharaohs enslaving populations to build them luscious tombs at no pay, and punishment of death to those that refuse, kings conquering other lands in the name of the nation only to keep all of the gold and riches to themselves while the peasants got NOTHING and had to pay taxes even with their own food which they didn't even have for themselves.  If you believe in Christianity, Judas, jesus' own disciple, sold him out for some silver coins.  He liked money so much that he sold out the savior of humanity..

Things were SO MUCH worse before we evolved until this point, what are you talking about man?  EVERYONE lived in poverty except the kings and the noblemen.  Nowadays you still have a small percentage of elite, but the average american still has days off, holidays, catches the football game while drinking a beer, goes out to the movies, goes out to eat instead of cooking every day of the week, buys coffee outside of work instead of bringing their own, has a variety of clothing, owns at least a car per family, lives with electricity, gas, and heat.

I know we're far from perfect, but we keep pushing forward.  Everything doesn't just fall into place, there are powers that try to keep the status quo and there are powers that try to change.  The last century has seen a GREAT turn in terms of technology, knowledge, literacy rates, survival rates, transportation, etc.

We're a couple of thousand years into recorded history.  in the last century we developed more than in our entire history (in non-physical ways).  Everythign has a negative.  I agree with people trying to make their dollar so insurance companies are in control, legislation won't be passed because they profit too much, blah blah blah.  Move to Western Europe, man.  America is the capitol of capitalism, everyone that came to this country came to make their dollars and find work.  They had kids here, and here most of us are!

So while we're seeing a stagnation in the rapidly rising social standards we have enjoyed in the west over the last century or so, globally less people are living in poverty. Our rapidly improving quality of life was built on our foreign policy, and as we see in Iraq we are still prepared to kill millions of people in order to secure cheap oil (without which we are fucked).

Yes, those who have can coerce those who have not into doing their bidding.  That is a repeating theme in human history.  But here's another theme in human history:  when those who have not are laid so low that they have nothing to lose by opposing those who have, violent revolution takes place.  Those who have are forcibly removed from their wealth (and usually their lives) and those who have not loot the remains.

It doesn't have to be that way.  I'd prefer to avoid it myself, even if I'm not among those who would be impacted by the proposed tax system.  What we can do instead is use a little bit more of the resources from those who have to provide means and opportunity for those who have not so they're not so motivated to rip the ten-thousand-dollar suits off the rich so they can have something warm to wear for themselves.

The thing is, civilization requires cooperation even if you buy into the bullshit that everybody is only out for themselves.  People who do not cooperate are harming civilization, which undermines their means to enjoy the prosperity that civilization enables them to have.  The poor, downtrodden rich you purport to champion, are themselves greater drains on society than the poor who depend on public funds in order to survive.

&gt; Ah, yes, the old ""it wasn't real socialism"" dodge. The reason it's silly is because they are the same thing: the belief that the needs of the group is worth trampling the rights of the individual. This is by far the most dangerous idea in history. Here are some stats that this idea has wrought upon the world

It really, really isn't.  Look up Marx's comments on Marxism, and why.  Read up on what socialism really is, and why the Communist regimes never actually achieved it.  Socialism requires the cooperation and consent of the many, a bottom-up movement where the people decide on the public good rather than the elite.  That modern communism requires a military dictatorship to enforce is enough to disqualify it.

Yes, they followed socialism to a degree.  I'm not talking about the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy here.  I'm talking about what socialism is supposed to achieve and how it's supposed to bring it about.  From a purely technical standpoint Western Europe isn't socialist because they haven't had their socialist revolutions.  Instead they used democracy to institute socialist policies that raised their standard of living to unprecedented heights, resulting in fewer poor and uneducated, higher standards of health and prosperity and fewer economic crisis.

&gt; Except that's not socialism at all, that's capitalism with a welfare state. And they pay the price for their welfare state with reduced standard of living and a dependency on the US for innovation. They've made a deal with the devil: ""we'll accept a lower standard of living if you promise nothing bad will happen to us in our lives."" Well, the bills are coming due now, and I'm seeing riots in Europe over it. How's that ""socialism-lite"" working out?

He recounts correctly that attrocities towards the Albanians only started after Nato began bombing Serbia.  Before that, there was a civil war which involved skirmish between Serbian forces and the UCK and burning of Mosques by the Serbians and burning of churches by the Albanians.  Civilians fled but were not directly attacked by either side.  After NATO started bombing Serbia, Serbs started to attack Albanian civilians.  The US wanted to attack Serbia, not to protect the Albanians.  They did because it was the only and last part of the Balkan that was under the influence of Russia and not converging towards a transatlantic partnership and integration with the rest of Europe.  The US forged documentation about a supposed massacre in a soccer stadium with feigned aerial photographs.  The US also planted misinformation about how supposedly Serbian soldiers killed Albanian civilians with gas.

NK: there are more than two options for NK, for one they can become something of a client state to China, since the rest of the world has turned their backs on them China can choose to prop up the regime to avoid a failed state and refugee crisis on their boarder, this also prevents a potentially unified Korea which would mean a strong U.S. ally on their boarder. This is a bad outcome, especially for North Koreans, buts its not WWIII. 

Another possibility is that China will see the regime on Pyongyang as a liability, and that its in their interests to stop supporting the rouge state and will pressure NK to standdown in the interest of regional stability (IE to prevent WWIII)

Iran: The biggest problem I see with your theory here is that Turkey will become a belligerent power, while Turkey-Israel relations have turned sour, that doesn't mean that they're about to start a war over it. They want the middle east to become more stable. They want good relations with everyone, including Iran, but also including the U.S. (they're still a NATO ally after all) and the EU (which they're still trying to gain membership to).

People will hear about atrocities, and they'll give a half-assed moral reply by rote, because that's all they can do.

I'm often reminded of [Kseniya Simonova's performance at Ukraine's Got Talent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cri7aQHRT7k) where she painted a picture of Ukraine's view of the war.

They included stadiums that could be broken down and shipped to poorer nations(huge incentive for votes). 

Here's another point, those that attend the World Cup in Qatar will likely see many more games(assuming they can afford tickets etc...) than they could in the states. The trip between the northern most stadium and southernmost is only an hour and a half.

If the upper bracket rate cuts led to lower revenue which was offset by increases in social security revenue and the like, this graph would be disingenuous.  As it stands, it's just somewhat dumb.  It would demonstrate more clearly that cutting the upper bracket hasn't led to decreased revenue from the rich by graphing revenue from the rich along with upper tax rates.

Is the graph flawed, yes.  Does this mean the point, that decreased upper rates have led to stable or increased revenue from the wealthy is wrong, no... it's numbers, that is what has happened.

As for your second issue, a 1% change in revenue as a percentage of the GDP provides a minuscule change in revenue as compared to changes in the GDP.

What I meant by discrimination is taking one, superficial characteristic of a person (in this case, skin colour) and assuming and asserting that that person has other characteristics based only on the fact that they have a superficial characteristic.  
This is very different from the discrimination you use in your examples. I'll let good old [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discriminate) help me here:
&gt;discriminate  
&gt;1. to make a distinction in favor of or against a person or thing on the basis of the group, class, or category to which the person or thing belongs rather than according to actual merit; show partiality: The new law discriminates against foreigners. He discriminates in favor of his relatives.  
&gt;2. to note or observe a difference; distinguish accurately: to discriminate between things.  

You are working with the second definition, whereas I am working with the first. Obviously it is important to discriminate between heterosexuality and homosexuality, when your decisions relate to the matter of sexual orientation. In this sense, discrimination is not negative, but useful. However, following my use of discrimination, it would be wrong to assume that your gay friend, for example, robs banks because of his sexual orientation.  

My assertion that discrimination is negative because it creates a salience of race, should, perhaps, be clarified. I do not want to, say, white-wash ethnicity. Rather, I argue that my definition of discrimination is negative because it draws attention to race in a negative manner, that is, it has the potential to make members of that race view their own ethnicity in a negative manner, or rather, it inhibits their ability to perceive themselves as fully actuated individuals, because their identities is limited by the constraints of their race. Their ethnic identity should add to their self-worth, not detract from it.  

&gt; Political correctness is a propagandist measure that simultaneously shrouds the ostensible culture of the majority while assimilating minority culture into the ""non-culture"". While that is not the intent of PC, intentions are no defense for ethnic tyranny.

This was very well put. I agree fully. 

I would like to say, however, that it is important to remember that there is a distinction between a cultural identity and race. Race is a construct meant to distinguish difference and justify some really horrifying things such as slavery. There is no such thing as a black person, except that we have constructed the idea of a black person, and that idea persists. There are people who lived in Africa in a wide variety of lifestyles, from hunter-gatherers to large empires. They had many different cultures and societies that varied over the millenia. They were neither good nor bad, but just people. Then, the Europeans came, and in order to justify their ends (which were economically motivated) they invented race, and reinforced it. As they brought slaves to the Americas, they repeatedly drilled the idea of blackness into their own minds, and everyone around them, until it was believed. They erased the earlier identitie of the Africans, and so all they had left was the construct of blackness given to them by their oppressors. 

Of course, that is not to say that the identity of being black is not now real, and that the history of blackness should be forgotten or ignored, because there is a very real identity that comes with being black, a real history. It should not be forgotten. It should be remembered. But so should its origins as a construct formed to emphasize difference. It is a discourse we should not engage in. We should not make claims on a person's characteristics by the colour of his or her skin, because that reduces that person to a stereotype. But nor should we ignore cultural history. No, I would never argue for that.

&gt;All of your references are relatively new. People realized what a failure neoconservatism was with Bush and many people started to distance themselves from it, or to appear to, so as not be associated with the failures. There is therefore no surprise that we see Zakaria say stuff like that.

I am sorry that I chose current events to demonstrate that you are wrong.

[June 12, 2001](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/jan-june01/bush_europe_6-12.html) he criticizes Bush's failure to negotiate with Europe
""I do very much wish that Bush would be more serious, listen more carefully, consult a great deal more because -- as I say -- in historical terms these are not great differences.""

He supported a UN lead attack on Iraq. This is clearly not a neocon idea.  I am sorry that it does not align with your views, but it is not neoconservative.

&gt;Like most of US media they try to stay ""relevant"" by being the Establishment. As neoconservatism became a swear-word they rename themselves to be ""centrists"" or ""moderates"".

What? Was supporting Obama in the primary the ""Establishment"" thing to do?  Did he rename himself?  Did he ever call himself a neocon?

&gt;On Iran it's clear that Zakaria still supports Israel in trying to stop them from getting nuclear power and still plays the fake nuclear weapons story.

Is it clear?  Is that what he meant when he said [we must stop exaggerating the Iranian threat](http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/03/containing-a-nuclear-iran.html).

&gt;We can see that Zakaria moves around quite a bit in his views but it's fair to say that he has stayed with the neoconservative ideas, and still do.

No we can't.  I don't care what you call him but I don't think he has moved around.  Any evidence of this?


&gt;I'm sure you'd say that Zakaria is now a ""centrist"" or a ""moderate"". That's how Lieberman describes himself to, as do other neocons.

I get it.  Lieberman describes him a centrist.  I agree with you that on foreign policy he is a neocon.  So?  Maybe in Lieberman's mind his liberal social policies make him a centrist.  Maybe it doesn't matter at all b/c he is a different person.  

Just because one asshole neocon calls himself a centrist doesn't mean that everyone who claims to be a centrist is a neocon.  This argument is so painfully dumb I am sad for ou that you made it once, let alone twice.

Well, I was working rather freely with both, but granted, you are right: definition 1 will be our operating definition.

&gt;...discrimination is negative because it draws attention to race in a negative manner, that is, it has the potential to make members of that race view their own ethnicity in a negative manner...

Going back to the operating definition we're using:
&gt;...a distinction in favor of or against a person or thing on the basis of the group, class, or category to which the person or thing belongs rather than according to actual merit...

How does a favorable distinction make someone look negatively on their heritage? Nepotism is a form of discrimination, does this make the relative view the benefactor or his or her family in a colder light?

&gt;Race is a construct meant to distinguish difference and justify some really horrifying things such as slavery. There is no such thing as a black person, except that we have constructed the idea of a black person, and that idea persists.

Race was not invented by slavers in order to oppress, it was invented by people who found group of people who were different from them yet homogeneous. 

Back to dictionary.com since we're using it:
&gt;Race (definition 2)
&gt;1. a group of persons related by common descent or heredity.
&gt;2. a population so related.
&gt;3. Anthropology .
&gt;a. any of the traditional divisions of humankind, the commonest being the Caucasian, Mongoloid, and Negro, characterized by supposedly distinctive and universal physical characteristics: *no longer in technical use.*
&gt;b.an arbitrary classification of modern humans, sometimes, esp. formerly, based on any or a combination of various physical characteristics, as skin color, facial form, or eye shape, and now frequently based on such genetic markers as blood groups.
&gt;c. a human population partially isolated reproductively from other populations, whose members share a greater degree of physical and genetic similarity with one another than with other humans.
&gt;4.a group of tribes or peoples forming an ethnic stock: the Slavic race.
&gt;5.any people united by common history, language, cultural traits, etc.: the Dutch race. 
&gt;etc...

First off, the Anthropology definitions are off. Definition (b) is not *race*; anthropologists tend to use the term *ancestry* for physical characteristics of individuals and their affinities to larger populations. Race implies culture in anthropology. When an archaeologist finds human remains with features that belong to one ancestral group, he or she does not assume that that person is of that race (see: [Kennewick Man]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man)). In fact, some choose to not use the term ""race"" at all because it's been used erroneously by laymen and misanthropists and carries heavy connotations because of this. Moving on, it's clearly put that definition (a) is archaic and completely obsolete. But its obsolescence does not prohibit it from being used frequently for racist assumptions as I’m sure you’re aware. 

Notwithstanding this: ancestry is as equally salient as race. We *should* make testable observations on a person's physical characteristics. To not do so is to do a disservice to knowledge. I’m sure you may have read that there is a physiological reason why most footrace winners are from West African descent and why most swimming race winners are from European descent, right? [(It's apparently all in the belly button.)](http://current.com/news/92541856_proof-blacks-make-better-runners-than-whites-but-whites-are-better-swimmers-according-to-duke-university-study.htm) We *are* different stocks of people not only in our individuality, but in the genes we carry which form our physical shape. If we were to deny research such as that done by Duke University due to fear of offending, then our political correctness has terrorized our better sense. And even in our institutions this is a constant battle. We should be celebrating the difference of ancestry and race, not burying the facts of our being and diversity. 

I think these may be among the last years of these differences. I think there will be one day when people will be amazed at the diversity that the human race once had. Shouldn't we record our differences and celebrate them while we have them? Simply because we have treated our differences badly in the past when we were more ignorant than we are today is no reason to not celebrate our differences today and discover what exactly those differences are. If we should ignore the very differences we see so clearly among ourselves we may never get to know ourselves as a species; further, we might just end up becoming an entirely different sort of ignorant in our attempts to thwart our own ignorance.

The clergy were the only ones who had the time and means to copy all the Roman/Greek books. And the Greek books were translated into Latin by the Romans.

Furthermore, This was before the printing press. Books were handwritten, and hard as hell to make. It made no sense to translate a book into a bunch of languages for the masses. They wouldn't be able to afford them anyway. They just wrote the books in Latin, the educated understood Latin because all the books were in Latin. That way they only had to write the book once, and that book would be understood in what was at the time, an extremely fractured continent.

The battle was in 1389. The last Ottoman soldier left Belgrade in 1867. That's 478 years. Not 300. So it's closer to 500 years than 300.

From then on you've skipped a lot of things that are really important. For instance, first and second Balkan war where Serbia occupied Kosovo; then occupied Kosovo had less than 8% of Serbs because serbian orthodox priests called for three migrations of Serbs to north in period between 1389 and 1867. 

See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Serb_Migrations

Basically, Serbs fled from Kosovo a long time before 1912. where Kosovo got occupied by Serbia. Those people migrated to Croatian Vojvodina (Srijem, Banat i Backa), and Slavonia, and all along the part of Croatia called Military Krajina which was a military buffer zone between austro-hungary and Ottoman empire.

Fast forward some time later, those Serbs took away Vojvodina from Croatia and tried to occupy Krajina in 1991. in Balvan revolution.

Balkan Wars are story for itself where Serbia tried to expand by allying itself with surrounding countries against Ottoman empire.

WWI was started by Serbs killing Austrian prince in Sarajevo, shit hits the fan, Serbian army even totally abandons Serbia and flees alltogether to Krim. They get on the winning side just by default by being an Russian ally. Not important in the outcome of war.

State of  Slovenes, Croats and Serbs comes into existance. Later, usurped emmisaries falsely vote for joining Serbia and accepting Serbian King as its own. Kingdom of SCS comes into existance. It changes into Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Serbian king signs away some parts of Croatia to Italy in 1922. Serbian hegemony is widespread, oppression of non-serbs is a daily thing, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann write a letter to the world concerning status of Croats after Serbians killed Milan Sufflay:

http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/einste.html

Stjepan Radic was killed in Belgrade and croatian resistance against serbian oppresion is formed - Ustase, radical wing of political party HSP. They flee to Italy soon after.

WWII - Ustase get a chance to rule NDH, a puppet state installed by Hitler, which is officialy a kingdom of Tomislav II. At first the state was seen as a godsend because people of Croatia were supposed to be free after king Koloman in 1100. defeated Croatia's nobility and made a personal union consisting kingdoms of Hungary and Croatia.

Like it happened in NDH with Croatians, Serbians got their state too - Nedic's Serbia. Also a puppet state, first Judenfrei state in Europe.

NDH and Nedic's Serbia soon brings racial laws as mandated by Hitler and start enforcing them. Two large concentration camps were created - Jasenovac in NDH and Sajmiste in Serbia.

In Jasenovac there was somewhere between 45 and 70 thousand deaths (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasenovac_concentration_camp) and in Sajmiste (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajmi%C5%A1te_concentration_camp) there was around 40 to 48 thousand deaths and 100 000 more people were sent to other camps. Almost all the Jews in Serbia were murdered in Sajmiste.

TBH, there was a lot of propaganda during Tito's era and blowing up numbers for getting high compensation from Germany. Tito claimed 1 700 000 + victims on the territory that encompassed post-wwII yugoslavia but the real figures were noted at about 1 000 000 victims on the whole territory. It's simply impossible for the NDH government to be responsible for numbers you've listed. Simply because they couldn't directly even defend Zagreb from over the river Sava, much less do anything else. At most, Ustase were prison keepers and couldn't even be armed outside first occupation zone. Germans were pretty meticulous people, so look into it.

For instance, a high percentage of American black men have a *European* Y chromosome (and alleles off ""Euro"" X as well, just harder to trace than the Y) - so their phenotype ""black"" doesn't match their genotype, so how can you really classify that man as ""black"" and say that his intelligence is linked to race when the genes he has that influence intelligence...might be the same as the white kids who're doing better on standardized tests than him?

All the things you described above were merely a blip on the radar back then. To me, it was truly the biggest waste of time and money i'd ever witnessed living in France (that's saying a lot).


About the only thing that made it worth it for a while was France winning the World Cup, but even that turned out to be a temporary victory that could have been had elsewhere. 


And in Australia, it would be worse. First off, those stadiums ARE privately owned and operated, which means that all the facilities in use would be renovated by the public yet the stadium owners would be the ones to benefit. Second, it would cost waaay too much. We spent billions hosting the olympics, with its dozens of different sports, venues and infrastructure (that wound up being eight years late, but hey). And now hosting a world cup for one single sport is going to cost nearly as much money again? Fuck. that.


Oh, and FYI? The football world cup is cool if you go watch the games. For everyone else, having it far away so that you can watch it on TV without having a crowd of drunken nationalists running around your house is a definite plus. 



And Germany didn't do it for the image boost, but because there are millions of football fanatics living there. Germany hasn't needed an image boost since the fall of the wall. It has, however, needed a boost in chances for a football team that hasn't really done anything notable outside the European Cup for years.



And yes, i would rather spend billions on scientific research rather than hosting a ball-chasing tournament. Not to mention using the money to upgrade the infrastructure in any case, but noooo. There has to be a sports event attached to it.


I just tune out sports events here. I don't particularly care for them, regardless of what event it is. Obviously, people who would rather use the stadiums and sports venues themselves instead of watching said venues on TV aren't enough to stop the current fashion of hosting sports venues here. 



If that's racist and close-minded, then i think the definition has changed somewhat since i learned it. As far as i'm concerned, Australia isn't as bad as Europe was becoming when i left, so i am happy i got here before the financial crisis.


Not to mention that Australia doesn't just fixate on one game. Every year, there are dozens of different games competing for your attention, all with their own little quirks. In Europe, there was only one game when i was growing up, no matter where i went: football. 



It wasn't until i went to England that i finally got myself a modicum of choice in the sports i could pay attention to. And then i came to Australia, where they only gave a damn about there being sport available to either watch or play at any given time. At last, freaking civilisation. I finally have the option of completely bypassing that bloody awful excuse for a game, and now people want to go ahead and shove it in my face again?


And, as a fellow German, i think i have to point out that it's you that doesn't get it: 



Australia is great because of the people, good and bad. 



If you're not brown, you're not trying hard enough. 



And your reaction is totally expected for a football fanatic  who somehow still hasn't looked up ""sports tourism"" and ""plane ticket"" in his Leo wort buch.


There are parts of the world where football is a marginal sport, like here. Savour it. This is how it's meant to be. A game that is played without billion-dollar clubs with 1000 local supporters and millions of off-shore merchandise hogs who think the colors look cool. A game with more soul than money.


So stop being a prick and enjoy the fact that you don't have to listen to the noise, the football hooligans, the tax man and all the other little things a major sports event brings with it, but can still enjoy the game either on TV or on Holiday. Also, maybe typifying Australians as racist and then going on to say that the country would be better if half the people living there didn't is not exactly a very good way of showing that you aren't one too.

It has a very specific meaning. What occurs in free markets is voluntary consensual agreements -- the exact opposite of coercion.

Voluntary consensual agreements?  Really?  You're going to try to pass that shit off to us?  Let me give you an idea of [what happens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_v_Bethell) in our voluntary consensual agreements:  ""necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them.""

With the middle class in decline and the ranks of the elite harder and harder to join, guess who are increasingly qualifying as ""necessitous men""?

&gt; This only happens when the government is doing the laying low; show me a revolution in a country where free markets reigned.

We *almost* saw it all across Europe during the Nineteenth Century.  Unless, of course, you're going to play the No True Scotsman card and claim they weren't *truly* free in spite of extremely lax government oversight (namely:  little to none).  The Free Market Fairy cannot and never will cure our ills.  The only thing that has ever protected the interests of the poor and working class has been an overarching authority that can force compliance on the part of the business class.

&gt; No, they are harming themselves.

I see you're not familiar with or do not accept modern game theory.  People who use society to their own benefit until they get what they want, then withdraw, are of far more harm to society than those who aren't nearly so successful and require assistance.

&gt; This is just nonsense. The rich, in free markets, get rich by improving the lives of others.

Ha!  Hahahahahahahahahaha!  Oh gods, that was the best laugh I've had all day.  Thank you.  Classic comedy.

&gt; Exactly -- it is not plausible because it goes against the basic rules of millions of years of evolution.

So you're not only ignorant of what socialism really means, you're also ignorant of biology and evolution.  We are social creatures.  Cooperation is what allowed us to thrive, a state we were forced to because we're not as strong as other apes, not as fast as most animals and so forth.  The only thing we have to our advantage is our oversized brains which allow us to reason out the benefits of cooperation rather than isolation.

Of course, in some cases it's clear that some brains are defective.

&gt; Yeah, I guess those riots there are just their new spectator sport.

Those riots there are the natural response to the power grab by their nations elites.

They fought the peoples around them. They fought each other. They killed, reveled, and enjoyed themselves, generally, until the Norman French bastard Guillaume conquered Brittany and turned it into a French fiefdom.

They still fought each other.

This French rule culminated in Richard Coeur de Lion, known in English as Richard Lionheart, who led Anglo-Saxon armies under Norman feudal lords to ravage and rape their way across Europe and Palestine until his death.

Capital Appreciation
The key to capital appreciation is location – 
the resorts are in locations where the property market is experiencing high capital growth which is likely to continue indefinitely.
Properties are sold off plan at up to 50% below market value with several price rises during construction. 
Early investors pay less than the property’s value at completion.
The earlier the investment is made the higher the capital appreciation giving a higher share in the capital growth.

Annual Rental Income
Rental income comes from the property being rented out by the hotel management company - investors will receive 50% net room rate share ongoing. Investors will receive a two year rental guarantee of 10% of the original purchase price paid from
completion i.e. If the original purchase price of your property is £200,000 you will receive £20,000 each year for 2 years.

All resorts will include 5 star amenities:
The Island Sanctuary Spa
Harlequin Sports Academy including the Pat Cash Tennis
Academy, Football Academy, Cricket Academy
Harlequin Fitness Centre
Shopping Piazza with designer boutiques and beachwear
Restaurants and bars which offer a choice of cuisine, ranging from

Oh wait look, why, here's another suicided man in Britain:


A group of doctors has demanded an inquest into the death of government scientist David Kelly – saying the verdict of suicide should be overturned. 

It comes as a documentary to be screened later this week claims Dr Kelly may have been killed because he knew about secret germ warfare plans. 


His body was found six years ago this week in woods near his Oxfordshire home, only days after it emerged he was the source of a BBC story which claimed evidence against Iraq had been 'sexed up' to justify invasion. 

No coroner's inquest was held into his death and the results of a post-mortem examination were never made public. But the Hutton inquiry commissioned by Tony Blair concluded that the 59-year-old scientist died of blood loss after cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife.

For starters, WWI began with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian nationalist. Ferdinand was heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the Serbs were trying to gain independence from the A-H Empire. Anyway, thanks to several alliances and dealings, the main conflict was fought along the Maginot Line in France/Germany. Millions of lives were lost, and all it did was sow the seeds for yet another World War. And yeah, the irony is that Europeans call Americans warmongers today. I know we're wearing the asshole cap right now, but c'mon guys...your track record isn't exactly sunshine and daisies...

Anyhow, back to the Balkans...back in the days of the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia was a confederation of many ethnically different states. This lasted until the fall of communism when Slobodan Milosevic (sorry I know there's accents and stuff on his name...don't know how to do that and either way..the guys a genocidal war criminal..) exploited existing ethnic tensions for political gain. He came to led the Serbs in their fight for their sovereignty. All sides (Serbian, Croatian, Albanian, and Bosnian) committed atrocities that shocked the rest of the world, so NATO decided to get off it's ass and do something about it. Keeping the peace generally involves dropping a shitload of bombs, killing civilians, until leaders decide peace should be made. Logical, I know. Anyway, tensions still exist and the war didn't help any. Personally, I can't see why these people who share a very similar culture and are generally just considered slavic peoples to the rest of the world, can't come together for a greater good...like taking out Turkey...or something. But, alas, if I was a Croat (or Serb...or Albanian...or Bosnian...or Montenegran?!...seriously?!?) and I witnessed the terrible things the Balkan conflict produced, I would be hesistant to work with my former enemies as well.

I'm sorry dude but this article is kind of nuts.  Do people really believe this just from reading words on a blog that have nothing to back them up?  This is kind of the point I was making in the thread about Muslims and conspiracy theories....

&gt;In places, where music is more prevalent, we find that there are more neurotic illnesses. It is for this reason that most of the mental hospitals are to be found in Europe and America.

I feel the logic here is so bad I have the compulsion to grab the nearest real analysis book, run into a dark corner and read the proofs compulsively while crying to myself.  No but honestly this statement is ridiculous.  You're making a connection to two entirely random different things.  ""There are more apples produced in California, and there are more prisoners in California than any other state, this means that exposure to apples makes people more violent.""  Holy shit, the war on crime has been solved!  

Just to comment further on the logic... so you are saying there are more mental institutions in Europe and America... you do realize the world is larger than Muslim countries + Europe + America.  Music in American society is far less important than other countries.  What about India?  You can't watch 15 minutes of a Hindi filck without a song and dance number.  I can't go 5 minutes without hearing Hindi songs being blasted in my apartment complex all day long.  And India is only one example.

There were two things that made me legitimately believe the United States would get it:

1) Since we still hold the highest attendance record when we hosted it in 1994, FIFA know that ""If they bring it here, they will come"" (to paraphrase Field of Dreams a little bit). FIFA, like many others in this financial climate, are hurting and the South African World Cup didn't do much to help. Even though in Brazil soccer is wildly popular, the reason they wanted the World Cup in Europe in 2018 was to give a guaranteed lucrative financial return. Which made me believe that England was going to get it. However, since the BBC couldn't wait one more week to show that scathing Panorama documentary on the FIFA bribes, they may as well have not bid at all. If they were going to go experimental with the 2018 World Cup, then the logical choice would be to go with a safe, lucrative option for 2022 (and the only one on the list where I could see that, was with the United States).

2) When Qatar was on the list, I thought to myself ""Oh shit, here we go...it'll go to the Middle East because of politics, and lord help us if we don't give it to the Middle East bidder. Sure we can not give it to the Americans, or the Koreans, or the Japanese, or the Australians, because who cares if they're offended if we don't pick them, but if we insult an Islam nation by not picking them, *gasp* we can't do that cause that's SO MUCH WORSE!"". I remember when FIFA decided that they wanted to do the 2002 World Cup in Asia, then-President Joao Havelange said ""No"" to China because of its human rights record. I don't know about you, but I can't recall another time someone said ""No"" to China since its rise as an economic superpower. Part of me thought that FIFA wouldn't bend to diplomatic pressure and pick anyone but Qatar, but then I realized that we're dealing with fucking Sepp Blatter here. A man who would rather bankrupt FIFA than offend a group of people by not letting them host football's premier tournament.

Something people have been saying recently that's been getting on my tits is ""The USA doesn't deserve to host the World Cup"". First of all, again, we've HOSTED the tournament before, and it was a MASSIVE success. Furthermore, I've heard these same people say ""We aren't a worldly nation cause we just play our own sports instead of trying to be good at the world's most popular sport"". Now that we have, it seems that the rest of the world doesn't want us to catch up. We topped our group this past World Cup which featured ENGLAND, and even though we got knocked out at the same stage as England, we put up a MUCH better fight in our match than England did in their's (albeit, we didn't have to play Germany, but we only lost by 1 goal as opposed to 3).

/rant

TL;DR - I thought USA would get it over Qatar because we were a safe financial return for a struggling FIFA, and given history of FIFA not bending to political pressure, they would do it again.

Bernie's tax strategy is to tax wealth, not income, and to do that he wants to tax everything you own, every year. Bought a new car? Curently you pay a ""sales"" tax on the purchase of that car once, but under Sanders' plan you pay a ""wealth"" tax every subsequent year that you own the vehicle. Same goes for your house, your clothes, electronics, land, whatever. Its all ""wealth"" to him. What he is striving for is a perfect neutral equilibrium of wealth. Its a disaster.  
  
EDIT: I'll try to reply to you all here. First understand that Bernie is getting his taxation rhetoric from inspiration from tax programs in Europe where many countries have a ""wealth tax"". This is not a ""property tax"" or a ""sales tax"". It is specifically a tax on ALL accumulated wealth, above and beyond a property or sales tax, that a household may gather over the course of a year.  
  
One tremendous flaw that I see immediately is the impact a wealth tax would have on retirees, people that have accumulated a good amount of wealth, but have no further income. Bernie's plan does not discriminate, and quite frankly, it would cause A LOT of people that are ready to retire or already retired to go back to work simply to pay their taxes. As a former citizen of Vermont with family still there that have seen their taxes go through the roof over the last decade, I say fuck him.

I wouldn't consider my family rich, I know rich families and we're not in their class. However, I was never want for anything as a kid and I know that is not always the norm. With that said, Bernie's plan would eat away at my father's life savings and force him, in his 70's, to go back to work just so he can pay these taxes. Its ridiculous. And its a waste.

And finally, as it stands, Kosovo will never be recognized where it counts - The United Nations - so it will never be a country. Good luck with the wet dreams, though.

Actually, no. It hasn't.

There were concerns about IGF-1 increasing the risk of cancer, but multiple scientific studies have shown that the levels of IGF-1 in milk from cows treated with rbgh is well within the normal variance of IGF-1 in a conventional cow.

I researched this for a comment I made the other day. So I have some evidence on hand. 

From the EU evaluation of rBGH:

[""Mean concentrations of IGF-I were 2.77 ± 1.36 ng/mL in control cows and 3.30±1.40 ng/mL in treated cows, respectively.""](http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scv/out19_en.html)

Now lets compare that to the normal range as stated in a laundry list of scientific papers :

""1-34 ng/mL, normal milk (Malven et al., 1987; Campbell &amp; Baumrucker, 1989; Juskevich and Guyer, 1990; Collier et al., 1991; Schams, 1991; Zumkeller, 1992)."" 

From the FDA re-evaluation in 1999:

[""Assuming 5000 ml blood plasma volume in a 60 kg person and assuming this person consumes 1.5 liters of milk containing 9000 ng IGF-I from rbGH-treated cows (as opposed to 6000 ng IGF-I in milk from untreated cows), the maximum increase in blood IGF-I would be less than 2 ng/ml of which only one-third could be attributed to the use of rbGH. This minute increase would dilute into the endogenous pool of circulating IGF-I.""](http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm130321.htm)

and here is one more paper I found.

[""From a consumer perspective, bST was unique, and special interest groups loudly predicted dire consequences. However, introduction of bST had no impact on milk consumption, and milk labeled as recombinant bST-free occupies a minor niche market. ""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10527114)

Even critical opinions [such as this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11733423) fails to provide evidence that IGF-1 occurs at a rate beyond the physiologic range. It simply hand waves the point and moves forward. ",True,False,,searine,0,0

&gt; Dude, i lived in France for WC '98. All the things you described above were merely a blip on the radar back then. To me, it was truly the biggest waste of time and money i'd ever witnessed living in France (that's saying a lot). About the only thing that made it worth it for a while was France winning the World Cup, but even that turned out to be a temporary victory that could have been had elsewhere.

Personal experience ≠ facts and figures. Before the WC 1998, France was a country of underachievers when it comes to football, since then teams have been improved massively, most prominently Lyon, who are actually contenders for the Champion's League and have been over the past several years. There has been a ridiculous amount of talent that has emerged out of France ever since they became a 'somebody' in the world of football. If you consider the world cup in France a failure, you understand nothing about football.

&gt; First off, those stadiums ARE privately owned and operated, which means that all the facilities in use would be renovated by the public yet the stadium owners would be the ones to benefit.

How does the public NOT benefit from improved stadiums? Would footy, rugby and cricket not benefit from these stadiums being upgraded or are they exclusively used for football? Does Australia even have an exclusive football venue...

&gt; Second, it would cost waaay too much. We spent billions hosting the olympics...

Who is we? First you are Australian, then you are french, then you are british and finally you are German? Damn, I thought my heritage was complicated.

&gt; Oh, and FYI? The football world cup is cool if you go watch the games. For everyone else, having it far away so that you can watch it on TV without having a crowd of drunken nationalists running around your house is a definite plus.

So your opinion trumps everyone else because *you* find it annoying, so does everyone else? I can't go out anywhere in Australia at night without running into drunken and violent bogans, so your point is moot, unless you have a problem with foreign drunks.

&gt; And Germany didn't do it for the image boost, but because there are millions of football fanatics living there. Germany hasn't needed an image boost since the fall of the wall. It has, however, needed a boost in chances for a football team that hasn't really done anything notable outside the European Cup for years.

FYI, I never said they did it for the image boost. The image boost was a result of a successfully hosted WC. I read tons of surveys and articles re: Germany after the WC and the general opinion was, everybody was surprised that the Germans aren't boring and actually know how to be good hosts. Public perception of the country benefited immensely from the World Cup, no question.

&gt; Not to mention that Australia doesn't just fixate on one game. Every year, there are dozens of different games competing for your attention, all with their own little quirks. In Europe, there was only one game when i was growing up, no matter where i went: football.

Wow, the ignorance is increasing exponentially the more you go on. Germany has a huge following in a variety of sports: Ice Hockey, Basketball, Track &amp; Field, Tennis, Formula 1 and tons of other motorsports, Handball, Cycling, Boxing, Winter Sports and the list goes on. To say you had to go to England to escape football is the dumbest shit I heard all day. Where did you live, on a secluded island? I watched Ice Hockey regularly live with 10.000 other fans when I was still there, hardly a marginal sport.

&gt; It wasn't until i went to England that i finally got myself a modicum of choice in the sports i could pay attention to. And then i came to Australia, where they only gave a damn about there being sport available to either watch or play at any given time. At last, freaking civilisation. I finally have the option of completely bypassing that bloody awful excuse for a game, and now people want to go ahead and shove it in my face again?

So again, your personal experience equals facts, right? Because *you* hate football, so does everyone else and if they don't they are uncivilized? Yes, you are close-minded, I have no problems standing by my word. You fit in well here, no wonder you call it civilized. Plenty of people to share your ignorance.

&gt; And, as a fellow German, i think i have to point out that it's you that doesn't get it:

Seriously, what the fuck are you, German, Australian, French, British, Turkish? Make up your mind already.

&gt; If you're not brown, you're not trying hard enough. And your reaction is totally expected for a football fanatic who somehow still hasn't looked up ""sports tourism"" and ""plane ticket"" in his Leo wort buch.

You are starting to sound like a rambling old person. No clue what you are getting at, but I am starting to think you aren't Australian, or just generally uneducated.

&gt; There are parts of the world where football is a marginal sport, like here. Savour it. This is how it's meant to be. A game that is played without billion-dollar clubs with 1000 local supporters and millions of off-shore merchandise hogs who think the colors look cool. A game with more soul than money.

There are maybe 2-3 clubs that are worth a billion. I guess everyone who loves football is in it for the colors and money, there can't be possibly another reason that the entire fucking world plays football, even North Korea made the world cup, North Korea.

&gt; So stop being a prick and enjoy the fact that you don't have to listen to the noise, the football hooligans, the tax man and all the other little things a major sports event brings with it, but can still enjoy the game either on TV or on Holiday.

So according to you there is no room for football, because it is already occupied by footy and rugby fans who are loud, get drunk and do the same shit that a football fan would do? Are you still living in England during the 80s? Hooliganism is nearly non-existant in football, you have to go to Eastern Europe to see football violence. Any major public event will bring drunks, rowdies and other little annoyances, but this isn't about that, this is about your own little opinion that you consider the truth and anyone that enjoys football is uncivilized. Your words, not mine.

&gt; typifying Australians as racist and then going on to say that the country would be better if half the people living there didn't is not exactly a very good way of showing that you aren't one too.

I am racist against ignorance if you want to twist my words.

&gt; First of all, when you base your entire argument on a comparison between cultures I dont think its very wise to lump the rest of the world into ""Westerners"". Different countries have different dating cultures (or lack of it), different traditions and different views on sex.

I'm comparing the Muslim world to the Western world. Not to like, China, Korea, Japan, whatever. I don't mean the rest of the world when I say ""West"", I mean the actual West.

&gt; The idea that one half of society shouldn't interact with the other is completely ridiculous.

You're even more ridiculous for coming to that interpretation.

It's that both halves of society don't interact with the other outside of what's necessary.

&gt; What's even more ridiculous is to only justify it by fearing it would lead to ""immoral behavior"". ""What leads to Haram is Haram"" right ? Lets ban Tvs, the internet heck lets go back to Stone age because the invention of fire and the wheel lead to technologies that lead to porn.

You think like a Wahabbi at the turn of the last century. Very interesting. 

Television, internet, etc in and of themselves don't lead to haram. One of the biggest complaints in Pakistan when they banned YouTube was that they also banned one of the largest respositories for Islamic content on the web.

On the other hand, contact between men and women does, in and of itself, lead to sexual attraction and sex itself.

&gt; Claiming that Hijab and segregation protects women from sexual harassments is putting the whole responsibility into women's hands. So any non-Hijabi woman who mixed up with men is responsible if she gets raped ? This is no different for saying ""She was asking for it"" which is how many extremists see the issue.

This is actually nothing like that. You're trying to force conclusions here. What you're only doing instead is showing your way of thinking is quite... strange. It's abhorrent. For instance,

If a woman dresses up like a prostitute, gets drunk off her ass, then strolls into one of the worst crime areas in South Africa in the dead of night, and winds up getting raped. Is she responsible?

Nobody in their right mind would argue against the fact that some of her decisions shared in *some* responsibility.

There's a difference though, between acknowledging the obvious, and actually blaming the woman. I wouldn't blame a rape victim. Not even the case of our theoretical South African.

You, on the other hand, clearly would. This is why I said your thinking is abhorrent.

Now, if a Muslim woman does not wear hijab and gets sexually harassed, does any blame fall on her? Again, we can say some of her decisions were questionable, and probably didn't help, but blaming the victim is a pointless act. One we don't encourage. Unlike you.

**The notion that you can challenge the right of some people to take preventative measures because you think that by doing so, they raise the standard of preventative behavior expected from others, is ludicrous.** It's insane. The insanity is further exemplified by insisting that these people call these preventative measures something other than preventative. 

This is your argument applied to a different scenario:

""Please, don't lock your car doors. It makes those of us who don't want to lock ours look bad. Ok well, since I can't stop you from doing that, please call it something other than 'locking doors' and I demand you not tell people you do it for the purposes of avoiding theft because those of us who don't lock our doors don't want to look bad if our cars are stolen.""

Or another,

""Don't study! Or rather, those of you that *do* study, please don't tell people that you study in order to pass exams, so it doesn't make those of us who don't want to study look bad when we fail. Just pretend you study because it's fun and you like it. I don't want to think about how I could have studied when I fail.""

I think what makes this worse is that I don't think you've actually ever been a victim of sexual harassment or worse. Have you? I've never heard of any victims of sexual harassment take offense when a woman who wears hijab cites sexual harassment as one reason she wears it. Please, cite examples indicating otherwise. I would be very interested in people holding such opinions.

&gt; That also happens in Islamic societies.

I didn't say that it doesn't. But it happens far more in Western countries. Since you have a hard time dealing with the subject of women, let's just take the example of men.

For men, divorce is extremely easy, right? So how many men in the Muslim world actually marry multiple wives or divorce their wives and take newer, more attractive ones when that spark goes from the relationship?

How many men in the West switch partners for the same reason?

&gt; It doesn't get discussed because Sex is still a taboo topic but its there. Check any Islamic forum and see how many Muslim men complain about how little (if any) sex they get from their wives. Do you know what answer they get ? If she's not sick, she shouldn't say no.

This is switching subjects but this is an interesting switch. You make the assumption that Muslim men do not lose attraction to their spouses, just that Muslim women hate their men, don't want to sleep with them, and are always raped.

Leaving the ludicrous nature of that conclusion, let's look at your initial assumption.

Why do you not take into account the possibility that Muslim men can lose attraction to their spouses?

This certainly is one of the first things mentioned when discussing failed relationships in Western culture.

You basically tacitly endorsed what I wrote about how the segregation of non-related and unmarried men and women helps preserve the sexual attraction between couples.

EDIT: I'm re-reading my post, and to make it clear: You clearly admit Muslim men want sex from their wives. You're saying they want it so much, they have to resort to raping their wives like crazy because they want their wives so much and you have some way of knowing that Muslim women don't like sex and don't want their husbands. This is absolutely hilarious.

Now, let's go on to the ridiculous conclusion:

&gt; Marital rape is often justified by this little factoid. Which lead me to my other point :

To just state out of the blue that marital rape is common, okay wait. Let's start with all your assumptions and list them:

1) Men don't lose attraction to women (this backs up my original post)

2) Women were never attracted to the men and if they ever somehow were, they lose it quickly

3) Men rape their wives

Stats? None. Personal experiences or anecdotes? None.

Dear God. That is just dumb.

&gt; This is how people identify partners who are sexually compatible with them.

Sexual compatibility has been turned into an issue by the pornographic culture of the last few decades in the West. Prior to this, for almost all of humanity's history, including the history of Europe and the Americas, sexual compatibility between men and women wasn't in doubt, nor was it threatened.

&gt; According to you, the ""correct"" approach would be making a gamble and pick a partner.

Like I said, arranged marriages have worked pretty well for most of humanity's history. It got us this far, hasn't it?

&gt; What if it turn out that the man or the woman have absolutely no libido (untreatable)? 

This is a medical issue that should be disclosed before marriage.

&gt; You will respond that if its the women, then the husband can get himself another wife (polygamy) right ? The first wife doesn't have any choice really since its either : Get divorced (divorced women are very harshly viewed in Islamic societies) 

Not in all. You still seem to confuse traditional South Asian stereotypes with everyone else. Your experiences with Muslim communities in the West has left you with some really, really, strange ideas. Something I'm going to look into more later.

Divorces were fairly commonly narrated occurrences among the first generations of Muslims. Hell, probably through the entire first half of Islamic history. If there's a stigma on it today, it's something Muslims need to address. The Islamic scholars I've heard have done so, but since few people are religious these days, they don't listen to the scholars.

&gt; or live a miserable life. 

Wha? If she has no libido, then why would not having sex leave her miserable? Or are you implying that being a second, third, or fourth wife automatically makes women miserable?

Again, no stats. No personal experiences. No anecdotes. Just prejudices and bullshit made up on the spot.

I'm disappointed, I thought you knew better than that.

&gt; If its the man, the wife is fucked (no pun intended). Yes, she can get divorced, but see my previous point.

Your ignorance of Islamic law or even contemporary Muslim societies is on full display here.

Browse any of those online ""ask an imam"" sites. Read a book. Hell, read Wikipedia.

In Islamic law, impotency of the man is grounds for divorce. A woman can bring this up to a court and be guaranteed a speedy divorce. Because it's an open and shut case.

The remarkable thing is that when you actually read the questions sent into Muftis/Imams, many women ask if it would be okay to stay with their husbands who are impotent or even incapable of fathering children. That blew my mind at first, because I instinctively viewed the idea like you did, without taking into account the humanity of the women. How could a woman possibly *want* to stay with a husband who couldn't father children or sexually satisfy her? But there it is. It not only happens, it happens often.

The example also illustrates how easy it is for a woman to get out of a marriage where the husband is impotent or can't father children.

I'm trying to think of any cases where it might be the opposite. Saudi-Arabia is what instinctively comes to mind. Their version of Shariah is not Sunni and varies from region to region, case to case, and by economic status of the people in question.",True,False,,Logical1ty,0,0

&gt; What you call ""sensitization"" I call repression.

That would be incorrect.

Repression is assuming that the natural state of things is for men to view women as much as they do and as they do, in Western culture today.

This cannot possibly be the natural state of things because this came about within the last 50 to 75 years and humanity is a lot older than that.

Now, if you mean sexual repression, sex is not repressed at all in Islam. People have sex through marriage. Europeans used to think Muslims had an overly sexualized culture and civilization once upon a time, so you're judging Islamic culture and civilization relative to something that has not yet proven to be anything more than transient... that something being Western culture from the 1960s to the present day. 

That you would judge an ancient civilization and a world culture and an entire people (1/5th of humanity) against the standard of a few cultural mores that were in vogue for a few decades in some Western countries is astonishing and outrageous.

The largest number of truly sexually repressed people are from the West. After all, there's no ""forever alone"" meme in the Muslim world.


&gt; There is a correlation between sexual repression and physical aggression(and blue balls).

Stats?

&gt; I can state many cases, this year alone, where Saudi students were accused of rape in Canada, the US and Australia but correlating the two wouldn't be fair.

No stats. :(

&gt; When you see segregation and Hijab as the only thing between you and women,

I have no idea what this statement means or how you would construe that from my original post.

&gt; it becomes easier to think of them as brainless flesh up for grabs.

Not for us. But as you've clearly shown with a detailed expression of your thought process, that's what you think and how you think.

You really shouldn't think of women as brainless flesh up for grabs. Women are humans, no matter what they wear. I realize this, whether she's in a burqa or a miniskirt. It's unfortunate you don't. 

&gt; Reducing the causes of rape to ""sexualized society"" is a mistake anyway as Filipino maids are getting raped in KSA (ma malakat aymanukoum ?).

http://www.rainn.org/statistics

I have a hard time believing you give a fuck about rape victims since there's practically a rape epidemic in Western countries and you're wasting your time on the internet attacking people on the other side of the planet instead.

Bad form.

Please don't try to claim that ""Muslim countries have more rape they just don't report them HERP DERP"". None of that unfalsifiable claim crap.

Besides, as you can see from the RAINN site, 60% of sexual assaults are not reported in the US. According to Wikipedia, in 1992, 16% of rapes were reported. RAINN's site says that reporting has increased by a third only in **the last fifteen years**. Meaning, rape was a ridiculous epidemic in the West even up to the 1990s (and still is, but not as bad). In a country that is on top of the world in terms of money and power and being able to actually do anything about it.

&gt; Wrong. Its an important part, but not the basis.

No, it's pretty much the basis of it. Is it the basis of male-female companionship? Not necessarily. Of **romantic** relationships? Yes. Yes, it is.

The sex drive exercises huge influence over every part of the brain and one's psyche. Take away the attraction to the opposite sex and how much romance would still exist? None. 

None.

Feel free to put my assertion to any psychologicst, psychiatrist, sociologist, biologist, or anyone else who knows their shit.

&gt; How are you supposed to pick your partner when you cant even mix up with them in the first place ? You seem to see the situation like training a dog against foreigners. To raise an overly aggressive dog, you raise him in the dark and minimize his contact with strangers so he would jump at the first foreigner he meets. Lets over-sensitize men so they would jump at the first women they see just because they're eager for flesh.

Because relationships really are about more than just sex in Islam. Romance is a huge part of it, and the male-female relationship of marriage is still certainly a romantic one in nature, but companionship plays a big role. There's so many more important criteria than sexual attraction.

In fact, since sexual attraction in its natural state is so strong between a male and female, it's almost a given. Humans are mammals and going by what we know of our origins (evolutionary origins too) and our history, any anthropologist or evolutionary biologist will confirm that. And Islamic culture's policies pretty much try to preserve that ""given"". People should be able to pick a spouse on important criteria than have it be a given that they will be sexually attracted to one another. That's no longer the case due to contemporary Western culture, and it has encroached into every Muslim society to varying extents too.

I love how you just try to claim that sex is not the basis of romantic relationships... then turn around and ask how are you supposed to pick your partner without being able to have sex with them. Whaaaat?

&gt; Over-generalization ? Dating culture is different from Sweden, Germany, France etc... People learn from it, they grow as individuals from this interaction and they acquire a taste for their ideal partner. Its a great opportunity and you suggest abolishing the whole system and preventing men from mixing with women. I dont think you realize how ridiculous it is. 

I am certainly not advocating an Islamic culture for any nation that already has its own. Duh. Islamic laws and culture for Muslim societies.

&gt; People learn from it, they grow as individuals from this interaction and they acquire a taste for their ideal partner.

So they spend years trying to figure out just which sexual experience is the best? So you're admitting Western relationships revolve around sex? I'm not saying that there aren't exceptions but it's hilarious that all the happy relationships are the exceptions.

I also strongly doubt that there is such a thing as an ""ideal sexual partner"", meaning an ideal person to have sex with. This is something that people learn from culture or it is strongly influenced by their culture. 

If you truly want people to find their ideal partner, **let them have their own ideals first**. Teaching people about what sex should be like via the pornographic culture in the West is not the way to do it.

It's a travesty against humanity that in the West they socialize and condition all people to suppress their own individualness in favor of a one-size-fits-all sexuality peddled to them via popular media. Everyone is attracted to the same idea of what looks good in the opposite sex, an idea they saw on TV. Everyone was taught, before ever having sex, what sex should be like. 

And yet still, no matter how much you argue about how women are screwed in Islam, most women aren't sexually satisfied in Western cultures. And Islam remains one of the fastest growing religions among Western women.

Sex is great and all, but there's more to life than sex. If Westerners woke up to this fact, perhaps they wouldn't sit idly by (being preoccupied by this manufactured rat race) as their civilization was run into the ground.


""We must reckon with the possibility that something in the nature of the sexual instinct itself is unfavorable to the realization of complete satisfaction.""

-Sigmund Freud

""It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct.""

-Sigmund Freud

And dear God, man. People grow as individuals from indulging themselves in sexual experiences? Really? Is that sort of like how people grow as individuals from indulging themselves in their appetite for food? That's kind of funny, because they do grow literally, but you know what I mean.

Considering how much sex Americans are having, why is America still screwing up the world? Shouldn't it be a country of highly developed individuals? Or are you going to argue that they're still not having enough sex?

Actually, that might be right. Americans really don't have that much sex, since it's a sexually repressed society as I mentioned above (the ""forever alone"" remark). They oversexualize people from childhood into adulthood, trump up the importance of sexual experience, yet the simple basic act (and physical need) of sex remains elusive for more people than it probably ever has in human history. You guys like torturing yourselves I see. Perhaps that's why you made the reference to blue balls?

&gt; Divorce is less popular in Islamic countries and its not because segregation or Hijab work as both of them are not that popular outside the Gulf region.

False, hijab is extremely predominant in Indonesia, and the Indian subcontinent. That's over half a billion people right there.

&gt; Maybe its because Islam discourages divorce?

It does, but you have to take that in the context of how often Muhammad (saw), his companions, and the first generations of Muslims divorced.

They divorced quite a lot.

&gt; Maybe because chastity is so important that women would rather stay stuck in failed marriages than go back to being single?

Earlier, I touched upon the difference between modern ideas of traditional culture in Muslim countries and the reality of what traditional culture really was (it was not this).

I'll give an example, just using random numbers to illustrate the concept: 

A given installation of wind turbines generates a peak of 100MW and produces 100 GWh per year.  According to the proposal at time of construction, it should successfully operate for 40 years and total operating and capital costs over that time amount to $10 billion.  4000 TWh / $10 billion = 0.4 MWh per $

A different installation, this time of solar panels generates a peak of 100MW and produces 200 GWh per year.  According to the proposal, it should operate for 20 years and total costs should amount to $25 billion, generating 1MWh per $

Realistically, I'll be working on a limited budget with limited financing available.  I can't just make money appear out of thin air.  So, for those power plants, a $1 billion dollar line in my budget spent on wind is going to generate more power than than if I budget the same for solar.  Lower costs per KWh mean more power generated from clean energy, which means fewer tons of CO2 exhausted into the atmosphere.

A few other points: investment in capital projects today doesn't magically make things better in the future - the reason why things get better in the future is because the potential for income motivates companies to do more research or improve on existing designs.

Instead of motivating research that way, it might be more economical to simply invest in research directly.

A final comment on the European Comission projections - if you can't place your trust in historical numbers, how come you place your trust in projected trends based on those numbers?  You can't have one without the other.

Further, just because the European Comission issued these projections, doesn't necessarily make them the most efficient distribution of new power - I'm sure you don't advocate producing new coal, gas, and oil plants, and your position on nuclear is quite clear, so why not produce more of that capacity from wind instead of the 41% they projected?

These include quasi-isolationist, anti-war paleoconservatives and even those who lean libertarian (Jack Hunter, ""The Southern Avenger"").

These are not the first Conservatives to see the Drug War for what it is: big, intrusive government.  The flagship American Conservative magazine of the 20th century was [The National Review](http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/images/2008/02/27/national_review1.jpg), which did an issue on ending the drug war in the middle 90s (it was about this time I actually went ice skating in hell.)  

One of the most consistent problems the legalization movement has faced is getting conservatives on board, in part because, well, social conservatives (the kind who are obsessed with sex) cannot be moved.  And secondly because the pro-legalization message isn't often written in such a way that conservatives can relate to it.

However, there are those who need no convincing, and you will find them scattered around the libertarian and anti-government fringes of conservatism.

For conservatives, it is best to attack the drug war on the basis of the rights of the individual, governmental intrusion into personal affairs, and the massive waste of taxpayer dollars on ""another inefficient, wasteful government program.""

You will never convince most conservatives that marijuana is ""mostly harmless,"" and for god's sake don't bring up European countries because many conservatives think Europe is full of ""a bunch of fags."" (sorry)

You sell legalization on the basis of government intervention and ""government colonization of bloodstreams and lungs of American taxpayers"" and you put an American flag on the hemp industry and talk about free markets and all that stuff.  As much of the pro-legalization movement tends to lean left, they have problems writing about this persuasively. 

As for the ""social harm"" factor, I find this is also a dead end with conservatives because most simply don't give a damn what happens to ""drug addicts,"" who they perceive to be criminals, thieves, and so on.

All of this is if pro-legalization people want conservatives on the bus.

Otherwise, carry on as normal.

(*) I became pro-legalization as a young conservative, before I ever smoked cannabis, on the basis of much of the above.  I have moved sharply left in subsequent years but I still find the conservative/libertarian/free market arguments most persuasive: government should not have the power to regulate drug use from an individual rights/Constitutional perspective.  I do not consent to this, nor should any conservative.",True,False,,[deleted],0,0

The money would make it to the government coffers--if not directly then indirectly. Your point here is moot.

An influx of foreigners will have an affect on national security policy and probably for the worse. Imagine the TSA dealing with a huge number of foreigners arriving within a small period of time.

How about the no-fly list and other arbitrary, no-contest restrictions placed on travelers? How does a foreigner deal with that mess?

&gt; Qatar, hosting the World Cup would have a direct negative effect, including the slave labor used to construct the stadiums and giving direct support to an authoritarian, wasteful regime.

I agree with you here. Qatar's labor laws need to updated asap. I believe FIFA should ensure that modern labor practices are applied to the building of the stadiums.

&gt; The furor over alcohol availability has to do with the fact that alcohol is a large part of football culture (especially in Europe, which is the most important market in this) and having the World Cup in Qatar would severely restrict that. Can you same the same thing about Qat?

Alcohol may be a part of football culture in parts of the world but it isn't in the host country. Visitors should respect that. Likewise, visitors to the US should respect the fact that the use of certain drugs is illegal regardless of how ingrained it is in their culture (Qat in Yemen, marijuana in Jamaica, etc).

The reality is Qatar doesn't ban alcohol and will probably lift current restrictions in time for the World Cup. The US isn't that unrestrictive with alcohol itself: 

* A high minimum purchase age of 21, which most Europeans would find unacceptable.
* Many communities in the US have laws against the sale and possession of alcohol (there are over 500 municipalities in the United States that are dry)
* open container laws (exist in most US states), etc.

The difference between the US and Qatar is that Qatar is willing to change its laws and ease restrictions during the World Cup, which can't be said of the US.

&gt;It is a serious risk to national security to repeal DADT without first investigating thoroughly – in public hearings – the effect of the proposed repeal.


The Pentagon did that. Oh, sure, they didn't hold public hearings at which every neocon Congressman could stand up and mumble about how it's not about hating queers, but rather about....uh....something. The Pentagon is in a much better position to judge combat readiness than a bunch of overpaid paper-pushers in Washington.


&gt;We are engaged in a war on many fronts. Our troops are in harm’s way in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. This is no time to experiment with social engineering of the military.


Virtually every one of our allies in this war on many fronts has a fully integrated military—pretty much every EU nation aside of Greece (irony), for starters. Israel, for the clincher. They seem to have zero difficulties.


&gt;We are also gravely concerned about the effect that repealing DADT will have on religious freedom.


None at all, unless you define ""religious freedom"" as ""the right to make other people follow your religion's tenets.""


&gt;One senior army general, Lt. Gen. Thomas Bostick, said that those who oppose repeal are guilty of unacceptable attitudes that he reportedly described as “bigotry.”


He's absolutely correct.


&gt;Additionally, **expert analysts** have warned that a “non-discrimination” policy for sexual minorities will have broad-reaching effects on religious freedom.


Uh-oh, the dreaded EXPERT ANALYSTS...when religious kooks start talking about EXPERT ANALYSTS, I start making popcorn. Who are these analysts? What is their area of expertise? They wouldn't happen to be ""expert analysts"" such as the sham organization American College of Pediatricians, who the AFA, NARTH, and AFTAH delight in quoting, would they? Given these people's track record of creating impressive-sounding dummy organizations to spread utter fabrications as research, I demand credentials.


&gt; It is conceivable that chaplains will be forbidden to preach or speak about their denomination’s position on homosexuality.


Downside: none.


&gt;The Defense Department report on the likely effects of repealing DADT was not released until November 30, 2010. There is simply not enough time between then and adjournment to investigate and deliberate about this very important issue. For that reason, any consideration of repeal should be put off until next year.


...when we can de-rail it properly...


&gt;Moreover, we are deeply concerned about the methodology of the DOD report and survey. In view of General Bostick’s disturbing comments and Admiral Mullen’s and Secretary of Defense Gates’ unseemly cheerleading on this issue, we believe it behooves the next Congress to investigate whether proponents of repeal tried to create a climate of not-so-subtle intimidation in the Pentagon.


...by changing the fucking subject, and levying criminal charges against anyone with whom we disagree.


&gt;The rush to repeal DADT by January of 2011 is a slap in the face of the American people who are tired of bully politics.

&gt;Also, wouldn't a hot dry climate necessitate planning ahead and cooperation?

Which is worse, a hot dry climate or a climate where you die if you're caught outside for 4 months of the year and where no food is available at all?  Also consider that in Lapland you can't simply run naked and sleep under the stars if you feel like it.  You need some place to sleep, and you need clothing, and you must have fire.

&gt;Can you provide any logical reasons that some climates would produce more intelligent people?

""Stronger, better, faster"" isn't always the answer.  Nor is smarter.

People did not find overweight people necessarily more attractive but found that the wealth and status required to be overly satiated to be attractive.  It was a time when if you weren't royalty, you were doing back-breaking laboring work for carrots and potatoes and people wanted to look as wealthy as possible.  Nothing in that sense has changed, only the manor in doing so.  

Look at the way most Americans live; far above their budget with a house they couldn't afford with cash, a car they couldn't afford with cash, electronics that were bought with credit cards, etc.  

People want to look wealthy.

Its easy to understand why a physically fit body would naturally be more attractive.  Those who appear to be fit seem instinctively to be better mating partners because they appear to be without any problems/diseases.  Wild animals tend to avoid sexual contact with wounded or diseased animals.  We, being animals, are no different.

Lastly, I'm tired of people who are overweight complaining they are being criticized or lambasted.  There are certain medical conditions which inhibit one's ability to lose weight effectively.  However, most of the overweight 33% of America does not have any of these conditions.  

Much of the obesity problem in this country is from America switching from a laboring, factory producing country, to a desk-job type of country.  People move less and decide to work out less in their free time; therefore they gain weight.  They choose to eat poorly, eating boxed meals and fast food which are full of terrible preservatives and unhealthy chemicals that inhibit the ability to detect fullness.  Cities spread out rather than build up, insisting on the need for a car so that people are less likely to walk anywhere and opt to rather drive, even if just a short distance out of habit.

Before you decide that the media is to blame for foisting the belief that thin is beautiful, I think you need to step back and consider why being overweight isn't necessarily a disease or something to be a victim of but rather a serious problem with society today.

I'm not sure, Why do European countries not have the same problems Australia does with youth binge drinking when alcohol is just as widespread?

Israel declared independence in 1948 and has been more or less at war ever since. About 700 000 Palestinians were made refugees, and those parents and grandparents of the people fighting Israel today.

A year earlier, India and Pakistan were formed. Like Israel, the borders were determined by religion (India was supposed to be Hindu, Pakistan Muslim). Like Israel, many people wound up on the wrong side of the line and lost their home. 14.5 million people were displaced and a million were killed. But compared to Israel, India-Pakistan is relatively peaceful (It's still tense, but it's not nearly as violent). Two years before that, 12 million Germans were displaced from Eastern Europe at the end of WW2. Two million were killed. Some had come with the Nazis, but most had been there for generations living peacefully. You've probably never heard of them.

Israel-Palestine was escalated by the Six Day War in 1967 which captured Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights. The war killed about 15-25 000 people and sent 300 000 Palestinians into Jordan (many of whom had already been displaced 20 years earlier). That's a lot of kills and refugees. But at the same time, the Cambodian Civil War was killing 600 000 people and creating 2 million refugees, and the Nigerian Civil War had just begun, killing 1.2 million and displacing 1.8 million

Today, Israel's government is discriminatory and violent towards the Palestinians.  But that's hardly unique.  There are dozens of other countries with oppressive governments, but other than the occasional headline about Darfur or Myanmar or North Korea we never hear about them.  Why not?  Why does Israel deserve all this attention when the desperately poor third-world can't buy a story?

I don't know if it's anti-Semitism or just regular ole' racism, but there's definitely a sinister cause for this bias.  Either we attack Israel because they're Israeli, or we ignore Africa and Asia because they don't look like us.  I can't think of any other reason which would explain what I see.  I just can't.

The international media (US largely excluded) criticizing Israel reminds me of a teacher harassing a disrespectful student.  On one hand, the student deserves to be put in line.

First off, we have a tendency to overstate the power of a firearm, case in point: Have you ever seen the raw damage a european longsword can do to flesh? No? Do a youtube search for ""ARMA Deer Cutting"". Enjoy. 

So, the first thing to realize is that the damage that is listed for typical medieval weaponry is badly UNDERSTATED. You neither need to, nor should you make firearms godly weapons.

Second, ""primitive"" firearms do not go through armor like a hot knife through butter. A coat of plates is actually quite effective against firearms, there is some evidence that it will deflect a modern bullet up to .38 caliber, assuming it's a typical bullet, it will deflect a modern .22lr with ease. So, you don't need to adjust the armor rules, armor piercing doesn't come into it. Technically a longbow or a crossbow has more ""armor piercing"" capacity than a bullet.

The evidence for the holocaust is pretty much only based on eyewitness testimony. These witnesses include various outrageous lies such as melting Jewish fat to be made into soap and a lot of similar stories. The Nuremberg trials can be shown to be a sham (for a few reasons) but Nuremberg does not even deal with the Holocaust. 

There are many convenient explanations that follow a very predictable pattern. Zyclon-b is sold specifically for de-lousing - but really the sinister Nazis ordered a ""special"" version beefed up to kill people. The outside of Auschwitz says ""Work shall make you free"" -but really it was just to fuck with their victims think that they are going to a nice work camp. The victims were told that they were going to have a nice shower, they even brought people into a place that looked like a real shower - but this just shows how evil the Nazis really are - basically 90% of the story is just a bunch of eye witness accounts in this vein. 

Let me smash a few sacred cows. WWII had so much propaganda it is mind boggling. There is no evidence that Hitler was ""brought to justice"". Our best buddy Stalin a real mass murdering criminal (who's deeds we covered up) ""liberated"" the camps that conducted the Holocaust - but don't look for evidence, *the Nazis dug up and burned all the evidence, all the paper work, all the evidence of fuel needed (in spite of war shortages) all gone*. 

But what about those famous photos? Those people are clearly emaciated and disease ridden (we were bombing all supply routes in Germany for ages) and the ground froze hard in the winter, the bodies could not be disposed of. People looked like that all over Europe, it's called the atrocity of war. Everybody was doing fucked up shit to everybody. 

I know it's hard to accept that we've been lied to on this level - it was really hard to question the official story. I think 9/11 sort of liberated my mind to ask hard questions. Another reason for my conviction here is this. My grandparents are Polish Jews who fled during the war. My grandfather was Jewish and his father was killed by the Germans at some point during the war. So either I am one of those Jews who hates their own race or something is not right here. But either way I am standing up right now to say that to my knowledge, reports of a Nazi holocaust are nothing more than war time propaganda - of which there was a great deal.

I am sad for young Germans who grow up thinking they are descendants of pure evil. It's disgusting to me that people are willing to condemn millions of people in this way.

Because assassination is too obvious and risky, and risks creating a martyr.

Smearing and discrediting, on the other hand, not only stands a good chance of hamstringing or bringing down the man, but also the organisation he's a public representative of.  Before this erupted Assange was applying for a residence permit in Sweden, and lookng to set up a static, permanent Wikileaks presence there protected under their powerful whistleblower-protection laws.  Then the rape allegations surface, his residence permit is denied and Wikileaks legal protections and a safe harbour from which to operate.

Also, Wikileaks lives on donations, and that requires public support.

&gt; The Anglo-Saxons decided that Denmark wasn't enough, so they sailed over to Britannia and made war upon the peoples there

The original Anglo-Saxon tribes were invited over by the usurper King Vortigern to serve as mercenaries, however when he defaulted on his payments they overthrew him and settled his kingdom for themselves.

&gt; until the Norman French bastard Guillaume conquered Brittany and turned it into a French fiefdom

Guillaume le Batard (or William the Conqueror as he's more politely known) was the son of a Norse chieftain called Rollo who conquered Normandy in northern France and turned it in to his own fiefdom. 

Williams claim to the English throne was dubious at best, and his 'conquest' of England would be considered genocide by modern standards.

&gt; Richard Lionheart, who led Anglo-Saxon armies under Norman feudal lords to ravage and rape their way across Europe and Palestine until his death.

The Lionheart served in the Third Crusade, which was the first one that England formerly joined. He and his army travelled to the Middle East by ship, he purposely didnt capture Jerusalem because he knew he wouldnt be able to hold it and had a strong mutual respect with the leader of the islamic defenders, Saladin.

He died after he was captured by the Austrians on his journey back home, because of a personal feud with their King.

&gt; Henry Tudor, eighth of that name, risking war with Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and the papal states, because he wanted fresh pussy.

Henry Tudor was actually Welsh, he was descended from Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur, who was in turn descended from Rhys ap Gruffydd, King of the Southern Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth.

He did however risk war and excommunication for fresh pussy :)

&gt; She was queen for quite some time, and waged open wars against Catholic nations

During the Elizabethan period, Catholic Spain and France were the major European powers. Both regarded England as an upstart state and both were openly hostile due to Englands adoption of Protestantism and the fact that the ruler was female.

&gt; I completely forgot to mention fiends not in line for the throne, such as Jack the Ripper.

There've been more than a few hideous murderers from your country and in a much shorter time frame.

It's a shame your Texan ass couldnt resist distorting history to produce an entertaining but hostile account of the English people.

This would be a long thing to detail, but I would say that while the total freedom of speech is one of the most important item of the US constitution (and has major historical worldwide implications), it is also one of the main causes of your social problems in the past century. I would also dare to say that it's why you are one of the most progressive and backward countries at the same time.

Some extreme uneducated opinions should stay where they are, deep buried. Because people can haved ideas and are able to express them does not mean they should. 
""You niggers are just pedophile retard jewish homosexuals, go back to your country eating bananas. If you don't I'll kill 6 millions of your subrace"". Yeah. I actually think it's a good thing I am not entitled to say these things freely, for the peace of the society!!


Of course the problem is where to draw the limit between what can be said and what cannot. The US constitution says that everything is allowed. Europeans one that almost anything can. Between this ""almost"" and ""all"" stand a mere 76 million deaths due to WWI and WII.

And before I have to justify myself: I am not in favour of censorhip, on the contrary. Please have a look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country) Wikipedia entry, for example at the French and German entries.

I'm originally from Chicago, but I speak Polish and live in Poland, so I'm not very far away from the former Yugoslavia, nor did I have much trouble attaining what I admit is a rather basic level of proficiency.

On my first trip, I decided to hitchhike down to Montenegro (which had still been a part of what was left of Yugoslavia), and I stopped by Priština for two nights. I didn't have much money, or anyone to travel with, so I just hung around the city and hopped on a bus to Montenegro after 2 days.

The second time, a friend and I proposed a project at the Eastern European Studies Center at our university. This was just a few months after Kosovo had declared independence, and we wanted to see what the situation was like on the ground as far as inter-ethnic co-existence goes. We went to a variety of places: Kosovska Mitrovica (a town split in two), Priština (the predominantly Albanian capital), Djakova and its small Serb enclave, and Štrpce, an elongated Serb enclave in the South that runs along the Macedonian border.

We mostly talked about their relations with the ""others,"" and whether there was any hope people could live in peace side by side. We met some people with really interesting identities, like this one Gypsy in Štrpce. Normally, Gypsies in the area are shunned by Albanians, who consider them to be on the Serbian side. But this Gypsy happened to be a Muslim Gypsy, yet he was shunned by fellow Muslims. So he lived in the Orthodox Christian, Serb-dominated enclave in the South. While still a Sunni Muslim, he identified very strongly with Serbs, spoke Serbian, celebrated Orthodox Christmas and Easter (but Ramadan, as well).

There's some pictures from that trip in my flickr feed. [The one with the roadblock and the EU sign with bullet holes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arcsi/2551873628/lightbox/) is at the military checkpoint at the eastern end of the enclave.

The DMCA only gives you protection if you host content by your users *unknowingly*.

It is easy to claim that the few (how many of them are there? 4? 5?) Reddit admins cannot possibly moderate their entire site.

It is somewhat harder for anyone to believe that Amazon would not know that they were hosting Wikileaks, an internationally renowned controversial website after they announced that they were moving to AWS hosting. Secondly, while Amazon may not know who particularly owns the Wikileaks content they do know Wikileaks *does not*.

In the best case, Wikileaks content is in the public domain by virtue of being produced by the US government. In the more likely scenario, Wikileaks content is subject to copyright in various EU nations that give US government works the same copyright allowances that native government works receive. Also, Wikileaks 'cable messages' are two-way communication so the non-American government side may very well maintain copyright. 

Finally, while AWS may be protected by the DMCA in America, there are no such protections in the EU. Amazon may feel it is okay to *risk* Reddit content because there is no knowledge on their side about Reddit content, and the entities that Reddit may infuriate will be on a small order. However, taking the *risk* with Wikileaks content after possibly *knowing* is in the possession of copyrighted content and fearing that *governments (plural!)* will be the opposition is a whole other matter.

First off, if you get the change to do anything to boost your CV/portfolio, do it! Exchange to another country would be fantastic, and if you had a second language that would put you to the top of many piles.

Do placements. 12 months or just over summer, it doesn't matter, just do them. As a business student, look for placements that give a better overview of a business (so don't go for marketing departments etc), project management or consulting positions are probably the best for seeing a lot of a business and for the skills that you'll pick up along the way (time management, planning, budgeting, MS Office, Report Writing).

Remember that everything you learn at university is theory and that when you enter the world of business, a lot of it won't matter. Don't go into a job citing different papers and reports, read them if you want, but you don't want to sound like a student/graduate.

Build up your social skills. You could be the best business mind in the world, but if you can't hold a conversation you won't get the job.

Work the shit jobs so that you get a feel for the bottom of organisations. To fit in with the one above, if you can get a bar job, this is low paid work where your social skills are really put to the test to maximise your tips. But I'm guessing you're in the US so it may be a few years before you can get a bar job.

Ok so that opens up a lot of channels into the business world, but you want to go into the space industry? Unless you do an engineering/physics undergrad followed up with at minimum a masters you're not going to be in the hands on roles with any space company. But from a business perspective, you could be a project manager within the industry.

To be honest I think that you're limiting your aspirations far too much with space industry...BUT Europe and Asia are the places to go to get into the industry. More companies, with no centralised space agency in many countries.

*And if you're interested in getting to the top of a business (potentially in the space industry) a word to the wise, 75% of the top paid board members for big companies have an accounting background.*

&gt; The Free Market Fairy cannot and never will cure our ills. 

Nobody ever said it would, just that it will get much much closer than any other system -- and the historical record is clear on that fact.

&gt; The only thing that has ever protected the interests of the poor and working class has been an overarching authority that can force compliance on the part of the business class.

Compliance with what?  Some misguided notion of social justice that causes more harm than good?   No thanks.

OK, in the absence of force, give me a single example of a voluntary consensual transaction that does not benefit both sides from where they would be without that transaction.  Just laughing it off isn't an answer, it's a dodge.

&gt; So you're not only ignorant of what socialism really means, you're also ignorant of biology and evolution. We are social creatures. Cooperation is what allowed us to thrive, a state we were forced to because we're not as strong as other apes, not as fast as most animals and so forth. The only thing we have to our advantage is our oversized brains which allow us to reason out the benefits of cooperation rather than isolation.

You seem to be missing the difference between *voluntary* cooperation for our own good and *forced* cooperation -- an oxymoron if ever there was one.   The results between the two speak for themselves.   The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore.  Cuba is dying.  North Korea is a hellhole.  How many times do we need to run this failed ideology through the ringer before people finally give up on it.

&gt; Those riots there are the natural response to the power grab by their nations elites. 

LOL, it's not a power grab that's causing the problem, it a necessary elimination of dependency.   Socialism always fails because you eventually run out of other people's money; and that is *exactly* what is happening in Greece and the other failing European states.  The riots are because the people who have been living off the efforts of others are finding out that their gravy train is running dry.  They are protesting the removal of the appropriation of other people's money.

But ""saudade"" doesn't only vary from ""to miss"" in intensity, as it also is greatly embedded in our national entity. This wikipedia excerpt may shed some light:
&gt;In the latter half of the 20th century, saudade became associated with the feeling of longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from an emigratory trend from the motherland, historically speaking saudade is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called 'Golden Age', synonymous with the era of discoveries, Portugal undeniably rose to the status of a world power, and its monarchy was one of the richest in Europe at the time. But with the rise of competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of saudade, aptly described by a sentence of its national anthem - 'Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal' (Let us once again lift up the splendour of Portugal).

I generally see a much greater balance of young and old. The politics is also very different. 

3) The size factor is a direct issue to the average health of the US population as they have gotten older. Face as most Americans get older they have not had great diets. It shows. Also many women who have had children and are now comfortable with exploring their sexuality show the wear and tear of having children. 

I do not have any simple resolution for you. These things are not going away anytime soon. Here for me is the difference. I am now 43 years old and been part of the swing/poly/bdsm scene since I was 18. I am married to a women I have known for almost 16 years (married 9). She is 32 and looking to have her first kid. My life and hers will change with that and certainly so will what she looks like. We have a third who has two children.  She certainly has put on some weight in the time we have known her. It is important to note this we did not become this situation solely based on physical appearance for the long term. Don't get me wrong physical attraction is important but I don't use it as my only factor. Nor do my partners.  However her personality and what she means to us is a far greater factor for us in the long term. Do I want her to lose the weight sure. Am I going to ride her about it to the point of destroying her self esteem? No. 

I have also seen that once people discover they are comfortable with exploring their new found sexuality they tend to do it like kids who have just left home and gone to college. However when you are older this behavior can seem very immature. Sometimes one person has come into these activities but their partner has not. Yet the partner comes along anyway. Not everyone comes to the some level or even the same direction as their partner. 

One partner is kinky the other isn't. That doesn't mean they are not a fine couple it just means that there are certain areas they are not the same on. 

Even swing with it's sexual openness  does not mean you will be into everyone else and finding that person or persons is not always going to be easy. I wish I had a bumper sticker answer for your issue. I do not. I am not sure there is one.

I don't think of the world of 1899 in 2010 terms.  Doing so involves the historical fallacies of [Presentism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_historical_analysis%29), [Chronological snobbery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery), and [The Historians Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy).

So, in the world of 1899 when the European powers and a newly emerging Japanese Empire was carving up the last bits of Africa and claiming every island in the South Pacific, here was an island chain that had just started the process (yet was unsuccessful in defeating the Spanish until 1899 with the help of the US) of declaring its independence in the area, but would have had no ability to defend itself from another foreign power that would have used the thinnest pretext of an excuse to invade the Philippines.

So, the US as early as 1899 had already determined that it in no way wanted to colonize and annex the country, but that the nation did not have the ability to properly self govern a fractious (and still sectarian) island chain.  It simply lacked the experience of government, the economy was barely more than a plantation system, and the vast majority of the population were illiterate farmers.  As early as 1902 the first of thousands of teachers from the US arrived to educate the population.

In 1902 the US government handed all but heavy military operations over to the Philippine constabulary, established a parliament with Fillipinos making up the lower house but was replaced by a fully self-determining one in 1916.  They eliminated the Catholic church as the state religion, and educated the merely 10% literate population.


So, while I agree that invading and conquoring a country is wrong (though that's historically a rather new concept only coming about in the last 100 years or so...) and this is a case of White Mans Burden clearly.

That's not about their ancestors - it's about THEM. In the mid 20th century, the Canadian government took all the children from their traditional ways, and 're-educated' them in boarding schools. They were abused physically, sexually and emotionally. They were taught that every aspect of their culture, being and who they are was wrong and had to change. This included their language, practices, religious traditions - everything. 

If you were ripped from your parents and abused for 13 years, taught that you were basically worthless, what do you think the psychological effect would be? These social problems have more to do with what we did to these people in recent history. 

That said, I work with many band councils, and governance is a major problem. Like in any government, concentrated power corrupts, and so leaders need to be accountable. It's too bad your experience with a few bands is negative, but there are many successful bands who have held to their traditions and managed to modernize, along with providing for their people.

I don;t know what your background is, but remember, they are FIRST Nations - meaning, they have treaties that entitle them to the lands the Europeans stole. Therefore, these treaties provide entitlements based on these agreements, as they were here first. To change it, we have to renegotiate the treaties - that's not going to happen unless we take away these rights by force. Unless that's what you are advocating?

Also, be careful in your generalizations. There are a lot more First Nations people living across the country that you may realize - I work with several high ranking folks in my organization and unless they tell you, you'd have no idea. I think there are more 'exceptions' than you may realize.

EDIT - I am open to my points being criticized, and would like for those who disagree to use their words in addition to the down arrow.

Not really.  The laws just aren't as strong as they are in Europe.

&gt;They pay shit wages to the people who perform the most important tasks, like security, cleaning, waiting tables, and answering the phone.

This is a product of capitalism.  If any monkey can do your job then your wages will reflect that.  Americans as a whole do not have a problem with this.

&gt;60+ hours a week might be normal in the US, but in France, you're not allowed to work more than 35.

I wouldn't say 60+ hours a week is normal, though obviously that depends on a lot of different factors.  Working more hours is part of the American culture, and it always has been.  You could argue that it's one of the reasons why America became an economic superpower and France did not (obviously it's only one of hundreds of reasons).

&gt;Americans are giving up their rights at every turn

Most Americans don't fly on a regular basis, and the Patriot Act has had zero effect on at least 99% of the population.  It's no surprise that people don't care about things that have no effect on them whatsoever.  Americans are not unique in this regard.

&gt;The Pilots Union threatened to ground planes, and are now exempt from screening. Since they don't give a shit about their customers, they won't stand up for their rights.

The Pilot's Union got their way because you can't possibly make the argument that screening pilots makes flying safer.  Their situation was just absurd.  You can't really argue with the fact that the new scanners and pat downs do indeed make flying safer (just like a full strip search and cavity search would make flying safer), and many Americans honestly feel that it is worth it to them to give up some privacy in exchange for safety.

&gt;It's clear and obvious that Americans want to live in a police state. If that weren't the case, they wouldn't keep giving up control of their lives to the government.

The government has very little effect on the day to day life of the average American.  America is so ridiculously far from being a police state right now.

My overall point is that you seem to have a problem with American culture as a whole, and you expect Americans to protest against it.  You are assuming that Americans hold all the same values and priorities as you do, which is false.  Americans generally embrace capitalism and accept the negative consequences that come with it.

From a Breeder, it depends on the Breed. You are guaranteed a certain look, if that matters to you. You are also guaranteed certain aspects of personality; a Persian will be on the lazier side of the scale, an Abyssinian very energetic. You are also guaranteed certain aspects of intelligence; with a shelter cat, you will never know if it can be trained to do various things until you try, with a pedigree cat you'll know before you try.

You can have a cat that is less healthy than a shelter cat (inbreeding) or, depending on the breed, just as healthy as any shelter cat. For example, Abyssinians have been around since the late 1800s, were nearly decimated in Europe during WWII but have since rebounded beautifully. The Abyssinian Breeder Council doesn't like the mutated super-breeding that goes on, producing such animals as the [Bambino](http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/bambino-cat.html); they strive to keep the genepool wide, breeding cats that are less-than-show perfect to produce pet-quality and sometimes show-quality animals. 

With a Breeder, you will probably avoid things like FIV or Feline Leukemia, as the Breeder can guarantee you that your cats parents, grandparents, etc. are all free of that. Of course, not everything is a guarantee: pedigree cats have the same odds of getting FIB that all cats have. Not to mention that a Shelter cat can have just as narrow a genepool as any pedigree animal; cats don't discriminate in regards to incest and you may end up with a cat that has a Father/Brother. Such close incestuous breeding does not happen with pedigree animals.

I think most xenophobic behaviour is born of ignorance. The way to fight ignorance is with education. Inviting educated people to our nations regardless of where they are from or what skin their colour is, ultimately benefits us.

I've long though Britain would benefit from attracting more professionals from Asia. British culture was enriched by what the empire took from other cultures during the height of the empire. While taking from other nations by force is no longer a viable option it still wouldn't hurt to learn from and invite these people over to improve our society.

Faint notions of what we were are no longer relevant, we have to look to the future and at a new world. Whether we like it or not the world is going through globalisation and it will mean we all rely on each other regardless of race, religion or location.

It isn't a time for abject racism it is a time for celebration. I've actually been to Sweden and Swedish people were very nice to me. I'm mixed race but I do have an English name. I still can't pass for white(though my strong British accent gives clear indication to where I am from).

Regardless though I stuck to the cities in Sweden(I spent 4 years in mainland Europe going to various nations while studying there) and I have to say people were quite nice to me. I was probably more strongly associated with my accent as a lot of people seemed to very quickly pick up where I was from upon hearing me talk but I was told to stay away from non-city places in fear of experiencing racism.

Depends. What part of the Roman Empire? Close to its glory or close to its *end*? If you tell me that it is close to its end, you will be both factually correct and have answered your own question.

The point is that history shows us that mankind's morals are cyclical. They become better closer to an empire's glory, and become worse closer to its end.

In the past, there have been many ""end of times."" Every time a civilization was destroyed, it *was* its ""end of times."" However, nowadays we can no longer count on geographical and political separations that caused the rest of the world to remain unnaffected when one civilization was destroyed.

I beg to differ. People are greedy and that greed needs to be regulated. Individuals alone in general are not fit to judge what they deserve or if they are worth what they got by accident when abusing instabilities of the system.

&gt;How do you determine what an 'unreasonable personal profit' is?

There are many ways. Most people can do it naturally to certain extent, but ultimately it boils down to the distribution of consequences where individual profits result in less productive, inefficient etc society output than would happen otherwise if the profit capital would be naturally distributed. Here we simply have a progressive taxation which taxes high income people more than low income and naturally limits the ability of the rich to gain power. While far from perfect, it is still working to some extent as we have no homeless or very poor people here in Finland at all.

Israel got billions in funding from the US, Germany, the EU, etc. Billions more for the Jewish people in general for various Holocaust museums in Washington, New York, London, et al., billions even more than that for the Anti-defamation League, AIPAC, JINSA. All told, guilt money because of the Holocaust has probably netted a trillion dollars, conservatively.

Poland got . . . Polish jokes.

They were murdered in the millions. In fact, when the first inmate of Auschwitz died recently, it was a Christian-Pole who was part of the Polish resistance against Hitler. The news articles were almost embarrassed to have to point out that he wasn't a Jew. (Through Hollywood and carefully crafted international media campaigns, they've co-opted the issue, re-branded it as their own . . . as if millions of Poles didn't die, too.) 

It's sad that for *their* suffering, Poles got nothing. It's even worse when you read stories about Israelis going to Poland to visit various concentration camps and how they crap in their hotel rooms and abuse Polish maids and domestic staff. Thuggish young Israelis behave abominably in Poland. It's heartbreaking when you read some of the articles on their abusive antics toward the Poles.

Like this quote from an article from *Polish Weekly Magazine,* May 10th 2007, by Anna Szulc (quoting hotel staff regarding Israeli teens): ""It happens sometimes, that the hotel service has to collect human excrement from hotel beds and washbasins.""

Or this quote from another article: ""'We have resigned from admitting Israeli youth once and for all,' admits Agnieszka Tomczyk, assistant manageress in a chain of hotels called System. 'We could not afford to refund the losses after their stays any more.' These losses include demolished rooms, broken chairs and tables and human excrement on walls or trash bins.""

Once the country is split up into isolated geopolitical regions, people will be able to simply vote with their feet, and the failure modes of democracy that involve the tyranny of the majority will not be able to affect as many people at once because everything is significantly more decentralized. Allowing anyone in the union to easily move between these smaller countries as citizens with full rights to live and work in whichever nation they want is essential, and would be one of the few extra things that the continental-level government would need to do. This should allow people to choose which set of laws they want to be governed under.

Conservatives from the various stretches of red states will be unable to impose their views on more liberal regions of the union and vice-versa. If the midwest fails, they will be unable to blame ""liberal elitists from the northeast"" or anything to that affect. If the northeast fails, they won't be able to blame ""those rednecks from the south"" on it.

When people can be arrested for photographing a police officer on a public street in broad daylight, thereby making people afraid of gathering information that could be used to hold the government (the police) accountable, you're in a police state.

""Latin"" relates to [Romance languages.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages)  The most widely spoken ones include Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian but there are many more.  Because of Spain and Portugal's colonization, their respective languages became dominant in Latin America starting in the 1500s.

Based on this history we could fairly say that French, Italian and Romanian people are as much Latin as the people of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, etc.  

Here's another [historical connection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_america#Etymology_and_definitions) for this term between Europe and America:

&gt; The term Latin America was supported by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico, as a way to include France among countries with influence in America and to exclude Anglophone countries, and played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire.

For this reason, many people of Latin American ancestry are ok with the term ""Hispanic"".  It may sound racist to some and it doesn't acknowledge the Native American portion of their background.  At least it focuses on the Spanish part of their heritage and makes a distinction between Europe and the New World.

Does anyone else think it's odd that the term ""Latino"" (a Spanish word) is used to describe this ethnic group in the US?

On a stretch of forlorn beach on the north coast of California, I used to while away my school break summer days, generally doing what a 13 year old boy does when left to his own devices.

One particularly lovely, fog-free day, I noticed a pair of young adult women sheltering in a pile of driftwood. Not just any young women, but TOPLESS, hot young women. I just had to get a closer look. This was something entirely new to me.

Not brave enough or clever enough to go right up and just ask for an onion, I decided to sneak. And sneak I did, crawling like a horny little snake, hoping the driftwood would provide adequate cover. I managed to get within 20 feet or so, popping my head up now again to get an eyeful of tanned skin.

I don't remember how long I was there, but my focus was so narrowed on my prize that I didn't notice several other young boys popping up out of nowhere, apparently adopting the sneak-and-peek strategy as well. Not surprisingly, the girls noticed one of us and said aloud, ""We can see you guys!"" And then they put their shirts on. Damn it all!

All us little peeping toms shuffled off, avoiding each others' gazes. I think I started to head home. Then, I stopped and thought, ""But now they're alone again..."" My hormones had given me a jolt of not exactly confidence, but a feeling of invincibility. I turned around and walked straight back to the driftwood pile again.

They were indeed sans tops again. Shaking somewhat, I walked right up and said, ""hi"", in what was probably a very wobbly, edge-of-manhood voice. They glanced up, casually, and said ""hi"" back. It was then I noticed the accents. German? French? Swedish? Whatever! I have adored European women ever since.

They shared their water with me, and we just hung out for a while. Sorry, I'd love to tell a Summer of '42 sort of tale that ended with me getting devirginized by a pair of Euro-nymphs, but in reality I just went home with a huge, shit-eating grin on my face.

Source?

&gt;While the “formal reasons” for the outbreaks of the wars were different, the Second World War was created through the same process as the First: the reorganization of the balance of power system to accommodate the new realities of the 20th century.

And the same happened during the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War.  Your point is a generalization.

&gt;Ultimately, as we know, these efforts failed, largely due to the ideological motivations of Hitler and the Nazis that you have mentioned. However, as I have attempted to briefly explain, that ideological madness operated in a system which was very much linked to the ending of the First World War. The time between the two wars demonstrates a political link between Versailles’ “solutions” and their failures to prevent the invasion of Poland in 1939.

For as many links as you can find I can find breaks.

But I don't want to have that conversation. 

The important point here is that none of these western european countries have to spend money to protect themselves, the US does it for them. If they had to pay for their own protection, certainly resources being used to pay for their social programs would have to be cut. Instead, they're all milking off of the American military industrial complex.

This is a point the progressives and paulians can come together on, if one considers Barney Frank a progessive. There are lot of imbalances seen in the world today can be attributed to the US subsidizing protection of other countries and being enabled to do so through the Fed. If you removed the Fed and allowed interest rates to fluctuate as per the market, the cost of debt would sky rocket forcing the US to cut back their military, intelligence apparatus and state department, which would serve as a benefit for everyone. 

Ron Paul would be the first to say that if a bill came in front of him to cut spending over seas to pay for shoring up the social programs at home, he would vote for it. 

Just as most on this forum recognize, so does he, that its secretive, corrupt, and even criminal government that needs to go first, and in that, he is the people's greatest ally.

Also I can understand your irritation at the term ""Asian"" it typically refers to the South East part, which I guess, does include India, but their population is so large it makes sense they would be defined as ""Indians"" the same applies to Russia as well. Afghanis are part of the Middle East, which is predominately Arab, and goes all the way to Egypt. Which brings me back to the idea of African descent and country of origin. They're definitely of African descent, but they live in Egypt, and they typically identify with Islam, so they're part of the Arab ethnic group, but again they're from Egypt. It's simply easier to call them Egyptian.

* That's exactly the problem here.  The balance between security and freedom is a very difficult one to achieve.  The main problem is that everybody draws the line somewhere different.

I'm saying that because nature does not feed and clothe us by default, the task of feeding and clothing the members of our communities falls on the community members.  I'm saying that when we are without food and clothing, we're desperate enough to accept any conditions -- no matter how exploitative -- if it means we'll be able to survive.  Your ""voluntary consensual agreement"" society results in laments like this:

&gt; Work 60 to 80 hours a week for crummy $300.00 paycheck, go home do cleaning, panic over bills that are never caught up , sleep, ( during sleep of course obsess about bills.) Repeat daily until severe mental depression wins.

That comes from a state that passed ""Right to Work.""  In every state that's passed it, they've learned it really means ""Right to Starve While Working.""

&gt; Nobody ever said it would, just that it will get much much closer than any other system -- and the historical record is clear on that fact.

The idea that the free market will correct this or any other problem has one fatal flaw:  it's *never happened, and never will.*  You can't point to a single example where the free market, when given more latitude, has done anything but further enrich the wealthy and create poverty and suffering for everyone else.  The only time social and economic mobility was the rule rather than the exception was when a government maintained strict regulation and oversight into market affairs.

&gt; OK, in the absence of force, give me a single example of a voluntary consensual transaction that does not benefit both sides from where they would be without that transaction. Just laughing it off isn't an answer, it's a dodge.

Oh, you were serious.  I'm sorry.  You made a statement that was so amazingly laughable, so absolutely invalid in terms of human history that the only response I could provide was laughter.

&gt; You seem to be missing the difference between voluntary cooperation for our own good and forced cooperation -- an oxymoron if ever there was one. The results between the two speak for themselves. The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Cuba is dying. North Korea is a hellhole. How many times do we need to run this failed ideology through the ringer before people finally give up on it.

Yes.  All those *military dictatorships* are dead or dying.  They are not representative of their people which is a **core principle of socialism.**  Socialism is about the rule of the people, not the elite.  Better to say, how are the socialist democracies of Sweden, France, Germany, Denmark and so forth holding up?  Because those are examples of socialism brought in -- admittedly gradually rather than by revolution -- by the will of the people instead of by fiat under military rule.  Socialism does not work when imposed from the top down.  This is a principle that Marx emphasized repeatedly until he died, but the military junta within the Soviet Union and Communist China didn't get the message.  Western Europe did.

&gt; They are protesting the removal of the appropriation of other people's money.

Ye gods.  They're not protesting the fact that their lives were made richer through democratically approved socialist policies.  They're protesting the fact that the elite made a grab for their money and they're not going to stand for it.  Of course, that doesn't fit with your anti-state message so of course you have to revise it somewhat.  You enjoy that, but the rest of us will stick to reality.

You don't seem to realize that what Rome was or was not doing in Israel 2 millennium ago has very little importance to Europe, Germany, France, Italy and Spain adopting western philosophy almost 1500 years later.

&gt;I didn't say it was easy, just wondering how many more trillions for the intellectual brilliance of man to master simple mindless evolutionary processes.

It would indeed be more lucrative to treat instead of cure.  That being said, that's not generally the motive behind most research.  As for evolutionary processes, they are *not* simple.  Man has ever wiped out one virus from existence, and even then we're not sure.  We can't make a vaccine for AIDS yet, so that process can't even be started.  As for cancer, every type of cancer is a different beast and must be approached on its own.

&gt;NOT dicing and slicing, from inert.

Oh, you want abiogenesis?  Have you seen that new NASA report about a second type of life that uses arsenic?  Or have you been keeping up with the [latest research](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6QYDdgP9eg)?

&gt;Who killed the little babies?

Your god.  Whether by drowning them in a global flood or destroying them in Sodom.

&gt;Yeah ""peace, peace, peace"" is just around the sudden destruction corner.

Your opinion on the matter is really quite irrelevant.  We're dealing with facts, not your incredulity.

&gt;Just how much taxation for you to self rule again?

If everyone were to ""self rule"", we'd be in a state of anarchy.  I don't want that.  Do you?

&gt;The worshipers of false gods to this day do all kinds of evil deeds.

So do the worshipers of your god.  Atheists, on the other hand, are more moral, if you can trust prison population statistics - they're vastly underrepresented in the US prison population.

&gt;Slaves into the house of Israel were not sold outside of her house.

Those rules only applied to non Israeli slaves.

&gt;Suppose God believes learning something is morally superior to simply being created 

The argument here does not address the regulation of slavery.  My point still stands - one does not regulate what one finds abhorrent - one condemns it.  God has laws against murder and adultery of all things - he didn't chose to regulate those, but he decided to regulate slavery instead of condemning it.  Apparently sleeping around is more evil than owning another person for life, according to your god.

&gt;Hierarchy is the order of all things.

If you're very narrow minded, I suppose you might see it this way.

&gt;Is the land equal to the ocean, or a valley to a mountain?

Irrelevant - we're talking about human life, not geographical features.  As with slavery, your bible seems to think it imperative to mark some lives as subservient to others.

&gt;I bow to a GOD of Truth, Wisdom &amp; order.

You bow to a figment of your imagination that endorses slavery, genocide, and rape.

&gt;The very test that time shall prove out, GOD's Wisdom Vs. mans.

Prophecy bullshit...

&gt;Thus GOD discriminated, passed Judgement.

First Lot, a supposedly ""holy"" and ""righteous"" man had to offer up his two daughters to be gang-raped.  What a righteous and christian thing to do.

&gt;The Jews, the House of Israel has been and shall be GOD's first and direct example to the nations, just as man is to woman, in line with the Hierarchy of all things.

Which is exactly my point:  the very existence of this hierarchy, one over another arbitrarily, is unjust.  You worship an unjust god.

&gt;It is not mans charge to bend his fellows knee to Christ, Christ shall keep his own word.

You are dodging the argument - your bible directly supports treating your fellow as yourself, unless your ""fellow"" is from a tribe that doesn't worship the same god or is a woman, at which point it supports subjugation, enslavement, or murder.

&gt;Proving that man can't govern his own affairs.

And your god felt it necessary to damn tens of thousands for not being able to follow a set of rules he knew were impossible to follow?  How kind and caring your god is, how benevolent.

&gt;By Christ's mercy all things are made new.

Are you saying that those who were in hell are now in heaven after your christ's supposed crucifixion?  What is your biblical support for that?

&gt;I'll throw in Greece and the USA as the best that man has accomplished at self rule, the last door is closing.

That's rather irrelevant to the point I was making.  I shall reiterate:  I have a different point of view that doesn't include blind hero worship.

The U.S. is a large country, that is true. However, if a robust public transportation system was implemented on the East and West coast, maybe some parts of Texas, where the majority of the U.S. population lives, I do not see how your position holds water.

The majority of travel Americans make are to their morning commute, destinations within their town, and long distances during holidays. Ask yourself, how does public transportation (perhaps a combination of a few) not meet all of these travel needs. Any destination can be matched by walking, bussing, taking a train or plane or a combination of these.

&gt; Take a look at an actual to scale map and let me know if rail would be a viable option.

I am a polysci major and I know the E.U. population density fairly well tyvm. But I thought some statistics might be helpful: 

**Population density in km**

*Netherlands: 401 -- UK: 255 -- Japan: 873*

*Europe average: 105 persons per km2*

**U.S. and le States**

*New Jersey: 439.39 -- Rhode Island: 387.35 -- Massachusetts: 312.67 -- Connecticut: 271.40 --California: 83.85 -- Texas: 30.75*

*U.S. average: 32*

As you can see, while our national average is well below The U.K's, The Netherlands, and Europe as a whole, there are States that exceed the most densely populated countries in Europe. While a lack of public transportation makes sense for say Utah (10.50), it does not for the other 60% of the population living on the coast. Furthermore, there are other large countries with similar population density's to the U.S. (Spain comes to mind) that are far more supportive of their public transportation systems. If they can do it why cant we?

This is true but there is a very fine line between reactionary and overreactionary as is the case with the current TSA procedures.  As far as terrorist threats are concerned, the US has fared quite well in the world.  In stark contrast, compare this to the IRA bombings in the UK last century or various upheavals that occurred in Eastern Europe after the USSR collapsed.  The US has been attacked by two foreign governments in over 200 years of history and has had a very small number of 'terrorist' attacks above that.  

""We have nothing to fear but fear itself.""  - Pres. FD Roosevelt

This quote fits nicely with our current regime being overreactionary and paranoid of future attacks.  As for cyber threats, if there was such imminent danger, why hasn't one already occurred?  What is stopping a foreign government or militant agency from staging a 'cyber war' now?  The internet has been global for way over a decade but only now there is a threat?

&gt;Also, just because something is publicly available does not mean it is unclassified (as you implied when saying ""entering all of them into the public, unclassified domain""). As odd as it sounds, being published does not necessarily mean it is declassified (meaning that anyone who has knowledge of it from its classified status is still forbidden to comment on it for example).

Taken from Wikipedia: [Pentagon Papers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_papers)

These portions of the Papers were subsequently published by Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations.[5]

&gt;it's not all that irresponsible of a group that you're paying money to prepare you for a job to warn you about things that can hurt your chances of getting that job.

This is entirely true and I don't disagree at all so long as we are speaking strictly of private corporations.  However, when its a government agency telling the tax paying American public, even students that wish to work for the US Federal government, that they should have no access to documents prepared and paid for by money they've paid to the US, is ridiculous.  I've paid for the jobs to exist so that those documents could be made.  I should have every right to view that publicly funded document.

&gt;The government represents us, that means we are entrusting them to make good decisions on our behalf. It does not mean that everything is subject to a public vote or discussion. Of course, we have to have some way to judge whether they are representing us well, but that does not imply that we need to know every detail and internal deliberation.

This is exactly why it is a problem for the government to have these state secrets.  We *don't* know that they are representing our best interests in a global perspective and the released documents clearly show that they *weren't.*  

It's like taking a dog for a walk in a large city and somewhere along the way, you say fuck it, I'm going to drop the leash, he'll stick around right?  Likely the dog will find something to chase and runoff and eventually you lose track of it but continue to walk down the sidewalk in the hopes that the dog is being safe and will eventually return.  Instead, the dog is wreaking havoc, running in the street causing disruptions in traffic flow until it comes in contact with another dog and gets into a fight.  Had you not dropped the leash, it would be entirely possible to avoid the conflict but because you are no where around, a rumble begins and by the time you catch up and see the fight taking place, its already too late to stop them.

Government transparency is an absolute must to keep our government in check and ensuring that it is representing us, the tax paying citizens that have elected them into power.  If we learned anything from the Vietnam War, it should have ** *atleast* ** been that...",True,False,,idarkiswordi,0,0

there is a difference between fanbelt and timing belt. if your fanbelt breaks it's no big deal. if the timing belt breaks your engine is probably fried. nevermind the waterpump that stops working, you're f*cked in any way.

changing your oil every 5000 miles is a myth. if american cars are anything like european cars, you can go 100k without a change. I change my oil yearly, which means about 10 to 15.000 miles. When I do change the oil, I also change the filter. check if the sparkplugs are ok. clean out the air filter. check fluid levels, stuff like that. check brakes
etc

Timing belts have a certain lifespan, you can google the type of belt your car uses and make sure you change it before the max mileage OR the max lifespan, depends which one you hit first. Timing belt changes are expensive but very, VERY necessary.  usual lifespan is about 60-70.000 miles or 5 to 7 years. 

fanbelts snapping aren't that big of a deal but it is an inconvenience. you can look that one up too. if your fanbelt snaps you can just pull over and replace it (a fanbelt is $30 - $40, and changing it easy)

This statement is pretty disputable. It's true that the United States donates billions of dollars in humanitarian aid throughout the world. However, we also happen to be the richest country in the world, and, as a percentage of our gross national income, we actually [give significantly less than many European countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_charitable_countries#Official_Development_Assistance_by_country_as_a_percentage_of_GNI_.28April_2010.29).

Not quite true either. The U.S. funds [about 22% of the U.N.'s regular budget, and about 27% of its peacekeeping operations](http://www.betterworldcampaign.org/issues/funding/us-dues-and-contributions.html).

And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the boook of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done. Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire; and if any one's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

I can't address the[ ""hate"" thingie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Mudd), but is a conduct and activity of no social or generational value, its even of less value than lying, cheating &amp; stealing. Don't tell because nobody cares.

&gt;No god tells me that women are inferior and should subject themselves to men

GOD did not make woman to be inferior, GOD addresses man subsequently woman next.

&gt;No god tells me to pray instead of seeking medical attention

Virtually all of pharmacy boys magic comes from nature, where did GOD state one should not see medical aid?

&gt;No god tells me to hate people who believe in the same god but in a “wrong” way. 

To hate sin, not the sinner but offer repentance.

&gt;No god tells me to be fruitful and multiply, then says that sex for fun is bad

Well it ain't public business either.

&gt;No god tells me to hate people who look different than me

Where does GOD say to hate other people?

&gt;No god tells me to start a war over another land having the wrong god or the wrong types of people
Men have warred for every reason under the sun, for, against or without GOD.

&gt;No god makes promises to me about being a martyr,

I think this is mostly an allah thingie, many have been ""martyred"" for great and small just causes.

&gt;No god makes open-ended promises that will never come true about Armageddon

Time to GOD is not the same to men, once the game is again under foot there are few survivors.

&gt;No god promises eternal life to me, so I understand that this life is precious.

All are subject to the first death, it’s the second we're advising others to avoid.

In the States, especially in the South and the West, calling for a tax hike is nearly always a political death sentence, regardless of the reason. That's why, in a time when most state and municipal governments are running deficits in the millions or billions, they're slashing funding for *everything* rather than raise taxes. If you try to raise taxes for education, conservatives and some moderates will howl that those stupid liberals think they can solve the problems of the schools by throwing money at them. (Admittedly, the schools need more than money, but more money surely would not hurt.) If you try to divert money from defense, they'll howl that you're not supporting the troops and trying to make America weak.

For perspective, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_schedule_(federal_income_tax)](according to Wikipedia), I'm in the 15% tax bracket. 

Buuuuut... that's only the federal income tax. There's also the FICA tax, which goes to the Social Security and Medicare funds. I don't know how that's calculated, but mine is generally only a little less than my income tax, so that means I'm paying somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of my income.

I live in Nevada, so there's no state income tax, but in most states there is. And some cities and counties also charge income tax, so that's another couple percentage points.

There definitely seem to be many more problems in some states than others, you're right (and mind, the difference doesn't seem to be particularly correlated with the state's population size, so that seems a strike against the size-matters argument :-)).

The measurement of IQ, in and of itself, is a very tricky proposition.  Existing tests are largely focused on European/Western/industrialized societies; a person in, say, a tribal culture living out in the woods/desert/jungle/Outback, while perhaps being extremely intelligent within his own framework, wouldn't have a clue about the answers to most IQ tests currently in existence.  *Maybe* he could handle spatial/shape reasoning -- except that *those* test components tend to be expressed using abstract geometrical shapes, which recent research suggests aren't processed by tribal/nature-living people the same way they are by industrialized people.  I know for sure that *I'd* fail an ""IQ test"" designed by a forest tribesman and including such basic tasks as being able to spot an animal in thick underbrush, track an animal, etc.

African Americans in particular need this designation, because knowledge of our true tribal origins has been deliberately and systematically hidden from us by slavers, for whom this practice was essential because it helped prevent slave uprisings and insurrection.  (They split them into different familial, tribal and linguistic groups and forbade them the use of English.  In America, this led to their developing pidgins with English vocabulary - picked up from slavers -  superimposed onto variations of West African grammatical systems.  This is the source of today's ""Black American English"" accent and manner of speech.)

Anyway, it is somewhat unfair that an African American should just have to say ""Black"" while the rest of the world can say ""Japanese/Korean"", or ""Scottish/German"" or even ""I am half Ethiopian, half Somalian"".

The phrase ""African American"" has a special meaning which specifically refers to historical events the OP seems to be overlooking.  You do not call a Nigerian born US citizen ""African American"".  He is Nigerian American. 
   
Your mother in-law, like my mother, should also be able to claim she is Caribbean American.  In case any of us are unaware, the Caribbean was once inhabited by Aboriginal ""Indians"" who lived in the region before the Europeans wiped them out to make room for tea and sugar cane, harvested by the African slaves which they brought to the region themselves in comfortable little travel packs.

I, a black man, do not wish to remind people of slavery when I state that I'm African American on paper but ""black"" in informal situations.  All I want to do is show that my ancestry is intimately tied in with American history and I'm not ""just black"".

Also - in your original post you equivocate the functions of ""Caribbean American"" and ""Asian"" as though they are similar descriptors.  They are not.  Asian refers to the scientific classification for so-called ""Race"", while ""Caribbean American"" refers to ethnicity.

- no tax on the first $15k

- 15% on $30k-$50k
- 20% on $50k-$100k

Up to a maximum of maybe 50% on anything above $1m. Actual brackets and rates would be determined by smart people and there would be various exemptions and deductions as necessary to prevent double taxation and so on. Basically what Europe does.

Of course, the biggest problem with taxes isn't the rate of tax, it's the fact that resourceful (rich) people always find ways of avoiding them, or even directing the taxes from less resourceful (poorer) people into their own pockets, via subsidies, excessively lucrative government contracts and bailouts. I think the primary focus should be on enforcing the existing tax code for rich as well as poor people, trimming the code to a point where everyone can understand it, and closing all the loopholes that prevent the code from being effective.

Disclaimer: I would be on the left of the political spectrum in the US, but more in the Center in Europe.

Warning! This is not a cut and dry topic, wall of text incoming (skip to TL;DR if you can't be assed to read)

Basically here is what happened:

1) Because of low US interest rates, speculators looked for another product which could give a guaranteed profit (like bonds - bonds are basically you lending money to the government at the government interest rate). The product they found was essentially US mortgages, and this started a bubble. Basically people started over-investing in houses and soon the price of a bundle of mortgages was not really based on the true value of the bundle of mortgages.

2) When the bubble burst investors started pulling money out of the economy to cover their losses. This caused something we call the money multiplier to run in reverse (the money multiplier is the idea that when you place money in a bank and the bank lends it out, its effectively increasing the amount of money in the economy. There is some pretty strange math involved in this, so I won't go into detail about it. Basically - money goes into bank and is lent out, lender still has the same amount of money but the person taking the loans gains money, so money is added in the system.). This caused the banks to need to trim their loans to retain their minimal capital requirements (basically a government mandated amount of cash they have to keep on hand to cover losses). The supply of money fell, and people looking for loans couldn't find any. This caused a credit crisis.

3) Once we fell into this credit crisis, people couldn't find loans and the world economies ground to a halt. This was partly due to a lack of information on all sides, as banks didn't know who to trust and didn't want to get burned. We started sliding into something called a savings trap (a savings trap is a controversial idea which is highly debated, so here is probably where most of my bias comes in). The basic idea behind a savings trap is this. A generally accepted fact about economics is that savings MUST EQUAL investment, again some complicated economic theory explaining all the details, but basically what you save is reinvested in some way, mainly by banks. However, at this point people were saving and as were banks, leading into a savings trap; everybody was saving too much at the same time. To cover this government has to step in to ensure that savings does = investment, and has to step in for the private sector when it comes to investing. This has been done in different ways across the globe, with mainly Europe and parts of Asia directly investing and the US choosing to go a more indirect route. Now these are highly controversial moves, something which I come to in the next phase.

4) This is the phase we're in right now, the debt crisis. A lot of governments owe a lot of money since they've attempted to keep their economies going, and now an age of austerity is being pushed. Again, there is a seriously right left debate here, were the right tends to believe that government is crowding out private investment (pouring too much money into the economy) and the left generally believing that cutting spending now could push the world back into recession.

I'm not even saying 'who are we to judge' about the Chinese foot binding. What I am saying is that besides involving Children it doesn't seem too far from cosmetic surgery that people undergo here. I think a pretty quick parallel could be drawn between this foot binding and corsets or some other painful device. 

You are certainly free to judge, though. I'll gladly join you and condemn the widespread adoption of Chinese footbinding here in the west. But what I wouldn't say is that these women are forcible victims of torture. It seems much more likely to me that these women are just like women in the west, women in Europe, women in Africa who go through painful often permanent and often debilitating procedures in order to fit in with accepted society. 

And they do it willingly, because they have a deep seeded desire to fit in with the standards of beauty. Whether its lasering the hair off of your face or using brass rings to stretch out your neck. From that point of view it's fascinating, and this case, although somewhat extreme, isn't unprecedented with what you see everywhere else in the world. 

That doesn't mean it isn't bad. That just means that the sense of victimization is more complicated than a purely feminist point of view will allow.

I think it would be more appropriate to compare female circumcision to a face lift.

Facelifts, or body tucks or cheek implants are far far far more acceptable by our own standard (not that they are perfectly acceptable, as much as I would assume in China foot binding isn't perfectly acceptable) than the standard as its applied to other cultures.

My state has no income tax and only a sales tax.

There is definitely a way to set it up to keep most of the burden on those who can afford it. You also bring in much more money from tourist and people just passing through. 

A national sales tax is something that is always being discussed by democrats it is just they discuss it as an additional tax to the income tax which is unacceptable. The reason is they try and say it will start off small, as it did in European nations, but then once they have it they bump it up to 20 percent and soon half or more of your earning are gone to the goons in Washington.

History also teaches us that voluntary charitable contributions never meet the scope of the need for them.  Put simply, it's never enough.  Fortunately, we have other solutions available that do work, and work sufficiently that everyone wins.

&gt; Do you not see your fundamental flaw here? Those are not your choices any more than it was the choice of the person who grew the food and made the clothes. The choices are to work for yourself, or work for somebody else, or get lucky and have a rich dad. 99% of us can't have the latter, so we make our choice among the first two. Somebody else choosing to work hard and feed and clothe themselves hardly seems to be a moral justification for them to be forced to feed and clothe those who have not made that choice.

Bullshit.  Starvation is never a viable choice.  It buys into the same argument that says we should never have public unemployment because it encourages people to be lazy.  Millions of Americans are out of work today not because they're lazy, but because *there aren't jobs for them.*  For every job opening, there are a dozen or more applicants.  It is not their fault for being unemployed, but it is the responsibility of society to keep them clothed and fed until they can stand on their own.  The flaw in your logic is that it assumes everybody always has options besides being exploited or starvation.  In a society with low unemployment that is sometimes true, but in days of high unemployment where jobs are scarce it most certainly is not.

&gt; That is everybody's choice every single day of their life. I'm sorry the world was not created the way you wanted, but it wasn't. So the choice now is to live with that or whine. Which will you choose?

There's a third choice:  pool our resources and lift everybody up.  That's what socialism offers.  That's what the socialist policies in America still allow, which you and the GOP are trying so hard to remove.

&gt; LOL, the poor in capitalist countries are kings compared to the rich in socialist countries.

Wow, is that ever a tired old cliche.  To be poor is to be poor.  Just because $100 a month will feed a family for a year in a poor country doesn't mean it will feed a family for a month in a rich country.  When you're without your basic needs of food, clothing, housing and medicine then it really doesn't matter whether you live in a rich country or a poor country.  You're still suffering.

&gt; You may want to talk to someone who knows. I have a close friend who fled there and still has family living there. You are spouting nonsense propaganda.

Yes, the friends I still have working there are telling me nonsense propaganda.  The international news of Chavez holding free elections and abiding by their results are nonsense.  Of course.

&gt; You realize that your answer was completely unrelated to the question, right? Right? I mean, not even the same subject. I'm sorry that the question demonstrates the failure of your ideology, but at least make an attempt.

I'm sorry, what about my answer wasn't completely on target?  Oh, nevermind.  No matter what I say, you'll come up with a reason it doesn't work.  Moving the goalposts is a basic prerequisite for the Church of the Free Market Fairy.

&gt; LOL, I'm sorry facts keep getting in your way. It's quite easy to look up the Index of Economic Freedom, and the results are very obvious: more freedom = more well-being, more health, and better overall living conditions.

Yes, they rank very high.  None of it invalidates the fact that these are nations with strong socialist policies.  In fact, their strong socialist policies are the very reason *why* they rank so high on your index.  These are highly socialist societies that have not (and possibly never will) see the end goal of Marx's Communist Utopia.  That's the problem with utopias:  they're never achievable.

But it turns out that the intermediary stages of socialism, when socialist programs are used to temper capitalist extremes, are very useful at managing democratic societies.  That's what makes Western Europe socialist, not the failed military dictatorships of Eastern Europe and China.

Did I correctly understand that the idea is to pretend to be dumb so we can make the case that atheists don't have a god to tell them to be moral so moral behavior is meaningless to atheists?

Monkeys practice various forms of moral behavior even though they never read the Bible. Do you think that if we taught them sign language and explained to them that their ethics have no philosophical underpinning, they'd start murdering each other? How about atheists?

Here's another question: [My poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/e9ghh/ratheism_poll_results/) shows that /r/atheism has 500 subscribers who used to be religious. Did they go on criminal rampages when they did? How about you Jesus-loving folks: If God didn't tell you to be nice, would you surrender to your inner demons? Why not?

There are a few societies that manage to get by without some supernatural authority. [One of them converted a missionary to atheism](http://freethinker.co.uk/2008/11/23/more-on-missionary-turned-atheist-daniel-everett/) :) It turns out these people lead happy, peaceful lives without having proved that their morality is *true*.

You know why? **Because it *works*, bitches!** Humans have huge brains because they're social animals. They've managed to figure out that not killing your neighbor makes sense, and not stealing from him, ditto. Half of the high-sounding Commandments of the Bible were stolen from people who lived thousands of years before Moses' wife allegedly circumcized her son; and the other half, such as ""thou shalt kiss thy God's ass"" are simply bullshit.

Modern secular societies live by many of the same morals that proved helpful to monkeys and primitive tribes. Other morals emerged from philosophy and reasoning, and in many cases prove superior to morals found in the oh-so-holy Bible. While the Bible says, ""try not to beat your slave so hard that you kill him,"" modern laws say ""do not keep slaves, period!"" Who would have thought?

As individuals, most of us behave morally because we have the same moral genes as monkeys. Like monkeys (and like priests, who evolved from apes like all of us), some people act immorally anyway. For those, we have a legal system to deter, catch and punish them. Nobody's perfect, and no society is either. But on the whole, it works!

When he gets to the description of the sun at 2:11 or so, he totally misses the mark. All the pantheons had a sun god who was known, and most of the sun gods were not even the chief gods. Apollo was a pretty dominant figure in greek mythology, for instance, but the sun was just a disc he was hauling behind his chariot. He was the sun god, of course, but Zeus, the storm god, just like marduk, odin, and the other storm gods of various other pantheons, was the one in charge.

There's a huge anachronism when he gets to the Christmas in December thing. Most Christians for the first 600 years or so didn't celebrate Jesus' birth, and the gospels clearly point out that Jesus was born in the spring time. What actually happened was that, as Christianity spread into northern europe, the Yuletide festival was still important to those people, because, unlike in Rome and the middle east, December is cold and miserable, and they need a reason to celebrate. So, the church decided to celebrate Jesus' birth during that time, and tacked Christmas (Christ's mass) on to December 25th, thus allowing the northern europeans to celebrate and party in december, but on the terms of the church, and in the name of Christian observance. We have the Celts to thank for the December 25th Christmas, not the Greeks or Egyptians.

at 3:25 or so he talks about dark versus light being all over the place in mythologies. No shit, sherlock. It's almost as though human beings all deal with issues of good and evil, and associate good with the thing they know (daylight) and evil with the thing they don't like (night).

When he gets to the Horus thing, note that he uses the word ""speaking broadly."" It's because the myth of horus has a lot of details that don't match up to the Jesus story in any way, shape, or form, and are of pivotal importance to the story. Here's a good starting point:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#Origin_mythology

Here's a fun part: ""Horus was born to the goddess Isis after she retrieved all the dismembered body parts of her murdered husband Osiris, except his penis which was thrown into the Nile and eaten by a catfish,[5][6] and used her magic powers to resurrect Osiris and fashion a gold phallus[7] to conceive her son.""

The article sites another oft-cited-by-atheists-completely-out-of-context story of Horus that is also cited by the video. Here's the link to the book that they're talking about, see if you see where they're picking and choosing.

http://books.google.com/books?id=ojccFpRU8DwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=horus&amp;lr=&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=horus&amp;f=false

Horus starts at around page 44.

Also, it's important to note that crucifixion was a peculiarly Roman punishment, so either the video maker or the myth itself is making another anachronism when he says that someone was crucified before the year 500 BCE or so. (horus was from around 3000 BCE.

Krishna isn't a good comparison, because he's considered to be one of the avatars of God, not a god himself. Here he's just lumped in with a completely different mythological group of characters.

Dionysus also doesn't fit if you read pretty much anything about him in Greek mythology. All the gods in the greek pantheon were essentially born of virgins. Or of sea foam. They all had several and conflicting stories of their births, too. Maybe that's another parallel! :-D

Also, the day of worship for Christians was Saturday until the council of Nicea, in which Constantine, a former sun worshiper, asked them to celebrate mass on the Lord's Day (Sunday) instead of the Sabbath, the Day of Rest (Saturday). Again, it's pandering to the ignorance of the audience with regard to Christian history.

Now we get to about 6:00. The astrological stuff was used to identify and signal the birth of kings, which, like I said, Jesus was born in spring time. Also the story of Jesus' birth involves the Kings actually bringing gifts, so it's really only a reference to the astrological phenomenon, not a fact of Jesus' birth that there was a star. I should also note that stories of Jesus' birth were tacked on over 60 years after his death. the letters of Paul and the gospel of Mark don't know and don't care about Jesus' birth. It then makes the equation between sun and son, which makes sense in english, but remember that in farsi, greek, hebrew, coptic, and heiroglyph, these two words sound _absolutely nothing_ alike. 

Then he gets to this whole thing about the southern cross. The death by crucifixion was not a special punishment. The Romans did this shit all the time. There was nothing symbolically significant about the death on the cross in the Bible, save for the fact that it was generally reserved for thieves, traitors, and anyone who the Empire wanted to make an example of. Unless you want to make the argument that the Romans were symbolically turning people into the sun by crucifixion, then you've really got a problem with this revisionist history.

tl;dr - this video, and the religulous clip it's a rip off of, relies on the ignorance of the audience with regards to greek, egyptian, and indian mythologies, among others, as well as general ignorance in Christian history to make it's almost completely unfounded points.",True,False,,[deleted],0,0

Sure, the term Eskimo might be pejorative in other parts of the world, but Alaskans will wear the word with pride, especially as many Eskimos are simply not Inuit, in much the same way that many Irishmen not French. That being said, when somebody refers to my ancestry by this 'politically correct' term, I feel as if they are attempting to strip away the distinctiveness that makes the Yu'pik the Yu'pik, like an Irishman would feel if we started to say that 'European' was offensive and 'French' was the new 'ok' term. What's worse is that not all Alaskan natives are Eskimos. A great chunk of the Native population is Athabaskan Indian, or Heida, or Tlingit, or Aleutian, or any of several others. These folks are not, by any stretch, Eskimos, but there is a growing population of those *in Alaska* that will refer to them as Inuit. My friends who have these honorable peoples as part of their ancestry are equally incensed when someone uses that 'pc' phrase 'Inuit' to refer to them as a lot.

TL;DR the term 'Inuit' is bogus as a catch-all, never call an Alaskan Native one unless they actually are, no matter what Greenland says.

Again, the trouble is not the hundreds of miles over open land *between* cities-- those are very easy to service, because there's nobody there, and nothing that anyone wants to get to. The trouble is the handful of miles *inside* cities, where the routes run through skyscrapers, freeways, etc. If you can pull off eminent-domaining a straight line between LA and Sacramento, I'm all for it. I don't believe it will ever happen, but good luck with that.

Europe largely ""solved"" this problem by displacing freight rail. The other possible solutions are displacing freeway lanes, or going over/under cities with massive civil engineering projects like Boston's Big Dig. All of those are difficult and expensive, possibly even impossible without basically forcing taxpayers to pay for the trains. Remember people still have to ride the trains for them to work, and if the tickets are three times as much as airfare then the train will never have any passengers. 

And keep in mind throughout all this that densely-populated metropolitan areas are *exactly* the places where HSR works best. When passengers balance time and cost to drive versus fly, HSR is ideal where it is too short to fly, but too long to drive. I.e. people are still going to fly from Texas to Seattle even you build a high-speed rail. But dense coastal areas where the traffic sucks and where cities 4-5 hours apart could be done in 90 minutes by train are ideal. Some parts of North America are more like Europe than other parts.

Oriental is a very euro-centric word. It was used to describe everything that was Far East of the European continent (Oriental -&gt; Orient -&gt; Oriens -&gt; East). This includes everything from places, food, people and sentiments/attitudes. 

When this term was popular, which was around the 19th century, the European/American views of the ""Orient"" was that it was a backward, savage, unintelligible, exotic and mysterious place. A lot of stereotypes were born during this era.

If you look at the eastern front, with it's untermeschen (sp) policies, it becomes clear what the doctrine was. Kill the population base that supports the insurgents. However, it's not fair to say this was limited to that regime, as this was how almost every invading/colonizing force achieved their goals before that. 

The U.S. never beat the indian warriors. They were too elusive. The U.S. just neutralized their population base i.e. trail of tears, infected blankets etc. They did the same thing in the Philippines. Pretty much all colonial powers did the same thing. Reward those who went along, while killing the partisans. You can't hide among the civilians if there are no civilians. That part is nicely buried in history thanks to the lack of modern media. That's now impossible. Hell the Germans failed to do so in Russia only because there were too many Russians, although they (despicably) tried valiantly. If they took advantage of the fact that many ethnic groups subjected under the USSR would have joined them, things could have turned out very differently.

Your point on Hitlers mismanagement is also valid. Kursk is a great example of the Command working within the confines of Hitlers retarded plan. It was pretty much doomed from the start, and they still managed to do pretty well considering they faced the largest defensive lines ever created. 

And to say the U.S. won because of the determination of it's people just doesn't make sense. As if the German people were defending Berlin against all hopes because Hitler wanted them too? If anything the German people were more determined than we were...If anything is proof of that it's the fact that we voraciously adopted the German propaganda line of ""holding back the Russian hordes from Europe"". Even at the battle of the Bulge Patton rightly commented that we could still lose the war. 

It doesn't even make sense to compare the U.S. and German military at that time considering 80% of German losses were on the Eastern front. As far as the Germans were concerned, the Russians were the enemy, not us.

Netbook I'd only take if you can't live without your own computer - you really don't need it, computers are everywhere in Europe.

I'd research a bit for the initial period when you settle in and make sure to have a friend at home that'll track a bit where you are going. This way if you ain't sure about hostel for the next city and don't have time to research yourself, you just message your friend and they'll help you out. Keep in mind that Hostels are also well connected and there are many more travelers around so really this will not be much of an issue.

If you solely speak English, you could start out in a country where the young people speak it pretty well (Uk, Scandinavia, Netherlands, Germany). This will help you settle in.

I'd also highly recommend Couchsurfing. If you start networking early, you will have a chance to meet great people from around the world - and get to know them before you go.

Regarding valuable things, as someone mentioned already, hostels always have a way to store valuables - usually those lockers. Worst case, you'd fall back to lockers at the train station (which often is close to your hostel).

Also regarding your age &amp; being female no need to worry. Just act responsibly like you would in your own country (e.g. don't get drunk/take drugs at a party where you have no one you can trust).

If you are going anywhere [I've been](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/eadrm/i_want_to_know_the_top_places_to_go_near_or_where/c16lhx5) already, feel free to ask for more info.

This creates difficulty for many African American children in schools because there are more white teachers than black teachers, and elementary school kids don't realize that the request isn't a request at all, but a command).

It is a useful term for this reason.  If the scientific paper were on ""Commands for black students in the classroom"" or whatever, then it isn't clear whether it's talking about all black people or not.  Because black people in Europe act differently than black people in America, or Africa, or Asia.  Different cultures, dear.

&gt;Just to avoid confusion

Yes.

&gt;and potential offense.

No.  I said nothing about offense at all.  I think black people in America should be called black instead of African American, because it's usually not their heritage we're talking about, but their race.  Only when we're talking about culture should we use cultural terms like this.  

&gt;Why can't we just be Americans and be done with the shit?

Can't we as Americans stop simplifying slightly complex issues because of our irrational fear that ""political correctness"" is destroying every aspect of life instead of, I don't know, actually having uses?",True,False,,sje46,0,0

Yes, there are lots of other people to rob you or take your things. Europe has no such credible enemies. Combined they are the second strongest military force in the world. If the USG disappeared, Europe/NATO would become the most powerful military in the world. A better argument can be made for the rest of the world needing protection from Europe.

&gt;The guarantee of defense by the world's current super power provides a natural incentive to spend less on military than you otherwise would.

That implies, that budgets are based on reasons. Even if they were based on reason there are no threats ATM. Germany is comfortable spending a certain percentage of their tax revenue on things that go boom. Under the circumstances of imminent war Germany would increase war spending, but these are not those circumstances.
