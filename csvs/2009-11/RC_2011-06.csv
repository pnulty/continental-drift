&gt;yes there is. I believe in evolution.

yes I accept the fact of evolution as well.

however human intelligence has not increased very much if at all in the last 100,000 years.  we are no smarter than the Cro-Magnon man eating grubs off of rotten logs. we are no smarter than the extinct neanderthal (and possibly less intelligent as their brains were larger than ours)

evolution does not favor intelligence after you have become the dominant species on the planet and no longer have natural predators. which happened about 100,000 years ago.

in fact if you take the idiocracy approach, stupidity will far out reproduce intelligence.

so you're theory that europeans are more evolved/intelligent than africans since they came on the scene later, while valid, is not correct.

when choosing a mate 100,000 years go a female is more likely to select the strong healthy fit male who is a good hunter and likely to produce strong fit offspring.  selecting a weakling who can do abstract maths in his head does not help her.

however in some cases I could see intelligence being beneficial, for instance a man may be smart and hence invent a better spear or arrow or some kind of thing that makes his life easier and makes his tribe stronger, in which case he may gain great notoriety among his peers and then have his selection amongst female mates.

I believe this is also a factor.

but as far as modern humans are concerned our cognitive abilities are quite equal across the board.

how we choose to use or not use those abilities and also our environmental factors play a much larger role.

if Einstein were born a peasant in Cambodia instead of in a first world nation like Germany he more than likely would not have become a famous physicist.

&gt;
&gt;I think we're quickly approaching the last bullet-point. I never thought I'd sound like ""those crazy conspiracy theorist types"" ... but it is not different from calling someone a slut to prevent them from exploring their sexuality.

**I think for many individuals (especially those with zero debt, some investing ""savvy"" and a base of capital to ""play"" with) we have already LONG surpassed that point.**

If you can minimize your expenses, then ""working""; in terms of wages, salaries, and/or self-employment profits -- all of which will be subject to a 15.3% payroll tax {from dollar #1 on up} **PLUS** -- for amounts over ""poverty line"" numbers {minimal tax ""credits"" for living that do not approach even a BARE minimum of the costs of living AND maintaining a ""working"" job -- i.e. transport, clothing, etc. most of which therefore must be paid for with AFTER tax net income} -- being subject to 20% and higher INCOME taxes; AND then on top of that being charged +5% sales taxes and a bevvy of excise taxes and licenses, permits, and other fees.

By comparison, any long term capital gains (with ""long term"" being the ridiculous arbitrary minimum of 1 year) are TOTALLY UN-taxed in terms of ""payroll"" taxes, and only taxed *minimally* as INCOME on the amounts ABOVE the &gt; $33K (single) or $67K (married).

And quite frankly, one would be a FOOL to work a salary job for $40K or $60K or even $100K a year if one can has no debt, can minimize their expenses and manage to make around $20K or $25K in annual capital gains. (Because not only will the wage/salary/profits be taxed at near or above 40%~50%, but your capital gains will be taxed at 25% or higher as well.)

So a single man (let's say mid 40's or 50's) who earns say $50K a year in salary and can (investing wisely) garner $20K in long-term capital gains -- for a total gross income of $70K -- will essentially PAY some $8K in payroll taxes (for the ""privilege"" of working); and *another* $8K in income taxes (roughly Fed + State); AND he will then be subject to another $3K (15%) in tax on his long term cap gains (or worse $5K -- 25% on short term gains).  And in addition, he's probably blowing somewhere between $10K to $15K annually due to commuting to/from a job that is just 1/2 hour away.

So the lion's share of the $50K in ""wage"" income -- some ~$33K (or about 67% of the $50k)  -- will end up going to taxes or expenses DUE TO HAVING THE JOB.  In effect, if he is working 12 months, he only gains anything from the LAST 4 months of labor... the first 8 months going to pay for his commute and the taxes ON the wages.

Conversely, if this same individual were to simply sit at home (minimizing travel to minimize expenses) -- and be happy with his or her $20K of long term cap gain ""investment"" income -- not too difficult if they have $0 debts -- and they will essentially pay NO taxes at all (and no commute charges) -- or if his cap gains are ""short term"" -- well, even still, rather than being taxed at the TOP rates, he will be able to avoid the payroll taxes, offset his earnings with the standard deductions, and end up paying the LOWEST tax rate (10%) on the half of his cap gain income that IS subject to taxes (so maybe $1K a year).

PLUS, of course, that individual would have the equivalent of a FULL TIME JOB'S worth of hours 2,000+ hours of time (actually MORE if count ""commuting"" time) to use as he wishes...  basically that person would essentially be ""FREE"", with LOTS of time to do whatever hobbies, inventions, writing, or other interests suit their fancy, or to do whatever is needed for work on the home or property (and **it no longer matters** if a DIY project takes 2 hours or even 4 hours to complete, when a professional could do it in 1 hour or less... because the ""FREE"" person has PLENTY of time available; they are NOT tired/exhausted/frustrated by a job, and do NOT have to try to cram DIY work into evenings and weekends, etc.)

And if one comes up with business and/or product ideas, one can ""putter"" around with them at one's leisure... for the pure pleasure of the intellectual exercise... and not worry much about whether they are actually put into the market (at least not yet) -- one has the ability to delay THAT form of gratification either until a better economy or business-environment comes back around, or potentially just to let it go forever...  Because seriously?  What more will be gained by lots of ridiculous heavy-lifting labor?  Why work your ass off for 2,000+ hours for such little gain?

Not really ""idle RICH"" -- but ""idle content and financially secure"".  So long as you don't hanker after things designed to impress (mega yachts and European vacations)... one can easily live the life of a ""hermit"" (or as I prefer... a ""country gentleman"").

What we're doing, as much as it may offend the Gadhafi-lovers, is supporting the Libyan people in their overthrow of a dictator. But knee-jerk simpletons will always find a way where Europe, the UK, and the US are evil and Gadhafi and suchlike brutal, murderous dictators are cuddly.

To go back to the original point:

We have soldiers in Libya.  We have warplanes over Libya.  We are not there at the behest of the (currently) legal government.  Therefore, this is an invasion and a violation of sovereignty.  They are fighting what amounts to a civil war, and its technically not our business.

At no point in all of the above rhetoric did I make a moral judgement on what the US is doing there.  I simply stated that the US does not enter into wars for humanitarian reasons.  That's because *there's no money in it.*  Wars are expensive.  We're dropping $500k bombs on $10k technicals, and someone's going to have to cough up the dough for it.

At no point did I call the US evil.  I only said that our government is not altruistic.

&gt; I don't think you're wrong on everything, I just think that viewing every single event in the world in exactly the same framework is as naive and unhelpful.

Riiiiight...  Just as naive and unhelpful as your belief that I'm calling the Western world evil and have a hard-on for Gaddafi because I think that there's actually motives *other than helping the rebellion.*  Sure, it's nice to help them...  Our leaders get to pat themselves on the back and be congratulated by the populace that elects them, and then they get to keep their highly lucrative jobs  (and if you don't think it's all about money, just remember that Congressmen are legally allowed to engage in practices that would get anyone else jailed for insider trading).

Frankly, between the two of us, I'm the one who's actually providing something bordering on a realistic point of view that contains something other than ""killing crazy people good!""

&gt; But over in the Alex Jones world, you can't just see what the geopolitical realities are (and, yes, oil plays a big part in that) and think about this issue in isolation. We have to switch into full-blown the US is evil blah blah oil blah whothefuckcares ranty rant mode. Because that's all you've got.

You know it's funny, because I had to actually look up who Alex Jones is.  I hit so many links while digging into a story.  I even watch Fox News every now and then so that I can keep up on how the crazies on that side of the fence are faring.  Sometimes they actually say something intelligent.  But you're pidgeonholing me in a way that is laughable...  You don't know me, and yet you can judge me on the fact that I posted a factual and confirmed-by-multiple-sources statement through a link to an Alex Jones website.  You don't know that I had to write a paper on this shit in college.  You don't know that when someone makes a really good point, I look it up to see if maybe I was wrong and change my stance accordingly.

I'll grant you, though, I walked into that alternate accounts/conspiracy theory bit.  Touché on making the most of that one.

&gt; I don't think your ideas are rooted in the real world; they are rooted in a worldview that demands a particular narrative.

And that narrative is that money rules the roost.  It's a little less so in parts of Europe.... and it's a lot less so in the back-woods... or sand... of Africa.  But here in America, your voice grows louder the more money you have.  If that's something you doubt, then you're being intentionally blind.  On a small scale, sure, I don't give a rat's ass about money so long as I can live comfortably and happily, and there are many people like me...  but on a large scale, the current generation in particular has been brought up to get while the getting's good regardless of the expense to other people, and that's pretty well documented in psychological circles.  Also, people who run big companies disassociate their actions from the consequences to other people.  I realize that he's not a licensed practitioner, but Ted Danson researched his role as a big businessman for some TV series by interviewing CEOs, and he came to the conclusion that the only thing distinguishing them from people in prison is the color of their collar. Take that as anecdotal or not, I don't care.  Frankly, we've cultivated a culture here that rewards the sociopaths with higher salaries and bigger bonuses... and you can verify that line with my Dr. Mom, who used to be a licensed therapist.

So, the TL;DR:
Didn't say US is evil, just profit motivated.  Saving peoples' lives is nice, but it doesn't pay the bills.  Gaddafi's nuts and could probably use a good killing.  Wondering about our motives in Libya when the situation is quite similar/identical in Syria/Bahrain/North Korea but we do nothing there is far from thinking of issues in isolation.

Telugu is a [Dravidian language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages), not an Indo-European language. Certainly, it's borrowed a lot of words from Sanskrit, but this does not mean it is related to Sanskrit or Indo-European.

To be related means something very specific in historical linguistics. If one language is related to one another, they come from a common source: a proto-language. For example, English and German come from a proto-language called Proto-Western Germanic. 

A proto-language changes into its daughter languages by the regular changes that are always going on in languages. For example, one of the changes that [Yonaguni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonaguni_language)--the southernmost Japonic language--underwent to differentiate itself from most other Japonic languages was merging the vowel sound /e/ into the vowel sound /i/ and the vowel sound /o/ into the vowel sound /u/ in all instances. So we find the word ""boat,"" which is *fune* in Japanese, as *puni* in Yonaguni, and the word for ""thing""--*mono* in Japanese--as *munu* in Yonaguni.

These changes are said to be ""recurrent""--that is, if they occur in one word, they almost always occur in every other word that comes from the same proto-language. We don't find /o/ or /e/ *not* changing into /u/ or /i/ in Yonaguni.

Borrowed words ""don't count"" for establishing genetic relationships. Words you wouldn't expect to be borrowed can be; for example, you might expect ""karaoke"" to be borrowed into English from Japanese, but Latin borrowed the very ""basic"" Greek word for ""rock,"" *petra*, which survived into all Romance languages. We wouldn't use these to group Japanese and English or Greek and Romance languages. If we're looking at language as a tree, borrowing operates across the tree, rather than up-and-down the tree.

Telugu isn't related to Indo-European languages--it doesn't come from Proto-Indo-European. It just borrowed a lot of words from Sanskrit and other Indo-Aryan languages.",0,1427199698,t3_ho3m4,1306891975,10,,0,True,True,limetom,c1x366s,t1_c1x2e8w,False,t5_2qhos

If this, ""consumption of alcohol is linked to cancer"", was all he was saying, I would agree.  Yes, it is linked to cancer.  But it does not specifically cause the cancers of these patients.

Not really.

In the late 18th century the traditionally held discoverer of the Indo-European languages' common descent, [Sir] William Thomas, proposed, largely for Biblical reasons, that this ancestral language originated in Iran.

Soon afterwards, as the idea of an Indo-European language family began to entrench itself within intellectual circles, the historical self-designating term (Old Persian: Ariya; Latin: Ariana; Sanskrit: Arya; English: Aryan) of the indigenous inhabitants of Thomas' hypothesized homeland became associated with all Indo-Europeans.  So the establishment of Aryan being accepted as equivalent to Indo-European occurred almost a hundred years before Hitler was even born.

Furthermore, although still debated among experts, it's not outrageous to suggest that the Proto-Indo-Europeans used a cognate of Aryan to refer to themselves.  At the very least, Aryan as a synonym for Indo-European is more accurate and justifiable in a historical linguistic sense than the current consensus usage of Semites (descendents of Shem) for Semitic-speaking peoples, or the less often used Hamites (descendents of Ham) for the Berber, Omotic, Chadic, and Cushitic peoples.",0,1427199789,t3_ho3cb,1306893796,2,,0,False,True,Perditus,c1x3cn2,t1_c1wyxpt,False,t5_2qh0u

Businesses do nothing... only *individuals* can act. Some individuals are amoral psychopaths, yes. That only has to be a problem to the extent you begin allowing people to increase their power by being masters at politics and coercion.

&gt; You shouldn't expect them to do otherwise.

It's completely fine that man is greedy. It only begins to be a problem when we structure society as if that is not the case.

&gt; The banks who felt they HAD to sell the negative amortiation subprime mortgages to people even when they suspected it would all end in a default were doing it because they knew that if they didn't their competitor would.

That's not all of it though. They did it because they knew that there was a bailout at the end of it all. If they thought there wouldn't be a bailout, then they would have let their competitors engage in those loans to their hearts content and suffer the bankruptcy of their firm afterwards. What you're describing there is not a problem that results from man's nature or banking. It's a problem with having a government that believes it ought to use its coercive powers to transfer wealth around the economy for purposes beyond defending individuals from aggression.

&gt; When those oil&amp;gas companies come in and do a fracking operation to get at the shale gas, they want to go to the place with the lightest environmental regulations so that they don't have to spend as much money handling their waste water.

So sounds to me like you're talking about a country that isn't very capitalist and doesn't have a strong respect for private property rights? I agree. Nations such as that are never a pretty sight. I am all for strong property rights and for making men pay who aggress against the property of others.

Yes. The West no longer practices capitalism and does not want an environment where voluntary exchanges can flourish. Government intervention is so entrenched in their system today that businessmen know that it is better to spend their time and energy lobbying Washington then it is to spend their time and energy trying to improve their product.

&gt; Have a look at BPs safety record. Those accidents weren't just bad luck.

What accidents are you talking about? What sort of work were the men engaging in? Is it a dangerous line of work? Did the men voluntarily agree to work for the employer in those conditions?

&gt; They avoid taxes with offshore tax havens and then lobby for a tax holiday in order to be able to bring in all their profits.

Agreed. People don't like being plundered from. If you want people to produce wealth inside your country, don't implement policies that discourage wealth creation inside your country.

Now this means that the lifeguards don't do much saving, and just yell at you to get you back into the beach space.

6,0,t1_c1x3nhd,Anarchism,,,"In my experience, anarchism is simply an acknowledgment of the natural human condition:  No class, no status, no nation, no religion, no gods, no masters.  If we were more like our early hominid cousins, life would just have remained an eternity of Darwinian violence. But we are not simply complex primates.  We have ascended to become intellectual, artistic, idealistic, storytelling, adaptive, scientific, and social entities.  We have all the tools necessary to observe and adapt to this very dangerous world.

Prior to the agricultural revolution, historians have come to the conclusion that life was much more egalitarian, and far less materialistic.  There was much more equality in terms of social status, most notably in terms of gender roles (as is demonstrated with the concepts of deities in the earliest religions- worship of a mother goddess rather than the later patriarchal war gods which came after agriculture). 

This ""prehistoric"" human experience has been described as a brutish, violent, and short existence, but the transition to agricultural society did not bring much more solace and comfort.  Subsisting on farmed carbohydrates and beer caused many generations to live in stunted growth, poor immunity to disease, and at the mercy of the soil which might leave hundreds or thousands in starvation should the crop fail.  Most significantly, this agricultural revolution created the concepts of land ownership, social hierarchy, and standing armies.  Territory, war, monolithic religions, and government are the normal Monday to Friday points of focus.  These concepts are taken for granted in today's society.  

But history has long left the bronze age behind, and many of these intellectual constructs are now rapidly deteriorating all the things which make civilization great.  

It is said that we would be colonizing space if not for the suppression of Europe's intellectuals by the centralized christian catholic church during the 'dark ages'.  I feel this claim has some weight, but it is an incomplete assessment.  Today, well more than half of the world's material wealth is spent on military expenses.  That amounts to the majority of humanity's resources and man-hours being placed into killing each other with startling efficiency and abominable execution.  The scientific advancement of civilization is bottle necked by governmental and corporate influence.  We must wait until the next international war in order to enjoy the fruits of scientific advancement these days.  Energy production and infrastructure improvement are often stifled by the 'old guard' as was seen when Ford motor company bought up (and then dismantled) the public transit systems of southern California, or when general electric began buying the patents for alternative energy systems starting in the 70's.  

An anarchistic society is dependent on our nearly limitless ability as a species to adapt and advance.  At some point the technologies which are used to beat us or seduce us into submission will be turned to liberate us and provide for us.  Instead of spending more than half of the world's material wealth on military expenditures which do nothing but tear apart populations and ruin civilian infrastructures, this research, production, and manpower could instead be turned towards improving the human condition.  

Instead of carpet bombing civilians in order to punish Machiavellian despots, we could be investing in the creation of artificial intelligence.  Super computers which would be able to harvest the vast overflow of data which we cannot possibly process. 

Instead of buying another couple of aircraft carriers, we could be investing in a 'space elevator' which would reduce the cost of moving material into orbit from 2 million dollars a pound to 20 thousand.  From there, sending unmanned drones to harvest the unfathomable amount of mineral wealth and resources from the asteroid belt.  This could springboard our species from being terrestrial to being interstellar within a century.

Instead of investing in biological weapons we could be investing in nanotechnology, which may one day eliminate disease as we know it.  Self-replicating nanites may one day construct all that is now produced by hand, and break down all the harmful matter which we fear may be causing climate change.  

I feel that government was necessary to bring us out of the caves, and away from tribalism.  But at this point- if we don't allow ourselves to advance away from government and become a globally united species (think star trek) we will forever be subject to the incompetence and willful cruelty of our masters.  We will see a constant flux of dark ages and renaissances, or maybe just be snuffed out by our own materialistic over-consumption and the destruction of the present world ecosystem.  

Anarchy is much like a secular religion to me.  I know it won't happen in my lifetime (beyond the small scale, communal, experiments which we may engage in day to day as anarchists).  Humanity is still weighed down by the chains of competition, blind religious ignorance, and destructive materialism.  But at some point- the masses will become fed up (or terrified) and look to new systems.  Anarchism will be there waiting.

3,0,t1_c1x3orx,TrueReddit,,,"&gt; motivation for our morality

See, that's the key: I think Singer (and nearly any moral philosopher) would argue that morality is its own motivation, and not just a description of human emotions. He is starting from the axiom that suffering is bad, and exploring the consequences of what else must be bad because it causes suffering. If you don't have a starting axiom like that, what you're doing may be interesting and useful but it probably isn't arguing morality.

P.S. just since I brought up the tangent, this is probably closer to the truth:

&gt; species is a social construct and ethnicity is not

Definitions of ""species"" vary widely and break down when you actually look at them closely, but that's precisely when biologists stop trying to use that term and just say what they see. It's basically just a rule of thumb, or shorthand for something we don't want to have to explain in detail every time. ""Population"" tends to be a less misleading term for this.

And also for ""race."" Give a geneticist your DNA and he/she can tell you very specifically about your ethnic origins (for [$200](https://www.23andme.com/), though there are occasional sales). If your heritage is fairly pure, we can use your DNA to guess where your ancestors lived [within 1000 km](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2008/09/01/european-genes-mirror-european-geography/). The word ""race"" carries also sorts of connotations involving culture and upbringing, not to mention the political implications, but the main reason we don't use it is that it's just imprecise and so are the traditional ""races"" (Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid, if you care, but you probably shouldn't). So no, ""race"" is not a social construct... but only for certain specific definitions of the word that are better expressed by ""ethnicity"" or ""population.""",0,1427199941,t3_hogo6,1306897059,3,,0,True,True,Epistaxis,c1x3orx,t1_c1x3kt3,False,t5_2qyt6

Those Jews came from Europe and Russia the 50 years prior to WW2 in order to start their own country away from the anti-semitism of Europe.  It is not, as I see many suggesting, a group of Jews who had lived in Israel for 1000's of years yearning for self government.

It is also important to keep in mind that this land was controlled by Muslims for nearly 1000 years since/during the crusades when the last period it was controlled by any people who called themselves Jews was nearly 2000 years ago, when the Romans destroyed Judea and began to call it Palestine.  So I think it is just as fair to say that this land belongs to Muslims who call themselves palestinians as it is to say it belongs to Jews who call themselves Israelis.

Once we get past all that historical nonsense we can look at the reality of the situation which is that the extremists on both side of the issue want to derail any progress towards peace because they just dont want to share.  I, for one, am against all this US bullshit in the middle east, which includes our relationship with Israel.  I dont think the USA should be aiding Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Israel,  and Im also against all these stupid wars against A-rabs over some sand in the dessert just because no one in my country wants to pay $5 a gallon for gas.  

It sucks that China screws Tibet and Russia fucks over Georgia while Zimbabwe continues to run its society into the ground and normally I dont care enough to bother with these issues.  The only problems I have with Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia is how they willingly take our US aid money, and then use it for things that are obviously against the USA's interest.  If Israelis dont like our criticism then they can give back the $6 billion they get from us.  Until then I expect that the countries that take our money to toe the line and get on with the peace making.  Obama made Mubarak step down and in 2005 when Hamas won the elections the USA stopped making aid payments to the PA.

I said *100%* return to 1967 borders. The withdrawal from Gaza hardly counts, since expansion in the West Bank in 2005 alone more than made up for the withdrawal from Gaza. Israel didn't withdraw from Palestinian territory in 2005 - it shifted and expanded. It continued, and continues to commit war crimes by violating the Fourth Geneva Convention. You may not believe it, but the International Court of Justice, the U.N. Security Council, about a billion Muslims, and about a billion Europeans do. The only way to convince all these people that Israel isn't committing war crimes is to stop doing the things that they consider war crimes.

&gt; Of course, it proved to be an utter disaster and only made things far worse for everyone.

If you call an end to the suicide bombings in 2005 ""utter disaster"" and ""far worse for everyone"". That's what Israel got for the token withdrawal from Gaza. Imagine what it would get if it fully complied with international law and withdrew from all the settlements.

&gt; Once Israel is placed in such a dangerous position

How exactly would withdrawal from the settlements put Israel in a dangerous position? Do you mean that the *civilian* settlements provide *military* protection to Israel's (pre-1967) borders? I've heard this claimed, but no one has ever been able to explain it.

Note that if there are real security concerns, I'm in favour of military-only buffer zones around critical areas, with both sided contributing equally to the buffer zones, and absolutely no civilian presence allowed.

Or are you referring to ""Palestinian radicals will become more empowered""? You're trying to have it both ways here. On the one hand, you say that the Palestinians are absolutely determined to destroy Israel and nothing Israel will do can change that. On the other hand, you say that the Palestinians will become even more empowered. What's more than ""absolutely determined""? If they're already doing everything they can to destroy Israel, how can they do more?

I say again: if the settlements are no big deal, then there's no reason for Israel to hold on to them, and good PR reasons (not to mention the moral reasons) to withdraw from them, 100%.

1,0,t1_c1x4233,transit,,,"&gt;BTW, not everyone lives in NYC, USA (LOL). Your copious acronyms are a reflection of the glistening lifestyle bubble you're in.

The transit situation in NYC, Boston, Chicago, SF, LA, etc. can be hardly described as 'glistening lifestyle [bubbles]'. These systems are supported by the words of politicians, but hardly receive equivalent funding support.

&gt;Transit stations' size should be a reflection of their ridership. A station like Long Ping is of a size that reflects the high transit ridership (87%), and overall population (7m), of Hong Kong.

When establishing new transit routes, [an increasingly controversial topic](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstreetsblog.net%2F2011%2F04%2F28%2Fchasing-the-illusive-new-transit-rider-missing-the-bus%2F&amp;ei=5rDlTfikENHOgAeM8f3qCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUqh5rJTbjuBcOdgKUOwc4kWun1A&amp;sig2=EftPRpE_KHiiut1w6Z4UeQ) in established transit areas, it's good practise to size the stations to reflect **anticipated** ridership. A key move that many transit agencies in the US have failed to do until recently is something I have been repeating here on /r/transit and elsewhere, something the Japanese have been doing since the first half of the 20th century: we call it 'transit-oriented development', everyone else calls it common sense. Why squander a high-cost infrastructure investment like transit and leave ridership numbers to fate when you can develop directly on and over your owned properties adjacent the station and encourage developers to follow suit, the former of which brings back revenue to the system through rent and both assure ridership if executed across the system.

&gt;It would, however, be an order of magnitude too large—and expensive—for a midwestern city of 500,000 and an optimistic 20% of the population using it.

I think you're assuming that I recommend large, high-cost, elabourate heavy rail transit for all regions, which is far from what my original post was about.
If not, the assumption that larger-scale LRT (light rail vs BRT) cannot serve a population of 500,000 defies the many cases of successful LRT operation in areas of similar population in many parts of Europe, Japan, and other locales with similarly strict legislation regulating development outside of urban areas.

&gt;People don't use transit in the USA because it's inadequate, not because it's ugly.

As far as the sparse Midwestern cities that typify the America we've invested in (I grew up in American suburbs like Kissimmee, FL and my family was zoned for **THE** [Levittown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown,_New_York) school district - we lived in nearby Wantagh, NY, so I know what it's like to be 'trapped' as a kid in your own home in the suburbs), many are [having to downsize](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/reports/shrinking-cities/video-youngstown-ohio-the-incredible-shrinking-city/1225/) and are taking the opportunity to invest heavily in transit to serve these smaller footprint cities that have been encouraged to sprawl because cars were born there. Admittedly, this isn't happening in every Midwestern/typical sprawled American city, but many cities are at an impasse with how to bring their roads to SGR while still being able to balance their budgets.

This brings me to the point I probably should've addressed at first: there is a wide spectrum of applied transit. Most of my focus is on established transit in metropolitan areas because of the number of political and funding issues facing the transport systems that enable these metropolitan areas to generate the majority of the nation's GDP. That said, this particular example is to point out the need to create spaces that should be celebrated in cities, because too often cities/urban areas are derided as dingy places that should be this way or are inherently dingy. With the pressure of impending climate change and the need to reduce human environmental footprint, it is critical to fight the American social stigma of urban/higher density areas with amenities that make city living worth pursing, which includes transit worth using. Yes, we need transit that arrives on-time, but with the overwhelming focus on natural beauty that encourages people to move as far into 'nature' as possible, it is important to not underestimate the importance of places in urban areas that delight, whether you're waiting in that place for several minutes or just passing through.",0,1427200115,t3_ho6z1,1306900602,1,,0,True,True,digitalsciguy,c1x4233,t1_c1x2kcm,False,t5_2qha9

With the pumped storage though, how much do you really have?  I tried to look, but I can only find the generation capacity, not the storage capacity.  If you had those numbers, that would be really interesting.  It'd take a lot though - imagine a strange weather pattern going over the EU that stills the winds everywhere for a week.  You'd have some hydroelectric and geothermal baseload, but you'd need enough surplus solar during the day to pump up enough water to last the country through the night.  And if it happened during the winter, you would be in a worse situation.

&gt;The good thing about the hydro-storage is, that you nearly don't lose energy.

(I'm guessing you are ESL - you lose a game and loosen a necktie)

My guess is that you'll lose at least 10% in transmission, and maybe another 10% in pumping it up and running it back.  If you have other numbers, that'd be cool to see.  (my information is a bit out of date, and google isn't finding things fast enough).

The huge thing that rocks about pump storage is that it can be brought online within seconds, so if a cloud moves over our solar plant, it can start letting out water so that the grid remains stable.  I'm having a hard time imagining that they could make up for a still winter week.  Especially since the energy demands will most certainly go up.  For one thing, electric cars are going to be a big new drain on the grid.

1,0,t1_c1x48cj,atheism,Ignostic,,"&gt; However, I would like to put forth the argument that belief in a creator is a philosophical choice based on one's understanding of their own life. By believing that we are here for some purpose beyond simply living or enjoying life, belief in a deity logically follows. One's religious persuasion is simply a direction of that belief, not a necessity of it.

Can you explain how you think this is relevant to the question?  The question whether it is valid, in the US, for a state to pass a law preventing an atheist from holding office.  The Constitution's ""[no religious test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Religious_Test_Clause)"" clause, says, ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""  Requiring belief in a deity is fundamentally a ""religious test"", regardless of your point about philosophy.  Belief in a deity is a religious belief, by definition; and requiring the profession of belief in a deity to hold public office is a religious test.

Here's what Justice Hugo Black wrote for the court in the Torcaso vs. Watkins case, which was a unanimous decision for the atheist plaintiff, Roy Torcaso:

&gt; ""This Maryland religious test for public office unconstitutionally invades the appellant’s freedom of belief and religion and therefore cannot be enforced against him. [...] Indeed, it was largely to escape religious test oaths and declarations that a great many of the early colonists left Europe and came here hoping to worship in their own way. It soon developed, however, that many of those who had fled to escape religious test oaths turned out to be perfectly willing, when they had the power to do so, to force dissenters from their faith to take test oaths in conformity with that faith.""

Please read that carefully, because it encapsulates almost everything I'm saying about this issue, both legally and historically.

Black also wrote the following in that decision:

&gt; ""We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person ‘to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.’ Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.""

Back to you:

&gt; The problem with church and state in Europe had more to do with political disagreements than anything else. The state would use organized religion as an excuse for its actions and any form of organized religion would try to manipulate the state. The founding fathers established the barrier of church and state to prevent at least this from happening, although if you have additional explanations I would be happy to hear them.

The issue, as Black's comments hint at, is much broader than you suggest.  It's not clear from your short summary what you are or aren't aware of.  The prosecution of Puritans in England was fairly well known, and led to tens of thousands of them emigrating to America.  As another example, in the 17th century, thousands of Quakers were imprisoned in England for their religious heresy, many were tortured, and hundreds died as a result.  But these problems weren't restricted to Europe: the Puritans who came to America believed in uniformity of religion, that they needed to impose their religion on everyone in order to realize the supposed plan of the god they believed in.  

It was because of these sorts of conflicts in both Europe and early America that the Baptist minister Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, wrote [The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloudy_Tenent_of_Persecution) in 1644 which:

&gt; ""argues for a 'wall of separation' between church and state and for state toleration of various Christian denominations, including Catholicism, and also 'paganish, Jewish, Turkish or anti-Christian consciences and worships.' The book [...] is a response to correspondence by Boston minister, John Cotton, regarding Cotton's support for state enforcement of religious uniformity in Massachusetts. Through his interpretation of the Bible, Williams argues that Christianity requires the existence of a separate civil authority that may not generally infringe upon liberty of conscience, which Williams interpreted to be a God given right.

It is encouraging to see that in 1644, it was possibly for a Christian minister to be so wise in such matters; but it is sad to see that so many modern American Christians have forgotten these lessons and don't appear to have the wisdom to recognize them for themselves.

&gt; I would agree that a barrier between state and organized religion is a very wise idea, but that belief of higher purpose has other philosophical implications that I prefer in a leader.

Again, that belief is your right under the Constitution (although in my opinion, it makes you a kind of bigot), but it has no bearing on the legal issue in question.

&gt; And I understand your frustration with people that refuse to listen to scientific evidence, but will you please stop ragging on them? 

You apparently forget where this discussion is taking place.  This is /r/atheism, a forum for the discussion of atheism.  Over in /r/christianity, they ban people at the drop of a hat, for stating opinions that they don't like.  We don't do that here - we tolerate a great deal of ignorance and even trolling, because we generally don't believe in censorship.  If atheists are not permitted to speak their minds here, where do you propose they can do so?

&gt; Sorry, which values did I mention that it spits in? I honestly don't see what you're talking about.

You wrote that the people you're defending are ""probably coming from the perspective that atheism is technically in opposition to one of our country's earliest values.""  I'm pointing out that one of those earliest values is *freedom* of religion, which includes the freedom to disbelieve, the freedom of conscience that Roger Williams described.  To claim that ""atheism is technically in opposition to one of our country's earliest values"" conflicts with this fundamental early American value to such a degree that it seems to me to spit in the face of the history which led to the Constitution being written the way it is.  Both positions can't be true, and the one that's enshrined in the Constitution is no government establishment of religion, the free exercise of religion, and no religious test for public office.  

Religious people should be thankful that this is the way it is, because otherwise, the ongoing conflict for control of the government between religious sects would have destroyed or radically changed the USA long before now.

&gt; I agree that atheists should not be barred from office (there are many Christians in government who are far worse), however I disagree that banning states from doing so under the grounds that it violates the free exercise of religion clause of the Constitution on the grounds that belief in a Creator is a philosophical, not a religious, decision.

I'm not clear on what you're saying here - are you saying you disagree with the unanimous Torcaso vs. Watkins decision?  If so, I think that there may be points about Constitutional law that you're missing: in particular, that the Bill of Rights grants rights to all people present in the US, and a state cannot pass laws that abridges those rights.  While it's certainly legal for voters to choose not to vote for someone for whatever reasons they choose, it is not legal for a state to pass laws which discriminate against someone in such a way that it violates their freedom of religion, not to mention the fact that the ""no religious test"" clause is about as explicit as it gets in Constitutional law.

Staying there requires a few different things, depending on which part of Europe you're talking about.

Norway in particular has a history of being a nation of immigrants, so I'd think it would be easier to gain permanent residence there a bit more easily than some of the other European countries that are known for being hardasses about immigration (looking at you, Sweden).

Also, Norway is mind-bogglingly beautiful.   You should check out some of the fjords.

Also, their government, like most European governments, is more socialistic than the USA.   You won't find the same corporation shell game going on in their government that you will in the USA, and if you do come down on hard times and need a month or two to find work, or if you do get in some kind of accident and need medical help, it isn't the end for you like it is in America.

This is a very valid point though I think they are somewhat dissimilar. Switzerland's bankers seem to have had a prevailing policy of not asking questions at any time, even after the fact; whereas an IBM subsidiary may not have had prior knowledge of how their business deal would detrimentally affect so many people.

Is it unsafe and ill-advised to never ask questions about the source of sudden massive wealth? Probably. Is it unsafe and ill-advised to sell counting &amp; sorting machines to a government which says it has logistical problems? Only if you are aware of the nefarious ends to which they will be used.

We're already into a meta argument but as an aside; who do we blame for the carpet bombing of Dresden? There were no significant military targets in or near Hiroshima.

Relegation adds temporary excitement, but then fans of the losing teams end up in the lower division and often end up losing a huge proportion of their players.  That doesn't seem terribly exciting for them.  If you know you'll get another chance next year, you can get excited about promising young stars and the opportunities ahead.  You're allowed to like one better (especially since, as a Bayern Munich fan, you aren't too concerned about being one of the teams suffering the worst parts of having relegation).  It's probably also worth mentioning that American sports leagues place a much higher emphasis on parity than European leagues, and so it may make less sense to employ relegation in a league that is more competitive top-to-bottom.

The other point I want to make though, is that ArtFormica, and those who normally make this argument for relegation, also argue against playoffs, and that seems to have contradictory reasoning.  If relegation increases excitement for teams at the bottom of the league, don't the playoffs increase excitement for the middle of the league, where teams are on the fringe of getting in?

When I was in 5th grade, there was a project where each student was supposed to craft a relief map of Israel on posterboard using a homemade dough mixture and food coloring. 

When the 20-25 students brought in their maps, there was a lot of confusion about who did the project right. Some had maps drawn on the 1948 borders. (mine was, based on an old encyclopedia, with the West Bank and Gaza carefully carved out). Some had the territories included in Israel. Some had the Golan Heights, some didn't. At least one kid, whose parents were apparently ultra-Zionist, had an enormous map including the territories, the entire Sinai and the Golan Heights, with a little toothpick Israeli flag stuck in it.

I remember there was a bit of discussion as to what was 'correct' and what the teacher would give full credit for. Credit if you have this piece, not that piece. The teacher was going to call the Zionist world-domination kid's parents for clarification. Things went back and forth a few times. I think she ended up giving almost everyone full credit except for the kids who didn't finish or just had a big unrecognizable clump of dough.

I guess my point is, your explanation reminded me of how confusing it was for a bunch of fifth graders that a seemingly simple assignment had 20 different potential correct answers as to what a country actually was, and a whole raft of explanation as to how this could be. You've got one map, the US has another, Europe has another, hardline Israelis have another, hardline Palestinians have another.

They are often referred to as a twister or a cyclone, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a narrower sense, only to name hurricanes or typhoons. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (177 km/h), are approximately 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme can attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), stretch more than two miles (3 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).

Various types of tornadoes include the landspout, multiple vortex tornado, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.

Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. However, the vast majority of tornadoes in the world occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, the Philippines, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes, as well as by the efforts of storm spotters.

There are several different scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused, and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes.

Essentially, I don't think your assertion that this is a potentially high risk experiment is valid.
consider the following.

1. potatoes are not native to Europe. Very unlikely to proliferate to any local flora.
2. most of the potatoes being grown in belgium are sterile anyway.
3. potatoes are not grown from seeds in most cases anyway. they are grown from pieces of tuber. read the following
&gt;The anthers of these species are hollow tubes that open by small apical pores, unlike in most other plant species where the anthers open dehiscing longitudinally to fully expose the pollen to the air and pollinators.
&gt;Solanum pollen are sticky and do not travel long distances, even if they become airborne.
When species of Solanum were introduced outside their native South American regions the original pollinators were not taken along to their new homes.  Hence, even varieties of these species are not normally cross-pollinated in nature.  Insects visit Solanum flowers but they can collect nectar without touching the anthers or stigmas, as the petals open flat out like the spokes of a wheel.
&gt;As potato is vegetatively propagated by the ‘eyes’ of the tuber (the farmer’s seed), pollination is not a matter of concern.  The breeders who are interested in the true fruits and seeds of potato hand pollinate the flowers.

4. (i don't have a citation here, someone mentioned it in this thread but I can't find it) The genes in question were originally from another potato that was naturally resistant to the blight. IE, the genes may have been synthetically formed, but not synthetically developed. Important distinction.

The point isn't that such a potential threat isn't possible, but that that chance is much lower than you think. Of course there's still a risk. there always will be. Extensive lab testing has been done prior to this to weed out any glaring possible problems, but field testing has to be done as well. that's how science works in production. First you remove all the variables, but you eventually have to add them all back in. There is no way to do this without potentially ending the world. 

To sum it up, i think your claim that this is an unsafe experiment is not true but I also think your premise that because an experiment is unsafe it should not be done is against the spirit of scientific advance.

Manufacturing jobs being shed is the result of the US' efficiencies in production.  China might be able to hire workers at a dime a dozen, but one US worker can do the same amount of work as a good deal of Chinese workers thanks to the mechanized nature of manufacturing.

We all have our limitations on how many things we can ponder at once.  The problem is that in order to simplify things you do your albedo calculation first because it seems straight so gosh darn straight forward.  Hmmm, perhaps I should use some extreme examples to explain this.

If the entire earth was shrouded in clouds, the cloud tops would be the effective radiating surface.  What little water vapor and CO2 was above the cloud tops would be blocking radiation from the ground (the clouds do that in this case) but would be blocking radiation from the cooler cloud tops.  Below the clouds, in order for heat to 
escape the crust of the earth there would be an unstable lapse rate...basically enough for there to be a reason for the heat to rise (maxwell boltzmann distribution within a gravitational field).  Now the cloud tops would reflect a huge portion of the sun's mostly visible spectrum...but are basically black body emitters within their own temperature range.  So they cool the planet...but they do make the surface warmer than it would have been if the solid surface had the same absorption/emission properties of the clouds.

RE:ice albedo

Ok, perhaps I'm expecting too much from you here.  I'll simplify.  Yes, virginia...there is ice albedo feedback for any amount of polar ice that are in sunlight.  However there isn't really very much ice left.  During the glacial period there's plenty.  During the glacial period some of the polar ice is being hit by sunlight even in winter...which is even more impressive becauese a lot of the time the milankovitch cycle actually increases the size of the arctic circle.

Here, lets just look at an artist's impression of the earth at glacial maximum ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age ) and ponder the trivial ice albedo that's easily changed now.  Now we have a mere 5 million square kilometers at the north pole during the summer.  During the winters of the glacial maximum most of the arctic ocean is covered in ice.  There's a huge ice sheet covering western europe, there's a huge ice sheet in north america.  Basically the ice sheets in America and Europe are as big as the arctic summer ice is now...only they're extending to within about 40 degrees of the freaking equator.  And again, the arctic ice is actually stopping a large amount of heat from escaping during the winter.

And ONCE AGAIN, the thinner the arctic ice, the less insulation it provides.  Ice may not have the greatest R value...but the water underneath is at about 1C while the surface is at -40C or colder. Every bit of sea ice that's lost...results in more radiation escaping from the pole and also energy lost through phase changes.  I'm too lazy to check back but the last time I calculated...it takes about .5% of the earth's yearly budget to completely thaw the arctic from the 1-2 meters it will always freeze to again during winter.  

And of course it gives this energy off again during winter.  Also, once again, summer sea ice is covered in melt pools...and the ocean doesn't absorb quite as much as it does at the equator since the sunlight is hitting it at such a steep angle.  I'm not saying this eliminates the feedback but it significantly reduces it.  Throw in the fact that the 5 million square kilometers of ice is only about as effective as 2 million square kilometers of ice would be at the equator...and you can see why the interglacial period is so much more stable.  Ice albedo feedback is just too weak during the interglacial.  Yes...its a pale shadow of what it once was and anyone telling you different clearly hasn't thought it through.

RE:Desert albedo feedback

Why yes, most deserts are caused by some sort of barrier or natural conditions.  In this case easern europe and asia have a bit of a problem with air getting to them across an extremely cold ice sheet and the fact that a lot more of the northen hemisphere oceans are covered by ice for much more of the season.  Again, look here

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Last_glacial_vegetation_map.png

Africa and australia are ALSO usually desert...even during the glacial period.  **but** and this is an important but.  Because of the conditions at the start of the interglacial they turn into forests and grasslands and are dotted with lakes.  The deserts of eurasia blossom too, partly fed by the melt water of the very ice sheets that kept them so dry during the glacial period.  This is probably partly responsible for the apparent warmth of the interglacial optimums.

While not as pronounced as ice albedo feedback, the conversion of tundra and desert to forest and grasslands is a significant positive feedback.  CO2 increases BTW would also contribute to this feedback since higher CO2 levels significantly increase drought resistance in plants AND make plants grow faster under most circumstances.  Ironically some people worried about global warming have in fact cited tundra albedo feedback as a positive feedback (which in all honesty it is).  This article actually makes mention of tundra feedback http://www.eoearth.org/article/Arctic_tundra_and_polar_desert_ecosystems

I find it amusing that environmentalists would complain about this particular feedback though...because it represents a substantial increaes in the habitability of the earth...right where its most needed...crazy, ay?
http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2011/03/23/global-greening-continues-did-we-cause-it/

So anyway...yeah, not remotely worried about anthropogenic global warming or climate change.  It looks like a pretty darned positive change.  What I am concerned about is all these idiots concentrating PURELY on warming and switching energy sources at any cost...when the world is likely to cool a little in the short term (a bad thing) and when the environmental movement's going all in with climate change is likely to cause a negative backlash against the environmental movement and many of the **truly** beneficial environmental policies that have been put in place.

Not quite. If ""legality"" is determined by the indigenous inhabitants allowing the entrance of foreigners into their territory, then the majority of European Jewish immigration is illegal, since neither the Palestinians nor their Ottoman rulers allowed Jews to settle (in the later periods around the time of WWI). 

Even if you take Britain's jurisdiction over the ""mandates"" as legal, then a whole lot of Jewish immigration was illegal as well.

Relegate has a pejorative connotation, as it should in this context: it feels a bit disingenuous to call one month Black History Month and leave it at that.  In fact, it sounds more like a slogan than a movement.  

Raising awareness is obviously important, but I think there are more subtle, less segregational ways to do so than declaring a month 'Black History Month.'  The name 'Black History Month' is, in the first place, incredibly reductive.  It homogenizes what is, in fact, a very diverse population of people who happen to share a skin tone (or not, in cases of black albinism, or simply because, in my mind, nobody shares an exact skin tone).  While African American (and African-European) history is stained by the (obviously) dubious legacy of slavery, I'm unconvinced that simply naming a month 'Black History Month' is the best way to begin to eradicate oftentimes deeply-held racist convictions.  There needs to be a less conciliatory, more direct method of dispelling racism; not a passive slogan, but an active curriculum.

Now that I look at it with a slightly more mature outlook, a lot of the name calling was just that - kids taking the piss out of each other. If he got messed up, the name callers would have defended him. 

Using skin color and race to evaluate someones Merit, is something I have personally, not come across. I'm sure it happens though - anyone got any numbers/anecdotes/studies?

That said, I know we are chauvinistic and bigoted in other ways - look at the caste system. We assume people from different regions will conform to their stereotypes, (hicks come from up north/this region/ etc etc)
I would also say that we are perhaps 'racist' when it comes to beauty - women are supposed to be fair, and dark skin is considered a major evil. 
I'm not sure that would count as racism though. A dark skinned woman in the north is as unlucky as a dark skinned woman in the east when it comes to the good-look sweep stakes in Indian culture.

What I am getting to is that racism in India is a complex thing and depends largely on the context, region and participants. 
I think in comparison to the wests history of slavery, we don't have the same set of baggage or context.
Perhaps a better comparison is between different regions of Europe. The Germans think that the Greeks are lazy good for nothings, and the Greeks think the Germans are colourless humorless androids who only want to save money.

For example, there are countries in Europe (Switzerland, The Netherlands and Portugal) with fairly lax drug laws (social freedom). There are economic havens (Luxembourg, Bahamas) with very low tax rates (economic freedom). None are perfect from a libertarian perspective. The drug-tolerant countries tend to be left-leaning states with high taxes. The tax havens tend to be more right-wing and socially restrictive. Libertarians feel the combination of these two types of freedoms is worth striving for, even if either is restricted to the maximum level currently tolerated by any of the powers-that-be. Such a state would be far more libertarian than any currently in existence without pushing the legal envelope or creating any radically new policies.

My university runs an event called Jailbreak every year where teams have 36 hours to get as far away from campus as possible without spending any money. Most teams manage to get into Europe and stuff, and me and my friend were hoping for the same. 

We got picked up on [the M10](http://www.bradfordschools.net/hotpot/Unit%208.1/m25.gif) by an Albanian guy who was in convoy, following his Lithuanian friend who had just bought an old Merc. He basically told us that he would take us down the M10, and then AROUND London on the M25, and then start to head down the M20 towards Dover and drop us off somewhere along there.

For most of the journey, he was very unsettling. He said he was a physics teacher and I could tell he was lying (I'm a physics undergrad). In fact, the whole time he seemed to just be telling us conversational lies. To make matters worse, my friend who was sitting on the back seat fell asleep and while she was dozing he used that as an excuse to lock the car doors.

I suddenly realised something wasn't right when he came OFF the M25 and actually started driving into North London – something which wasn't on the plan at all. I started to get pretty scared at this point; when I asked him why we were driving into London and not staying on the M25 he kept saying ""My friend, he know shortcut, we follow him"" (for non-UK people:driving through London city traffic definitely isn't shorter than driving around the M25) and even when I got out a map of London and asked him to point to where we were going, he was being very vague.

I asked him if he could just drop us off at the nearest petrol station and he kept saying like ""No no, we nearly there"" and stuff. Eventually, I told him that they were tracking our phones and that I had already texted someone else his numberplate and his friend's numberplate (all of which a lie), at which point he phoned his friend, spoke in another language, and then begrudgingly let us off at the next petrol station.

It was the scariest experience of my life.

2,0,t1_c1x5dm0,history,,,"CPI is a relative measure of consumer price changes within an economy over time, and can't be used to compare prices between countries. I guess what you meant to say was that prices in Germany are lower -- as anyone who's ever been on a vacation in Western Europe can tell you, they're not, at all. Most things are considerably more expensive over here.

Here's [an index](http://www.economist.com/node/17257797?story_id=17257797) that can serve as a quick and easy indicator of consumer price levels between countries.

That's what PPP (purchasing power parity) is for, and it's usually already included in international statistics, including those by the BLS. For most statistics, they don't simply convert euros to dollars, but use ""dollars PPP"" or ""international dollars"" instead. The latter is normalized over time as well (i.e., it includes inflation, so that you can easily compare values from, say, the 50's to today). Otherwise, currency fluctuations would make comparisons very difficult.

There are other factors to consider, though, if you want to know what that means for an individual. Comparing this is very difficult. PPP is an important factor, but there are many ways to calculate it, and every organization uses its own. An American organization will include the price for peanut butter, one from Germany would put more weight on that for bratwurst, for example. When you get to housing cost, there's a huge cultural difference -- there's a strong emphasis on home ownership in the US, whereas there is no social stigma attached to renting in Germany. Houses are built differently (brick and mortar vs. wooden skeleton), too, and universities are free. So what goes into the product basket for the PPP calculation?

Another factor is how long people actually work for their share of GDP. Compared to the US, people work less in Germany. Average [hours worked](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS) are roughly 1400 per year, compared to 1800 in the US. That's due to shorter work weeks, (many) more vacation days and public holidays.  
Then you have to consider how many actually work. This isn't only about unemployment, but also about stay-at-home moms, part time jobs, and of course how large the share of the population is that are of working age. Here's a [breakdown of GDP](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DECOMP) by various metrics. Germany's is still less per hour, but it shrinks to 6% in per-hour-worked terms.

Next, how is this even distributed among the population? Neither of the two countries is homogenous geographically. There's a difference whether you live in NYC or in the South, and the same is true for East- and West Germany. [Income inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) is an important factor as well.

After customers apply mandatory security patch 3.61 to their PS3s and change their passwords, they will again have access to online play, the media service Qriocity, and third-party services including Netflix and Hulu.
Patrick Seybold, Sony’s senior director of Corporate Communications and Social Media, first acknowledged that the service was down on April 20 via the official PlayStation blog. The next day, Seybold estimated that it would be “a full day or two” until the service was back up.
On May 14, nearly a month later, Seybold posted again saying that the service was being brought back online in both Europe and North America. The Northeast and California got service back first, and as of noon today, all US states are online according to Sony’s status map. Full restoration of services, such as the PSN store and purchasing through Qriocity, is scheduled for the end of May.
It has not been a short month for Sony: in the days that followed the April 20 announcement, Sony admitted the service had been hacked and that 77 million registered accounts and their data, many with attached credit card numbers, had been exposed. Some Ars readers reported possibly related credit card fraud, and later Sony reported they would offer PSN members a year of identity theft protection.
On May 2, Sony Online Entertainment was attacked separately, exposing 24.6 million more accounts and at least 12,700 non-US credit or debit card numbers. On May 4, Sony failed to attend a House hearing on the attacks, but did send a letter claiming that the hacking group Anonymous had undertaken activities to bring PSN down.
Now that the service is back up, Sony is attempting to make good on many fronts. Seybold said the latest patch is critical in making PSN “significantly more secure,” and Sony has appointed a new chief information security officer, Fumiaki Sakai, who is also president of Sony Global Solutions.
On the customer service end, Sony has planned a “Welcome Back” package that includes a free month of PlayStation Plus as well as select entertainment content for free download (details on this bit of compensation are still to come).

Advantages: *in a pinch* you can use the 'phones without the adapter if battery becomes an issue, this would be easier with a spare extension cord.

It also fell far short of the median forecast of private-sector economists of annualised 2.3% growth over the preceding period.
 
Moreover, in nominal terms Japanese GDP has fallen behind China’s: US$1,336.9 billion for China against US$1,288.3 billion for Japan for the quarter.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – Looking at individual demand components, the domestic economy was sluggish, with the exception of private capital expenditure. Private non-residential investment grew by 0.5%, almost the same as in the previous quarter, on the back of improved profits. However, private residential and government investment spending declined sharply by 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – The contribution of inventories to GDP growth declined by 0.2 points. This is a bit surprising given the acceleration in imports, and might indicate that there is still room for an upward revision of growth at the next release.
 
Officials were particularly disturbed by the slowdown of personal consumption. Although the growth in consumer spending had been shored up by the government subsidies, such as those for the purchase of energy-efficient cars and the eco-point incentive program for purchasers of eco-friendly home electric appliances, the effects of these policies apparently wore off during the quarter.
 
The eco-car subsidies and eco-point system are due to end by the end of September and the end of this year respectively. Meanwhile, even though major corporations are awash with cash, they are extremely cautious about capital investment in view of uncertainties about the domestic and overseas economic situation.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – Exports, the prime driver of growth, rose 5.9% on strong demand from Europe. But the pace of growth slowed from a 7.0% rise in the previous quarter amid signs of an economic slowdown in China, one of the biggest destinations for Japanese exports.
 
It is well-known that Japanese GDP data are volatile and subject to drastic revisions in both directions. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the economy has slowed considerably.

Red candies were reintroduced later, but they also kept the orange colored M&amp;M's. They currently contain Allura Red AC (FD&amp;C Red #40, E129). In Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and Norway.[10] Instead, Cochineal (E120) is used in the red shells.

&gt;The small amount of electricity produced by wind turbines, particularly due to their inherently low capacity factors. If all the thousands of windmills in the US as of the end of 20021 operated with a 25% capacity factor, they would produce less electricity (10,260,150,000 kilowatt-hours – kWh) than two 750-megawatt (MW) gas-fired combined cycle generating plants operating in base load with an 80% capacity factor (10,512,000,000).2 The windmills are scattered over thousands acres in 27 states (90% in CA, TX, IA, MN, WA and OR), while the gas-fired plants would take up only a few acres. Also, they are available when needed (i.e., dispatchable), not just when the wind blows.

The facts are that as of 2011 there are 40 GW of wind capacity installed in the United States.  Capacity factor for wind in the United States is 28.8 percent, 31.7 percent in Europe.  This equates to 94,650,000,000 thousand megawatt-hours for 2010 in the United States.  This is 2.3 percent of total power produced in the United States, almost double of what was produced in 2008.

I'm not a huge fan of the U.S. or U.S. aid in all or even most cases, but it can be a way to possibly influence social policy in Ghana. Granted, this is coming from a Muslim group, but a lot of homophobia in African has been explicitly pushed by American Evangelicals and their missionary groups. In part because of these groups, there's a growing belief that LGBT people are the product of the undue sexual influence of the U.S. and Europe, an argument that has enormous political traction considering the longer history of exploitation between Europe and Africa.

Ghana is actually one of the more stable democracies in Africa, and denying aid on the basis of a Muslim group that, like Focus on the Family, represents a political organization that claims to represent a religious constituency. They don't necessarily represent Ghana. Most importantly, I don't see how removing aid (most of which is medical and infrastructural) on the basis of Ghanaian homophobia will lead to the improvement of LGBT Ghanaians' lives. Maybe the U.S. could offer to airlift the hundreds of thousands of LGBT Ghanaians to the U.S., but more than likely LGBT Ghanaians want the same opportunities to transform their own society that activists in other parts of the world have had. If LGBT people in America want liberation everywhere, then we're going to have to recognize that liberation is geographically and politically specific (think of the difference between SF and Atlanta, both of which have a vibrant LGBT politics but one that emerged before the other because of the geopolitical differences of SF and Atlanta). That means empowering LGBT activists in other places with as much support as possible, which I think the U.S. can only do through aid programs that attempt to stabilize electoral institutions and reduce the physical effects (starvation, malnutrition, lack of basic healthcare and immunizations) of poverty that inevitably destabilize states and leave the most socially and culturally vulnerable (in this case LGBT people) open to attack.

It's difficult to find LGBT Ghanaian or LGBT African responses to what is clearly an endemic problem, even if it's being exacerbated to a crisis point by American missionaries.

- Freedom of speech: The ability to say blasphemous things. Please name one Islamic majority state that has a proven track record of _not_ arresting or prosecuting people for making statements that while not threatening to individuals, do blaspheme against Islam.

- Freedom of sexuality: How many Islamic majority countries tolerate open homosexuality and fornication? Dubai is the most 'tolerant' in this regard and there have been several high-profile cases of gay man and transexuals in trouble.

- Freedom from torture: Flogging, amputation and stoning are all forms of torture as defined by the UN, EU and US constitutions and declarations.

&gt;but wasn't Israel founded following legal migration

""Wrong again. The UN partition plan, resolution 181 was a general assembly resolution and not legally binding. It had no legal force to ""grant"" land that was already inhabited. The British mandate also had no power to grant land. The mandate given to Britain was only to administer the land since the Ottoman empire had been defeated and withdrew. Britain did not own the land or have the right to give any away and in fact it didn't give any away.

As far as purchase, less than 7% of the land that became Israel was purchased legally. The rest was taken via expropriation - nationalization of private property after 700,000 Palestinian were driven out by Jewish forces during 1948.""-Credit to [Bumbaclaat](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bumbaclaat), as I am often forced to correct these misonceptions over and over, I am tired of writing, so thanks bumbaclaat.

The British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, so many Jews migrated to Palestine illegally. Over 100,000 people attempted to illegally enter Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships made to Palestine. The Jews created closed off militaristic farming settlements called kibbutzes when they came and even kicked off Palestinian Jews which they saw as squatters. They actually continued coming in the thousands, year after year, from all over the world. Between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine, but soon this number would grow and increase.

They were, however, NOT from the ""Ottoman Empire"" but mainly from Russia. This post is incredibily dishonest and I am angered by how many upvotes this received.

&gt;and weren't Israeli territorial expansions beyond those agreed upon by the international community a direct result of repeated invasions?

[The UN Charter forbid conquest as a legal form of territorial acquisition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest)

When the Jews invaded Palestinian villages they drove people from their homes, and basically had a shoot to kill policy of anyone attempting to return to their village or home, this decision would later result an the obvious blood feud we have today. Not only that, the Palestinians have the right of return under [UN General Assembly resolution 194](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_194), which was passed on December 11, 1948 and is still not recognized by Israel today.

&gt;(The General Assembly) Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.

Here's some more relevant quotes for you,

What about Jews basically erasing the identity of the native population?

* ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."" Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983. 

* ""Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist... There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population."" Moshe Dayan, address to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.

* ""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai."" David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff. From Ben-Gurion, A Biography, by Michael Ben-Zohar, Delacorte, New York 1978.""

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is that Palestine strikes me as just as contrived a nationality

The Palestinians are not foreigners to the region, as they have a right to be there as proven by genetic testing.

""'Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and Jordan...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills after the Romans expelled the Jews were a potpourri: farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity, descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old Canaanite tribes. -Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, ""Their Promised Land.'""

---------
""But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin."" -Illene Beatty, ""Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.""

Credit to Bumbaclaat for the quotes.

Palestine has existed for hundreds of years, the indigenous and native population(The Palestinians) have lived there for thousands of years. The boarders of Palestine have existed as early as the 1800s. 
Here are some pound notes of Palestine,
http://www.banknotes.com/PS10.JPG

Even the Israeli ""Jerusalem Post"" was called the Palestine post. Don't try this revisionist history stuff here. Don't deny the existence of the native population.

Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and Mongols, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were ravging ...The various cultures exist for brief moments in history before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine.

The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

This matter is very well established, and genetic studies have proven the Palestinians are actually genetically homogeneous among each other and different compared to Arabs in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan. Modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/imperial-history.html

I'm not going over 3000 years of history with you, but if you'd like, you're free to check out the histories of the people named in the map and in that write up, ""Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders""

1. Obesity started to climb when HFCS began to be widely introduced into the USA food supply 30-odd years ago.  
1. It has a higher Glycemic Index, which in general is a bad thing.
1. It has been proven to increase food and caloric consumption in cattle and humans, having some effect on the way we determine ""fullness"" and certainly induces calorie craving.  The sugar in HFCS, doesn’t stimulate leptin, a hormone which tells your body it’s full.
1. It is heavily subsidised to promote its use in US industry, and as it is so cheap it is used to bulk out foodstuffs in place of wholesome ingredients.  There are many labs sponsored to look for ways to introduce it into foods where it doesn't belong.
1. In blind tests, many people seem to be able taste the difference and say sugar tastes better.  I for one can taste the difference between EU coke and US coke, IMHO EU coke is **much** nicer.
1. Recent research says HFCS may be harmful to the liver and amongst things cause kidney disease.
1. HFCS has been found to contain levels of mercury.
1. HFCS is bad for the environment as corn is grown as a mono culture rather than a rotated crop. This maximizes yields, but it depletes soil nutrients, requiring more pesticides and fertilizer while weakening topsoil.
1. It can be dangerous for diabetics because their body doesn’t process it like sugar (glucose) which can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels.
1. HFCS is unnatural not just in its production, but in its growing as it often made from genetically-modified corn.

When I had the teacher-classes, teaching me how to become a teacher, I was really nervous for the first lessons where I'd teach someone elses class to get some experience. I'd literally run to the toilet before I'd do the class because of the stress.

*However...* teaching your *own* class, which is what happened when I had my first teacher job, is a totally different experience. The thing is: you are not teaching someone else's class, you are teaching your *own* class. Which gives you a lot of freedom. Freedom to introduce rules/set boundaries, which make you and the class happy.

So, what happened? I made some mistakes. Biggest one: playing games on the board when there was time left... which resulted in a big chaos. And I had a lot of fun. Still remember the moment I was really angry at the class and was like: ""Ok guys, listen up, quiet everyone. This is getting too much. It's noisy, you are not working enough. Think *with* me for a second: how can we improve the class? Anyone any ideas?"" And then Marc (still remember his name) really eagerly raised his hand. ""Yes Marc"". ""Put tape on all the kid's mouthes"". I was just laughing. The nerve to come up with that ridiculous answer. I think you need to have humor as a teacher, sometimes these kids can be real smartasses/funny.

Regarding evolution theory, I've had to teach subjects which were close to it (general science) and I made it clear to the class that I was an atheist. Not literally, but, you'd be stupid to not notice. I must say however, that I've not been teaching in the US but in Europe. There tend to be a lot more atheists there, and less bible belt people.

My biggest tip for new teachers is: be yourself. Set boundaries which make *you* as a person happier. You have to shape the environment you work in, which is the class room. So make sure that you enjoy staying in that class room. The way to achieve that, is to punish/discourage behaviour which bothers you, and promote/stimulate behaviour which makes you happy. And, treat your kids in class with respect. Tell them *why* you are angry with them, make it clear where it comes from. In the same way, also tell them *why* you think they are doing good.

After we had something partly resembling sex / partly resembling two jelly donuts being smashed into a tub of crisco, she ran out into the party and told everyone that ""her vagina hurt."" This particular jam party set a precedent which I would continually fail to overcome.  

My very next sexual encounter was experienced in an equally inebriated state. A girl with semi-serious emotional issues (clearly I had some as well, in so far as I found her ""crazy"" a bit attractive) invited me up to her bedroom from the WOOO-MY-PARENTS-ARE-VAGUELY-EUROPEAN-AND-LENIENT party she was hosting. After a solid fifteen minutes of petting, pot, and Pink Floyd, she offers me a condom, I slip in, and--good god it's like taking a dip in a pool. I mean, this girl is gushing. Sweet, I think to myself, I must be really good at this. So good, in fact, I'm sweating like a brie wheel in baghdad. I wipe my face. *But.* Red. Everything is red. I look down to find there are two-inch-long, leaking gouges all over this girl's legs. Annnd she appears to be on her period. It's a heavy-flow day. So I fake a premature orgasm--which must have been more of a high-pitched yelp--and flee to her bathroom, to frantically scrub myself and my favorite boxers clean. There are bloody razors in her sink.   

And finally: I spent one year of college living in glorified laundry room behind a paisley curtain down the street from a 7-11. One drunken night (I'm beginning to parse a trend), a mousey girl from my major accompanies me home at the promise of a [P'EatZZA Sandwich](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mb_matt/131021351/), bourbon, and fucking. Objectives one and two obtained, we move behind my curtain, hop on my 99 dollar Ikea futon, and she starts to garble my yarbles. For a Brontes fan, she can really suck a dick. I swear. And she's doing that deep throat thing that I've seen in all of the videos. You know, like Sasha Jameson or whoever. It's great, except... she's gagging a bit and, wait, no she's vomiting. Vomiting not so much onto my dick, as into it. It burns. It's everywhere. At this point, thankfully, I'm used to sexual malfunction.

6,0,t1_c1x623o,Israel,,,"&gt;You argument is rather bizarre. Having a legal case, which the Palestinians do, is why they have political support. 

That is utter nonsense. They have political support because of lots and lots of Arab money has gone to support them. They have political support because it was the one issue in the Arab world where Arabs were allowed to say something. They have political support because in the 20th century Jews magically when from being Oriental (Levantine) and foreign to being White at a time when many Europeans decided being White was politically bad. But legal case? Sorry, but UN Resolutions really are not law. 

Do the people of Darfur and Southern Sudan not have the law on their side? Do the Congolese not have the law on their side? Yet deafening silence. How about the 60 years of Fatah/Hamas deliberate strategy based on war crimes? An explicit criminal strategy does not seem to affect that political support. It rather amazes me how people will go on and on saying that using WP is illegal (it isn't, using as a weapon is) and that therefore Israel is horrible. And then they will turn and say that the Palestinians have no choice, so it is acceptable for them to commit war crimes. 

&gt;It's akin to saying, criminals don't respect the law, the are only caught by the cops. Well the cops get involved when criminals don't respect the law.

I'll say the truth again and you can shift it again: nations don't respect the law. There has been a small weak movement in the 20th century towards dealing with some issue by law, but overwhelmingly relations between nations, and particularly conflicts between non-allies are not handled via a legal system. 

Now maybe I am wrong. Maybe you have examples of a war between parties that was then resolved by adjudication through a legal system. Maybe you can show us some war where it was law the determined the outcome. ",0,1427201057,t3_homoa,1306934792,6,,0,False,True,matts2,c1x623o,t1_c1x60dp,False,t5_2qhvo

LLLLOOOOOLLLL!

&gt;So their fighters go up, and get shot down if they try to come near the operational altitudes of US fighters.

That's why they won't do that. They will fly at mountain level. They will likely use their old Mig-17's (which they have a lot of) as a kind of fake attack. They'll be armed with bombs that will do basically nothing but cause panic, but they will force the ROK and US air forces to deal with them. Then they'll come in with their slightly more modern jets, which can actually hit targets. It's not like it's going to be a terribly effective strategy, but it's the best they can hope to do.

&gt;As to their SAM network, even if we don't take it with cruise missiles, there will be Wild Weasels and their AGM-88s to contend with.

Only if they keep their radar stations on at all times. If you think they didn't learn anything from the Balkans, then again, you're very foolish. They know their limitations and they know the abilities of their enemies.

Brazil also have a regular league season, it is not comparable with the US league structure.

The Dutch league only have a play off for the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th placed teams to get into the qualifying for the Europa League, they do not have it for the Champions League and 2 superior Europa League spots. 

The Mexican league structure is crazy, not comparable with the US leagues.

The problem I see with the MLS is that it clearly needs more support and money, but the league is competing with the NFL, NBA etc, which are deep rooted in American culture. Where can the MLS generate more cash? Selling TV rights to Europe and Asia, also increasing advertising revenue, then when the league is more established it can use its greater revenue to attract a greater American audience. So to do this you need to make the league more appealing to Europe and Asia. Dropping the playoff system would help, at least for the outright winner of the league. The league needs to attract more big European names, but not the likes of Beckham and Henry, they make the league look like a place for a comfortable retirement. Lots of players that go to the Turkish league would be good additions to the MLS, the likes of Guiza, Niang, Yobo, Lugano, Elmander etc. They are recognisable names but would benefit the MLS. But for this the league might need to drop the salary cap or at least relax it.

&gt;It follows that temperatures must have been higher than those of today’s during that first settlement of Greenland which lasted from approximately 900 until the mid-1400s AD, when these settlements died out.

No. It follows that temperatures were probably warmer for longer than the modern period until recently, but it does not follow that the recent warming, which is unearthing the items described, has not exceeded the medieval warming of Greenland. And in fact, we can look at the Greenland ice core record to see that it has: 

http://i.imgur.com/ElTKk.png

This plot was from the last time WUWT tried to promulgate BS about warmer than present Greenland temps, showing the GISP2 ice core and GRIP updates scaled to GISP values for the modern warming. 

&gt;Yet the whole reason for the existence of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPPC) 

The IPPC, huh?

&gt;is to thrust upon the world’s population the idea that industrialisation in the West over the last 100 years and our profligate use of fossil fuels is producing a run-away heating of the planet

This is a strawman on several counts. We're not worried about a ""run-away"" warming like that on Venus. We're worried about changes to climatic norms that will prove more detrimental than the cost of limiting emissions to avoid those changes. 

&gt;through the emission of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, which unless checked will lead to [the planet's] — and humanity’s — death. 

I'd like to see the cite for that from any of the ARs. Again, strawman.

&gt;So the possibility that temperatures were higher in the past in any part of the world was a thorn in the sides of those Climatologists who are wedded to the whole idea of Anthopogenic Global Warming (AGW), also known as Climate Change.

Again, this is false. Warmer than present temperatures undeniably took place in Earth's geologic past, this has no bearing on the reality of anthropogenic warming or its potential to disrupt climatic norms.

&gt;Unfortunately for them, an English Climatologist, Hubert H Lamb, first formulated the idea of a Medieval Warming Period (MWP) in 1965 and other surveys have found that this warming did not just occur in the northwestern hemisphere but was global (6). 

Lamb's maximum warming took place hundreds of years after (i.e. 1100-1300) the peak warming of the NH is now recognized to have taken place (prior to 1000). 

http://i.imgur.com/5o65B.png

http://i.imgur.com/MdwKc.png


Lamb did not believe that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (or ""Medieval Warm Epoch"" as he originally called it) was a period of continuous temporally and spatially coherent global warming, but rather that it was more pronounced in the Atlantic Northern Hemisphere. You can see Lamb's own discussion of the subject [here](http://sites.google.com/site/medievalwarmperiod/Home) (note, I haven't read the other contents of that page beyond verifying that the quotes from Lamb's writings are correct and in context. I'm in a hurry and couldn't find a publicly accessible version of Lamb's texts. If the guy starts talking about Lizard people, disregard his comments and stick to what Lamb says).

Much like Lamb, modern paleoclimate scientists believe the MCA was characterized by a warm North Atlantic, giving rise to unusual warmth in Western Europe and Eastern North America. Like Lamb, they believe that the MCA was marked by cooling of much of the North Pacific and Asia. 

Unlike Lamb, they have a wealth of paleoclimatic and physics-based modeling data that has only become available in past several decades. The MCA seems to have been dominated by persistent La Niña-like and positive NAO conditions, similar to but differing in origin and some specific consequences than Lamb's proposed proximate causes.

&gt;But Dr David Darning (University of Oklahoma College of Earth and Energy) in his recent testimony to Congress (7) said ‘…I received an astonishing email from a major researcher in the area of climate change. It said “We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period”’ 

Where is this email? Why quote this Darning instead of the email itself?

Possibly because it's an apocryphal quote, based on the innocuous comment by Phil Jones indicating a desire to reconstruct temps far back enough to capture the entirety of any MCA: ""it would be nice to try to ""contain"" the putative ""MWP"", even if we don't yet have a hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back"".

Etc. 

*Edited to add:* 

&gt;In 1998 a graph was produced by geophysicist Michael Mann, known as the Hock Stick Graph’, which managed to almost air-brush out of existence the Medieval Warming Period . 

[Mann et al. 1998 only went back ~600 years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6678/abs/392779a0.html), and said nothing about the time of the MCA. 

&gt;This was published in the eminent scientific magazine Nature and also in several places in the IPPC Report of 2001 and created a world-wide sensation. Here was proof positive the world was overheating and it was All Our Fault.

As has been pointed out exhaustively, the millennial NH reconstructions say very little on the issue of attribution, and indeed if you throw out all of our late Holocene reconstructions, that would have virtually no impact on the evidence for attribution of the present warming to human causes. 

&gt;However, investigation of the graph by historians and climatologists who doubted the existence of global warming, brought criticism centred around the statistical method used and the associated computer programme. It was eventually called the most discredited study in the history of science 

[The author of this article was eventually called the dumbest person in the history of dummies](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7097/full/4411032a.html). I was eventually called the tallest matador in all of Spain. Gee, this is fun!

&gt;and quietly dropped by the IPPC from the latest 2007 IPPC report for policy makers.

The Mann et al. study was [plotted along with other paleoclimatic reconstructions published between the TAR and the AR4](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html):

Yeah, you quoted my statement but then, wrote something completely irrelevant to my statement. I talked about entering another culture's space while your response was about public space. Public space is what you leave when you enter the space discussed here.

&gt;It's also worth reminding you that it was you who stated that communities who refuse to assimilate should leave. None of my arguments have been so potentially racist as that is.

I'd rather follow the rule that is ""potentially racist"" (although I don't know what it has to do with race, anyway), than follow the opposite rule that has already, in reality, proved to have catastrophic effects. Just think about the Muslim communities in France or the Netherlands. There is a huge problem, because some minority members display high level of aggression, which is unacceptable in the local communities and the local law. For a long time, nobody wanted them to ""assimilate or gtfo"", and now, some of them are so unassimilated, it has become a serious social issue. At the same time, there are assimilated Muslim communities in Europe (e.g. Tatars in Eastern Europe) and they're not an issue. They're of different ethnicity and religion from most of the locals, but as they behave in accordance to the local culture and law's demands, most people have no problem with that.
I remember that Turkish peer I had at the uni. He was sometimes a bit funny, he sometimes preached about God and it was clear his culture was completely different. Sometimes it was impossible not to laugh at some of his behaviours (usually behind his back), but I can't imagine any of us showing him open hostility, because the guy was very careful to respect our culture and customs and somehow it made us respect his.

The first day of my senior year of high school i met this very pretty Romanian girl. She sat directly behind me in homeroom. She and her family had just moved to my town over the summer. By the end of the week we had plans to hang out after school on Friday, so i could show her around the town a bit. Friday comes slowly, but as i watch her walk toward me and my car i have a feeling it will be worth the wait.

We hop in my 1972 Delta88 broham and head off to local pizza shop. We grab a quick slice and soda, then jump back in the lead sled and begin to cruise the town. I drive around and show her all the fav hang out spots in town, then we stopped and grabbed a blizzard from DQ. She said she really appreciated me showing her around and wanted to show me her families new house.

Her house was big, much bigger than mine. It was decorated in a very modern and European style. I remember thinking to myself, damn this bitch is rich. We make our way up to her room and start fooling around on the bed. I'm a bit hesitant at first, but she assures me her parents only come around about once a week, and they only bought the house so she could attend a good school district. I nod in approval as we start to peel each others clothes off.

This girl was crazy good. She's deepthroating, ball licking, under ball licking (my first chode tickle btw), and moaning like a pornstar the whole time. Now i got her turned around on the bed and taking from behind, she's facing the window, and my back is to the door. All of a sudden i feel something wiggling in my ass. I turn around and see her 23 yr old, 220lb mentally handicapped sister licking my ass. I freak the fuck out, and am now standing in the corner listening to my new fb tell me about her sister. She tells me back in Romania her ex boyfriend didn't mind if her sister joined, because everyone knew it's the only chance she would ever get to play with some dick. I'm in shock, and not really sure what to say.

So for about 8 months every time i banged her, she would involve her sister. Sometimes her sister would just sit in the corner and jack off her Labradoodle, i prayed for those days.

""Wrong again. The UN partition plan, resolution 181 was a general assembly resolution and not legally binding. It had no legal force to ""grant"" land that was already inhabited. The British mandate also had no power to grant land. The mandate given to Britain was only to administer the land since the Ottoman empire had been defeated and withdrew. Britain did not own the land or have the right to give any away and in fact it didn't give any away.

As far as purchase, less than 7% of the land that became Israel was purchased legally. The rest was taken via expropriation - nationalization of private property after 700,000 Palestinian were driven out by Jewish forces during 1948.""-Credit to [Bumbaclaat](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bumbaclaat), as I am often forced to correct these misonceptions over and over, I am tired of writing, so thanks bumbaclaat.

The British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, so many Jews migrated to Palestine illegally. Over 100,000 people attempted to illegally enter Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships made to Palestine. The Jews created closed off militaristic farming settlements called kibbutzes when they came and even kicked off Palestinian Jews which they saw as squatters. They actually continued coming in the thousands, year after year, from all over the world. Between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine, but soon this number would grow and increase.

They were, however, NOT from the ""Ottoman Empire"" but mainly from Russia. This post is incredibily dishonest and I am angered by how many upvotes this received.

&gt;and weren't Israeli territorial expansions beyond those agreed upon by the international community a direct result of repeated invasions?

[The UN Charter forbid conquest as a legal form of territorial acquisition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest)

When the Jews invaded Palestinian villages they drove people from their homes, and basically had a shoot to kill policy of anyone attempting to return to their village or home, this decision would later result an the obvious blood feud we have today. Not only that, the Palestinians have the right of return under [UN General Assembly resolution 194](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_194), which was passed on December 11, 1948 and is still not recognized by Israel today.

&gt;(The General Assembly) Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.

Here's some more relevant quotes for you,

What about Jews basically erasing the identity of the native population?

* ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."" Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983. 

* ""Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist... There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population."" Moshe Dayan, address to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.

* ""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai."" David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff. From Ben-Gurion, A Biography, by Michael Ben-Zohar, Delacorte, New York 1978.""

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is that Palestine strikes me as just as contrived a nationality

The Palestinians are not foreigners to the region, as they have a right to be there as proven by genetic testing.

""'Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and Jordan...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills after the Romans expelled the Jews were a potpourri: farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity, descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old Canaanite tribes. -Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, ""Their Promised Land.'""

---------
""But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin."" -Illene Beatty, ""Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.""

Credit to Bumbaclaat for the quotes.

Palestine has existed for hundreds of years, the indigenous and native population(The Palestinians) have lived there for thousands of years. The boarders of Palestine have existed as early as the 1800s. 
Here are some pound notes of Palestine,
http://www.banknotes.com/PS10.JPG

Even the Israeli ""Jerusalem Post"" was called the Palestine post. Don't try this revisionist history stuff here. Don't deny the existence of the native population.

Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and Mongols, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were ravging ...The various cultures exist for brief moments in history before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine.

The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

This matter is very well established, and genetic studies have proven the Palestinians are actually genetically homogeneous among each other and different compared to Arabs in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan. Modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

I'm not going over 3000 years of history with you, but if you'd like, you're free to check out the histories of the people named in the map and in that write up, ""Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders""

In Halo 3, you would be dead in less than that. Starcraft requires incredibly quick reflexes, Halo requires incredibly quick reflexes+1.

Neither low level Starcraft nor low level Halo require much decision making at all.

Mid-level Starcraft is silver, if we're using statistics. But I'll humour you and say gold, because that's what you'd assume. At gold, macro is important. Decision making and strategy are not. Learning about all that shit isn't necessary at that level, as stated by IdrA, Destiny, Incontrol and Painuser, all people who know what they're taking about. 

Mid level Halo could be maybe 35 in MLG, if we're talking mid-level competitive play.

I've thought about the aliens before.  The proper analogy would be the Europeans and sub-Saharan Africa.

It's a power balance issue, I believe.

comment section

""The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries."" 
-James Madison, 1803

""Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States the danger of encroachment by Ecclesiastical Bodies, may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history""
- James Madison, 1820

""All religions united with government are more or less inimical to liberty. All separated from government, are compatible with liberty.""
-Henry Clay, 1818

""I could not do otherwise without transcending the limits prescribed by the Constitution for the President and without feeling that I might in some degree disturb the security which religion nowadays enjoys in this country in its complete separation from the political concerns of the General Government.""
- President Andrew Jackson, 1832

""The divorce between Church and State ought to be absolute. It ought to be so absolute that no Church property anywhere, in any state, or in the nation, should be exempt from equal taxation; for if you exempt the property of any church organization, to that extent you impose a tax upon the whole community"" 
- James Garfield, 1874

""Leave the matter of religion to the family, the altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate""
- Ulysses S. Grant, 1875

""I found that they (members of clergy from assorted faiths) differed upon matters of detail alone, and that they all attributed the peaceful dominion of religion in their country mainly to the separation of church and state. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did not meet a single individual, of the clergy or the laity, who was not of the same opinion on this point.""
- Alexis de Toqueville, Democracy in America; 1835

For answers to the other questions:

1) Top advice is just be aware of your surroundings.  Criminals usually target easy marks so being aware of what's going on around you will reduce your chances of getting mugged/pick pocketed drastically.  I don't want to say that you shouldn't worry about it, but definitely don't let the thought of getting pickpocketed ruin your trip-- Barcelona is a pretty safe city.

2) Luggage lockers are in airports, and train/bus stations.  You may even get the hotel/hostel to store it for you if you're coming back.  I haven't heard of things going missing once they are locked up, but if you are staying at a hostel and they let anyone in the luggage room (i.e. not locked)-- that's not the best sign.

3) I honestly love this bag: [Rick Steves Convertible Carry-On](http://www.amazon.com/Rick-Steves-Convertible-Carry-Size/dp/B003JZCQUU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=apparel&amp;qlEnable=1&amp;qid=1306941653&amp;sr=1-1). Big enough to fit a good amount of stuff, holds up to wear and tear, you can check it or carry it on, space not wasted (weight not added) for wheels.  There are a couple options for camera/laptop bags, I can't remember the brand of the one I use though-- remember that you can generally bring a camera/laptop bag in addition to your carry on.

4) I'd definitely recommend Portugal (especially Lisbon).  Can't really go wrong with most of Spain but beware of the heat-- Seville has the warmest summer in the European continent.  You won't find much to do (nor will you want to do much) in the middle of the day.

5) I'm not a huge fan of e or the scene in Ibiza, but I would imagine that it's as good as any place to ask him if he wants to try it.

Which is not saying much. ""Der Einfluß der räumlichen Korrelation auf die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit bei bimolekularen Elementarreaktionen in dichten Medien"" and ""Untersuchung des Mechanismus von Zerfallsreaktionen mit einfachem Bindungsbruch und Berechnung ihrer Geschwindigkeitskonstanten auf der Grundlage quantenchemischer und statistischer Methoden"" has nothing to do with nuclear chemistry or physics. Or engineering. Or radiology. Or risk assessement.

She's not competent.

&gt; The 17 reactors have contributed heavily to the European giant's energy needs

This is incorrect. Nuclear power produced only 14% of Germany's electricity, and 11% of total energy.

&gt; Germany hopes to largely replace the lost nuclear energy with renewables such as wind and solar

Already only 4 reactors out of 17 are operating, and there are no shortages. This is all domestically generated, there is negligible additional net imports.

Nuclear is a paper tiger.

&gt; It will be a vital test case for a world fumbling to find the way toward cleaner energy

Not cleaner -- having *sustainable energy* at all. There are no options.

&gt; If Germany of all countries can’t make this work, it will send a bad signal to the rest of the world,

Far worse. If Germany can't make it work, we're fucked. It's over.

&gt; Few in Germany deny it is a gamble. 

It's not a gamble. It's what it happens when you wait long enough until your only option is a rushed last-minute conversion. There are no alternative. Lap up the pie, you made it yourself.

&gt; At present, Germany gets about 23 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants

At present, it's 7 GW. Out of about 50 GW peak at the moment. Look:

http://www.transparency.eex.com/de/

Electricity is about 590 TWh, so if this stays that way that would be more like 9.5%.

&gt; While it is a U-turn for Merkel

It isn't. The phase-out is the slowest she could make it without voters recognizing it as the transparent ruse it is.

&gt; The opposing, and indeed unavoidable, argument is that the cost of electricity will rise. 

No, it won't. More scare-mongering.

&gt; is appalled by the rigid deadline

Rigid? It's the slowest exit they agreed upon during the red-greens, so whence the sudden whining? The current plan allows operation until 2022, actually.

&gt; They are now considering legal action against the government.

And of course Merkel knows this, and in fact set it up to happen that way.

&gt;Implanon is one of the least efficient contraceptives


Efficiency refers to the amount of hormones required for a safe contraceptive effect. The copper IUD does not release any hormones and is licensed for 10 years use ; the Mirena (levonorgestrel IUD) works releasing 20 micrograms (mcg) of levonorgestrel a day (d) through a rate-limiting membrane and is indicated for 5 years use whilst Implanon begins releasing etonogestrel at a rate of 60-70  mcg/d and is removed at 3 years as it drops to a rate of 25-30 mcg/d.


Effectiveness refers to the rate at which a contraceptive is successful at preventing pregnancy. I made no comment as to the Implanon's effectiveness. I did, however, realise that I should not comment about efficiency without making note of effectiveness. 


The most recent data was from a study in December last year concluding that with typical usage, the Pearl Index (ranges) and Net/life (range, per 100) are as follows: 

*IUD: 0.09-0.11 ; 0 - 0.8

*Implant: 0-0.3 ; 0 - 0.3

*Copper IUDs &gt; or equal to 300mm^2 surface area: 0.16-1.26 ; 0 - 6.5


Having said that, the study shows that the (hormone) IUD and the implant are of a similar efficacy as female sterilisation in preventing pregnancy over the first year: Gross per 100 (1 year life ; range)

*IUD: 0 - 0.6

*Implant: 0 - 0.2

*Female sterilisation: 0.11 - 0.69


Compared to life: (again, gross per 100; range; this time over life of method)
*IUD: 0 - 1.1
*Implant: 0 - 1.3
*Female sterilisation: 0.08 -0.69


I originally stated Implanon is one of the least efficient hormonal contraceptives; it is however, the second most effective hormonal contraceptive. Second to the hormone IUD but above the copper IUD.

We have labor arbitrage going on. Why should a hard working Chinese guy get a dollar a day when an equally skilled American guy get $15/hour? In a market economy, market forces are going to favor the Chinese guy earning more and the American guy earning less. And if we believe in human equality, then that correction is a good thing.

Let's run through our lists with Egypt:

Force: Egypt had an [official legal system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#Legal_system) responsible for hearing both criminal and civil disputes. I suppose people could settle matters between themselves with violence, but the presence of a court system suggests that doing so was at the very least discouraged.

Taxation: We both agree here I think. How else could the Pharaohs have paid for all that gold and the pyramids?

Bureacracy: Egypt had the class of [Scribes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe#Ancient_Egypt). Scribes were among the elite few who could read and write. They were responsible for [assessing taxes, keeping records and other administrative tasks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#Legal_system).

Paper and writing: [Papyrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus) is known to have been used in Egypt at least as far back as the First Dynasty, which began circa 3100 BC. The earliest known use of [hieroglyphic writing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs) is the [Narmer Palette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette) circa 3200 BC.

Succession: [Pharaohs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoah) usually succeeded one another in the usual fashion of hereditary monarchies. Of course, dynasties came and went, so the process didn't always go smoothly. But that [sort of thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses) has happened a lot more recently too.

Identity: The Ancient Egyptian name for Egypt was [Kemet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_(name\)), which means ""black land"" referring to the fertile soil of the Nile Valley. 

Also, the vast amount of monumental architecture and art depicting the power and glory of the Pharaohs shows that their legitimacy as rulers was the dominant ideology. What the peasants thought is lost, however, since they were probably all illiterate and left no records.

So in other words, even though most didn't believe the Aryan's *Urheimat* was in Germany, Scandinavia, or necessarily even in Europe (many proposed Tibet, and you've probably heard about the Nazi-funded archaeological expeditions to the region), that didn't contradict their beliefs because, in their opinion, the Nordics represented a splinter group who had maintained their purity throughout their migrations to eventual settlement of Central Europe.

As for inclusivity, the highest tier was generally restricted for Nordic-Aryans (which included the British, but not the European-derived Americans because of their perceived ""melting pot"" heritage) and the lowest invariably included Jews and Gypsies, and usually Slavs and sub-Saharan Africans.

&gt;The T-34 is widely regarded as the best tank of WW2 and the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik, also called the ""flying tank"" was one of the best fighter bombers of WW2. The Russians equipment was not as bad as most people believe.
Consider this though, the German army during world war 2 when it first invaded Russia was almost all battle hardened soldiers, had superior equipment and good supply lines. Yet they were eventually destroyed by the Russians poorly trained conscripts.

Once again, wrong. The T-34 was out gunned and out armoured by the King Tiger, the germans developed the KT after encountering the T-34, they developed this by **learning from their losses.**

Also stating that the 3.3 Million men deployed by the Wehrmacht as hardened warriors is a bit of a stretch. The majority of units deployed in Barbarossa hadn't taken part in the invasion of France and western Europe.

Lastly, the Germans weren't stopped by the Russians until well after they had already halted Operation Barbarossa after the Russian Winter started and they had no choice but to stop as their tanks couldn't operate in the mud and snow due to their small width tracks. Also the fact that most of the German army was actually not equipped at all to operate in harsh winter condition's because their high command hadn't issued the majority of their combat troops with the appropriate winter clothing because they believed their weapons and men to be superior and that they could force the Russians to capitulate before winter kicked in. 

The IL2's capabilities have been greatly over estimated, the main reason they were so effective was the sheer volume deployed into battle zones, they were known then and today as being very, very inaccurate ground attack weapons.

&gt;You are advocating escalating our commitment to conflicts simply so our army can be ""better prepared"" for a future war.

Show me where I said that. What I said is that Armies learn how to make themselves better by reviewing and adjusting their tactics based upon successes and failures.


&gt;Fighting a war, like most things is a learnt skill. Since ancient times training has played a major roll in preparing troops for battle. Even today if you argued that training is irrelevant with any commander in any army you would be laughed at. Training in an army is paramount.

Pray do tell, where do the training manuals come from to teach new recruits? Like I said, they're made from assesments and studying a militarys success's and failures, this is the ***entire*** point I've been making all along.

&gt;Holy shit, learn to proof-read.

Considering I was on my phone and rushed while at work, 3 mistakes out of a total of 407 words. I'd say that's a fairly good success ratio.

You've misread pretty much 99% of everything I've wrote. You seem to think I'm saying we need to be in a state of perpetual warfare so we can become the best. What I have been saying is that without an army that has REAL battlefield experience and battlefield knowledge that we can use to train and teach to our newer recruits, we **WILL** get chewed up and spat out the day we're invaded.

If you'd like to debate WWI or WWII or in fact any military doctrine/tactics you're more than welcome.

I think Civ 5 is a fundamentally broke game, it had some bold new design decisions that just seemed to fail to work out in the end, mainly the one unit per tile approach.  The game turns out to feel incredibly boring where you are spending most of your time doing nothing and pressing enter because the infrastructure (the part of civ games I love) seems to take excessively long to build with very little information at your disposal.  So instead instead of feeling that your empire is growing and evolving, it just tends to feel mostly like stagnation.  When the game does demand something from the player it is in the area of tedious micromanagement of military units (warmongering in civ games was never my cup o tea) which you endlessly shuffle around and makes conquering other civs a complete chore.  In the end the magic just doesnt seem to be there which even the earlier civ games all had at launch even before they grew into what they are now.  When finding myself getting into the mid game in Civ 5 all I end up with is a feeling of pointless boredom instead of an increasing urge to play the next turn as the game progresses.

There was no implication of proof. 

On the other hand, if it *did* happen, you should be able to prove it. Look at everything Archeology has been able to find.

&gt;The 600,000, plus wives, children, the elderly, and the ""mixed multitude"" of non-Israelites would have numbered some 2 million people, compared with an entire estimated Egyptian population of around 3 million (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Numbers_and_logistics)). 

A decline of 2/3 the population of Egypt should have some historical significance. It should be noted in many ancient texts, and taught in school. I guarantee if for some reason 2.6m people (Or two thirds the population) suddenly fled Phoenix today to go wander through the Sonoran Desert because some strange man told them they had to, it would be written in books, on websites, everywhere. Within weeks. We have copies of the Epic of Gilgamesh from 2800 years ago, and pyramid scripts from the same time. Surely we ought to find some record somewhere of two-thirds of Egypt suddenly packing up and leaving. 

And even at the lowest estimate (600k, Book of Numbers 1:46 ""Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty."") there would be evidence. A settlement. A trail. Something. We have been able to find traces of *Homo sapiens sapiens* (Specifically, [Cro-Magnon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnon#Cro-Magnon_culture)) settlements from around 35kya. They were wanderers who traveled in small tribes across the vast areas of Europe. To say that we can't find proof that 600,000 people wandered the (comparatively) small area between Egypt and Isreal in the desert in a giant group from 3,000 years ago is just ridiculous.

Well, it may take some more time to learn that it was won *in part* because of the *US participation*. By any metric, the Eastern front was the most important in that war.

Consider this: Germany lost [most of its soldiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_casualties_in_World_War_II) on the Eastern front - more than on *all other fronts combined* -  even **before** a single US soldier made a step in Europe. This is by modest estimates, of course.

The net result is that up to  [twice as many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II\)#Results) German soldiers were lost on the Eastern front than on all other fronts combined.

If you read the accounts of the high-ranked German military officers, such as [Walter Schellenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Schellenberg), head of intelligence (Abwehr), you would know that the Germans knew the war was over by 1943, due to the campaign stalling in the East.

The significant impact of the US invasion was that the Europe did not fall to the Soviets. By 1944, Germans were losing the battles, and it was clear that the winning Soviet army won't stop. The US invasion, undoubtedly, saved lives of many soldiers, but it did not turn the tide of war. What id *did* do was preventing the Soviets from ""liberating"" the rest of the Western Europe.

3,0,t1_c1x7shn,askscience,,,"Interesting question.

Think of it this way. When you're standing on the ground, you are rotating along with the surface of the Earth. If you jump so that both your feet are off the ground, the Earth doesn't suddenly slip away under your feet, because you continue rotating at the same speed along with the Earth.

You might argue that this is because a jump is relatively brief, and if you were to stay aloft for a few hours, then the Earth would turn underneath you. But this doesn't happen either. Get in a hot air balloon, go up a couple hundred feet to break your contact with the ground, then stay there for a whole day if you like. You'll still be over the same spot where you took off from, the Earth won't rotate under you. You might drift randomly a bit due to local winds, but on a still day, not even that.

Because of inertia, an object in motion stays in motion, *unless* acted upon by an external force. Inertia will keep you moving at the same speed (the speed of rotation of the Earth's surface where you were standing) forever, *unless* some outside force acts on you. So what are the forces acting on you when you jump in the air or float up on a balloon?

Gravity is the only one (disregarding wind for the moment). Gravity ensures that your path continues to curve with the Earth rather than flying off at a tangent. But this is exactly what gravity was doing when you were standing on the surface too, so there is no change there. The atmosphere could slow you down and let the Earth slip away from under you, **IF** the atmosphere were stationary with respect to the Earth. But the atmosphere spins with Earth at a matching velocity, so that won't happen either. This is why you would continue sitting right over the same spot in your balloon, until the fuel ran out. Again, local winds might randomly push you in one direction or another, but this is not a systematic effect of the Earth's rotation.

Now given these facts, there is still stuff to explain regarding aircraft. These questions often cause confusion given the simple explanations given above, because they seem to contradict those explanations. Namely:

1. Why do airplanes take less time to go from west to east (say New York to London) than from east to west (London to New York)?
2. Why do aircraft sometimes have to make corrections for the Earth's rotation on north-south trips?

The answers to the two questions are different.

**East - West or West - East Travel**

Since the atmosphere as a whole spins along with the Earth at a matching speed, the trip east to west should take exactly as long as the trip west to east. But it doesn't. Why?

It's because of headwinds and tailwinds. There is a pattern of winds over the Earth - the [trade winds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_wind) and the [westerlies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies) that blow in some preferred direction. Over most flight paths through North America and Europe, the relevant wind zone is the westerlies, which blow from west to east. Therefore a plane going from NY to London usually has a tailwind, and makes a faster trip than the same plane on the return trip, when it has a headwind to fight against. You have to remember that winds are pretty strong at the altitudes at which planes fly. An ""average"" wind at these altitudes of 80 mph is about 15% of the cruising speed of an airliner, so it would create a 15% + 15% = 30% difference between the east-west and west-east times of the aircraft. That can be pretty significant on longer trips.

**North-South or South-North Travel**

This causes a different problem. Aircraft traveling long distances in these directions need to aim for a point slightly east or west of their intended location, in order to reach it. This is indeed due to the spin of the Earth, but not in the sense that Earth is slipping away under them while they are stationary. This is actually due to the [Coriolis Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect).

Here's a simple way to understand what's happening. Suppose you are at latitude 20 North, and wish to fly northwards to your destination at latitude 50 North. Remember that the Earth spins with some constant angular velocity, so the transverse movement of the surface is maximum at the equator, and zero at the poles. Obviously, since 20 N is closer to the equator than 50 N, you are spinning faster when you are at 20 N than when you are at 50 N. Your *angular velocity* is the same, but the *transverse velocities* are different.

So when you take off at 20 N, you are spinning eastwards along with the Earth at say 400 mph (just made up that number for illustration, don't take it literally). But your destination at 50 N is only spinning eastward at 200 mph, because it's farther north. That difference in eastward transverse velocities will make you end up east of your intended destination, unless you make a course correction. Similarly, if you were flying from north to south, you would end up west of your destination.

These directions are for the northern hemisphere. The effects would be the opposite in the southern hemisphere. You can generalize it for the whole Earth by saying that objects moving away from the equator curve eastwards, while object moving towards the equator curve westwards. This is the Coriolis Effect.

The Coriolis Effect is actually very small, because of the Earth's slow angular velocity (takes 24 hours to spin once). Over short distances you wouldn't even notice it. However, it needs to be corrected for in long range flights or long range ballistic trajectories that go in a north-south or south-north direction.

Finally, I should mention that the permanent winds I mentioned in the first section (east west travel) - the trade winds and the westerlies, are actually also partially dependent upon the Coriolis Effect. Winds are driven by temperature and pressure differentials, which are caused by differing solar insolation over the Earth's surface, which creates high and low pressure centers. Winds flow from high pressure to low pressure areas. However, when flowing north-south or south-north, they are also affected by the Coriolis Effect. This is what curves the trade winds westwards, or the westerlies eastwards. So you could say that east-west flight times are also caused by the Coriolis Effect, which in turn is caused by the rotation of the Earth. Both east/west and north/south flight are affected by the Coriolis Effect, but in a somewhat complex way as I've described. It's not a simple matter of the Earth spinning away under you.",0,1427201942,t3_hp2du,1306951614,3,,0,False,True,JCDntn,c1x7shn,t3_hp2du,False,t5_2qm4e

You definitely need to know things like what items/berries do, EVs, IVs, Natures, how Hidden Power works, and more, and those articles cover that.

From there, go to the RMT (Rate My Team) forums, and read as many of the posts there as you can.  See how people try to build teams, and see what criticism people give them.  Also, check out the teams of last generation: there's a giant archive thread [here](http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=76508).

If you want to get battling experience, download the [Pokemon Online](http://pokemon-online.eu/) simulator.  It's a stand alone simulator of the Pokemon battle system.  It allows you to set up a team and see how it would perform against others, with feedback that's much quicker than you can get in Wi-Fi battles.

If you're interested in a specific pokemon, do a google search for ""&lt;pokemonname&gt; smogon analysis"" to find the forum posting for the writeup on that specific pokemon.  The writeups will give example movesets and strategies relevant to that pokemon, including what pokemon you should team it up with, and what strategies/pokemon are dangerous to what you picked.

Whimsicott is a good lead (in a doubles match, at least, I don't know how well he works in singles), but you should read the analyses to understand what its strengths and weaknesses are.

-1,0,t1_c1x7wtc,islam,,,"&gt;The burden of proof is on whoever makes the claim.

You're making the claim that god exists in the absence of evidence. The burden of proof is on you, like I said. Nobody needs to talk about ""the absence of something"" until ""something"" is brought up to begin with. You bring up god, you prove him. 

If I arrest you for murder, but there wasn't any murder, it's my problem to *prove that there was or I have to let you go*. I'm the one who said there was a murder to begin with, so I better show some evidence or you don't need to waste your time proving you didn't murder anyone. 

This is what the religious do. They say ""there's a god!"", when the rest of us see no reason to say such a thing. Then we say ""oh what a weird idea, can ya prove it?"" and they say ""....no not at all... can you disprove it?"".

Well, guys, **we aren't the ones who are trying to suggest the ridiculous idea to begin with**, so it's not our problem to disprove it until you can at least *sort of* provide evidence that it might be true. So far the only evidence is a few logical fallacies and some books that are very obviously written by men trying to pass themselves off as divine forgeries. I'm afraid we're going to have to do better than that. 

&gt;Either way, I can't claim with 100% certainty that your dog does not talk to you because I have no proof of it.

Exactly, but you can be 99.99% sure because everything points to no. You've never seen a dog talk, dog's don't talk to humans, there is no sufficient evidence to say that this one does. You can never know for certain though, just 99.99%. You have only my word to go on. This is why I doubt your god with that same level of certainty, there is exactly as much evidence for him as there is for my dog talking to me, and just because I can't disprove him does not make him real. 

&gt;I'm saying I believe in God because of the LOGICAL (not physical) pieces of evidence I claim to have for His existence (which you can choose to have me present to you or not, your choice)

Logical evidence you say? Logic is not evidence, it is just a system of thought by which you come to a conclusion based on a few facts. Either way, show me what you got. 

&gt;First of all, bear is a bad word to use for the analogy, since God isn't at all a specific being

Why, just because you know what a bear looks like? How convenient for god. What's the difference between a bear and an unseen being? There is none, it makes no difference that you know what a bear is and don't have a concept of god's appearance. The only difference here is at least bears have been shown to exist to begin with, so already that story becomes slightly more believable than this nebulous, intangible ""thing"" that nobody can touch, feel, see, measure, detect, converse with, or in any way prove is anything other than an abstract idea. 

&gt;Islam has always been a religion in which scholars were held highly and studying and science have been encouraged.

Not in about 900 years, Islam's renaissance has come and gone. Islam has crushed the region of the world that was once the MOST advanced and scientific. In early Islamic history and a period before it, the middle east was a shining beacon of learning and thought and science. Then Islam came along, and they both flourished for a short while before ultimately faith won out over reason and we now have countries where people are happy to have an iPhone and receive modern medical treatment courtesy of science but still do not accept evolution because it disagrees with their ancient religion. 

In other words, they continue to enjoy the fruits of science's labor, but Islamic culture and people are no longer a significant contributor to these fields in any way. Islam is inherently going to stagnate the cultures it infects, because the rules of how to live, what is scientifically true and untrue, and what is right and wrong are all laid out in a totalitarian manner by the religion itself, and questioning this is not possible in an Islamic state. It is exactly the same kind of fanatical faith that killed scientific innovators and iconoclasts like Galileo in medieval Christian Europe for something as benign as suggesting the Earth goes around the sun. 

Books like the bible or the Qu'ran that pretend to know it all and tell you there is punishment for you if you don't believe them are **always**, no matter what, by their *very definition*, going to be counter-productive to society. Society must be allowed to adapt and learn new things without worrying about something as silly as hell for finding out the truth about the universe. 

&gt;That Islam is a religion that encourages mistreatment of women is just plain propaganda.

Have you read the Qu'ran? Perhaps we have vastly different ideas of what the word ""mistreatment"" means. The Qu'ran mentions you may kill women for adultery, beating your wife is recommended should she become high handed with you, you are not to touch her when she menstruates because she is somehow ""unclean"", you may marry multiple women, have sex with slave girls, etc etc. 

As for Islam as a culture, we see in many Islamic states the widespread abuse of women's rights. There are modesty police in Iran that will arrest you for wearing what anywhere else in the world would already be considered extremely conservative attire. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6JYidmXxE
There are women in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan who will be killed if they leave their home without a male guardian. In Islam theocracy Saudi Arabia, women are not even allowed to drive (probably a good thing considering they are also required to cover their faces). 

How many more times do we need to hear in the news about women being stoned or lashed for things as ridiculous as talking to a boy or taking part in a beauty contest before we realize that this is a cultural phenomenon within Islam that is very real? Granted, it is not in every Islamic country, but in every one that it does occur in, the Qu'ran and the Hadith and Sharia law are ALWAYS used as the justification of it. This is a purely Islamic phenomenon, and before you mention that jews and christians did it, please remember that they did it over a millenia ago, where it belongs, and those religions have since moved past this type of behavior. The same can not be said of Islam in many parts of the world. 

This is not propaganda, these are real world issues within the Islamic community that need to be resolved before it can be shown any respect from modernity. People all over the world behave in a way that emulates a 6th century man who owned slaves, killed people, and married children. This is the role model for the Muslim male? That's what god says! In all honesty and without meaning insult, this says a lot about why so much of the Muslim world is in the state that it is.

My wife and I have decided a long time ago that we will adopt any child who would otherwise be aborted. We are able to give a child or two all of that. 

The fact is, though, that there are more couples in the US who want to adopt infants than there are infants being put up for adoption. I know there are a lot of kids in the system, but demand for infants specifically is very high.

&gt;I could understand your point if we had a sudden population decline but 310 Americans and we can't take those already here.

I think you forgot a word or two, but I think you meant to say that ""there are 310 *million* Americans and we can't take *care of* those already here.""  Let me know if this was wrong. 
If this is the position to take, then why not execute all of our violent criminals and rapists? Let's end the suffering and societal drain of millions by killing people who have been on life support for more than a month and people with IQs below a certain threshold. This is ridiculous, right? So is being able to kill a person based on their age and lack of experience.

&gt;I could also understand if we had the same family care laws as in the European Union. Then raising a child wouldn't be a to burden a single mother she could then continue her college and have child care.

I am all for social programs provided by the states to accomplish these kinds of things. I imagine if we took, say, 1/8th of the budget we're spending on maintaining military bases overseas, so many problems would be greatly reduced. This still isn't justification for abortion as a form of birth control, in my opinion.

&gt;I mean it must be nice to prevent an abortion, but that isn't the end but the start, are you ready to finish the job for the next 20 years, to make sure that kid doesn't fall like its mother?

Did you mean fail like its mother? Or did you actually mean fall? and if so, what did you mean by fall? I'll assume fail. 

Anyway, parenthood is not easy -- it never has been. It is, however, a job that every generation has done, and a lot of people today want to continue to do, but can't for one reason or another. As I stated before, there are more people wanting to adopt infants than there are infants available for adoption in the US. It isn't a 20 commitment then, just 10 months.

&gt;There is also a pull back on social safety nets in our country, sure you saved a child but endangered them to poverty and unfit parents.

Do your homework to know what model and what options are both desirable and give trouble. Some combos can be nearly bullet-proof, while others problematic. A happy owner might tell a few friends about their experience, but an unhappy owner tends to broadcast much more loudly and broadly, so results are skewed. 

When choosing an example to buy, have a respected indy shop that specializes in the cars on standby to inspect a potential candidate. Be patient to find the right car. I prefer to buy from private sellers so I can get a feel for how the car was driven and cared for, rather than a dealer reconditioning away any tell-tales.

By far the most important thing to realize is that on any European car, you don't drive it until it breaks, and then fix it. On a Japanese car the incident may remain isolated, but on a Euro car, it tends to create a cascade effect that makes repairs much more expensive. So pay attention to new sounds, smells, sensations and address them proactively. 

I drove the most unreliable of all Italians - an Alfa Milano - for nearly 20 years as a daily - much of it in heavy LA traffic or at the racetrack. My car has been very reliable over the 271K miles I've owned it. The most expensive year when I was having an outside shop do the work, was around $3500.

To get a place to sit in the beer tents, you have to make a reservation, 99% of the places in the beer tents are full all the time, you will not be able to come to a tent, sit down, have a double of beer and go try something else.

Some of the NC members started a war in Geminate. I believe this was mostly R.A.G.E and Majesta. The DRF pushed them back into Vale of the Silent, then hired mercenaries (Pandemic Legion, Raiden.) to come and help augment their forces to give them later EU and US timezone coverage. This combined force has a massive supercapital fleet that is literally unkillable within current game mechanics without meeting up with an even larger supercapital fleet (and then the lag would make things effectively unplayable). 

The combined DRF+merc force started to move into Tribute. Since Razor and MM live there Goons got involved and brought their hangers on Test/Gentleman's Agreement/whatever other small alliances are chilling in cloud ring/fountain/delve these days.  However, even with Goon+others the NC forces didn't have nearly enough supercapitals to even force a lagfest super fight. There were a few subcap skirmishes over towers, but even if the NC forces were winning the subcap battles they would end up getting hotdropped by multiple titans/supercarriers and it would end in a loss.

Last night, the leadership of the NC basically said ""hey we're going to form up everything and fight"" and they only managed to get 40 or so supers online. Not nearly enough to actually make a fight of it. So they never engaged. Test had already decided it wasn't worth hopping up across 4 regions to fight to defend some dudes they felt no loyalty toward (though MM/Razor did help flip Fountain stations... heh).

Well, religion is foremostly an expression of needs, that serve a certain beneficial goal for a group of people. So religion is not very restricted in the way it can emerge. A sociologist like Émile Durkheim has very interesting theories concerning religion and it's function in society. By studying aboriginal groups he noticed how the totems they honored in their religion were actually a representation of the strong point of the society itself, thus it served the purpose of unification and group cohesion. If we apply this model on modern societies, you might draw the conclusion that the US' sacred realm must be different than Europe's. This leads to theories regarding civil religion (like by Robert Bellah) that describe a community's differences by pointing out the values and other customs we regard 'sacred'. 
Anyway, I'm rambling. The most striking form of religious flexibility I find to be the long gone notion of 'minhag' in Judaism. Basically, it states that when a group of Jews immigrate and adapt to a society, certain customs may be integrated that are nowhere found in other communities. Although they might differ, these customs are okay and will be part of Jewish Halachah (law) because these are part of the cultural majority. 
Another example: in the 19th century in the Netherlands there was a phenomena called pillarization. Every Christian denomination had it's own facilities and contact was often hostile, not to speak of marriage outside your denomination. This was nationally and regarded as the normal way to go. But in the '6o this system collapsed, churches began to stream empty and the Reformed soccer club flooded with Catholics so to speak. Now, not even 50 years later, Evangelicalism is the way to go. A system that depends on very different organisation than the Reformed churches: charismatic leadership vs theologically schooled ministers, a network of independent churches vs a hierarchical system, emphasis on emotion and spirituality vs rational belief and stoicism. Anyway, you might be right about the clinging to certain values, absolutely, but the religion that appealed to my grandparents, ceizes to exist in todays world. Anyway, I must have a reader lying around from my sociology classes, if you're interested I can mail you some stuff.

And regarding the second point, I was a little sarcastic. I really am not a supporter of religious violence in any way. ;)

The titles are deeply satisfying, because they prove a team doesn't have to sacrifice style to win trophies, but above and beyond the laurels what really makes this team special to me is that all this success is based on a solid philosophy of nurturing players and teaching them a truly innovative style of play which on the pitch manifests itself as a profound connection between 11 players who are all working for the team always while still showcasing the individual brilliance of some of those most astonishing talents I have ever seen.

is bullshit. Bushido has been existece in Japan since 12th century. Here's the [proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido#Early_history_to_12th_century). It was not until 19th and 20th century in the post Meiji era, that Bushidō was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs. And there is no justification for that, just like there is no justification for using ""War on Terror"" propaganda as the reason to invade Middle east.

As a matter of fact, it was not until 1868 that a Western civilization was able to witness this ritual suicide act of [Seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku#European_witness). The event is also known as [Sakai Incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakai_incident). It is not just dramatization because you've never witnessed someone do it.

It's not like there was a terra nullius they just happened upon.  Everyone only goes back to 1946 as if that date is so special.  This all really began in WWI when the last sovereign nation to rule that territory still existed, the Ottoman Empire.  The Ottoman empire dissolved and the territory fell under mandate from the league of nations which was administered by the British empire (we all know what a bang up job the british do with that).  Aside from their historic incompetence at administering foreign territories was their favoritism for the establishment of a jewish state.  I'm not going to pretend to understand what motivated british politics at this time, whether they were true believers in the calls of zionism or just wanted to be rid of jews like everyone else in europe since the high middle ages.  We do know however that the British pledged their support to the establishment of a jewish state in the area of Palestine as early as 1917 from the [Balfour Decleration](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917) Whether or not they intended to fully deliver on this became irrelevant following WWII.  The holocaust was the turning point of centuries history building up to the nation state and the era of imperialism.  What the nazis practiced was the culmination of european dominance over colonial territories distilled and purified to a frightening perfection.  They practiced at home what everyone else was doing away, and it was then the west realized how horrific they'd become, an honor allegedly belonging to the war to end all wars.  

The collective guilt of the holocaust was to signal the beginning of the end of old world imperialism.  From there came the dismantling of their former colonial holdings.  The jewish problem still persisted and this was in an environment of centuries old prejudices and institutionalized persecution with the new threat of a cold war.  Establishing a jewish state anywhere was a problem of ""not in my backyard.""  The easier solution was to leverage their dominance over a weaker people to solve the jewish question, much the same way a modern nation would send unwanted toxic waste to a third world country.  This is particularly telling in the lead up to WWII when the jews are fleeing germany and no one will take them, not the neighboring european nations, nor the U.S.  The irony that the U.S. turned back jews fleeing hitler's germany and we're the great moral keepers of ""never again!""  Meanwhile from the establishment of the [mandate of palestine](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine#The_Jewish_Yishuv) to the conclusion of WWII the jewish population almost doubled.

Basically there were zionist efforts in place that were further legitimized beyond any reasonable expectations as a result of collective western guilt over the holocaust.  It was an easy out, but merely moved one problem onto someone else's lawn.  The fact that there wasn't a palestinian for each and every square foot of land is irrelevant.  There was no jewish state and justifying the establishment of such psuedo-theocracy is absurd.

They believe you can only save money by spending less, even if it causes penny-wise and pound-foolish behavior. Just take the bigger picture: How much greater revenue will the government get due to GM profits, and future higher GM profits than otherwise, profits from suppliers, income tax from workers that weren't laid off, welfare savings from those saved jobs, increased consumer spending (the motor of the economy) from having people in work? Etc.

It's basic Keynesian economics - government spending doesn't cost as much as it appears to cost on the balance sheet. And savings during a recession can end up costing more than you save. (Several European nations are now providing live demonstrations of how counterproductive austerity can be)

It's not like this is news, countercyclical policies are well-established by now. It's just that the Right is happy to exploit people's ignorance while whipping up hysteria about the budget deficit. After eight years of unfinanced wars and tax-breaks, statements that ""Reagan proved deficits don't matter"" and with a staunch refusal to even consider raising taxes to Clinton (much less Reagan) levels, you'd think people would realize the hypocrisy.

Unlike a household (in particular a US one), the government isn't about to go broke for posting losses for a few years. It's got plenty of assets and even now, no problems borrowing money. (see the treasury rates) The current budget isn't sustainable, but as long as things even out over a cycle of the economy, you're fine. But if you post losses when the economy is in a boom, then you're in deep trouble.

The problem here is that the Republicans simply don't give a damn about a balanced budget, except as a tool for forcing through their goal of budget cuts. They've got no interest in 'the company' posting a profit, because their ultimate goal is to shut it down. And who can blame them, given that it's a tactic that obviously works for them?

The sad fact is that it _doesn't matter_ whether or not TARP or the auto bailouts worked. They won't even say ""It works but we're against it, since it represents an expansion of the role of government."" Instead they just spin their own narrative, and their voters will eat it up. In 1996, a majority of Republican voters thought the deficit had _increased_ under Clinton. So there's no question they'll focus on whatever negative facts they can dig up, spin or outright fabricate. The question is why anyone still takes the Republicans seriously when they talk about 'fiscal responsibility'.

There IS a reason why London and the South East is overcrowded and expensive - because that's where all the (decent) jobs are.

Since London is so rich, it is effectively supporting its own poor people - and that of the rest of the country too.

Just about every other part of the country requires subsidy - and in the case of some parts, EU subsidy too.

I think the case for subsidising towns in the same country as your own because they are not economically independent is not quite the same as giving aid to a country that clearly can afford to look after itself now.

It would also be a bureaucratic nightmare to somehow ringfence taxation based on what town it came from, and would you deny giving a less wealthy settlement some money because of that ringfencing?

Israel screwed the pooch completely.  It came in using the Torah as a way to state they own Palestine and immediately went to action marginalizing the indigenous people.  Think of it the way the Europeans treated the indigenous peoples of their colonies.  The difference was this was in the 1950's not the 1750's.  And it was just after WWII, the Jews had a first hand experience with Apartheid and Holocaust, they frankly should know better.  In fact some hollocaust survivors have spoken out against how Israel treats the Palestinians, in part because of how they were treated.

Israel overstepped its right to land in the area and that is why there is such hatred of Israel in the Middle East.  Recently people leaving Palestine have been refused entry to Palestine.  Think of it removing a persons right to travel.

You sow what you reap, and Israel is sowing a horrible harvest.  If the Israeli government doesn't adjust how it is treating the Palestinians it will most likely have a horrible adjustment enforced on it by its surrounding neighbors.

Israel wasn't the cause of the refugee problem the arabs were, and they admit it.

The Arab legions were the true cause of the refugee problem because they spreed blood libel about what the jews would do to the arabs if overtaken.

&gt; Some Palestinian leaders actually circulated false rumors that women had been raped. When confronted with the reality that no rapes had taken place a Palestinian leader said, ""We just have to say this, so that the Arab armies will come to liberate us from the Jews."" Haazam Nuseibi a journalist at the time told the bbc years later that the deliberate fabrication of the rape charge "" was our biggest mistake... as soon as they header that the women had been raped at Deir Yassin, Palestinians fled in Terror.""


In his 1972 memoirs, the former prime minister of syria, Kahlid al- Azm, placed the entire blame for the refugee problem on the arabs:

&gt; Since 1948 it is we who demanded the return of the refugees while it is we who made them leave. We brought disaster upon arab refugees, by invading them and bringing pressure to bear upon them to leave. We have rendered them dispossessed. we have accused to them to begging. we have particulated inaptly in lowering their moral and social level. Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder and arson, and throwing bombs upon them.


Even Mahmoud Abbas has said the following "" (Arab armies ) Forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland and threw them into prisons similar to which the ghettos in wich the Jews used to live.
I understand the Jewish perspective, but the world today is not the same. Jews in Europe and the US have no reason to go to Israel other than their belief that they somehow have a religious or genetic connection to the land.

Now the kill count.

During 2000-2005 When Israel was getting attacked by suicide bombers left right and center. They simply have better medical facilities, far more Israelis would have died if they didn't have such good care. They actually offered to treat all Palestinians during the second intifada. However, the Palestinians wouldn't have it, and it's a shame because It would have saved a lot of their lives. However, one could argue that the more Palestinians die the better for them, at least, because then someone can put up a graph like this and get responses from people like yourself (no offence).

Although you implied that it was illegitimate for Israel to have caused that many deaths because the Palestinian rockets hadn't killed that many people, I'm going to argue that this is exactly what Hamas wants. They fire rockets meant to terrorize a population, thousands and thousands of them 10,000 before the gaza war actually. This forces retaliation by Israel because they can't just let them keep shooting rockets at their civilian population it is terrorizing them ( A study found that between 75 percent and 94 percent of Sderot children aged 4–18 exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress. 28 percent of adults and 30 percent of children had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76438). Anyhow because Israel is forced to act they bomb gaza and try to avoid killing civilians, because believe it or not it's bad for them to kill civlians. However, it's hard to be perfect especially when Hamas hides among the civilian population. Hezbollah does and did the same thing during the 2006 war and that is why I really don't have any sympathy when people complain of high death count if your that pissed off about it then don't let terrorists launch rockets from your childrens school.

What's the difference? Very well, if I stay at your house I can instead of paying rent and buying food, can finance a music video shoot in the Netherlands.

&gt; NGO's in one's field are typically great.

Please name such an NGO in the music business.

Look, I think you've missed the point of what whoever it was suggested. S/He wasn't saying let someone couch surfing when they're visiting. The suggestion was that an individual could allow a musician to create music by funding their physical needs ie food, shelter, etc. If you're in a place where you can afford to feed an extra mouth for even a week, congratulations. Most people I know certainly can't. And most people I know really like music. So if one has to provide for a musician in order to be able to get music, I know a lot people who won't be able to listen to music anymore.

You might say, ""We can spread it around, there are a lot more non-musicians than musicians."" But I'd counter with two points. 

First, there are also a lot of artists and authors too. And that doesn't even account for all the philosophy majors, or the 17th century central american studies majors. These are things that contribute to society's cultural wealth, but don't pay so well. How do we decide what groups offer enough to our society to afford them free housing and food?

Second, I am actually a musician. I have exactly zero plans to make it a profession. But if I knew that I'd be guaranteed food and housing? Hell yeah I'd be playing music for the rest of my life. What's to stop the hobbyists and amateurs from deciding to quit their day jobs, make music, or art, or literature their main focus and get free food and housing from everyone else. We're going to run out of everyone else pretty fast if that's the case. And if we draw a line, how do you decide who's talented enough to qualify? I know people who listen to, from what I can tell, is nothing more than white noise and feedback. That is the music they like. They're weird college radio kids, but hey, whatever blows your skirt up. How do we decide what's art and what isn't? Do we let the people vote? Because then we'll end up with only Billboard 100 music and hell if I'm supporting that.

Personally I think that closer economic and political ties with our neighbours is always a good thing. After all, it's not like they're going anywhere soon. Opinions among the wider population are evenly divided between ambivalence, positivity and negativity at ~30% each, but the Eurosceptics are considerably more dominant in the media.

There's a long history behind the EU that colours the discussion of it to this day, which in turns decides public opinion.


It started badly when De Gaulle worked against UK EEC membership in the 1960s, partly for domestic reasons and partly because he was wary of cultural differences and American influence. Naturally this invited some patriotic posturing and the Conservative party set up the Anti-Common Market League, which did exactly what it said on the tin. Then as the EEC became the EU, EU leaders were keen to sell it as a social enterprise, which Thatcher's Conservatives took against and the Left Wing took to. That right-left divide on the EU lingers to this day.


Fifty years later and that seed of patriotic posturing has matured into a vehicle of xenophobia, absurd at first but gaining more converts as the EU begins to spread East. (A more palatable anti-European meme has been that it reduces independence and democracy, or that the EU is incompetent because of its size, which have interesting parallels in the smaller state ideology of the American Right.)

A major cause is that nearly all the major newspapers here are strongly Eurosceptic - to the point of inventing scare stories about the EU. I wouldn't like to speculate on the reason why, but it's interesting that it's not only papers owned by Murdoch and other billionaires, but also many leftist papers as well. As you can imagine, a constant stream of anti-European headlines and columns efficiently manufactures more Euroscepticm.


Of course, there're other elements: the ex-Empire mindset is still strong here, and the fact that we're not part of the mainland is embedded somewhere deep in the national psyche. But my money's still on the public discourse and history of the issue being the prime contributors.

I backpacked Europe with a girl who was plus size - and to be honest, she did not enjoy it.  I'm not sure of your size or fitness level, but here are a few things to keep in mind:  
Europe loves stairs - and many places (even hotels!) are so old that they don't have elevators - so make sure you are comfortable walking several flights.  And then make sure you are comfortable walking several flights with a 40lb pack on. 
 
Also, while being a tourist you will walk A LOT.  Get some good walking shoes (I really like Keens) and break them in while walking around a track for a few miles.

If you are plus size, there are going to be very, very few shops where you can purchase clothing.  My friend wanted new shorts and had quite a bit of trouble finding clothes in her size.  

If you go to REI they can help you pick out a backpack.  Something I never realized, until buying one, is that the majority of the weight falls on your hips - not your shoulders/back!

&gt;Efficiency Paragraph

I'm talking about pure economic efficiency. The deadweight loss triangle from Micro 101. Taxes distort markets. Market distortion always leads to greater deadweight loss. 

&gt;It doesn't actually matter how inefficient any authorship tax distribution process is, it is very unlikely to cause the inefficiencies of copyright restrictions.

This is just silly. Let me rephrase it for you. ""It doesn't actually matter how large any negative number is, it is very unlikely to have a greater magnitude than any unknown positive number.""

I get what you're trying to say, but that's just a huge logical fallacy. 

&gt;Additionally, the claim ""government is inefficient"" is debunked by the simple comparison of government-based health programs in various programs, compared with the for-profit programs in the US. The US non-governmental programs are literally the least efficient in the entire world.

If you're looking to compare a public market to private market in order to compare efficiency, that's pretty bad example. The insurance industry in the US is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the nation. A better example would be comparing US and European labor markets. The US has some of the loosest labor laws in the developed world and Western Europe has some of the tightest. Unemployment in the US has been about half of that of Europe. We're only almost caught up with European unemployment levels due to the recession. Our jobs market also seems to be recovering a bit quicker, though it's likely too early to say with any certainty. 

&gt;This seems to ignore the huge elephant in the room. Copyright restrictions in and of themselves are a huge problem. A solution to these problems is allowed to have problems, even big problems, and it would still be beneficial.

Fair. But see above on making the assumption that one strategies faults are larger than another strategies faults without closely examining each strategy. 

&gt;Actually, a system of distribution can make it better for new artists.

I think you've misunderstood my question. Changing payouts to benefit less popular artists would almost certainly be necessary. My question is how, as a new musician, do you get on the payout list in the first place? If we just count downloads, what's to stop me from writing a clever program to download my song 5000 times a second, shifting through a variety of IP address so that it looks like people really like my music?

Also, how large a tax are we talking? Is the idea to pay the artists enough so they don't have to have a day job? Or a specific amount per download? Is there a minimum or maximum payout? or both?

&gt;In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[21] (...) The following year, the club got its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the famous Galáctico side including players such as Zinédine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl and David Beckham. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite a European Cup win in 2002, followed by the League in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons.

This, with the fact that England and most of Europe was exceptionally Christian at the time, and the Jews were 'money grabbing Jesus killers'. Jews were not allowed into any areas beside finance, i.e. they were not allowed to become part of the guilds in the major trades such as mining, woodwork etc, and so they were forced into money lending as a way to make any sort of money in order to survive on. Usury, or loaning money at interest, was barred by Christians in the 13th Century, and as such the Jews had no way of making any money whatsoever. As such, they were of no use to the crown's purse, and were expelled.

A list of everything I have:  Had 3 heart attacks - 1st at 30.  Acute [Vascular claudication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudication) - so I can only walk 15-20yds at best before I have to rest.  Acute angina.  For past couple of years I get severe Cluster Headaches, sometimes up to 8 or 9 a day although it's normally around 3 or 4.  Had 4 angioplastys.  Still classed as epileptic, although I haven't had a fit for over 7 years.

&gt;Faced with an early grave, did you and how do you find hope?

Well to be honest thats a tough one.  I have a pretty stoic outlook (the dictionary definition not the philosphical one) on bad shit that happens to me.  Pretty much along the lines of bad shit has happened to me that I can't do anything about so there's no point moping about it.

The way I see it, I've done more in my 37 years than some people - especially my fathers generation do with their whole lives. My grandmother spent her whole life living in the same house she was born in and never ventured further than 6 miles away from her hometowm - I was determined that would never happen to me.

I've toured uk/europe in a band I was in, played at Glastonbury in another band, dropped Acid with Hawkwind, got drunk with Lemmy, designed album covers for some of my musical heroes, worked in mountain rescue when I was younger, London marathon twice... I've had a very full and rich life up until my 1st heart attack.

My biggest inspiration is my best friend - she was born with [Bilateral Telepes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot) and has had over 30 operations since she was born and just over a week ago underwent her 2nd amputation and now has no legs below the knee.  For as long as I've known her she hasn't let any disability to prevent her from doing things she wants to do.  She's a mother of 6 amazing kids (I'm godfather to all of them).  So I pretty much get my ""meh I'm disabled, so what, it's not going to stop me doing shit"" outlook from her.


&gt;What are your aspirations?

That medical science hurrys the fuck up and catches up with Star Trek!  lol  

My main aspiration is to get rid of / control the headaches so I can get back working.  After my 2nd heart attack I ended up leaving my job as a graphic designer and working in forensic mental health, dealing with people with major mental health issues that had a criminal history - mainly murderers, peadophiles, sex offenders.  It was a cross between a residential home and a prison.  They could leave for social activities, but only on appointment and only with a member of staff who had the power to bring them back at any time for any reason.  So I would like to get back into that line of work but more desk based.

&gt;How do you spend your time?

At the moment, mostly gaming or writing/recording music.  The frequency/severity of the headaches pretty much puts a block on getting a regular job at the moment.  I do odd jobs here and there - I give guitar lessons to a couple of kids, and keyboard lessons to a couple of others.  I also do the occasional bit of freelance design work.

&gt;Where do you find comfort?

My girlfriend.  We met about 2 months before my 1st heart attack and have been inseperable since.  She beautiful, kind, caring, and has the biggest, firmest pair of....... cough.. nvm :)  She turns 50 on the 14th and I'm taking her away to a Barony Castle on the Scottish borders for a couple of days where I plan to ~~shackle myself for the rest of my life~~ ask her to marry me.

I also take comfort from the fact that up till now, despite the major curveball life threw at me.. I've still had a whale of a time and intend to do so till I'm dead.  Disabled people that have the attitude of ""oh woe is me, I can't do anything so I might as well sit here and feel sorry for myself, everyone pity me"" piss me off.  Oh and I still have my sense of humour. 

My best friend and I constantly rip on each other - perfect example was last week when she had her amputation.  HER: ""doctor told me to make sure I exercise so I have the upper body strength for the prosthetics"".

ME: ""You could always hold your old amputated feet in your hands and take up kick boxing!"".  We pissed ourselves laughing for a good 1/2hr on that one.  I'm always the 1st to take the piss out of myself too.  

I think I've covered everything.  Anything else, feel free to ask.  Thanks for your interest, tbh I'd never think anyone would be interested in any way. :)

Yes, the indigenous people do have rights as a collective.  They inhabit their land as a collective, and they are entitled to ""just compensation"" for the eminent domain seizure of their land.  Seeing as they reside on a piece of land with extraordinary value in terms of energy generating capacity (11 Gigawatts is huge huge huge), we're talking about compensation in the 10's of billions of dollars.  Perhaps property law works differently in Brazil, but we must ask ourselves whether the fundamental principles underlying U.S. property law should apply everywhere.  (I recognize that U.S. history with regard to indigenous populations is abhorrent, but the principles remain, and the same mistakes need not be made again.)

Here's a relevant hypothetical example: Say I own 25% of the mineral rights on a ranch that just had a huge oil discovery.  Until my partners and I agree to some sort of deal with an energy company, no one has the right to come and extract those resources.  We are the ones with the bargaining power.  If for *any* reason we don't like the deal, we can walk away and decide to wait until someone gives us a better offer.  On the other hand, if it's an eminent domain situation with a state run energy company, we at least know that by law we must be justly compensated.

&gt;people don't have a right to a particular lifestyle

People have right to live whatever lifestyle they want on their own land.  If they can live in a way that is self-sustaining on their own land, who's to stop them?  They aren't tradesmen who need to rely on being competitive in an ever-changing economy.  No, they live on their own land and mind their own business.  As such, modernization poses no threat to them because they are not incorporated into modern systems nor do they rely on such systems to satisfy their needs.  The only threat that modernization poses is that it will overstep its bounds and encroach onto their land.  If you prefer to say, ""Well it's really Brazil's land,"" then it becomes a matter of ""just compensation"" as noted above.  Nevertheless, I think a very strong argument could be made that these people deserve the same rights that a sovereign country with it's own globally recognized borders would enjoy.

&gt;these stone age indians living in the jungle

I sense in your description and tone a significant bias against their way of life.  In terms of sustainability and environmental stewardship, their way of life would probably score pretty high.  If they are happy living without modern amenities like TVs, cell phones, air conditioning, etc. who are we to judge them?  It's their own choice.  Are we justified in decimating their way of life just so others can have access to the very things that they are perfectly content to live without?

&gt;By giving them a vote and a voice, which they have exercised, and certain guaranteed essential liberties, which were perserved. Beyond that, they lost. That's the end of it.

Brazil didn't give them a voice, they always had a voice.  Brazil simply gave them a platform for their voice to be heard for a brief time.  But did Brazil listen to what they had to say?  No, because their ""votes"" weren't enough.  Of course their votes weren't enough!  They are a tiny minority that inhabits a tiny region of the country.  Suggesting that the voting system fairly represents them is just a fool's argument that attempts to legitimize the taking of their land.  Suppose all of Europe had been able to vote on whether Switzerland should be part of the EU?  In such a setup, the votes of the 77% of Swiss citizens who voted on March 4, 2001 not to join the EU wouldn't have really mattered.

When we look at the Post-Roman Medieval period, we find that identity was primarily constructed by religious affiliation, then by status of birth, followed by language, followed by place of birth. This was a departure from the Roman Empire under which identity was constructed primarily by citizenship status (and birthright), followed by place of birth, then by language, and only intermittently by religion (and that is primarily near the ending centuries of the empire).  

So the mark of an ""other"", as Jews were seen, was highlighted in the Medieval period, by the rise of religion as a primary self-identifier among European Christians, a condition brought forth by the survival of Christianity in the form of the Roman Church after the collapse of the Roman Empire.  Without the power of a centralized authority that governed rights and priviledges through citizenship, the church fufilled the role of legitimizing authority through allegiance with the church. Meaning that Authority became decentralized into the hands of powerful warlords, whose legitimacy of rule was confirmed by the sole surviving institution of the only widely recognized legitimate-but now-defunct Roman Empire. Christianity thus became the standard unifying identity that transcended kingdoms in Europe, furthermore making the most widespread and recognizable group of non-Christians targets for persecution.  

Jews became the primary ""other"" that the christian hive-mind could recognize and have ready contact with; making them a preferred and consistent target for discrimination, above all other ""others"". A legacy which has continued to the present only assuaged in the last few decades of Western Civilization.

Most other peoples at some point melted into some bigger pot. But why not the Jews? 

That is almost certainly because of Judaism itself. Before Christianity and Islam, really only the Jews worshiped ONE God. Maybe someone else here and there too, but no one was as populous or with their own language and writing system. 

The Jews, thanks to culture and religion have a strong identity.  This is good - they'll stick around. But it is bad - because they'll always be ""outsiders"". 

This means that when the Jews lose a big war to either Persian or Romans and that ends up scattering Jewish refugees all over the middle east and the Roman empire, they tend to not absorb and disappear. 

This is a problem, because people (especially ancient peoples) do not like outsiders. Bad, bad things happen to outsiders in the ancient world.

So the Jews lose a war to Rome. But wait why did they decide to fuck with Rome in the first place? 

In their defense the Carthaginians also fucked with Rome, but with even worse results. 

What do the Carthaginians and the Druids in England, and the Helvetii all have in common? They fucked with Rome and they got extinct by Rome. As in totally erased from history. Do Not Mess With Rome!


But back to the Jews, being a somewhat large nation and sticklers over there being only one true God, they didn't like the Romans allowing Greeks to perform sacrifices to their Gods. They didn't like the Roman emperor, calling himself a God. In general it was a culture clash between a morality we would recognize much like our own and that of ancient Rome.  

So they rebelled.

Rome won. 

This means Jews get dispersed all over the Roman empire. 

Jews then tend to not become absorbed and lost. As previously established this will end badly.

A bit later the Roman empire becomes Christian, or Jew-lite if you will.  You'd think that's be good news, but you'd be wrong. The smaller the difference, the more important it is. Besides, now every Christian feels they got personally slighted by you know who.



First the Spanish inquisition starts to bother the Jews. Why? Have you red anything about the Spanish inquisition? That's why.

The Jews from Spain run away, all over Europe.

Turns out the Europeans don't like foreigners! I know, how unusual and a typical of us open minded folks. Hey did you know ""folk"" is a German word meaning people?

Jews are bothered by everyone in Europe and the Germans go really over the top, and I mean really, really over the top with the Jew bashing.  

This makes the rest of look and feel bad and now we pretend to to like the Jews.

Now in medieval Europe, Christians were not allowed to lend (take interest, from other Chistians). Jews could, and so a ""caste"" of jewish moneylenders established all over Europe.

Now a ""monopoly"" of banking is a very good business plan, and so you got a loi of rich Jewish bankers. Jews did have large priveliges by being outside the feudal system, they were not serfs under a lord but free subjects of the king.

At this time you should not think of Jews as an ethnicity in the modern sense, but as a (mostly) herelditary class or even ""caste"". (It was, at times, possible, though not easy or normal, to become a Jew by conversion/adoption, compare this to changing class going from pesant to artisan by adoption into a guild.)  Probably the Jewish religion survived in Europe for 1500 years exactly because the non Christian religion was the reasoning that allowed the social class its monopoly. 

As privileged bankers the jews may have been unpolular by parts of the populance but did fill a necessary niche in the economy. Also the monarchs needed the ability get money quickly, especially to finance wars.  Then, at times, the monarch borrowed too much, became unable to repay loans, and the easy way to default was to expel the Jews.

And here you have the backstory of virtually every medieval expulsion. Repeat for the next country and next generation. (Of course Jews were allowed back in at some point when the king or society realised they needed their services again.)

The entire reason shen is good is because he can split push from the minute he gets items. His tanking abilities actually aren't that great outside of his absurd ultimate-like taunt. The reason why he is strong is because of his split push power, not because of the strength of his abilities.

Early Jewish immigration in the 1890s (otherwise known as the first Aliyah) was primarily into unpopulated, rather undesirable areas. Immigrants from Eastern Europe were trained in agriculture and built settlements. Some of these areas were in close proximity or overlapped with Arab townships, but the land was legally bought from the local population.

Couldn't disagree more... NZ is tied up significantly from a financial standpoint - not including trade and loans to NZ and foreign banks that Kiwis then borrow from, most of the so called wealth producing funds sold by financial advisers have a number of US based components; this includes parts of KiwiSaver. Plus, every commodity in the world is priced in US$, so whether you choose to ignore it, the US is integral to the global economy.

On the surface that's true, but does the interest (minus fees and tax) keep the purchasing power of a 1980's $100 the same in 2011? No, is the simple answer. 

&gt; Greed exists wherever there is people, regardless of the presence of money. It is inherent in a world with finite resources, and is in no way restricted to banking.

Completely agree, which is why enforced and fair regulation, with an understanding that greed is human nature, must take place. Private banks self regulation is like putting the fox in the chicken coop.

1. Your overly dramatic and rude air. I make you sick? I don't concern myself with facts? Bite your fucking tongue, guy. I tried to be polite.

2. You completely ignored the 'perpetual war' bit. Either back up that point with something more concrete than an accusation that I don't concern myself with facts, or admit you're wrong on that.

3. America is *not* comparable to Soviet Russia, hence your tactic of flipping them around is ridiculous. Did we take over our half of Europe following WWII and install puppet governments through sham elections backed up by naked force (you may be aware that, rather, we single-handedly rebuilt the damn continent)? Did we deliberately starve millions of our own citizens in the name of enforcing our economic policies (resulting, for instance, in documented cases of parents eating their children to survive)? Did we institute a wave of ideological purges that killed hundreds of thousands and involved tortures such as letting rats eat their way through peoples' midsections? Did we create a system of forced-labor camps that unjustly imprisoned tens of millions of people over a few decades? Did we rape our way through Western Europe as we advanced against the Germans? 

Look, I won't claim America is some kind of international saint. We've acted amorally and placed national interest above morals many times. *All states do this to some degree.* The point is that the records of America and the USSR are very different, and to flip the two around like this is misleading and wrong.

What made the USSR so bad was the degree and frequency of such things, which was far greater than America at any point in its history.

It was crusted with a weird looking green substance that seemed to be coming from the inside of the shell and had spilled out. But I was little and in my tiny brain thought ""eh, fuckit"" and popped it in my mouth. I remember it tasted awful, but there wasn't any convenient place to spit it out so I just gulped it down.

I went through the two pairs of clothing we had with us very quickly, so that by the end of the flight I was just wrapped in an airline blanket. I really feel bad for everyone else on that flight. 10 hours in the air stuck with a kid that's just gushing bodily fluids. I imagine the smell was less than pleasant. When we landed in Madrid, my parents asked where the nearest hospital was and rushed me there half-conscious and wrapped in a blanket. We got to the hospital and they told us to wait in the waiting area, to the anxiety of my parents. In the meantime, they gave me a big thing of Pedialyte to rehydrate me. By the time the doctor saw me, which probably took far longer than my parents were comfortable with, I had perked right up. The pedialyte had brought me back to life, and they never really figured out what had been wrong with me. To this day I still won't eat pistachios, and even hate pistachio ice cream (although that's more because it tricks me into thinking it is that king of ice creams, mint, when it is clearly inferior).

Oh how you can be SO wrong. You need to STOP buying into this MYTH.

The Kokoda Campaign was NOT won by successive allied assaults due to superior ingenuity by the Australians, the ONLY reason we won the Kokoda Campaign was because the Japanese had over stretched their supply lines and were no longer able to move fresh men and ammunition up into the area of Operations. 

You see it was the AIF that had stretched itself initially after pushing up the track to meet the Japanese, but it was ONLY after the AIF had moved back to an area where their supply lines and reinforcement routes were shorter then the Japanese that they could A) Move in the superior fighting forces of the AIF as compared to the Militia. B) Move serious amounts of equipment up the track. C) Clear away available jungle areas so that United States C-47 Skytrains could offload cargo.

That on top of the help issued by the FWA's helped them being able to move men quicker and supplies easier then the Japanese.

The Japanese ONLY lost the Kokoda Campaign because it was a rushed and ill-thought out operation. You're an idiot if you think that it was some magical on the spot learning from the AIF that saved Kokoda. (which I might point out, you've misspelt wrong, HOLY SHIT LEARN TO PROOF READ)

&gt;Also you really need to stop making things up, the King tiger was not developed in response to the T-34 and in fact the T-34 was out gunned by the Tiger-1 tank. Besides, having a bigger gun then other tanks does not a good tank make.

You're an idiot mate. The idea of a super tank had been around since the late 30's for a few European nations, but none of them saw action until well into the war. The KT was rushed into production after the battle of Kursk in which the T-34's went thought the the Tiger I's like a hot knife. The TI had a superior gun to the T-34 but lacked the T-34's sloped armour to deflect shots up and away from it, unlike the KT which nicluced an even superior gun and had total immunity from allied AT.

The King Tiger was THE most powerful tank fielded by ANY army in WWII, it had the most powerful main gun and it's frontal armour made it totally immune to ANY allied Anti-Tank weaponry. It was so effective the Russians would use set piece artillery that they had hidden in bushes and tree lines to try and use sheer kinetic energy to destroy them. This tactic while successful was extremely dangerous as artillery pieces are very hard to move in comparison to AT weaponry.

&gt;Also dont forget that before invading Russia in 1941, the German army had conquered France, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands. The majority of their army had combat experience.


No. No. No. No. NO!

The German Army units that took place in Operation Barbarossa DID have elements of their combat units operated by men from the earlier operations in Western Europe, but they deployed in total, 3.3 Million Men into Barbarossa while still keeping a toe hold on France AND North Africa. Your knowledge of WWII is lackluster at best, and you're obviously relying on things like Wikipedia to prove your points, which you're not doing very well at all might I say.

&gt;Its not that I have misread what you have written, but rather that you jump from point to point in a desperate attempt to defend a statement that you didn't think through. You are trying to weasel away from your original statement (see above) which you know you can't defend.

Explain to me this then: 

&gt;How are you meant to learn how to fight when you're sitting around doing nothing.
Armies learn to fight by fighting, not sitting in class rooms.

That there was my original comment, what that comment says is that Armies learn how to better themselves by evaluating and annalysing their mistakes and successes in combat, that is the TRUE key to being a **professional** army. Seeing as you think I'm trying to weasel my way out of things when all I've done is reinforce my stance with historical facts. From WWI ANZAC's, to WWI Wehrmacht and Russian tactics.

&gt;I also notice that you didn't address either of my points about our specialists fighting overseas or our joint training with our allies. Nor did you address whether we should start a war with a similarly developed power.

you know what. fuck it. You're obviously a civilian and never pulled on a uniform in your entire life. I'm sick of trying to explain how modern, professional armies operate in ways to better their training and field tactics by using assessments and evaluations of its own and it's neighbours fighting abilities.

I just pray to what ever God exists that if we are attacked, spastics like you stay as far away from a command and control interface.

/end of discussion, cannot be fucked wasting more time trying to drill into your head that training manuals are written after action has taken place and new and better ideas and tactics are invented.

Germany was split into two pieces during the Cold War--East for the Soviet Union, West for NATO.  German scientists in the east were exported to the Soviet Union for their weapons programme, while West German research was under the NATO (thus, America's) wing; a lot of it was also co-opted by the French (explaining their intensity in nuclear energy).  I would say the same goes for Japanese research; we did, after all, essentially occupy them for a great deal.  But I do think that Japanese research was much more independent than German research.  Actually, this is good evidence for my part; look at the two nations who successfully integrated nuclear energy into their electric economies--France and Japan.  France has the lowest energy costs in Europe, even though their reactors are highly un-economical.  And Japan, aside from this latest disaster, has been extremely proficient about their nuclear program.  

I utterly reject your contention that it is a technology failure.  That would be like saying that the Wright brother's planes were a technology failure; I still believe that nuclear power, in terms of much much interest it has garnered over the past few decades, is still relatively young.  Breeders and fuel processing have both stagnated because of a lack of urgency (uranium is cheap) and politics (fucking nuclear weapons and proliferation ruining things again).  The lack of breeder investment is yet another market failure--why invest in technology that efficiently extracts energy, when we can do a shoddy job now for cheaper?

The assumption of an objective reality is not a religion, it's an epistemological principle (albeit a rather dated one). My point is that given the nature of cultural beliefs and its relation to human subjectivity and the human mind which is highlighted in research in neuroanthropology and neurophenomenology; given the historically contingent nature of philosophical ideas, principles and values (including 'atheism'); given the complex measure by which knowledge is accrued - it's a safe bet to be rather sceptical of any system claiming to be 'pure' rationality, it's a safe bet to be sceptical of any system which claims to be the sole interpretive basis of evidence and the applicability of reason. My suggestion is that cultural systems are self-replicating, yet contingent ideas and ideals which govern and make possible the applicability of reasoning and rational behaviour within these systems and which govern and make possible the very reality which is experienced by those within these systems. Religion is one such cultural system and while your beliefs aren't religious, they do share enough in common to be able to function in a rather similar epistemic manner. 

Also, my point was rather broad in that language and religion are both normal human possibilities hard-wired into our brains. I should elaborate that given the complex nature of 'meaning making' and the fact that all people are born into social systems (whether familial or tribal or any other conceivable possibility), the accrual of meaning and knowledge attained in upbringing is not so much a matter of abandoning a 'natural' state for an 'unnatural' one. If it were then one would have to accept also that a child being brought up in a Western education system is 'brainwashed' into accepting scientific knowledge. If the cultural systems within which infants develop are less described in the pejorative sense of 'brainwashing' (which carries the horrible connotations of mind control, coercive persuasion, manipulation and cult formation) and more in, what I would imagine would be, the more neutral sense of 'enculturation' (the term used by social scientists to describe the phenomenon), there is a huge challenge to this ideal concept of a 'natural' state of belief in any given concept.",0,1427204253,t3_hnmg9,1306986295,1,roca,0,False,True,allanpopa,c1xb7py,t1_c1x9me1,False,t5_2qh6c

I wanted to investigate the world situation more than one specific place or idea.

The first in this series was about a massive invasion of North America by the Russians that uses a horrible plague to kill almost everyone, and the PC's were immune innocents caught up in it.  Then this campaign happened in Europe, a year after the invasion, when Europe was going nuts with self-protectionism and trying to keep to boogeymen and the plague out.  The political upheaval was still going on and these sorts of activist groups were common.

I moved away from my group in Ottawa shortly after this campaign ran ( :-( ), but the next stage I had planned was that Israel and the entire area was nuked into a glass parking lot.  The PCs were going to be Jewish Israeli refugees in a northern Australian refugee camp.  One of their member was going to be an Israeli scientist who had worked out the antidote/innoculation against the plague.  It would be suicide to just announce it, especially in the camp, and the politics among the Israelis trying to figure out how to leverage this incredible discovery into a new homeland would be neat.

After that, I only had some vague ideas, but I was thinking about a few things:

- the characters are very low-tech aboriginals in Africa when refugees from Europe and the middle east start to move in.  My group was very big on quality role play so I was thinking this would be a neat challenge.

Lehi would support sabotage and espionage operations in the Middle East and in eastern Europe anywhere where they had cells. Stern also proposed to recruit some 40,000 Jews from occupied Europe to invade Palestine with German support to oust the British who had legal mandate and wanted to give the land to its native and original owners, the Palestinians.

On 11 January 1941, Vice Admiral Ralf von der Marwitz, the German Naval attaché in Turkey, filed a report (the ""Ankara document"") conveying an offer by Lehi to ""actively take part in the war on Germany's side

Lehi proposed intervening in World War II on the side of Nazi Germany. It offered assistance in transferring the Jews of Europe to Palestine, in return for Germany's help in expelling Britain from Mandatory Palestine. 

So basically, they would help fight the British and destroy the allies, who would basically end up saving the Jews from concentration camps.

The Jews from Europe (where they were called ""the Palestinians among us"" and graffiti scribbled on walls read ""Yids back to Palestine"") wanted to be nationalized into a country in which their forefathers had lived and to which they retained a claim, to which they would be loyal because the country would be a Jewish state eventually, and the immigrants were housed in property bought and paid for by the Jewish Agency, up until the War of Independence, at which time Israel received hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe and hundreds of thousands of Arabs had left their homes, so Israel dealt with the influx of refugees using the most readily available housing they could.

As for Moshe Dayan, his quote changes nothing. Firstly, some now-Jewish-inhabited areas had previous Arab occupants, but were Jewish-inhabited in even more distant history, like Jaffa, which had a Jewish majority in ancient times but was over time populated by Arabs. Secondly, he was exaggerating. Many places in Israel really were built on uninhabited land.

9,0,t1_c1xbjfz,todayilearned,,,"They weren't being kicked out of Muslim countries. Muslim rulers liked having Jews in their Kingdoms. The Ottoman Sultan helped evacuate Jews from Spain after the Catholics kicked out the Muslims and Jews, and brought them to Ottoman lands. He said,

&gt; ""You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler, he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!""

Things changed after Zionism started and picked the British and the United States in World War 1 (opposite the Ottomans who were allied with Germany).

Although can't really blame them for that, as the Ottoman Empire secularized in the 19th century, persecution of minorities increased because religious protections that were hard coded into Shariah law were removed and everyone was treated equally which meant minorities were at the mercy of the bad apples of the majority. Although the Jews didn't really get the worst of it (the Christian minorities like the Armenians did).

It was forced into such measures by Britain and France who refused to deal with the Ottomans until they did so. Then Britain/France turned around and fought them anyway in WW1. If the Ottomans and the Jews of Europe gave the middle finger to Western Europe and stuck with Germany in WW1 history would've been completely different.

Jews have historically gone for professions in the economic industry as well as other high education careers. It was a cultural thing and it's not dissimilar to how you see Asian Americans disproportionately become extremely economically successful in the United States in our day by going for certain professions. This amplified their presence and effect in any nation. The relationship between the State and ""the Bank"" has been a tenuous one and that's probably what earned the Jews the ire of some rulers. Until ""the Bank"" completely won and took over the world political order at the turn of the last century (thus all the ""Jews rule the world!"" conspiracies).

The Ottomans and other Muslim rulers recognized the advantages that Jews brought to the table in any society they were in, especially since Muslims themselves were quite heavily invested in trade, banking, education, science/research, etc. As Islamic civilization declined and the Ottoman Empire became the sick man of Europe, they (and Germany) tried to woo the Zionists who wielded considerable economic influence in Europe but the Ottoman Sultan wouldn't give them Palestine. The Zionists also turned their eyes to the United States which was turning into a bastion of capitalism and it was really a no brainer to pick the Anglo-American sphere or ""axis"" since it would've required some ridiculously prescient forethought to realize all the negative consequences at that time.

Speaking as someone familiar with Islamic history, Western rulers who turned the Jews into scapegoats have no one to blame but themselves. We're talking about an age where they controlled everything and could have outlawed any financial behavior they didn't like. Jews involved in banking/trade/etc didn't break the law, they worked within it. Usury was categorically forbidden in Islam and yet Muslims (and Jews) had tons of financial success anyway. You really didn't need the current modern economic model to fund the progress of the 19th/20th centuries. I actually understand why some people might want to jump on the conspiracy theory bandwagon in *our* age because of the behavior of the world's banking industry (especially IMF/World Bank) all factors which are out of anyone's control now. But that wasn't a big deal in Roman times or Medieval times.

I think the assumption that all/most backpackers love weed is fundamentally flawed.

The thing is that weed really isn't hard to find anywhere. Amsterdam obviously has higher quality and greater diversity but you can get stoned anywhere. I would bet even money every time that I could find weed in any tourist city in the world within 6 hours. In most cities it would happen within 3 hours.

I really don't think that Amsterdam weed pilgrimages happen to the extent that you think. At any rate, they don't happen simply because weed is decriminalised and wouldn't happen to the same marginal extent if there were no underlying attraction to Amsterdam itself.

No need to generalize.  You should read up on how Europe developed after the collapse of the Roman Empire.

&gt;""Needed their services again""???

That's right.

&gt;What services? Access to money? What money? Were they hording all of the gold, jewels and other precious metals of the time? Did they have large standing armies to protect their vaults and land? Did they own the supply routes, supply technology, seed silos, or livestock?

Please explain how a nomadic group can have access to so much wealth in that monarchs were asking them for loans?!?

They did not only have access to money, but to trade routes and they had contacts throughout the Mediterranean world.  Europe's monarchies were regularly involved in wars, which is where most of their money was spent.  Raising taxes was only an option some of the time.  Furthermore, the nobility and clergy were not taxed.  The nobility earned income from peasants paying rent for working their land and the clergy received tithes.  In order to tax the nobility the monarch needed their permission, otherwise a rebellion would easily begin as nobles regularly kept their own private armies (a left-over from the post-Roman period).  Jews were multilingual and could and did readily deal with merchants (also usually Jews) from North Africa to the Middle East and Western/Central Europe.  They accumulated plenty of wealth through such business practices.  They were the middlemen we loathe so much today but usually cannot go without.  They were forbidden from owning or working land, so another way they could succeed in the world was through usury and through supplying armies (the latter practice continued into the nineteenth century in states like Russia, so when the army didn't get their supplies, Jews received the blame).  Interestingly enough, Christians also practiced usury, and they charged higher interest rates than their Jewish counterparts.  Some religious laws can be broken if the profit is large enough.  Live and learn.

1,0,t1_c1xbxsn,socialism,"Democratic socialist, non-Communist/anarchist",,"I do. If we're comparing the merits of socialism versus social democracy, then ""pure"" socialism is better for the simple reason that it replaces capitalism. Under social democracy, you have capitalism (albeit alongside a strong welfare state), which is a problem for several reasons:

* Social democracy is an adversarial half-way solution, an arranged marriage that is doomed to failure. Capitalism, by it's very nature, will try to reduce the size/scope welfare state because it will see it as unnecessarily constricting through corporate regulation/taxation and/or seeing taxpayer dollars going to the welfare state as something to be appropriated. Look at all of the European social democracies that have become neoliberal states. 

* Capitalism, under any system, is immoral. Workers' labor is still exploited by the rich, who keep getting richer on the backs of the people who actually perform the labor, whereas executives do relatively little work, and investors do absolutely *none*. And yet they reap the benefits of the many. And let's not forget things like wars for oil and defense contracts, environmental devastation, abuse of third-world peoples by major corporations, etc. 

* Capitalism is unstable. Instability is built into the system, in that things like ""bubbles"" and their inevitable bursting, banks gaming the system, etc., often run unchecked and wreak havoc on world markets, sending them into a tailspin and decreasing the quality of life for literally billions of people in ""advanced"" capitalist world markets. Check out David Harvey's excellent speech/animated video *[The Crises of Capitalism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOP2V_np2c0)* where he talks about the real reasons that led to the Great Recession. 
 
* Capitalism uses ""shocks"" to survive. Watch Naomi Klein's *[The Shock Doctrine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4pLoFIKmE&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL14AEE516BDE72CAE)*. In it she lays out her theory as to how capitalist societies use crises (natural or artificial, real or imagined) such as wars, natural disasters, economic problems, etc., to push through a radical, right-wing agenda when people are too frightened/distracted to care. 

* Capitalism stunts human growth. In the workplace, people are often looked at as just another commodity, like a lighting fixture. The ""rat race"" is a dehumanizing grind that treats a human being like oxen to squeeze every last drop of productivity out of them without having to hire another person and pay them. This constant stress diminishes human potential and leads to many health problems, both physical and psychological. 

* Capitalism, with all its talk of innovation, stunts scientific achievement. If something cannot be immediately commercialized, it might not get funded. NASA is one example of science done right, but their budget is notoriously prone to budget cuts. Meanwhile, the war corporations get lots of government subsidies, and I've read that half of the government scientists work for the military in some capacity. Scientifically-supported natural medicines are heavily suppressed so that a friend of mine has to pay $300/a month for a *single* prescription of Cymbalta (true story).

You can oppress a black person, an Asian person, an Hispanic person, a Native indigenous person, a Rom instantaneously because you can see it in their face and their language.  You can even deny them freedoms and wealth through systems of institutionalized oppression.

But Jews?  Jews didn't rely on the Anglicized white western world as the source of their wealth and education the same way that Italians or the Irish did through soft integration.  They had to learn how to be independently educated in the face of centuries of European oppression, and this systematic cultural self-identification along ethnic lines, which was actually imposed by *other white people*, led to a group of whites who are separate from other whites.

The irony is that, despite having plenty of economic power, they lacked the degree of integration needed to wield political power in much of the Western World, which is why they were so easily made targets.  They were a powerful *other* that could blend in with mainstream white society while not relying upon it for its survival, its education, its culture, or its moral and ethical beliefs.

Case in point...we went to Granada, Spain back in 2007.  We arrived at around 23:45, and given that we had been to spain couple of years before and knowing that life didn't really start til midnight, we expected to find restaurants opened.  Shockingly, we entered a couple of places and they both said they were closing at midnight.  At the 2nd place we were really surprised so we asked the waiter---why are you closing at midnight?  We thought bars didn't close til 6am....
Bartender says, is a new EU directive.  We can't be open past midnight. Of course my british friends went apeshit, and as they told me, ""you see, this is what happens when the EU takes over.  They start taking away the country's cultural identity.""
 
Anyway, we had to go to another side of town to find restaurants open as those for whatever reason didn't violate the Eu directive.  
Granted---I have no idea if the bartender was talking the truth or not, but my point is that I think brits believe that the EU is there to take away national pride, and that's one reason they are eurosceptic.

Now, given the number of muslim refugees/illegal immigrants pouring into Europe now, and given that most of them have 3, 4 children, and most are all on welfare, eventually europe might turn to  shariah law, so all that cultural identity will be all gone anyway. :D

They were set up to oversee the whole European Union so that no one member state could be seen to have a disproportionate level of influence over the court. The UK supreme court is principally made up of English judges in an English courtroom setting. There are a couple of Scottish judges who make up the pool that sit on the court, but the majority are English with decades of experience in English law. Certainly there are overlaps, but in the main even the basic terminology in law is very different between the two systems.

*TL;DR - Scottish Government are the SNP. Scots Law's independence guaranteed by 1707 union. SNP want independence from England, creation of route of appeal to a court in England renders Scot's Law subservient to England.*

I think the Scottish Government are right to take issue with the UK Supreme Court it undermines the whole idea of a separate and independent Scottish legal system, something that was guaranteed in perpetuity by the 1707 Treaty of Union, by providing a means of appeal held within another country with a separate legal system. This might well only apply to Human Rights Legislation at the moment, but given that the UK Parliament can override the Scottish Parliament should it so chose then it's within the realms of possibility that the UK Government could eventually decide that he UK Supreme Court is to be the final point of appeal for any and all cases held in the UK. Really though it's redundant. I'm sure the Court of Session and the High Court of Justicary are more than capable of dealing with appeals, via Scots law, while remaining mindful of their obligations under the Human Rights Act etc. Any decisions they make would not be biding in English Law, and vice-versa, so the English Courts have nothing to fear about people using Scots Law decisions as a precedent in their own cases.

Having a central point of appeal makes perfect sense in a federal country like the United States, but as far as I know the individual states of the USA don't have a legal history stretching back hundreds of years that was guaranteed by an international treaty. What we're really talking about here is if people in America could appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court when the had been turned down by every other court in the US.

This has all been debated before though. In the 18th and 19th century there were a great many cases decided in Scotland that were then appealed to the House of Lords and decided on by a majority of English Lords who were entirely ignorant of Scots Law. In the end the mounting public outcry lead to the creation of The Lords of Appeal to deal with these cases and these eventually became known as the Law Lords who now make up the members of the UK Supreme Court. I don't suspect that the UK Government will change its mind on this one as dissolving the UK Supreme Court would be seen as another nail in the coffin of the Union.

""a single mating pair can produce a population of nearly 17 million in just over three years"". 

That's a brown rat stat.. They can't mean brown rats because they came with Europeans to Polynesia/NZ etc (via Norway from probably China) which is years after the events they are talking about. It's misleading because brown rats AND polynesian rats only typically live &lt;1 year in the wild - even sans predators - and the domestic pet rattus norvegicus only live 2-3 years typically. Not heard of too many Rattus exulans kept domestically so who knows how long they might (potentially) live for with veterinary care etc.

I know they have probably mixed this up because unlike the brown rat the Polynesian rat only mate seasonally - and because I've seen those numbers quoted before - its a common bit of hyperbole. 

These rats are also much  unlikely to become pregnant with a new litter before weaning IIRC - unlike brown rats.  

Many Polynesians including Maori and the residents of Easter Island ate these rats so they DID have a predator - particularly in places like that where there was scarce protein aside from seafood and birds...

But Ron Paul, in what he could actually accomplish in the while in the presidency (remember: just because RP is president doesn't mean that Howard Dean, Anthony Wiener, etc. have vanished from congress -- did republicans disappear when Obama won?), would essentially be a lot of civil liberties action that is popular with people. He's the president so he can bring troops home immediately from all over the world. He commands the DEA, so raids on medical marijuana would end. He would be able to use public sentiment to end the TSA. Hemp would possibly be legalized (depends on the strength of lobbies), maybe pot too, he would never allow censorship of the net on a worldwide basis, there's just so much good to be had. If democrats/republicans opposed these things they'd start losing elections, people are tired of oppressive statism. It would kick-start both sides of the spectrum into increasing basic freedoms, at least to some extent. Economics, not so much, as there are millions and millions of dedicated liberals in the country. That stuff would be fought tooth and nail. Even if, for the sake of things, we assume that Ron Paul did get one or two things done, they would enact all of the above effects that would benefit progressives (Europe was defederalized for quite some time, look how liberal they are), but if we're assuming that bills had to pass snuff through a congress with many, many members who believe government has a significant role to play in the economy, they would likely be smart, undeniably needed reforms. Like ending the health care cost inflating employer tax cut. Or discontinuing the AMA lobbied regulation that does not allow nurses to preform some incredibly simple tasks (thus inflating doctor's profit). There are countless corporatist regulations like that that could and should be eliminated, and Ron Paul will certainly go for it.

7,0,t1_c1xcew2,gaming,,,"I'm a game design student, and I have a concept for a game that involves shooting your way through hordes of genuinely threatening slow zombies, working your way toward the western seaboard. it might interest you, particularly the multiplayer:

**Inspired by:** Condemned and Zombie Games in general.

**Game Title:** Disinfection (working title)

**Genre:** Squad-Based First Person Action Game.

**Gameplay:** The enemies in the game are, for the most part, slow zombies, though there are some human enemies later on. These aren't, however, your standard video game zombies. In fact, they're more in line with movie zombies, in that, if they bite you once, you're dead, unless you can amputate the infected limb within three minutes. Even if you do, your player character will be permanently gimped, either losing movement speed if they have to get a prosthetic leg, or accuracy and melee damage if they lose one of their arms. You have to work with your squad and move forward carefully to avoid getting bitten. Fortunately, if you're within range and a zombie gets the jump on you, your AI squadmates can shoot it and save your life. However, each time this happens, you lose a luck point, and when your luck runs out… well, your luck has officially run out the next time a zombie grabs you.
In order to take out zombies effectively, you need to make strategic use of your weaponry. You're never short on ammo, however, each shot you fire creates a lot of noise, which will draw zombies to your location. You can also make use of melee weapons and silenced ranged weapons (like crossbows,) however, these are less effective, and make the zombies you're currently fighting that much more dangerous. When fighting human enemies, it's almost always best to use firearms, as they will undoubtedly be doing the same. Bullets reduce a health bar separate from your luck points, and it can only be refilled with medkits. It's not all bad news, however, as by wounding human opponents, you can use them as bait to keep the zombies off your back.

**Multiplayer:**
Co-op (in co op, if your partner gets grabbed by a zombie and they are out of luck points, you can kill the zombie within five seconds to save them.)
""Scavenge"" – Objective based gametype set weeks after the outbreak claimed the city. Survivors have to run around collecting supplies, which are sparsely distributed around the map. Points are gained for each supply crate players manage to find and bring back to their respective drop zones. The map is littered with zombie mobs that will pursue and attack you if you get too close. As this is a versus mode, you can attack other players, and you will need to if you want to get enough supplies to win, but you need to do so strategically. Each player limb has a hitbox with a different effect: hitting their legs will slow them down, hitting their arms reduces their melee power and makes aiming harder, hitting their head kills them instantly, (rarely the best move, unless they have a crapton of supplies you want to steal, as they will quickly respawn,) and hitting their chest causes them to bleed out, which reduces their health over time AND causes them to attract zombies. If a player is injured, they need to return to their drop zone/spawn point in order to get patched up. As with the main game, if a zombie gets you, you will die instantly, and you will not respawn for the rest of the round.
""Raid"" – Essentially a team variant of scavenge, with bases at either end of the infected zone. In addition to the scavenging, teams can raid each other's bases and steal all of their points at once. However, this action carries with it a risk: if an enemy player tags you while in their base, you will be tied up and thrown to the zombies, and your teammates will have thirty seconds to rescue you before you are permanently killed.

**Plot Summary:** The year is 2026, and humanity has just turned the tide in a massive zombie outbreak that has claimed most of the earth. The larger horde has been put down, and the infected sectioned off into quarantine zones. Unfortunately, most of the major cities in the continental United States still lie within these zones. As a member of the Quarantine Clearance Force, you are charged with clearing zones of the undead and pushing back the war front until the entire country is clear of zombies. As your squad moves toward the Eastern Seaboard, you eventually find yourselves clearing Langley, where you discover an unusually large number of zombies swarming around a single building. After killing the zombies, your team enters the building to clear it out and realizes that it is the headquarters of the CIA. Clearing the building floor by floor, your team eventually finds a hidden elevator to the basement. Below ground, they find a laboratory that appears to be the source of the zombie plague. After discussing it, your team decides that they should gather evidence of the government's involvement in creating the virus, so that those responsible can be brought to justice.
When they exit the offices, however, they find that ""those responsible"" are less eager to be punished. A warrant has been issued for your squad's arrest, and you realize that if you are captured, you will likely never see the light of day. You decide to flee for the coast, where you hope to find a boat that you can take to Europe. The rest of the game has you fending off both the undead horde and groups of military police and QCF squads that have been ordered to take you in. In the game's conclusion, you fight your way through Manhattan, and manage to find a suitable boat docked in one of the marinas. You then must gather supplies within the city to ready yourselves for the long voyage, fighting off zombies and armed pursuers as you scavenge for food, fuel, and ammunition. Once you have enough supplies, you meet up back at the boat, where your squadmates confirm that the military is scouring the city for your squad. Worried that they will intercept the boat if they see it leaving, your squad decides that someone will have to stay back and create a diversion so that the rest can escape.
The player can choose to volunteer for this mission. If they don't, another squad member will take their place, but will get killed too early and you will be taken into government custody. If the player does volunteer, it will lead to them holding up in the UN building and sniping military police to create the impression that the entire squad is hiding there. Once the police swarm the building, the player will have to hold out for five minutes to give the squad sufficient time to get away. If they do, they will see the game's ""true ending,"" in which we see a British Newscaster reporting that the US government is in the middle of a war crimes tribunal. The camera then pulls out from the TV, showing the surviving members of your squad dressed in black suits and sitting around in some sort of lobby. They then stand up and walk out in single file, making their way into a massive theatre. The audience applauds them as they enter, walk up the centre aisle, and sit down at the very front. The camera then pans around to a stage, and reveals that the event is a massive funeral for you. You and your squad are being recognized as war heroes, and the Queen of England Knights you posthumously. The camera then cuts to a wide shot of your squad standing abreast of the altar with your picture on it, and the credits roll as this last image slowly fades to black.

**What's Unique:** As opposed to other games, where zombies are a minor threat, these ones kill you with one bite. The game aims to make the classic ""slow, shambling, shoot it in the head"" type zombie a credible threat again, instead of just cannon fodder. On the rare chances that zombie bites don't kill you, they will permanently inhibit the player character's performance.
There's also the setup. We see a lot of zombie games about surviving the intial outbreak, but rarely do we see anything involving the cleanup.",0,1428201921,t3_hpmcd,1307005774,7,,0,True,True,G-0ff,c1xcew2,t3_hpmcd,False,t5_2qh03

I went through Andorra last summer - the climb into Andorra from Ax des Thermes in France is a killer: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pas_de_la_Casa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pas_de_la_Casa), it's 35km long and the top of the climb was above the snow line in June - one of the longest climbs in the Pyrenees.

In terms of kit, make sure you take spare spokes of each required length, and a spoke key, as well as all the usual allen keys and puncture repair stuff.

having been ""stolen"" by the green.
You can't steal land that's ""yours""

If ""legality"" is determined by the indigenous inhabitants allowing the entrance of foreigners into their territory, then the majority of European Jewish immigration is illegal, since neither the Palestinians nor their Ottoman rulers allowed Jews to settle (in the later periods around the time of WWI).
Even if you take Britain's jurisdiction over the ""mandates"" as legal, then a whole lot of Jewish immigration was illegal as well.

This is the Land ownership circa 1945, **after thousands of Jews had been immigrating to Palestine:**
http://julian-richards.co.uk/WP/theblog/files/2009/01/palestine-land-ownership-1945.jpg

Population sizes circa 1946, note the population of the Jews were significantly smaller just years before. The British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, so many Jews migrated to Palestine illegally. Over 100,000 people attempted to illegally enter Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships made to Palestine. The Jews created closed off militaristic farming settlements called kibbutzes when they came and even kicked off Palestinian Jews which they saw as squatters. They actually continued coming in the thousands, year after year, from all over the world. **Between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine, but soon this number would grow and increase.**

Military conquest does not abolish private rights to property - nor does it entitle the victor to confiscate the homes, property and personal belongings of the noncombatant civilian population. The fact that Israel conquered the inhabitants of Palestine in 1948 doesn't create an ""exclusive right""

&gt;And it ignores the fact that both the 1948 lines and the 1967 lines were redrawn in response to outside forces deciding that there was only room for the State of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea.

This is just PLAIN FALSE. The 1967 war started as a result of a preemptive strike made by Israel. Basically, they attacked the other side first.

&gt;And it ignores the fact that both the 1948 lines and the 1967 lines were redrawn in response to outside forces deciding that there was only room for the State of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea. 

Lies

* During May [1948] ideas about how to consolidate and give permanence to the Palestinian exile began to crystallize, and the destruction of villages was immediately perceived as a primary means of achieving this aim...[Even earlier,] On 10 April, Haganah units took Abu Shusha... The village was destroyed that night... Khulda was leveled by Jewish bulldozers on 20 April... Abu Zureiq was completely demolished... Al Mansi and An Naghnaghiya, to the southeast, were also leveled. . .By mid-1949, the majority of [the 350 depopulated Arab villages] were either completely or partly in ruins and uninhabitable."" Benny Morris, ""The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949.

* ""Before the end of the mandate and, therefore before any possible intervention by Arab states, the Jews, taking advantage of their superior military preparation and organization, had occupied...most of the Arab cities in Palestine before May 15, 1948. Tiberias was occupied on April 19, 1948, Haifa on April 22, Jaffa on April 28, the Arab quarters in the New City of Jerusalem on April 30, Beisan on May 8, Safad on May 10 and Acre on May 14, 1948...In contrast, the Palestine Arabs did not seize any of the territories reserved for the Jewish state under the partition resolution."" British author, Henry Cattan, ""Palestine, The Arabs and Israel.""

* ""Menahem Begin, the Leader of the Irgun, tells how 'in Jerusalem, as elsewhere, we were the first to pass from the defensive to the offensive...Arabs began to flee in terror...Hagana was carrying out successful attacks on other fronts, while all the Jewish forces proceeded to advance through Haifa like a knife through butter'...The Israelis now allege that the Palestine war began with the entry of the Arab armies into Palestine after 15 May 1948. But that was the second phase of the war; they overlook the massacres, expulsions and dispossessions which took place prior to that date and which necessitated Arab states' intervention.""

Please use your common sense. Please read John Quigley's ""The Statehood of Palestine"" in which he concludes that Palestine was declared a state after the 1st World War just like Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.


Lehi would support sabotage and espionage operations in the Middle East and in eastern Europe anywhere where they had cells. Stern also proposed to recruit some 40,000 Jews from occupied Europe to invade Palestine with German support to oust the British who had legal mandate and wanted to give the land to its native and original owners, the Palestinians.

On 11 January 1941, Vice Admiral Ralf von der Marwitz, the German Naval attaché in Turkey, filed a report (the ""Ankara document"") conveying an offer by Lehi to ""actively take part in the war on Germany's side

Lehi proposed intervening in World War II on the side of Nazi Germany. It offered assistance in transferring the Jews of Europe to Palestine, in return for Germany's help in expelling Britain from Mandatory Palestine. 

So basically, they would help fight the British and destroy the allies, who would basically end up saving the Jews from concentration camps.

So they helped Germany deport the Jews who were living in Germany and wanted to live in Germany, in return for Germany's help in expelling Britain from Mandatory Palestine.. How are you going to tell me that's not immoral?

There's nothing odious about a man fighting for freedom from the British (who had, btw, promised to establish a Jewish homeland on his people's land) to talk to the German leader, who was fighting against the British. Please use your common sense.

In fact, the Mufti wanted to do the same thing that the Lehi wanted, expel the British.


&gt;There was the ""Palestinian Mandate"" of which 80% was given to the arabs from the British as Jordan.

ctually, the land wasn't ever given for the purposes of the establishment of a Jewish state. In fact, the land was promised to the Arabs way before,

* ""The Palestine position is this. If we deal with our commitments, there is first the general pledge to Hussein in October 1915, under which **Palestine was included in the areas as to which Great Britain pledged itself that they should be Arab and independent in the future .** . . Great Britain and France—Italy subsequently agreeing—committed themselves to an international administration of Palestine in consultation with Russia, [and the Sharif of Mecca] who was an ally at that time . . . A new feature was brought into the case in November 1917, when Mr Balfour, with the authority of the War Cabinet, issued his famous declaration to the Zionists that Palestine 'should be the national home of the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done—and this, of course, was a most important proviso—to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Those, as far as I know, are the only actual engagements into which we entered with regard to Palestine.""[4]

* **'Unauthorized statements have been made to the effect that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Palestine. Phrases have been used such as that Palestine is to become ""as Jewish as England is English."" His Majesty's Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view.** They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded ""in Palestine."" In this connection it has been observed with satisfaction that at a meeting of the Zionist Congress, the supreme governing body of the Zionist Organization, held at Carlsbad  in September, 1921, a resolution was passed expressing as the official statement of Zionist aims ""the determination of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people on terms of unity and mutual respect, and together with them to make the common home into a flourishing community, the upbuilding of which may assure to each of its peoples an undisturbed national development""'.

* **'it is contemplated that the status of all citizens of Palestine in the eyes of the law shall be Palestinian, and it has never been intended that they, or any section of them, should possess any other juridical status.** So far as the Jewish population of Palestine are concerned it appears that some among them are apprehensive that His Majesty's Government may depart from the policy embodied in the Declaration of 1917. It is necessary, therefore, once more to affirm that these fears are unfounded, and that that Declaration, re-affirmed by the Conference of the Principal Allied Powers at San Remo and again in the Treaty of Sèvres, is not susceptible of change.'

That's because France still subcribes to the le Roi-Soleil autocratic model. Areva is &gt;90% state owned, and needs to be bailed out by the French taxpayer. The actual electricity costs are estimated to be south of 60 EUR/MWh. 

And of course France had its national peak uranium around 1985 http://www.theoildrum.com/files/Uranium_Production_In_France.png and needs to import it.

As nuclear power isn't cheap, and breeder/fuel reprocessing is considerably more expensive, and thin-film PV should be cheaper than coal in less than a decade the sun is setting on the nuclear power industry.

&gt; I utterly reject your contention that it is a technology failure.

Nuclear power production goes back to steam engines. Even steam turbines (technology producing 80% of all electricity world-wide) has been invented in the modern form 1884. Nuclear technology is roughly ~70 years old and has been in a mature state for at least 50 years old.

&gt;McMahon was British High Commissioner in Egypt and Ali Ibn Husain was the Sherif of Mecca during the First World War. In a series of ten letters from 1915 to 1916 McMahon tried to attract Arab support against the Ottoman Empire. The following excerpt is from a letter from October 24, 1915. The implied promise is of British support of an independent Arab state.

As for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:

(1) Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.

(2) Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability.

(3) When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories.

(4) On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British.

(5) With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special administrative arrangements in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.

I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke, which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them.

Or they're a non-profit.

&gt; I'm talking about pure economic efficiency. The deadweight loss triangle from Micro 101. Taxes distort markets. Market distortion always leads to greater deadweight loss.

So are artificial restrictions like copyrights.

&gt; I get what you're trying to say, but that's just a huge logical fallacy.

We might simply have very different estimates of just *how* inefficient copyright restrictions are.

I believe they are *so* inefficient, that even if we had no authorship compensation at all, the mere boost of allowing sharing for progress would be better than the current situation. The authorship tax could just improve compensation even more.

&gt; The US has some of the loosest labor laws in the developed world and Western Europe has some of the tightest. Unemployment in the US has been about half of that of Europe. 

Yet even employed people in the US are often in poverty, and do not have basic benefits that people in Western Europe take for granted.

&gt; I think you've misunderstood my question. Changing payouts to benefit less popular artists would almost certainly be necessary.

How is it handled now, when there's the same problem?

&gt; If we just count downloads, what's to stop me from writing a clever program to download my song 5000 times a second, shifting through a variety of IP address so that it looks like people really like my music?

Don't count ""IP addresses"", count some better-authenticated entity (that may still be anonymous), and prevent or discount multi-voting.

&gt; Also, how large a tax are we talking? Is the idea to pay the artists enough so they don't have to have a day job? Or a specific amount per download? Is there a minimum or maximum payout? or both?

It can be roughly based on the amount of return authors currently have, and averages of people payouts to authorship in today's economy.

2,0,t1_c1xcl53,IAmA,,,"I can answer this question for you. When I was younger I did a lot of tagging, Bathrooms, Walls, Bridges, Windows, whatever I could get my hands on.  To explain you need to understand that tagging is part of a subculture you are not a part of and probably never will be, its simply not your form of self expression.  However, I can help you understand the mindset of this subculture.  For starters lets draw parallels to a subculture you are actually a part of, reddit.

As a user of reddit hopefully you will be able to understand this. The goal of many reddit users is to get on the front page and to collect useless Karama points and share his/her postings with others.  Tagging in essence is the same thing.  The more tags one throws up the more well known he/she is in the tagging community.

Tags are also used in a territorial sense.  I want to make clear this is in no way ""Gang"" related as many people assume (Taggers can have a ""crew"" but that story is for another day).  As a graff writer it is crucial to understand who else is tagging in your community and where most of their art is concentrated.  If you have seen a ""Lukk"" tag in the past four restaurants you've been to you can be damn sure under the nearest bridge you can find a fully flushed out piece of artwork that you can admire and appreciate.

These tags aren't meant for you to understand this is why they are as you say ""An illegible scribble on a stall.""  Its meant to be that way, so that the average dumbass who thinks vandals need to be prosecuted and charged to have the entire wall of a building replaced don't find them or figure out what they're doing.  This is part of the distrust and resentment graff writers feel for the modern industrialized world in which our economic and governmental systems are completely fucked.  The rich man isn't going to spend his time learning the intricacies of their subculture.

This ""illegibility"" as you call it has has parallels in many different cultures around the world.  For instance Jamaica was colonized by europe in the 1650's and english became the dominant language.  In revolt to traditional english the natives created a unique dialect in revolt of the white man.  The white man could no longer understand the natives nor take the time to understand their language, this was done so the natives could flaunt their distrust of the white man within their own community.  Of course the colonists thought this language represented stupidity and the inability to be educated, when in fact it was a genius way of getting away with preserving their culture during a time of extreme imposition.  A parallel to this can be seen in these ""illegible scribbles"" you see on walls.  You're not meant to understand it, you're not going to take the time to understand it and the fact that you think it is illegible is all part of the plan.

These tags on bathrooms aren't meant for you to understand, but they're meant to piss you off and aggravate you... and its working no doubt.  Its guerrilla warfare, there's no way for you stop it, and its never going to end.  Thats the realization graff writers are trying to get you to understand but you have to expand your perspective to get there.  Its about opening your mind and seeing things in a new perspective and not just from ones own point of view. There is something inherently wrong with the society you live in, you just need to open your eyes[...](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm)

You would occasionally come in the situation large unpayed loans grew and where the king owed more gold than was actually in the kingdom. This is the problem. 

Usury was declared illegal by the church and this was the legal basis for the expulsion. Therefore all loan were deleted. (Or only repayed by original amount, not interest.)

But in all honesty I feel privileged for living here. We have our problems like everyone else but compared to some industrialized countries we aren't that bad off. And it helps having beautiful nature (every country has some but I love my country's nature). But all the high GDP do comes with a price - it's highly because of the oil but we won't spend the money earned (just about nothing). ""It's poor being rich"" as some of us say. Sweden and Denmark, with no oil, has better roads, railways, health care (we have a huge health debate ongoing here...) and such. And bloody high taxes on everything. I read that buying a certain new car model, 70% of the price were taxes... 0_o Ridiculous at times...  

As joining the EU - I doubt it. We've had 3 nation votes since the 50's and they all said no. Last one in the early 90's I think. We are a member of the [European Free Trade Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTA) - we pay a lot of money to gain access to the inner marked of the EU but have to accept a lot of the EU legislation that comes from Brussels :/ And we are really being pussies (in lack of a better word) when it comes to boycotting laws... 

We could join the EU to gain a bit more 'power' with a vote but considering how few we are population wise I doubt that's much power. There is also the notion on ""once you join you can't leave"". I, and I think a lot of my fellow Norwegians, don't feel like Europeans. We are Norwegians first and Scandinavian second. Europe is a notion that's south of us - mainly the EU. I think that and the patriotic feeling we have towards out country hinders a large 'yes' vote. It also says in our constitution that Norway shal never be joined with another country ever again (in a union or similar) - not sure how the view is on that among jurists and normal citizens. And I doubt the southern EU countries economical crises really helps on our view on the EU - or that a lot of former east block countries are joining the EU as fast as they can...

20,0,t1_c1xcs53,AskReddit,,,"EDIT: I did not intend for this to be so long. No one will ever read this =/

I work in a camping/outdoor clothing store in the UK.

I feel somewhat guilty, because I really like my job. It seems very different from other workplaces here. I thought I'd share so it's known that some places are different.

1, I want you to ask me things. All our members of staff are 'outdoorsy' people, and between us we've tried and tested, or at least have tried and tested equivalents of just about every product in store. If we're offering advice, at least listen to it! We're honest! I know you can't always trust advice from shop assistants, but if you hear us out you might find our advice involves spending less, or spending elsewhere... 

2, If you ask for a discount, you might actually get a discount. We offer discounts for a large number of outdoor clubs and groups, and you may be eligible for a discount you weren't aware of. If not, sometimes we can do something. It's probably worth asking anyway. Of course, sometimes you'll get a discount without asking, when we can :)

3, I don't mind if you leave things untidy, but please make an effort. On busy days I don't have time to tidy everything, but as long as things are put back in the right place or handed to me it doesn't matter. Don't worry about hanging things properly, because clippy trouser hangers are horrible things and it took me long enough to master the art myself.

4, I'm afraid if I advise you that you need to spend a lot more and buy a more expensive version of something, it's not because I work on commission (I don't) but because your currently selected item won't be up to your intended purposes. Sorry. It happens the other way around as well though, I think you'd be pleasantly surprised to know how often I get to tell people they can spend less and get a better product.

5, IMPORTANT: If you buy a tent, put it up before you go to use it. If you put up a tent and you don't like it, you can bring it back for a refund. We don't have space to have tents up in store (though on request we can arrange to have one up for you to view outside of normal hours), so we're fine with this. Unfortunately, if you wait a few months, use it, and find it's not quite what you wanted we can't do anything. We'll try, but we are somewhat bound by company policy.

6, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: Please follow our advice, and try your footwear inside at home for a while before you wear them outside. If you walk out of the shop with them on, and then decide you don't like the fit two miles down the road, we can't do anything. If they haven't been worn outside we can refund in full.

7, Please tell me if a price is wrong. A few months ago a guy bought a sleeping bag from me for £49.99 and I only realised afterwards that they had been mistakenly labelled half price! If only he had said I would have overrode it without hesitation, but for whatever reason he didn't tell me the price was wrong and I never got the opportunity to put it right.

8, If you're rude to a colleague of mine, you can leave immediately. We do make allowances sometimes though. Only the other week, a customer was overcharged for a fleece (not our fault I believe, a case of switched labels by another customer I suspect), we apologised but before we could refund the money the customer had decided they'd been cheated, refused to speak to us and left the shop, ranting about trading standards. It's rare but sometimes mistakes have been made and a customer may be understandably angry. I think they'd just had a bad day, I'd actually rather have taken a bit of abuse and be able to put it right. An apology afterwards would always be appreciated though!

10, The 'Extreme' rating on sleeping bags, for most people, should be ignored. One of our two season bag may be extreme rated to -10 degrees, but that may not even protect you from hypothermia at that level. Just keep you alive. The 'comfort' temperatures are the ones to look at, but even those should be taken with a pinch of salt. I know that's not very helpful, but it's a European system all the manufacturers use and we're stuck with it....

11, Just because you had a boot with a Vibram sole that was fantastic before, doesn't mean the next boot with a Vibram sole will be. Vibram make hundreds of different types of sole, it's up to the manufacturer to pick which sole they want for their boots. It could well be a completely different compound.

12, If a branded product is returned as faulty, we have to send it back to the manufacturer for evaluation before giving a refund. I hate that we have to do this, but unfortunately it's necessary and we are bound by company policy. Obvious faults we can deal with straight away, but things which could be down to accidental damage or through wear and tear we have to have have evaluated. So far, I haven't had to disagree with a manufacturers decision. In fact I've been very impressed by a lot of manufacturers replacing items that clearly have been misused. 

13, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU KNOW THE LAW WHEN YOU QUITE OBVIOUSLY DON'T. There is nothing more infuriating than having to listen to people argue that they're entitled to full refunds, months after purchase, on items that are used, not in any way faulty, just no longer wanted. Having said this, shop assistants and managers can be just as bad...

14, If you bring a product to the till without a code... don't worry! We'll either look it up in our book, or it'll have it printed on the sewn in label. No problem.

15, Sorry I have to offer you extra products at the till point. Head office make us, and send people to check from time to time. Plus, if we don't ask, and then you ask for one after with pressed the payment button, we can only sell you them at offer price by refunding (with the paperwork refunds entail) and starting over. Which we don't mind of course, it just takes more time.

Nothing surprising. I noted with an inter-mixture of perverted glee and contempt that no one on reddit even bothered to even mention Tagore on his 150 birthday. Rabindra-da was too Hindu, too saffronite, too right wing nationalist, for the comfort of the ignorant, for the quasi-westernized leftist-liberals of reddit, and the rest of India. If you read him, you will almost think you are reading some RSS fellow. Some comments from him, from his essay ""The History of Bharatvarsha"". So much of it still rings true.  


&gt; [These] histories make you feel that at that time Bharatavarsha/India did not exist at all; as though only the howling whirlwind of the Pathans and the Mughals holding aloft the banner of dry leaves had been moving round and round across the country from north to south and east to west.

&gt; The way we get our education since our very childhood, with every passing day we get increasingly alienated from our own country till a sense of rebellion against the land of our birth overtakes our mind.

&gt; We find that a single objective has always been motivating Bharatavarsha. **This objective has been to establish unity among diversity**, to make various paths move towards one goal, to experience the One-in-many as the innermost reality, to pursue with total certitude that supreme principle of inner unity which runs through the differences. It has also been her endeavour to achieve these without destroying the distinctions that appear in the external world.
 
&gt; Bharatavarsha has forever been engaged in constructing with varied material the foundation of a unifying civilization. And a unified civilization is the highest goal of all human civilizations.

&gt; The effort to establish harmony between knowledge, action and devotion that we see in the Gita is a trait that belongs especially to Bharatavarsha. It is impossible to translate into Indian language the expression called “religion” that exists in Europe, for within the domain of faith Bharatavarsha has resisted the dividing of the mind. Our intellect, our belief, our conduct, all that we hold dear in this world and in the next, all of these together constitute our Dharma. 

&gt; Amongst the civilizations of the world Bharatavarsha **stands as an ideal of the endeavour to unify the diverse**. Her history will bear this out.

One one hand - no. But it's a bit more complicated than that...

In general I think people are not very positive towards immigration. The main reason for that is that what we think of as immigrants are never 'successful' immigrants - aka. people with full jobs, highly integrated into society, speaks Norwegian well and participates in society. That fuels the negative attitudes. 

What is shown in media over and over again, and that certain political parties love to focus on, are the non-white immigrants and the trouble makers within them. That's everyone from Africa to eastern European countries (e.g. Albania, Poland). Over 90% of rapes are done by non-western immigrants (granted only x% of rapes are told to the police) and just about all violent rapes. Stuff like that and problems with refugees and their integration into society are always highlighted by media. It does kind of stick into your head :/ And it doesn't help that, perhaps because of this, many non-western immigrants keep their social circle to mainly consist of people like themselves. 

There has also been huge problems with Eastern European criminals in Norway the recent years. Everything from stealing boat motors to violent robberies of stores and homes threatening with guns and what-not. Many also see prison here as better than the life they had/have back home - luxury even with even getting paid while they do time...

That said Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden and Denmark) have very similar society. We do like to differ ourselves but also to think of us as very alike. That makes everyone outside this group labelled as immigrants, even your typical white western. And it doesn't help that a very large group of non-Scandinavian immigrants are refugees and asylum seekers that have problems with their background and with integrating into society. We aren't a 'melting pot' as the US are labelled in our school books. 

-

So all in all - I don't think it's very open-minded towards immigration. Mainly because of the problems we have had and what media focuses on. I've met and worked with highly well integrated non-western immigrants but they are in the minority it would seem. 

But I think it is changing slowly. There are open-minded people here and people who are willingly coming here to do their best, integrate into society and 'keep their nose clean' are thought of as welcome.  But you might always be thought of as an immigrant - people are also labelled as 2nd generation immigrants and 3rd generation immigrants even when born and raised here (mainly non-whites)...

The result is that, even assuming that there were ""out"" atheists during that period, they were unlikely to have left much record of it. We don't really start to hear about specific people proclaiming their own atheism (at least, not in Europe) until the rise of literacy and the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. Even at that point, they wouldn't have called themselves atheist for two reasons. The first is that the word wasn't coined until a century later. The second is that it was initially used almost entirely as a term of approbation. People who did not believe in God would have been unlikely to self-apply it, and if they were called atheists, it would have been as an accusation. Often, the accusation was mere polemic, leveled against dissenters who would have been more accurately described as protestants.

That's not to say that there weren't people who denied the purported existence of God prior to then. Diversity of religious belief was actually much higher in the middle ages than we sometimes give it credit for. If it weren't, how could heresy have been such a pressing concern for the RCC? So it's almost certain that there were, among those who mixed gnosticism and manichaeism and paganism with their Catholicism, those who went so far as to suppose that there were no gods.

Seeing as they did not fight over 9 crusades for the land, of course they would not be ""sovereign"" rulers.

&gt;merely that Arabs wouldn't allow a sovereign Jewish state there.

Because a Jewish state was never meant to be established there.

* **'Unauthorized statements have been made to the effect that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Palestine. Phrases have been used such as that Palestine is to become ""as Jewish as England is English."" His Majesty's Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view.** They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded ""in Palestine."" In this connection it has been observed with satisfaction that at a meeting of the Zionist Congress, the supreme governing body of the Zionist Organization, held at Carlsbad  in September, 1921, a resolution was passed expressing as the official statement of Zionist aims ""the determination of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people on terms of unity and mutual respect, and together with them to make the common home into a flourishing community, the upbuilding of which may assure to each of its peoples an undisturbed national development""'.

&gt;This is similar to how French people might be tolerated to live as a minority in Algeria, but the rule of a foreign French minority over the Algerian majority was considered illegitimate.

So would be the rule of the foreign Jews over the Arabs. Are you actually using this as a talking point and implying it is not fair? The Arab population and land ownership was significantly more than the European Jews.

Not only that, the French were colonist and had no right or claims to Algeria, just like the Jews. 

&gt;but nowhere may they have equal footing to Muslims. 

This was untrue if you're claiming this was in the 1900s.

&gt;but the Muslims consider it an abrogation of the natural order and an affront against Allah for Jews to have sovereignty and rule over Muslim Arabs.

This is completely irrelevant, because you're making an attempt at turning this into a religious argument. 

&gt;Also, it was never mainstream among Zionists that only Jews could live in the Jewish state.

This is why Zionists not only sought ""Palestine"" but sought a state on both banks of the Jordan. Basically, they sought the whole British Mandate.

Oh yes, this is why Zionist militant groups like Irgun and Hagana did much of the ethnic cleansing in April. But the British Mandate did not end until May 14th and the war didn't begin until May 15th

* ""During May [1948] ideas about how to consolidate and give permanence to the Palestinian exile began to crystallize, and the destruction of villages was immediately perceived as a primary means of achieving this aim...[Even earlier,] On 10 April, Haganah units took Abu Shusha... The village was destroyed that night... Khulda was leveled by Jewish bulldozers on 20 April... Abu Zureiq was completely demolished... Al Mansi and An Naghnaghiya, to the southeast, were also leveled. . .By mid-1949, the majority of [the 350 depopulated Arab villages] were either completely or partly in ruins and uninhabitable."" Benny Morris, ""The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949.

* ""Before the end of the mandate and, therefore before any possible intervention by Arab states, the Jews, taking advantage of their superior military preparation and organization, had occupied...most of the Arab cities in Palestine before May 15, 1948. Tiberias was occupied on April 19, 1948, Haifa on April 22, Jaffa on April 28, the Arab quarters in the New City of Jerusalem on April 30, Beisan on May 8, Safad on May 10 and Acre on May 14, 1948...In contrast, the Palestine Arabs did not seize any of the territories reserved for the Jewish state under the partition resolution."" British author, Henry Cattan, ""Palestine, The Arabs and Israel.""

* ""Menahem Begin, the Leader of the Irgun, tells how 'in Jerusalem, as elsewhere, we were the first to pass from the defensive to the offensive...Arabs began to flee in terror...Hagana was carrying out successful attacks on other fronts, while all the Jewish forces proceeded to advance through Haifa like a knife through butter'...The Israelis now allege that the Palestine war began with the entry of the Arab armies into Palestine after 15 May 1948. But that was the second phase of the war; they overlook the massacres, expulsions and dispossessions which took place prior to that date and which necessitated Arab states' intervention."" Sami Hadawi, ""Bitter Harvest.""

Let me point out that **Menahem Begin**, the leader of a Zionist militant group was the sixth Prime Minister of the State of Israel.

&gt;Arab character who indicated that a significant proportion of the population of the Jewish entity would be Arab, and they would be full and equal citizens. That was always the mainstream of Zionist thought.

Your leaders disagree. 

* ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."" Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983. 


* ""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai.""

As you say, I don't know how we can go on if we can't secure our definitions. The only people i've ever debated who maintain that atheism is a belief, faith or a kind of religion in itself on a par with any kind of religion are the religious. Let's look at it in more detail:

Where is the formalised system and central teaching of atheism?
What are the tenets or core components of atheism?
What is there to believe about atheism when the term itself defines the lack of such belief?

Belief is the acceptance of the truth or actuality of anything without certain proof. Belief is a mental conviction. To believe is to accept something as true or real. It is to accept the truth, existence, value, worth, etc, of something. One of the primary meanings of ""to believe"" is to have religious faith. Religious faith is belief in the supernatural. 


The ""belief"" that Atheism should be classified as a belief is a view taken by religionists who cannot accept the simple absence of belief. The absence of belief is a benign, non-active status. There is no ""belief system"" involved. There is no ""system"" of Atheistic belief: no rituals, no practices, no rules, no set of doctrines or dogma. Yes, there are various philosophical opinions among people who can be described as Atheists, a conviction that there are no gods is not the primary characteristic. In it's elemental form, Atheism does not concern itself with gods.

Atheism is not a faith or an unquestioning belief that doesn't require proof. It is this aspect that the religious try and claim and persist in trying to bend the meaning of words so that it can be equated as some kind of belief system. If you can demonstrate coherently how this is so, I'm all ears.

I live my life without any gods in the equation, I don't consider them in anything I do, I don't deny them when acting, therefore it can't be a belief! I'm not denying the single set of definitions you posted, I just asked you to post more and get a broader take on what you are suggesting. I simply said I'm not able to find a definition like the one you posted in any of the dictionaries I own, that is certainly not a denial or a ignorance of your rebutal.

I'm motivated by religions' obvious poison to expunge it, not because I believe it is fake or that atheism is true. Whether it is fake or not, theism or atheism I'm concerned that humanity is doing itself a disservice by believing in a host of completely different myths that are divisive in nature and clearly they are not all true. I could be a Christian campaigning about the falsehoods of Islam because I'd be atheistic regards Allah-yet not wholly atheist but my motivations wouldn't be based on that, they would be in response to my Christian convictions and the fact that I believe it to be absolute truth. Every religious person is atheist, to every god except their own chosen one. The truth as I see it is the same as everyone else sees it, with or without religious instruction. I'm not pushing a form of truth on people I'm saying open your eyes to the reality of our surroundings and environment. Do you see any evidence of a god? As I've already said, to live in the world the same as all the other animals do. Is that not the truth? Are we all living in a computer simulation. Are we back to a solipsist view? I'm talking about universal truths that affect us all, god or no god, imagined or not. This is why I'm trying to say that my lack of a belief in any gods has no bearing on that, like the unicorns. So, talking of unicorns...

I don't see your point here. I haven't seen a pink unicorn. No one, to my knowledge (which is pretty vast these days with the aid of the internet to corroborate or verify claims such as this) has seen one either. It's not that I believe that they don't exists, same as atheism, the truth of the world is that they don't exist. Just like any other mythical or bizarre beast you care to conjure up in your mind. I don't want to get involved in the truth of parallel universes and the 'somewhere out there, it probably exists' I'm talking about what we face here as realities on our planet. Nothing metaphisical or supernatural, just observable, measurable 'truths' on our time and relative size scale. When you say that ""a pink unicorn did some such"" I'm already ignoring the rest of the claim since I know that such a thing doesn't exist. It's not a belief, it's a truth. I don't need to believe the sun will rise, it's a truth and no amount of belief will change that fact. That's what I'm getting at here! The rest of what you say validates my point about religion even further when you say about the person being harmed by such a belief. First you say I'm wrong, then you say it's understandable and then the right thing to do! How is that wrong from your position in the argument when you then agree with it? So is it right to remove the belief no matter how in error it is or not? I'm unable to determine your position here because it contradicts itself.

Again I refer back to my evidence that essentially atheistic countries, those who have total church and state separation and in fact in many cases where the churches are empty as in large swathes of Northern Europe don't have any increase in murders and the like. Are you saying the only thing preventing rape and murder is the faith in a supernatural debt owed to deity? This can clearly be demonstrated by those who have either abandoned their faith and have not committed such acts and I myself am testament to it since no god has ever been part of my life yet I have not committed anything remotely violent or morally abhorrent. You 'atheistic country of death and destruction' argument just doesn't hold water and for the reasons I already gave which you have not refuted, the Pol Pot and Stalin examples were cults of personality and not some kind of defined atheistic cultures. There were atheist by default definition only because religion formed no part of their structure, not that the structure was atheist in nature and I've already asked you to define that but not had a response. Again this was a retrospective label, not something they had printed on their money or written in their constitutions.

Of course people will find a reason to fight-competition for food and resources will always trump any religious battle but with so little examples of cultures and regions without religion for any significant amount of time, that's hard to quantify, let alone provide evidence for. We are in the midst of such a phase in humanity right now with the death of religion in large parts of Northern Europe. Let's come back in 1000 years and see what pans out. I have lived in a peaceful village for all of my life, never seen strife or trouble of any kind, not even mild civil unrest. Yes my country has been to war but separation of church and state has seen my country peaceful in terms of the situation on the ground for well over 500 years. You cannot say the same of countries where religion is high on the agenda like the Middle East.

Who said that Hindutva people want to divide India? It is not their goal at all. They are the one people who want to unify India. 

Here is the Honorable [Supreme Court](http://www.newsanalysisindia.com/supremcourt.htm), ruling on Hndutva:

&gt; The court [ruled that] the word ""Hindutva"" [is] to be ""used and understood as a synonym for Indianisation, i.e., development of a uniform culture by obliterating the differences between all the cultures co-existing in the country."" 

**development of uniform culture by obliterating differences**? Ring a bell? Let me remind you, Tagore 

"" This objective has been to **establish unity** among diversity ... stands as an ideal of the endeavour to **unify** the diverse.

They both strive to the same goals. To unify the culture of India. 

&gt; Tagore denounced nationalism, deeming it among humanity's greatest problems. 

Yeah, Nationalism of the European kind. The nationalism of RSS/Hindutva is nothing of the kind that Tagore was talking about. Nationalism as seen in 1910 Europe is comparable to what is called sub-nationalism in India, such as Sikh Nationalism or Marathi natiionnlism, or the Muslim Nationalism of Muslim League, and some parties even in present day India. These are the co-orelates of the **ethnic nationalism** that Tagore was talking about. RSS/Hindutva stands for inclusive membership.

About why some people find themselves in a contrasting difference with that ideology, which is jsut another word for Indian culture, is what Tagore was talking about. How our education will try to make up stories of Mughals and Pathans as the real India. 

Btw, why should I read Amartya Sen _on Tagore_, when I have his direct writings!

The principles underlying them are almost identical (and are quite different from European criminal law), and they share a common origin. The idea that the two are in any significant way alien to each other is just silly. In any case, the issues that the Supreme Court is deciding on are human rights one, which are common to both.

Moreover, the judges sitting in the Supreme Court are the very best there are, and the judgements they produce are very highly regarded indeed - much more so, indeed than those of our own High Court.

(In fact Cadder only arose because of a much-criticised decision by the High Court ignoring a clear determination by Europe that access to a lawyer when being questioned by the police was a fundamental right).

Having a central point of appeal for human rights cases is essential where the signatory to the convention is the UK. When devolution took place, all parties agreed that Scottish institutions would be directly bound by the ECHR, and that determination of the constitutionality of their actions would ultimately be determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (to which the Supreme Court is the successor). If Salmond didn't like it, then he had plenty of opportunity to object at the time. To change his mind as soon as the court acknowledges the human rights of people he doesn't like, is just a little bit sad (though not unexpected - people generally get more authoritarian and opposed to human rights the more power they get).

Point is, if Scotland is independent, then Salmond can abuse human rights all he wants, if that is what he wishes.

Heresy trials would have mostly left atheists untouched. For most of its history, at least, Inquisition wasn't about persecuting unbelief. It was about prosecuting deviations from doctrine. The Waldensians, for example, were investigated not because they didn't believe in Catholicism. Quite the opposite, in fact: they were subject to Inquisition because they attempted to push innovations to Catholic doctrine. They remained so tied to the claim of orthodoxy that they even held a council to debate who would be Pope when Waldensians managed to take control of the Church.

As far as I can tell, two things changed that. One was the reconquest of Spain. The Spanish crown set up its own Inquisition, often in conflict with the Papal Inquisition, and used their version of the Holy Office as a more blunt tool to ensure not only orthodoxy but also adherence. That is to say, they were interested not only in making sure that Catholics didn't introduce unorthodox innovations into doctrine, but more so in making sure that no part of the population relapsed into Judaism or Islam. The Spanish Inquisition was thus an adjunct to the 15th and early 16th century campaigns of forced conversion.

The second was the Protestant Revolution, which seems to have changed the nature of Inquisition outside of Spain as well. But remember that Europe didn't really have a terminology for describing atheists at the time, so any records of people persecuted for unbelief would likely have been couched in euphemistic terms. and even where charges of total unbelief were part of the record, they might just as well have indicated a wide range of non-atheist modes of dissent from Catholicism, like Protestantism, or pantheism.",0,1427205404,t3_hpkjc,1307028120,3,,0,False,True,blackstar9000,c1xdnll,t1_c1xdksr,False,t5_2qh2p

3 – GTFO when we close the bar. 
Once we stop serving customers, we don’t legally need to be paid even though we are still expected to work.

Less than three years ago, when the financial crisis exploded, the world economy slid to the edge of the abyss. The slide was arrested by an unprecedented global rescue, in which the International Monetary Fund played a vital role. We have now stepped back from the precipice but, should the world require another rescue, we must not forget that global collaboration requires trust among partners, with legitimate institutions at its core.

In recent years the IMF’s board has embarked on reforms to give a greater voice to emerging markets. With the world economy undergoing major shifts in relative wealth and financial flows, continued reform has become urgent. Countries as varied as Indonesia and South Africa, the Brics – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and my own country, Mexico, have proved to be reliable partners and they deserve to be treated as such. They have every right to expect that the selection process for the IMF’s next managing director will be transparent and based on merit, rather than a backroom deal among a clique of advanced economies to select, inevitably, by a vintage second world war agreement, a European.

Emerging markets have vast experience in policymaking that can benefit the global community. It was neither surprising nor an accident that most recovered from the crisis quickly and are now booming. This reflects their good economic policy, increasingly robust institutions and accumulated experience from managing previous crises. But to bring this experience to bear, emerging market countries must now embrace their new, more vital role and fully share responsibility for promoting broad-based prosperity in the new global economy.

If advanced economies refuse to accept change, and if emerging market countries turn away, the world risks sliding back towards that abyss. In our interconnected world, purely regional arrangements may support, but can never replace, a functioning IMF framework.

An effective IMF is an independent taskmaster. When it extends loans it does so on specific, negotiated terms, including corrective policies on the part of the borrower. It is, therefore, imperative that it be shielded from regional and national influence and not be captured by particular interests. Only an objective and apolitical IMF will retain its credibility to serve the international community as the platform of economic co-operation.

European countries should not overestimate the role of the IMF in solving their current sovereign debt crises. With its analytical firepower, the IMF can provide objective diagnosis, workable solutions and, when approved by its executive board, financial support. But from my own experiences in Mexico, as well as what I observed while serving on the IMF’s executive board and later as a deputy managing director, for each country the tough decisions are political and they need to be taken domestically. The IMF cannot make these political decisions for Europe, whether its managing director is European or not.

What the IMF can do is provide the capacity and credibility to avert crises and resolve them when they do occur. But for this it needs a legitimate governing structure that is also required to tackle the long-standing problem of global imbalances, deal with destabilising capital flows, follow through on financial sector reform and protect the poor from the effects of rising commodity prices. Only such a legitimate governance framework can form the basis to create jobs for the world’s growing population and guarantee that growth is inclusive and to the benefit of all.

For this reason it is crucial that the IMF’s next managing director be selected transparently and on the basis of ability and experience. The IMF’s 187 members all deserve a candidate who can lead the IMF as what it was originally intended to be: a fully global institution that addresses economic imbalances well before they send any country, or all of them, into another abyss.

I don't think however that this stems from a lack of general funds so much as where those funds are going. As I said earlier, we spend a ton of money per student - more than enough to supply them with a fine education. 

Unfortunately there is a large segment of the population, especially in poorer areas that doesn't seem to see the value in education. In fact often times children in these areas that do excel are looked down upon or teased. This creates a toxic environment where even if you want to succeed, its difficult. Combine that with our social safety nets (which aren't as extensive as Europe's, but still, enough) which offer no real penalties for not trying in school and you have a recipe for disaster.

1. acquire a sailboat. you don't have to be some storm-braving badass to just live on one. i've got friends that do and i've picked up enough to already survive on my own, and i'm going to informal sailboat school later this summer. you can cruise south to an awesome location and use your skills as a native-born english-speaking american (and female? you're good like 24""s in da hood) to pick up work here and there in touristy areas for spending cash. as long as you're cool with not having ritzy living conditions, this works. it's also an amazing life. you can float around, ignoring the world for as long as you want. the best part is that it's hard for those scamming student loan assholes to find you in belize. 

2. basically do the same thing on land in asia. you don't have to be coddled by your family, you can just wander around. there's some awesome communes in thailand and other places, and you can have fun until you feel like leaving, then make your way overland to india to rinse and repeat. if you require more money/security than that, teach english. pretty easy to land a gig like that there if i'm not being totally lied to about it. 

3. peace corp. go help people. if you're anything like me, you might have the nagging feeling you don't deserve the easy life. 

there's plenty of other options. go work for a few months for room and board at a ranch in mexico. that'll break the monotony. get a work visa to australia by getting a job on a ranch there, then get some cash and quit and be an illegal immigrant for a while until you get caught and deported. unfortunately with the whole being asian thing you'll need to keep your passport handy so you don't get dumped in thailand or indonesia. or get a job on a cruise ship. do the australia idea in a european country then use the trick in france of just leaving the borders before your visa expires then returning to get indefinite extensions. if you're super, super bored, make up a totally new life story and bounce around shacking up with hot european guys until you get tired of that life, then try another idea.

How much did they research into thorium power, and how much of a priority was it?  Did they invest a lot?

Importing uranium is irrelvant--its still going to be extremely cheap, and thus not create any market incentive to invest in future breeder reactors (which I contend is stupid, and a market failure).  [This](http://www.fissilematerials.org/ipfm/site_down/rr08.pdf) is a great paper on breeder reactors.  It concludes that breeders are a failure, but reading between the lines, I have found that a better conclusion is that breeders just weren't an urgent cause for governments to heavily invest into at the time.  I am still of the opinion that the 'failure' of breeders is a market failure due to low interest and low investment.

Re-processing is an interesting case.  It certainly has its problems, cost not being the least of them.  That's why nuclear engineers are devoting much more of their meager time and money to developing closed-fuel cycles, taking re-processing completely out of the picture.  Reactors like the [IFR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor) are great examples of promising projects that got cancelled due to unwarranted fear.    

....Steam engines?  I'm really confused at this argument.  You're saying that because steam engines are really old, nuclear power is really old?  That doesn't make any sense.  The main point of nuclear energy is to extract energy from fissioning, the steam turbines are going to be a minimal part of the research and development of nuclear technology.  And how can you say that nuclear technology has ""matured"" by the 1960s?  We barely knew what the hell was going on back then, and we've come INCREDIBLY far since, which is impressive when taking into account how hostile the political and economic atmosphere has been to nuclear since that time.  I hope you're not under the impression that our nuclear technology is still exactly the same as it was in the 60s.  (Also I'd like to add that we're still improving our steam turbine designs, there's still a ways to improve on that also).  

Wow, I'm not sure why you think I'm blaming thin-film PV for the climate mess.  I was blaming the mentality behind the disinterest in breeder reactors, as being the same as the disinterest in getting off fossil fuels.  It is clear that fossil fuels are fucking this planet, but its still not really written into the price (except in Europe).  Just like that, we know that uranium is eventually going to run out and we have a shit ton of waste to deal with, but hey, if its cheap, why think about breeder reactors now??  Its THAT kind of idiotic, purely economic thinking that is short-sighted, and is the cause of the lack of investment in both nuclear and renewables.

They were also quick to note the levels of civilization that these populations had created up until that point. From this they drew the conclusion that there was something which separated the European from other populations, other races. As time progressed European scientists became involved in categorizing the human species into distinct subgroups, or races, based on the belief that there was more to these observed differences than merely skin color and bone structure. This process continued up until world war 2 and ended soon afterwards when there was an agreement reached that human races did not exist and that every human being was equal to everyone else. This opinion has since been held as holy truth, even though the study of genetics at the time, late 1940s-early 1950s was at the same level as that being carried out by scientists all over Europe and America, which had concluded that there did exist mental and genetic differences between various populations that could also be distinguished by their physical characteristics.

 The way in which this field of study was shut down, only to be validated more and more as genetics studies became more advanced in later decades leads me to believe that the initial observations made by European explorers weren't too far off the mark. There was indeed something to the physical antropological studies done in the first half of the 20th century, even if the scientists didn't have access to modern technology and knowledge about genetics.

 It is quite possible and plausible that we as Europeans possess a unique and valuable genetical heritage that other races do not share. To engage in the mixing of our genetical heritage with theirs seems like a risky move to say the least. The jury might still be out on just how much we differ in terms of genetics and mental and other capabilities, but until the verdict is in, I'd say that the wisest policy would be to shun and outright ban any and all mongrelization between Europeans and non-Europeans.

**The following is translated from an article stating numbers and facts given by the police in their rapport on last year in Oslo:**

Out of 189 reported rapes in Oslo in 2010, non-western men were suspected in 65%. It is also thought than only 10% (older numbers show 6-12%) off all rapes are reported.

""The typical offender has non-western background, is in his 20ies. Some are 2generation immigrants, born and raised in Norway, while the rest are foreign citizens. 20% of suspected rapists have African background and are the biggest ethnic group beside Norwegians, 15% from the Middle East and 14,5% from Asia.""
By numbers of reported rapes to Oslo police 2010 with identification suspect/charged offender, show that men from the Middle East, Africa and Asia are strongly represented and significantly overrepresented when it comes to size of population. Of the police' 5 rape categories (ethnic Norwegian in () ):

*Party related rapes: 38,8% (32,7%)

*Relation rapes: 42% (40%)

*Vulnerable rape: 60,9% (34,1%) 

*Assault rapes: 100% (0)

*other: 54,6% (45,5%)

.

Acording to SSB from 1/1/2011 the group of immigrants and Norwegian born with immigrant background from Asia, Africa, Latin-America, Oceania (except Australia and New Zealand) Europa (except EU/EØS) 122 313 persons - 20,4% - of Oslo' population of 599 230 persons. 

Non-western men is behind all assault rapes in Oslo the last 3 years. And out of 21 victims of assault rapes in Oslo in 2009, 17 was Norwegian wommen with ethnic Norwegian look. 2008, 9 of 11 victims had ethnic Norwegian look. 

-------------------

As the numbers say only 10%ish of all rapes are told to the police. That's a scary as hell low number and a lot of rapes are going on with nothing done. That said, men with non-western background are overrepresented in rapes, especially when it comes to part of the population and when it comes to being behind 100% of all reported assault rapes the last 3 years. 

That said - the media blows it out of proportions. And that's my point. It makes non-western immigrants so much more stigmatized if you want to use that word.

1,0,t1_c1xeaml,Economics,,,"&gt;Of course America/West Europe will see hardly any of these price increases as usual. I can't recall if I saw this on Reddit or elsewhere, but something like around 70% of price swings to food commodities are taken by developing worlds, whereas mere fractions of a dollar are seen in final goods in places like America.


It really depends on the crop/commodity. 40% of rice is grown in South Asia, according to [this](http://beta.irri.org/news/images/stories/ricetoday/9-3/Map.pdf).

Therefore, there is enough supply from other regions to offset such large spikes in developed markets that generally tend to trade with a variety of countries across various regions of the globe. So if Thailand raises prices, India or Bangladesh may undercut them.

I don't blame the farmers though. The government's policy is wrong, but the farmers are struggling economically to keep up.

Rights are something we have, by virtue of being men, and they are inalienable. This viewpoint is shared by, and stated explicitly by, the Founders in the Declaration of Independence.

Okay, so I can follow your line of logic as long as you can clarify this. Who defines rights? I've always understood (and agree) that there are clearly inalienable rights, but how do we know exactly what they are? Because you say..

&gt;I disagree with this strongly; no organization, no society, grants men rights, and it's not an agreement

...so if rights are inherent, and aren't collectively agreed upon, then how do we ascertain what they are and even define them? For example, the EU classes healthcare as a human right, but while I would tend to disagree with this, how does one argue against it?

&gt;A government exists to protect the rights of its citizens, so an army isn't something that a society agrees to, it's something that the government is obligated to provide.

With regards to this, how can the government have an obligation to provide services when there is no obligation to provide funding? If one takes the view that taxation is immoral and that it should be a voluntary system of donations, then if no one donates, the government cannot fulfill its obligations. If that's the case, then doesn't the government only have the obligation to provide services to those who pay into them?

I'm thinking in particular of the somewhat recent incident where a fire department watched a home burn because the home owner didn't pay into the department's fund. This might be a bit of an aside, but do you agree with that?

&gt;Public roads have nothing to do with rights, they have to do with transportation and trade, which is why I don't agree with the government controlling or supporting them financially.

Fair enough. Do you believe, however, that the roads should be public property, and people should opt into paying to install roads? Or, do you think they should all be privately owned?

*HIS TEXT BEGINS AFTER THIS*



So, i'm currently in the 2100 Elo area on the EU servers, i feel that i belong in that Elo area, might belong a bit higher, but overall i'm mostly comfortable
I haven't played a single duo-queue game since the ~1600 Elo Area as i feel that playing Duo is like throwing rocks at MM, which obviously makes MM go mad and throw you in with people you don't enjoy playing with (Personal opinion, just feel like it, i have no certain proof of it).

Phreak: incase you're reading this, Hi, i'm the guy who sat next to you during the Quake Live match during the CeBit just before the LoL events started, my brother asked you in german to let us through.
I wanted to shake your hand and say ""hi"" after the match but you left rather quickly ;&lt;

I thought i'd write down what i think about certain things and give some kind of feedback to Riot. I'm quite sure Riot is talking to high-elo players and already has alot of feedback, but this ain't gonna hurt and i had some time on my hands.

P.S. after writing this i noticed that i use ""MS"" for both, Mortal Strike and Movement Speed.


Items:

5g/10s
I got the feeling that 5g/10s items are too powerful on supporters, especially Heart of Gold. It gives them rather cheap survivability and gold income, getting one 5g/10s item will give you 1,2 wards per 1 ward time (1 ward holds 180 seconds(3minutes) -&gt; you get 0,5g per second, 180x0,5 -&gt; 90g, a ward costs 75g)

Tiamat:
only for ""fun"" purposes for aslong as i remember.

Wit's End:
Loved the old Wit's End if i had it and played against mana champions, hated it when i was a low-mana champion. The rework worked out quite well, though i usually see each and a single ""Tanky-DPS'er"" packing it.
Overall the reworked Wit's feels quite strong as it gives you a total of 50MR, 40% AS and a +42 magic dmg proc on attack for a mere 2150 gold, a BF Sword currently costs 1650g and gives you 45 AD for it, the 40% AS are exactly a recurve bow for 1050, 50 magic resist are more than what a Negatron for 740g gives, so that's pretty much (1650~+740~+1050) - 3440g packed into 2150g, admitted, the damage is magic and might not benefit from ARPen. Yet, this item scales incredibly well with itself as it gives you attackspeed (which increases the number of attacks whom get +42 damage and the speed of stacking)

Nashor's Tooth/Stinger:
I haven't seen those 2 items, ever.

Innervating Locket:
Please, never bring it back


Haunting Guise:
Just like brutalizer, it doesn't scale into lategame
I've seen a few AP carries rush Sorc boots and Haunting Guise combined with massive AP runes run rampabe, but overall, Haunting Guise is rarely ever used, probably due to it's high cost. Yoomus Rage Guise maybe?

Executioneers Calling:
The only way to get a MS effect on your team if you have no champion with it (apart from Ignite)
Maybe might wanna add an AP item with the same effect?




Champions:

Alistar:
I've actually played AP Alistar before his rework and it was quite satisfacting. Once the rework was announced, i knew a nerf would have to hit him as his old 1. AP ratios + lower CD's, new passive with 0.2 AP ratio would be too strong, especially since Headbutt doesn't decide to not work once someone has over 380ms.
After his nerf, he's a quite valid choice and i think that he's quite balanced.

Amumu:
(In my opinion(i do play Amumu) he's quite fine, just a few things bug me)
Bandage Toss has a MASSIVE cooldown at early levels, even if you initiate a gank infront of your own turret and run all the way back to the hostile turret (without boots) Toss won't be ready again, it's stun duration isn't too long nor is the damage incredibly high for it beeing a skillshot, given the range is quite high.
Tantrums Mana-Damage value just doesn't add up. If i wouldn't need it for my jungle early on, i wouldn't bother putting a single point in it, especially since it forces me to stop for a moment to cast it and has a rather insignificant range.
Curse of the Sad Mummy: feared by everyone, except Jarvan because his E+Q doesn't count as blink/movement, so beeing snared doesn't matter for him as he can just throw his flag, impale it and he's freed from the snare, i don't see any reason why 1 Champion should have an ability that lets him move while beeing snared (Olaf's is an ultimate, that's fine)

Anivia:
Probably one of the most annoying champions to lane against, she has a passive GA, can throw a Stun/Slow, wall you off and has 2x 1 AP abilities, her ultimate giving her an easy farm and a slow.
Laning against her is hell, chances to kill her are pretty **** low. Especially if she has teleport and uses it right before she morphs into her egg so she'll be teleporting as an egg (if this is still possible, haven't seent his in ages)
Yet, i rarely see her played, haven't played her myself, so that's all i can say about her

Annie:
The buff elevated her to the level of the other AP's, if not above
Sometimes, when aiming Tibbers DIRECTLY on a champion, they take no damage/aren't stunned, is this a bug, lagg or am i just bad?
Her Burst @ lvl 6~9 might be a bit over the top right now as she can easily take 80~90% of another casters HP with QWR+Ignite (but well, who can't?)

Ashe:
Well, Ashe
nerf her size
she's having backpain.

Caitlynn:
Incredible laner with her Q, maximum safety due to her 3 Traps and her ""pushback"" + slow
Performs incredibly well during early but drops quite fast in late, her ultimate is quite easy to block, i think it might make things more intresting if the ""line"" from her to her target would be removed so that taking the bullet would become a bit less unchallenging

Brand:
his range feels quite high and his ultimate depends on a lot of luck, i've seen Brands ult a champion, the Fireball bounces off on a creep, never to be seen again and i've seen Brands ultimate and hit the same 2 targets repeteadly, resulting in MASSIVE damage, i as Annie made the mistake of staying very close to him and my tibbers, resulting in me getting blasted for 670~ damage @ lvl 6 from Pyroclasm.

Cassiopeia:
played her for a week maybe, felt intresting to play but not satisfying as the amount of work you have to put into her does not pay off, not even slightly. She just completely underperforms compared to other AP's.

Mundo:
either goes where he pleases or dies trying, MS totally kills him (Captain Obvious)

Evelynn:
Well, Stealth+Stun, her Q giving her each possible Sheen/TF proc, an ult that increases her MS+AS and restores health on Kill/Assist, I'm quite sure Riot is aware of the problems with her and they're working on a stealth rework(as Morello said quite often?)

doesn't seem to have any mana cost on his poision trail, most Singeds turn it on once and never again turn it off, he's just annoying, nothing else.

Sona: 
underperforms compared to other supporters and is, without question, the most boring to play.

Soraka:
The choice for sustained harass laning, she can just Heal people, give them an armor boost in the process and restore her own and a mates mana while beeing able to global-heal people, netting her easy assists.
Soraka pressing R in the right moment can give her quite a few assists and easy gold which is kind of an advantage over other supporters.

Swain:
has no mana problems at all, a quite nice damage output and ocne he reaches level 6 he's nearly unkillable.
Trying to kill him near a creepwave is a real task as once his ultimate pops, he's receiving a huge amount of health while losing barely any mana thanks to his passive, i'd love to see some kind of nerf on his healing through creeps, kind of like Irelia

Teemo:
never seen, mostly just annoying.
Please, set a maximum amount of Shrooms or atleast remove the slow from them. So. Annoying.
I usually don't rage much but shrooms make me punch holes in my wall.

Tristana:
the carry with probably the best escape ability, incredibly underplayed/undervalued

Trundle:
haven't seen a single non-troll

Tryndamere:
incredibly strong if he gets farm, which he doesn't against good players.

Twitch:
Stealth rework, awesome CJ, very undervalued in Soloqueue

Udyr:
Udyr looks rather boring to play and he's either dominating or failing, i haven't seen a middle-ground udyr yet
his Tiger stance burst feels too strong, there doesn't seem to be any kind of decision making when it comes to stance choice

Urgot:
getting hit by E is probably one of the most punishing things right now, usually you lose about 60% of your health once hit by an E and the following 2-3 Q's
can't really say much else about him as i rarely see him

Vayne:
very punishing laning.
i'm mostly fine with her apart from her 80% stealth uptime once she has her ult on lvl 3 and her MASSIVE damage from W as you can't counter it, % True damage of max HP? stacking HP makes her deal more damage, getting Armor/MR is useless. She just eats tanks

Veigar:
scales very good into late, doesn't match the current AP Casters

Vladimir:
Speedboost should be removed
once he has his Hextech revolver, using E isn't a ""oh i might lose some Hp but i'll deal more damage"" choice but rather a ""Push E, deal damage, get health"" choice, feels pretty wrong

Warwick:
Junglewick is fine
Lanewick, holy ****.
Stopping a WW from laning is very. very. hard, he has massive amounts of liferegain and his ultimate is quite a pain too
I dislike him beeing able to simply press R and get an insta ultimate off. There's no casting animation, no gap closing, nothing. I'd like to see some kind of animation for his ultimate, even if it's just 0,5 seconds

Zilean:
very annoying with his massive Speedboost/slow and revive ultimate, apart from that, rather useless

I hope my opinion is some kind of help and please, remove the 20 ""The servers are about to shutdown"" warnings on the EU client, i don't need to read it in Englsh, French, German and Polish.

1,0,t1_c1xecsa,atheism,,,"&gt;As you say, I don't know how we can go on if we can't secure our definitions. The only people i've ever debated who maintain that atheism is a belief, faith or a kind of religion in itself on a par with any kind of religion are the religious. Let's look at it in more detail:

Here maybe this will help:

be·lief   
–noun
1.something believed;  an opinion or conviction.

2.confidence in the truth or existence of something not immediately susceptible to rigorous proof.

3.confidence; faith; trust.

(Please bear in mind that all of the above apply to the word, you can not just pick and choice what suits you best.)
I am not twisting anything, You are twisting it. Belief means all of the above. Atheism is a belief. There primary tents are that there is No God, it is a disbelief in God. Now if you look at 1. You see that something that is believed? You Believe there is no God. Your opinion is there is no God. You are Confident in the truth that there is no God. 

a·the·ism   

–noun

1.the doctrine or belief that there is no god.

2.disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings.

&gt;What are the tenets or core components of atheism? 

You ask what is the foundation of Atheism, well A belief that there is no God. It is absolutely required to be an Atheist that you do not believe in a God. This qualifies as a core component of Atheism. 


&gt;The ""belief"" that Atheism should be classified as a belief is a view taken by religionists who cannot accept the simple absence of belief.

It is a view taken from the very book that allows two people to communicate. The Dictionary, which is the very bed rock for the meaning of words to allow for communication. The Dictionary defines Atheism as a ""belief"" and therefore requires no twisting of anything in order for it to be defined as a belief structure. I do not see a need to argue this point, when I have repeatedly posted the very definition of the words. You accuse me of being religious, and accuse me to twisting words, when you can read the very definition of the words and plainly see that it is you who are twisting the words. Not I. 


I can sum up this so called contradiction you claim there is. 
There is no contradiction. As I have stated many times. It is Okay to attempt to correct beliefs that are incorrect, **ONLY** if doing so will not cause any **harm** to the person. What is there not to understand about this. If a person believes in pink unicorns than yes tell them it is untrue, if a person believes in pink unicorns and it keeps them from eating a bullet, or having a mental break down than LEAVE them the hell alone. Let them have there belief. There is no contradiction. It all sums up to **Do No Harm**

In an attempt to be more plain on my point. It is not religion that is the issue. It is people who feel like they can come in and tell others how too live there life. It is the disdain people like you tend to have for people who think differently than you do that is the issue. There is nothing wrong in the fact that you are an Atheist, it is that you think you are right, and seek to impose your will on others, irregardless of the harm you could potentially do. You live in a fantasy world no different than Christians and other religions who refuse to look at what there beliefs has caused. You try to apply labels while not allowing yourself to be labeled. This is called a double Standard. You attempt to twist the very meaning of words in order to avoid accepting responsibility for your ideas, and convictions, or to better prove a point. Which to me seems somewhat tactless and delusional. You refuse to look at history and see evidence that supports contradictions to you beliefs, much like Christians do. It is an attempt not to justify your belief in Atheism, or there attempt to justify there belief in God, it is nothing more than an attempt to justify there intolerance of others, and make themselves feel better about the harm they may have caused others in the process of attempting to ram there own personal beliefs down another persons throat. 

&gt;There were atheist by default definition only because religion formed no part of their structure, not that the structure was atheist in nature and I've already asked you to define that but not had a response.

Umm.. They did not believe in a God (The very definition of Atheist), or any religion, and then actively sought out and murdered anyone who was religious because it was against the LAW. (This is a law against religion that carried a punishment of Death) So I am not sure how you can twist it to think that they where not Atheistic Governments in there design. It was not formed by the religious, it was formed by applying the word which most fit to the situation, and construct of said Government.
The Definition of a Government that is not religious by Nature, but allows for free thinking is a Secular Government. Which the Governments I have listed certainly where not. They where Atheistic Governments which persecuted the religious committing evil acts against humanity for no other reason than to force there beliefs on others, it just so happened one of those beliefs was Atheism. 

&gt;We are in the midst of such a phase in humanity right now with the death of religion in large parts of Northern Europe.

But not made outlawed, and people are allowed to chose for themselves. That is the big difference here. What you have proposed is to remove the choice, and abolish religion. To do so would see blood shed. It is the cost of taking away a persons choice to choose for themselves.  The Churches are still open, and you are allowed to enter into them with out fear, or retribution, giving people the ability to choose for themselves. 

&gt;separation of church and state 

This is not the same thing an Atheistic Government. I support the separation of church and state whole heartedly. The reason why is that it is neutral in the matter of personal belief. It is tolerant of both religious and Atheist. How do you even confuse separation of church and state with Atheism. If you want to praise the glories of your village than it is apparent to me that you should praise the idea of tolerance, and understanding, and a live and let live approach. Forcing  the removal of religion, or establishing a religion is the issue here. And to think otherwise is to live in a fantasy world. 


I personally think you are confused, I think you confuse a Secular Government for an Atheistic Government. 
If you read you will see that 2. and 4. Mostly not concerned with religion. To not be concerned would be to the point of neutral, does not care. In a Government system this is good, as it does not concern itself with religion and leaves it up to the individual to decide for them selves. It is neither Atheist of Religious.

The best way to find a place to rent over there is to actually visit the neighborhoods and walk around - signs on the windows will tell you whom to call to make an appointment. You can also try immoweb.be or similar real estate sites, but watch out for scams (if it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't).

Regarding the languages: don't worry about it. Those that tend to speak that many languages are fairly uncommon (although most Flemish do indeed speak 3/4 languages), and their percentage is definitely peaking around the European areas. 
Most jobs in Brussels do require a semi-fluent knowledge of French (to speak with the locals) and English. Keep in mind that experience is extremely important in here.

Regarding the long distance: doubt it. You might be getting away with a telephone/video interview, but that's only if you're looking at high-profile jobs. If you're looking for some part-time working in a pub, you might want to have a look at Place Luxembourg near the European institutions.

Some more random tips: get an MIVB subscription (bus/subway/tram) for about 150 Euro/year, there's an active nightlife near the ULB/VUB campus, but you might want to visit Place Luxembourg or Chatelain (esp. during the summer). Internet and mobile phones are expensive, so are cabs, there are only a few busrides after midnight (Noctis), trains are cheap but suffer from delays, ATMs are not that common. Food is relatively cheap, and in general high quality. Belgian people are rather cold at initial contact, but that goes away quickly.

They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving the other essential chemicals in the coffee beans. The process is repeated anywhere from 8 to 12 times until it meets either the international standard of having removed 97% of the caffeine in the beans or the EU standard of having the beans 99.9% caffeine-free by mass.

I've smoked them in other countries (in Europe) where I can buy them for a reasonable price and they're definitely good - no better than Montecristo or Partagas though.  In fact, I bought a Cohiba Robusto in Paris and it was almost completely plugged, couldn't get a draw on it at all.  Didn't seem to be a storage issue as the store had a pretty nice humidor.  They exchanged it and the second was good... but I actually prefer the Montecristo Edmundo or Open Eagle, or the Partagas D4 and P2.

One of the best cigars I remember having was a Cohiba Siglo IV (best because it had great taste and no bad qualities all the way through), but it was not so good as to be worth the $40+ I have to pay for them here in Canada.  I've had a so-so Siglo IV, too.

If I ever travel to Cuba (or perhaps next time I'm in Europe) I'll consider picking up a box of Siglo IVs, but the only reason for picking that over Montecristo would be the enjoyment of having something that's usually too overpriced to smoke here.  Not because the smoke is necessarily better.

Syria killed more Palestinians in one week than Israel killed in 30 years. The Nazis killed more in one weekend at Babi Yar. You are seriously equating a few thousand deaths with 6 million. You equate refugees due to war with a deliberate attempt at extermination. Calling the Nazis ""mobs chasing people out of their houses"" pretty much makes you a Holocaust denier.

Quite frankly, and I hope you don't get me wrong, but I'd like to think passers-by don't particularly care what you believe or don't believe in. There's absolutely no malice in this involved. I can only speak for myself when I say I certainly don't. This applies as much to a cross as it does to a hijab.

If your reason for wearing a hijab is for self-identification then you really are proving wazoox's point. 

Once again drawing from personal experience, I grew up learning how to pay homage to my ancestry by honouring certain religious festivals every year, which means good food and the company of my family and none of the theological baggage. I'm not trying to say this is the best or the only way to grow up but I'm rather trying to invoke the elements of a heritage which really do mean something to you as a person of a certain origin as opposed to those that don't.

That my ancestors believed that a Galilean actually walked on water and turned fish into fishsticks and christ knows what else does nothing to shape me as a person. That my ancestors shared a moment of intimacy with their families every year with particular kinds of food, and that this day of the year is passed down from father to son along a long and traceable lineage is much more meaningful to me regardless of the theological origins.

The numbers are similar in both France and Germany.

Wilders wants ethnic Dutch and Ethnic immigrants to the Netherlands to be registered with the government.  This should raise some red flags amongst more rational thinkers, as there is *literally no reason* that could justify requiring non-white Dutch and non-white Dutch immigrants to be placed in a national registry.  

The eradication of Islam as foreign policy goal #1.  Not foreign aid, humanitarian aid/disaster relief, poverty reduction, etc.  Eradicating Islam.  I'm all for limiting the influence of religion as much as possible everywhere in the world, but if I had to choose between spending money on relief efforts or spending money stamping out a belief, I'd put the money where it would have more effect.

Constitutional protections of 'Judeo-Christian' culture.  Really?  Is any atheist here going to step up and vocalize their support of this particular stance?

This will strengthen your resume but will also give you the chance to do Research Experiences for Undergrads (REUs). These are basically paid research internships abroad. I managed to get NSF sponsored REUs in Sao Paulo and Paris. Here's a list of [NSF sponsored international REUs](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.cfm?unitid=10003).

If your parents can afford to send you abroad then you can just have them pay for a study abroad trip. Otherwise, getting a paid internship is your best bet.

Food, energy, and commodities become more expensive. An increase in the cost of production means an increase in the price of goods.

Under Scots Law (see the Scotland Act), the final determination of whether devolved bodies have acted in accordance with human rights law (and hence whether they have acted lawfully), is with the Supreme Court (and previously the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council).

One of the great flaws of the European Court of Human Rights is that it has no means of enforcing its judgement, which means that tabloid chasing politicians, such as David Cameron and his buddy Alex Salmond, can ignore human rights violations when it is electorally favourable for them to do so. The devolution settlement deliberately created a stronger protection of human rights in Scotland, something which many Scottish politicians (including Salmond) welcomed at the time. It is that protection of the human rights of Scotland's citizens that the SNP is trying to do away with. And which the Supreme Court is, thankfully, protecting.

1,0,t1_c1xf8le,TwoXChromosomes,,,"&gt;There is no problem if you prefer light skinned women.

So is there likewise no problem if *many* (or most) people find quality X attractive, and quality not-X unattractive?

If it then seems that there is a cultural preference for X, is that not the aggregate of many individual preferences?

&gt;The primary issue in this clip is that a dark skinned woman is not only thought of as less attractive, it's that she is seen as less of a person.

But isn't this true of *everyone* perceived as unattractive, whether it's because of skin color, blemishes, weight/figure, facial structure, teeth, intelligence, etc.? People who are attractive tend to have others gravitate to and admire them, while those who are unattractive (at a personal, subjective level) are ignored or overtly rejected.

&gt;Altogether inferior because of her skin color.

Skin color is an easily identifiable factor by which people can be grouped as a class. But aren't the obese similarly viewed as inferior/undesirable; or those with other certain combinations of features: for example, gingers, fetishized by some, but considered repulsive by others (especially ginger men, a group I belong to). 

My point is not that the treatment of dark-skinned women is not lamentable, or that it is not likely worse as a subjective experience, especially in first-world nations, than for most other identifiable groups: dark women indeed seem to fall to the bottom of the social pecking order. But it's that it's not simply ""colorism"", but ""lookism"" at large that is at work here, and that other groups experience similar social judgement and rejection based on factors they similarly cannot control.

There are in fact [some dark-skinned models](http://showstudio.com/blog/28518) [NSFW link] who would easily, by many people from disparate cultures around the world, be considered far more attractive than a dowdy, squat white woman from Northern or Eastern Europe. White skin isn't an instant beauty pass, and dark isn't necessarily a barrier to entry. So it's my belief that the negative treatment being directed towards dark girls, as described in the video, is not unique because many other people who are less attractive than average experience similar (again, perhaps not as harshly) social rejection. It's not simply that dark girls are (considered) inferior; but unattractive (edit: again, by that subjective, individualized perception that you above stated is ""no problem"") people in general.

The other big player is the U.S.'s oil reserves and Russia. B.P. already proved that the U.S. population won't stand for anymore drilling on US soil and Russia's foreign policy is essentially doing whatever is bad for the U.S. The RealPolitik of the situation rejects the Utopian notion that the U.S. can simply pull out of the world and expect everything to fine. Europe's a big enough powder keg alone to warrant a large chunk of our military action.

There's two crucial issues in the debate - economics and culture - both are viewed differently according to class.

For the middle class their understanding is global. Their perspective is international, both for their career and pleasure. They assume they will need to move across borders if needed for both work and holidays. They aspire to living and working abroad. Politically they believe in global trade or global aid. They maybe members of the international jet set. Depending on their level they already are competing on a global level.

The opening of labour markets to Eastern Europe has meant cheap plumbers, shop assistants and other services. All culture is as fascinating as an ancient trinket in a museum or an exotic unpronounceable listing on a menu. Religion is nonsense so can't be taken seriously. They don't consider themselves as having anything as gauche as a ""nationality,"" they are internationalists. If they want multicultural area they move to get it. If they don't like it they move to a mono culture.  For them culture is a cross between a supermarket and a museum.

The ~~working class~~ underclass is selling their labour or living off the state, remember most poor people work. They are competing for temporary unskilled work. Often living in a former industrial area which has never recovered. They don't think about moving, their plans for ""getting out"" have not worked. Most people do not ""get out"" of the area and some come back. They are fighting for the menial jobs that the middle class look down on. They feel they are in a zero sum game with foreign labour.

Everyone has a sense of belonging. If people are under pressure and feeling alienated they will hold on to that identity even stronger what else do they have to hold on to? They don't have the choice about moving away from immigrants or even the choice to move to the ones they like. They live far closer to the poor of different ethnicities than the middle class and so they'll know the cultural differences of religion, education, drink, food and sex habits.

These two models are simplistic but its the context of why middle class white people might be less likely to be in the EDL.

Are the EDL racist? Sure. But where does racism come from? I suspect most from fear, both economic and cultural. Are we happy to tell a white family who move out of a predominantly Islamic area not to be so racist? Should we be forcing refugees to disperse around the country? In practice racism is not a scientific enterprise carried out with portable gene testing kits. Its a gut thing carried out by sight and sound.

Claiming the UK is a mongrel nation is both technically wrong and irrelevant. As if racism of any kind could be justified on genetic grounds. Cultures exist and races exist, even English cultures exist. Its still not the grounds for racism. 

The traditional answers to mass immigration were trade union rights, labour laws and wage control from the Left. From the Right they believed in very controlled immigration and a high degree of assimilation through cultural norms. But both sides have dropped these beliefs. The Left has embraced freer markets and dropped calls for labour rights and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking cultural norms. The Right has dropped culture and borders and is in favour of global markets and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking the welfare state. Why would people of different cultures agree to pay for the other?

I'm not saying I have answers to these difficult questions but I do look to Reddit for more thoughtful analysis of a difficult topic. I hope we can try to understand why someone might join the EDL rather than do some circlejerk reaction of saying ""ITS THE DAILY MAIL WOT DONE IT""

**tl;dr** Its complicated and answers aren't easy.

This expectation comes from a number of places: our memberships to the UN and NATO, but also within the country itself.  Canada provided a lot of support in the recent mission in Haiti.  A military base in Jamaca, for instance, would have eased the logistical head aches encountered when moving supplies and pers into the country.  A more formal base in the EU or Africa would have also helped and played a key role in our operations happening in Libya. 

We Canadians have the expectation that Canada will provide support to the international community- whether it is in armed conflict (Afghanistan and Libya) or humanitarian (Haiti, Pakistan, Sri Lanka).  Had the Government of Canada not responded in these cases there would be a huge outcry from not only the international community, but here in Canada.

Any future base outside of Canada could play a significant role in the execution of any international tasking the CF or Government of Canada takes on.  It could also act as a means of supporting our allies in the conduct of their own tasks throughout the world.

It is not a choice between Healthcare *or* military spending.  Healthcare is chiefly a provincial concern (in delivery and administration).  The burden of additional bases would be taken on by the Federal Government (which has vowed to maintain healthcare payments to the provinces) and the Department of National Defense through its budget.

As for Wilders I get the feeling that he and the many similar parties that have sprung up around Europe are disguising their dislike of immigrants from non-European / Middle Eastern countries as purely a criticism of their religion. 

The problem is that religion is so ingrained in our various cultures that it sometimes becomes a problem discerning the difference between the two. Of course immigrants have to adhere to the same laws as all other residents in their new country but they should be free to express their own cultural peculiarities and thus contribute to the culture of their new country. Of course they should be encouraged to integrate in their new country but to assimilate completely into a new cultural mold as many parties on the extreme right are proposing is in my mind counter-productive.

0,0,t1_c1xftlu,india,,,"&gt;classic debating patterns of religious fanatics

Did I give you an impression that I was religious? Well you'll need more conclusive evidence.

&gt;links to verses claiming that all men and women have equal rights and should be treated equally would have helped here..but then again.

Well, I don't think quoting Hindu scripture is the right way to go about it for the following two reasons:

1) Exclamations of equality often do not translate to practice. For example the Sermon on the Mount in Christian scripture clearly exhorts a pacifist outlook on life but Christianity from the time of the inquisition has been extremely violent against it's own believers as well as the minorities in their locale. 

2) Hindu scripture is not some monolithinc entity defined by a single text but a collection of varied belief systems from which you decide what to follow.

Let us look at the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata as two texts which are sufficiently far apart in time.

The Rig Veda has a number of it's shlokas written(composed) by women. It is explicitly stated that women have the right to the choice of husband and the husband must acquiesce any sexual demands made by the wife. There are many other more explicit examples but I feel these sufficiently address the highly superficial argument we are having. 

Next, lets look at the Mahabharata. The text is replete with strong women who influence the fate of Bharat as much as the men. Let us look at one example of 'defiance'. When Draupadi is called before the assembly of the Kauravas, she refuses to come because she states that if Yudhistir lost her after he lost himself then he does not have any right over her. That she is forcibly brought before the assembly in a state of undress(due to her periods) and humiliated *and* that humiliation is repeated often as criticism against the Kauravas and their destruction is partly retribution for that act.  

Now let us understand a few more issues- The Mahabharata is NOT a religious text. It has literary and historic value but not religious. Next let us also understand that the freedom/equality of women of the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata are not the same. If we are to look at the position of women in India from the Rig Veda to the present day we find a dramatic decline but what is more interesting is that even in the Ramayana and Mahabharata the position of women has declined. Of course this is purely a intra-civilizational  analysis. Compared to the other cultures the Ramayana and Mahabharata exemplify respect for women. Which brings me to my next point: what exactly led to this decline? This is a very difficult question to answer since the chronology of the Mahabharata is disputed. But obviously accurate speculations can be made. For that a firm grasp on history is required(and patience). 

&gt;Can you give me a reason why we should have a varna system AT ALL.

This is a fair question. But this is also an ignorant question. The answer lies in exactly *why* this question is ignorant. Varna means quality. Varna is not an imposition but a description. Of what? It is a description of the form human society takes naturally. Let us look at society today(in order of importance): men involved with economics, men involved with war, men involved with academia, men involved with the 'baser' logistics of civic life. In other words Vaishya, Kshatriya, Brahmin and Shudra. Civil society, human society organizes itself into a similar combination in it's natural state. But what should be regulated in the importance of each varna or quality. I am sure it is obvious that Vaishya(materialism) and Kshatriya(aggression) should not have social sanction as the epitome of human existence. Which leaves us with Brahmin and Shudra. If you ask the communists they will say the Shudra should be on top since they are the actual producers. Fair point. Unfortunately for the communists, human biology has different plans because we should not forget that we are apes and as apes we have to have hierarchy. Why?- is an extremely interesting debate but alas outside the scope of our present disagreements. 

Now you next question is whether I am insinuating that 'caste' as I have described above has always existed in this form- as a quality as opposed to imposition. The answer is yes and no. You have to understand Indian history to understand sociological changes within Hindu culture. 

Let us look at the Manusmriti. In the Manusmriti there is great importance ascribed to the Brahmins to the determent of the Shudhras. Does this text begin to show the hardening of caste? The answer again is yes and no. The things we must understand about the Manusmriti is that it is a text written during the Scythian invasions. Scythians are hunnic people, a race of barbarians. The downfall of the Maurya kingdoms led to their successful domination over North Western India. What is important to understand is that the Manusmriti is also a peace offering to the Kshatriyas by the Brahmins. In order to preserve social order, this alliance was considered necessary by the author. Furthermore another important(reoccurring) aspect of the Brahmin community reveals itself: self preservation through isolation. This quality manifests itself whenever external duress overpowers the Kshatriyas- another example is during the medieval period when the Arab, Turkic and Tartar hordes decimated Indian society and polity. 

So in conclusion, we find the self hardening of the Brahmin community, whether from the points I make or from additional circumstances which need further study. The remaining castes mingled freely. An important case is that of the British country wide census in the late 20th century. British surveys indicate that before the census, intermingling of caste took place between 60-70% of the population(from Dharampal's collection of British correspondence I think). After the census however, caste lines hardened for the next 50-70 years *in the fashion of British(European) understanding of their supremacy based on a corrupted understanding of the varna system*. This is a much longer topic and requires pages and pages of European perspective and their destructive(for us) search for their historic identity.

&gt;I noticed that you conveniently ignored my example of sati and why we shouldn't defend it based on Indian culture

No. My desire to make the world better is not strictly limited to self benefit.

Nope! I have read the Qu'ran and the Hadiths for myself, I own them both as books. I will first concede that you are right, I mispoke about the Qu'ran and stoning- this actually comes from Sharia law, and is in the Hadiths where Muhammed has women stoned several times. However the Qu'ran *does* mention that if a woman commits adultery and four witnesses testify, you are to keep her at home until her death (from whatever regulation is imposed on her).

&gt;Not True (in regards to the Qu'ran beating your wife should she become high handed with you). 

Totally true. Qu'ran 4:34 ""if you fear high-handedness from your wives remind them [of the teachings of god] then ignore them when you go to bed, then **hit them**."" 

That verse has a lot of controversy around it, it can be translated as ""to strike"" as well, but the context is pretty clear. Prominent Muslim scholar Abdel Maheem interprets this as ""a single slap"", which is still *hitting your wife*. It's right there in the Qu'ran. 

&gt;You are not supposed to HAVE SEX with your wife when she's on her period because it is potentially harmful to her.

First of all, this is just not true at all. It is perfectly safe to have sex with a woman on her period, the only danger is if one of you has an STD it could potentially be easier to transfer it. But she's your wife, right? And if she has an STD suddenly... better get out the stoning rock. 

The Qu'ran says to ""keep away from women during their periods"", which can be interpreted to mean don't have sex with them or just don't get near them, but the context is sexual. Allah calls this natural biological function ""a pollution"".

&gt;""you may marry multiple women"" - This was meant mainly for wartime when there were very few men and many women so that the society can live on and the women can all be supported

Really? Prove it, and while you're at it, explain why so many Muslims in the Islamic world and even in Europe continue to practice polygamy? Is it because Islam has been at war with the entire world since it's inception, is this a 1400 year ""wartime"" where this is permissible?

&gt;THAT'S the propaganda I was mentioning. I would not lie to you, but I am middle-eastern and have high standards of truth for what I say. Western media is controlled completely by the government, and they definitely have reason to spread propaganda, considering the military campaign known as the war on 'terror' that is a collection of wars with middle-eastern countries.

Shows how little you know about Western media. It is controlled by corporations, not by the government. It is HIGHLY critical of western governments, as a rule (depending on the station). I get my news outside of western media as it is, and this abuse of women is **not** propaganda. 

As for your claims about women in Afganistan and Pakistan (specifically places like Waziristan), you are just plain wrong... it is not propaganda, it is true. I guess we just have a difference of opinion here. As for Saudi Arabia it IS a theocracy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy) and who gives a shit if women get their own private chauffeur, so do children, it's called their parents. This is clearly a subservient, lesser role to males. What if they want to drive? They are not allowed to because they are not equal to males.  

&gt;I don't know about Iran, but either way they follow a branch of the religion (not a large branch mind you) that does wrong women, for example muta'a marriage is marrying a girl and divorcing her the next morning, legal in Iran. Most shi'ites don't actually follow or agree with the extremist parts of their religion, but the practices are allowed in Iran.

Iran's government is **extremely** oppressive to women, I encourage you to read about it and how Islam is used as a justification for these disgusting pracices (and Iran is far from the only place where Islam is easily used to justify this type of treatment). 

&gt;regarding slave women: I know exactly what you're referring to, 'captives that your right hand possesses,' but that means prisoners of war that CHOOSE to marry you (and it is sinful if you marry a woman only for sex, that's taking advantage of her).

Just how exactly is 1) it ok to have a slave in the first place, and  2) a slave supposed to not be ok with her masters wishes? It says you must give the proper dowry to her people and get their consent, but it does not mention her wishes. I'm quite sure her wishes would likely be *not to be a slave to begin with*, but that's ok, Allah doesn't mind slavery. 

&gt;re: face coverings: They choose to, they're not required to. Even the religion doesn't require it, nothing is said about covering face.

I know, this is a pre-Islamic cultural tradition that is easily carried on with the help of Islam. These women are not all choosing to wear this. In many parts of the muslim world, you have to wear this, like it or not. 

According to Saudi Arabia's Shariah law, women's clothing should meet the following conditions:

 -Women must cover their entire body, but they are allowed to expose one or both eyes in necessity.
-Women should wear abaya and niqāb thick enough to conceal what is underneath, and the abaya should be loose-fitting.
 -Women should not wear brightly coloured clothes or clothes that are adorned so that they may attract men's attention.

In Saudi Arabia, all Saudi Muslim women are required to wear the niqab in cities such as Mecca, Medina and Taif. In other cities such as Dammam and Abha, women are not required to wear it by law but it remains de facto obligatory, and women may be harassed by the religious police if they do not cover their faces.

I don't think I need to get started on the Taliban's treatment of women and their very strict enforcement of this attire. 

&gt;Re: stoning and lashing: That doesn't happen. No matter how many times we hear it, it won't be real. Why can't you accept the possibility that the US is in fact not benevolent, coming from a man from the area (my sister and mother would say the same thing if you don't trust me), and that the media could in fact lie?

I've seen videos these things happening in places like Sudan, Nigeria, Iraq, and tribal regions of Pakistan. It most definitely is not a lie. There are women in Iran (such as Sakineh Ashtiani) sentenced to death by stoning who are only alive because of the outcry for human rights from the West. Sakineh Ashtiani had her sentence commuted to hanging after enough lobbying from human rights groups. Hanging for the crime of adultery. Seriously? Death for this? 

Here are videos of stonings, Islamic law is always the justification. Why shouldn't it be? Muhammed has several people stoned to death in the Hadiths, and he's our greatest example, right?

This is not ""pretend propaganda"". It might not be widespread, but it is committed in the name of Islam and having read the Qu'ran and the Hadiths I have to agree with these people that this is a very plausible interpretation of the religion, the books are filled with this kind of behavior.

1,0,t1_c1xgfdf,islam,,,"REPLY PART 2:

&gt;The Qur'an does not justify any of what you mention above, neither do Hadith or Sharia. I know my own religion, and my father is a Hafidh (meaning he has memorized the Qur'an).

I have studied Islam as well, and Muhammed has many people stoned (and openly recommends the practice). This is easily used to justify it's practice in many parts of the world.

Muslim 017:4206 Bukhari 6:60:79 Muslim 17:4196 Muslim 17:4209 Ibn Ishaq (970) - ""The adulterer must be stoned."" These words were a part of Muhammad's farewell address to his people on the occasion of his final pilgrimage to Mecca.

Pretty easy to understand.

&gt;regarding stoning in ancient times: What do you mean 'where it belongs?' The behavior you mentioned (which doesn't happen) can't be justified, whenever it occurs!

Of course it never belongs anywhere, what I was meant was it occurred frequently in antiquity, and it has NO place in the modern world. I agree it's despicable no matter what age it occurs in.

&gt;Yes, it is propaganda. Why are you saying it isn't? What proof have you of that? If you've lived here all your life, why is it not possible that maybe the government spreads propaganda? It makes sense that a government tries to convince its good people that what it's doing is right, even if it isn't!

I've shown you video that proves these things happen. I do not listen to or like my government, this has nothing to do with them. Everything I am saying has only to do with me and my own interest with the religion of Islam and the Middle East in general. I am not saying the whole middle east is bad, I am not saying Muslims are bad, but I do think the religion of Islam is false and a poisonous ideology that ruins every culture it touches.

&gt;regarding Muhammed owning slaves: ...No, he didn't. He was a shepherd. Even if he was non-righteous enough to own slaves, he couldn't have. But Islam preaches against it and so does he.

The Qu'ran openly endorses slavery, as does Muhammed by his ownership of slaves. From wikipedia:

""The major juristic schools of Islam have historically accepted the institution of slavery.[1] Muhammad and those of the Sahabah (companions) who could afford it themselves owned slaves, freed many, and some of them acquired more from prisoners of war. ""

If you have read the hadiths you will have noticed he owned many slaves, he also did free some, to his credit. If you have read the Qu'ran, you will notice many, many verses dealing with the treatment and keeping of slaves. I'm not sure how you missed all of this as a Muslim.

Muhammed mostly liked to free slaves in order to marry and have sex with them. Here's a few examples:

-Safiyya bint Huyayy, according to Islamic accounts she adopted Islam and became a wife of Muhammad. She lived more than a decade after him as a widow and became involved in the first power politics of the early Muslim community and left a large inheritance to her Jewish family.

-Maria al-Qibtiyya, a Coptic slave given to Muhammad by Muqawqis, a Byzantine official. She gave birth to Ibrahim ibn Muhammad whom Muhammad loved dearly. It is disputed whether or not he actually freed her or not, but one thing is for certain: he had sex and a child with his slave woman.

-Sirin, Maria's sister. He gave her to the poet Hassan ibn Thabit who later freed and married her.

&gt;regarding muhammed killing people: What in the...? Many muslims were killed and tortured by the pagan tribe Quraish, and were not allowed freedom of religion. So they fought back as they had the right to. They fought for their rights. Muhammed was a GENERAL (and a very good one at that!). He fought WARS, and they were justified. Yes, you kill people in war.

How about the Qurayza tribe where up to 900 unarmed men were slaughtered and their women and children enslaved. That's not very honorable. On top of that, I've already referenced the Hadith's where Muhammed personally has people stoned to death. He was a murderer.

&gt;He did indeed have a wife that was 12 years old. However, in the society at the time, 12 was the regular age at which people get married, because they can (they develop romantic feelings by then) and that is the age when they set out to lead their own lives, after they have finished their education and training. She would have been called a child today, but she was not a child then, she was a full grown woman, and that's what matters.

Your math is off. Aisha was 6-7 when he married her, and 9 when he had sex with her. She herself says so in the Hadith. Muhammed was in his 50's when he did this. She was also not a full grown woman even for her time, because she mentions after Muhammed has sex with her that she gets down on the floor and plays with her dolls like a CHILD while he laughs at her. Are you really a muslim? Have you read the Hadiths? How did you miss all of this?

&gt;As a matter of fact, I do feel offended even if you didn't mean insult. I didn't see much respect for me or my people or my religion in your essay. Just putting that out there.

I have great respect for your people, they have given the world a great many things, but I'm sorry to say I have very little for the religion. I don't mean it as an insult, it's just honestly how I feel about the religion of Islam (and to be fair with you, every religion, but we aren't discussing them at the moment).

&gt;...Nope. The reason it's 'in the state that it is' is because of the US sending its military into every Islamic country. The countries fared fine before that. Imperialism says a lot about why so much of the Muslim world is in the state that it is.

This is an ongoing debate, but the Muslim world had not been fine for a very, very long time before the US had any involvement in it. It is Islamic law that ruined Iran and literally turned back centuries of progress with the Islamic revolution. Islam in parts of Africa that the United States has never touched (Sudan, Nigeria, Bhutan) has wrought havoc upon those countries.

Sure, the United States has it's fair share of involvement with the Middle East, but this is all not the US's fault. Poverty, illiteracy, closed-mindedness to ideas outside of Islam, ethnic conflict, corruption, and tumultuous relations with literally every other region on Earth (Muslims wage war on non-muslims in the Balkans, Africa, Russia/Chechnya conflict, Asia, India and of course with Europe and the United states), this is the real reason there is so much trouble in that region.

Let's not forget oil as well, which is an entirely new subject. I'm not sure we can argue much more about all of this, it seems we just have a very basic disagreement over what exactly Islam is. If you too have read the same books that I have and we are getting different things from what they say, well then I guess that says a lot about the vague nature of those books to begin with. This is why there are so many interpretations of Islam.

Which leads me to question whether or not it can really be the perfect text it claims to be. You can respond to me and I will be happy to read it, but it seems like our arguments are getting bigger and bigger, I had to post my response in two posts! I'm not sure I'll have the time for 3, but we'll see :) good talking to you

I included the Russian thing just basically to justify my claim under skills that I can in fact speak Russian. I was told by my universities HR people that in todays market it makes one more attractive but you need to be able to back it up with some kind of hard proof. 

My G.P.A. would be around a B/B+ on my M.A. but converting it to an American scale is kind of hard and more like a guessing game depending on what metric you want to use. Do you think I should include it even if I can't hit the number exactly?

I am still in Europe but I'm trying to make the transition back to the US after living here for the last 6 years. Which is part of the reason Personal info: etc. is there. In Germany its a required line and includes, birth date, and city of birth. Should I take that out for a US application? I let some friends in HR in Chicago look it over and they didn't comment on that.

1,0,t1_c1xgn2r,IWantOut,,,"I guess there are racists everywhere, and as far as treating you differently is concerned, be it consciously or subconsciously, it probably takes different forms depending on where you go. Only an Asian American who has first hand experience could tell you what the differences would be, and from what I gather, s/he would even have to be from the same part of the US as you.

I wouldn't feel comfortable saying it would be better in Germany or another European country. One reason is that I'm simply not in a position to make that call, and the other is that, yeah, of course people here have stereotypes as well, and some even are proper racists. Are there more or less of them over here? I don't know, but odds are it would be *different*, for better or worse. My guess is that after just a few days on a vacation, you'd be in a better position to answer that than I ever could.

So, take all of the below with a grain of salt, but there are a couple of things to consider.  
One important aspect are general cultural differences. If you don't take that into account, then you *will* perceive culturally perfectly normal behavior as discrimination, even though it wouldn't (necessarily) be because of your Asian heritage.  
From what I've heard, we're generally considered to be blunt and cold. This is probably true, because the German perception of Americans is exactly the other way round, as very open and friendly but ""superficial,"" in that you're quickly called a friend, that ""you should come over for dinner some time,"" but it doesn't really mean all that much. I've come to accept Americans talking badly about ""friends"" as something that goes with the language. Making friends takes a lot of time over here, especially if you have to ""break into"" existing circles. However, if you'd come over for a Master's, many of your fellow students would be in the same position as you.  
Apparently it's also more common to be stared at, especially if you stand out one way or the other.

(Re-reading the above, that probably was very ""direct."" Take it as a cultural exercise.)

In other countries, there would be similar effects. For example, the Brits are [notorious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6uhxH924ao) for their stereotype based ~~humor~~ *humour*. This takes some getting used to, but they genuinely don't mean to offend. Or so I've been told.

I'm *guessing* that most people over here would primarily perceive you as American the moment you opened your mouth, which comes with its own bag of stereotypes.

There's also that whole large city/small town difference.

I think it would be best to look for Asian Americans who have lived (not just visited) potential target countries, and ask them what their experience has been. An AskReddit about Asian Americans in European countries might be a good idea.

And of course, travel if you can! Nothing beats personal experience. Hmm… They're ""competition"", but AFAIK as an American you can get a Working Holiday visa for Australia and New Zealand, probably Canada and the UK as well, which you could use as a ""try before you buy"" kind of ticket.

The problem with natural rights is that they ARE contingent on laws, customs, and beliefs of a particular culture or government.  Ask an Asian political scientist, a European political scientist, and an American political scientist for a list of natural rights, and you'll have a great degree of variance.  Ask a 60s feminist and an 80s capitalist.  Ask a 30s era European Marxist and a '00s era Tea Party activist.  A 1760s Lutheran versus a 1990s Atheist.  You'll get different answers from different people, even if they've got an equal educational weight.

You're positing a set of rights that will never be in dispute.  Such a list doesn't really exist.  Natural rights are at best ethical guidelines by which we strive to live.  But they aren't in any way defended or enforced with any degree of authority beyond that possessed by the ethical adherents.

&gt; Can you at least concede that there is a principled argument against abortion even if you don't agree with it?

Only if you consider the embryo more human than the mother.  A principled argument requires a degree of principle.  And the so-called ""pro-life"" movement is buried in hypocrisy.  Forcing a woman to give birth at the barrel of a gun completely disrespects the natural rights of the mother.  

You can have a dispute over whether it is morale to abort.  At which point, I don't care where your principles lay.  But the ""pro-life"" movement isn't demanding the freedom to defend the natural rights of their own offspring.  They're demanding the authority to push their own morale code on the population at large through force of arms.  That's the difference between being pro-life (government enforced child birth) and being pro-choice (child birth at the discretion of the mother).",0,1427206948,t3_hperq,1307055708,1,,0,False,True,Zifnab25,c1xgxk1,t1_c1xglzz,False,t5_2qh63

Interestingly, George Papandreou is the *current* prime minister of Greece, a country which is in horrible economic condition, but is also dependent on tourism, which would be improved by decriminalization.  The Americans, Volcker, Schultz and Whitehead could be characterized as motivated largely by wanting to avoid the waste of money and resources.  Mexico and Columbia need to do something/anything possible to restore the rule of law.  The former president of Brazil, a vast country with areas of extreme inaccessibility, seems to know that the Nixonesque drug war is unwinnable, especially given the geography there and thus a waste of effort.  The others I would guess are more concerned with the human rights damages from this so-called war, but I doubt if they would argue against an assertion that the restoration of rights leads to more orderliness in society.  Therefore this report is a sign that policymakers are being told that it is costing too much money and causing too much disruption to continue on the former path.  If the money people and the human rights people are putting their heads together it might be worth hoping that the politicians will listen to them more closely than they do the old-fashioned conservative manufacturing interests who initiated the  trouble.

Don't change the subject. We're talking about breaking the law, not rationality. Anyone who has a college education has the basic concept of ""just because it's legal doesn't mean it's moral, and vice versa"".

Not sure why you split this apart from the rest of what I had to say...

&gt;Yes, what has that to do with anything? Having free thought doesn't mean one shouldn't oppose these thoughts.

It's one thing to oppose thoughts. It's a whole other thing to oppose the propagation of thoughts. People should be free to believe what they wish. What they say will enter the marketplace of ideas, and a rational thinker will be able to analyze all the other ideas alongside it, and make the best choice.

&gt;Faith is the end of all discussion. That's exactly why it should be opposed.

Because the faithful have never had any discussions ever. Don't be silly.

&gt;Exactly. That doesn't, however, mean you should tolerate religion. Religious education doesn't have anything to do with religious teaching and indoctrination.

The United States was may have been founded on religious freedom, but nowadays, it's no longer about mere religious freedom. It's also about religious tolerance, something that was alien to the Puritans who merely wanted to escape European persecution in order to have their own society where they could persecute those who didn't agree with them. Religious tolerance means you can agree to disagree. It means you're mature enough to be able to hold talks and reach understandings with those that disagree with you on certain things. At the end of the fucking day, the Muslims that are putting up this community center aren't going to pack up and leave any time soon. You're going to have to grow up and learn to deal with them.

See, even though people point to it as a beacon for easy-entry Pynchon, it's still fairly complex. Although I was lost a bit in the last 20 pages or so, regarding all of the European history stuff, even the plot of the play itself, I think I took away a lot of good notions.

Mostly, I'd say the story structure is built to mock mystery novels: stories written for a big pay off at the end. You might expect to find out the identity of the crier, at the end, but, alas, there's an abrupt cut-off. Combined with the fact that pomo stuff is so self-referential and so consciously aware of itself, and that Oedipa feared at the end, after a final meet-up with Fallopian, that maybe the whole convoluted mess of it all, the seeming pawns set against her at every turn, the again and again showing up of the muted posthorn, etc., all of it was just one big gag, put on by Pierce before he died, for whatever reason he may have had. (This whole part, I suppose, pointing to the ridiculousness of mystery novels, maybe? Something like ""it's about the journey, not the destination.""

2,0,t1_c1xhpux,canada,Lest We Forget,,"Sigh... OK, 

There is, in my mind, the idea that Canada has an expectation to act on **three** levels.  

As a member of the United Nations, member nations can be called upon to act in any number of ways.  Whether it be to further social change, environmental change, or as it may be, through military action.  This is an expectation of all member states, it just happens that some members are in a better position to act on UN resolutions than others.

As a member of NATO, we have an expectation within a military alliance to work in furtherance of defense of not only our own country, but other member states.  At times, NATO is asked by the UN to act on its behalf, or authorizes NATO action.  Within this military alliance there is an expectation for all to contribute in some way.  In Afghanistan there has been the expectation for Canada to provide a battle group in combat operations.  As a member of NATO we will still be expected by our allies to contribute, even as public opinion changes, we are expected by our allies to contribute (whether we like it or not, it is their expectation).

Finally, as a developed nation we as Canadians feel some sort of desire to help in some way to those not as fortunate as ourselves.  Through humanitarian aid, financial assistance, or even military action.  People pride Canada at being a nation of 'peace keepers' and can act in some way to help those who are suffering.  The Canadian public expected the Government to act in some way to aid Haiti following their earthquake- we sent the military.  People expected Canada to help those suffering in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, we sent in DART (a military unit).  Canadians expected Canada to act to end the conflict in the Balkins and we sent our troops.  

Hell, let me add a forth just for fun- we are also expected to help out when we can because we are nice people and good neighbours (most of the time).  The United States Government requested resources from Canada to help combat the oil spill in the gulf; Canada provided that support.

To loop back again, NATO cooperation and UN support are not always the same thing.  Canadian action in a region does not always need to involve the military though.  If we were to have a base somewhere else on the globe, it provides other departments and agencies the access and resources to provide additional support.  If DFAIT needed to send a team to respond somewhere in Europe, they could be routed through our base.  If CIDA wanted to support sending aid workers to some remote location in the world, a Canadian military base could act as a supply hub rather than routing it through Canada and adding additional logistical complications.  

This is my opinion, that is all.

10,0,t1_c1xhz8q,twincitiessocial,West St. Paul,,"I was in grad school, took a multicultural marketing course in 2008, and was with a group that studied the Somali market, and developed a plan to market to them. Hopefully the following helps (I apologize in advance for the length and tone of the text, I'm literally copying and pasting):
Since the mid 1990’s there has been an exodus from Somalia. Before 1988, there were approximately 7.7 million people living in Somalia. Since then, about one million people have left the country and moved to various places around the world. 

Many of these Somali refugees settled nearby in East Africa and in the Middle East, with several new Somali immigrant communities settling throughout Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Finland, and England) and North America. Within the United States many Somalis initially settled in the largest cities such as New York and Los Angeles, however second waves of Somali immigrants have settled in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where an estimated 40-70% of Somali immigrants now reside. This makes the Twin City area of Minnesota the largest American home to Somali refugees (Greeson, Veach, &amp; LeRoy, 2001; Minnesota Foundation, 2004). 

Since most of this group is very new to the U.S, they are still in the early stages of acculturation to Western society. Many Somali immigrants continue to wear traditional dress and participate in other cultural practices. While some Somali adolescents feel more pressure to assimilate and wear Western clothing to school, most families still have their children wear traditional clothing at home and continue traditional practices. The children often attend religious schooling during the evening or on weekends. (Minnesota’s Somali Community, University of Minnesota – Academic Health Center) The most important values to Somali immigrants include family and maintaining their Islamic traditions and education. 

In recent years, Somali families have adapted to some of America's institutions, not hesitating to take advantage of the greater educational opportunities and access to government services available in the United States. Even though they have adapted some of their practices to fit into society, for example having women work outside the home and adopting Western styles of dress, the one thing that remains consistent among the Somali people, and that is the importance of family. Family is the ultimate source of personal security and identity. The protection of family honor and loyalty are extremely important to Somali families. 

With religious tradition and family as strong driving factors, and with the importance placed on continuing religious tradition among children, most Somali immigrants would not be likely to feel comfortable placing their preschool children into a traditional, largely non-Muslim U.S. daycare situation. Traditionally, mothers or extended family members watch the children, but with fewer family members here, and as women work more outside of the home and move into higher level jobs, there will be a growing need for child care. Somalis will continue to prefer childcare needs to met be met within the community, trusting other members of the Somali community who are familiar with the community’s Islamic traditions to care for their children while they are at work.
Data: Somalis in the United States

 Minnesota has three large immigrant populations in addition to the Somalis; Hmongs, Hispanics, and Russians. Compared to these populations, Somalis are much more familiar with the English language, and appear to be more determined to grasp the English language. According to a survey done by the Wilder Research Center and released in 2000, 51% of Somalis can, “speak and understand English very well”, much higher than the 13% and 12% reported by Russian and Hmong immigrants, respectively. In addition, only 11% reported they cannot speak English at all, and if not comfortable with their fluency, 51% were taking classes, compared to 17- 31% with other immigrant populations. No doubt, tendency towards knowing and wanting to learn English is probably due to Somalia’s colonial history, which means that many Somali immigrants spoke English in their home country as well.

The value Somalis place on their native language cannot be ignored. Many Somalis consume media to keep in touch with news in their country of origin, and especially value spoken word poetry in their native language. Somali poetry is split into two main styles, the more traditional maanso style, and the contemporary hees. Due to the fact that there was no definitive script of the Somali language until 1972, the oral tradition of poetry is still rich, especially the maanso style, with poets composing and reciting long poems entirely from memory. 

In addition, survey data has revealed Somalis commonly share an intention to eventually return to their country of origin, with 69% hoping to return. They are also more likely to use the internet as a source of news, with 42% using it in 2000, utilizing it especially to gain news from their native country. 

From our personal observations of Somali shoppers in Minneapolis, it is clear that there are some cultural differences in how Somalis shop compared to most Americans. The most obvious distinction is the separation of genders. While a few Somali couples were shopping together at Cub Foods, the vast majority of shopping was done by women while the men waited outside the store. From interviewing a few shoppers at the Somali shopping Mall on Pillsbury Avenue, we learned that women make most of the day-to-day shopping decisions. Even though men may make the bigger purchasing decisions, like buying a car, women have input into those decisions as well, wielding ulitimate “veto” power if necessary.

1,0,t1_c1xi8ai,politics,,,"North Korea has been the equivalent of a totalitarian and fascist (in practice) dictatorship (and, since the death of Kim Il-sung, a theocratic necrocracy too, for lack of a better expression) since the early 70s, when Juche supplanted Marxism-Leninism as the state's official socio-political and economic policy. For a long time, the DPRK apparently had a much better standard of living than South Korea, but the authoritarianism and self-reliance of the state (and the Songun policy) has ruined that.

The USSR was doomed from the start, because vanguardism and Blanquism are self-destructive ideologies. Lenin was of course a bastard in his own right, and Stalin transformed the state into what Orwell would like to call a collective oligarchy (there's really no better term for it than this: socialism was not exactly on the to-do list as much as state ownership of the means of production and servitude of the citizenry was, these two things not bearing anything in common with socialism, which is, at its core, either public or worker control of the means of production in a democratic state or with no state at all).

Cuba was created by violent revolutionaries, and its aggressive foreign policy led to its current state (then again, the fact that the USSR at that point was fucking huge didn't exactly give Cuba much of a chance to argue with them - it's like Australia trying to say no to the USA). Che was an executioner, whose view of homosexuality and other forms of expression, sexual and otherwise, isn't exactly endorsed by many socialists and Communists today. I'm honestly not familiar with Castro's personal politics. But, let us not forget that Cuba's environmental policies are the most ecologically sustainable on Earth, and its literacy rate is incredibly high for a nominally socialist country (I would certainly say that Cuba is socialist, it just happens to be a relatively totalitarian one too - it's certainly not a democratic socialist nation), and its infant death rate is lower than that of most Western countries. It also did pretty well to survive its artificial peak oil. 

Basically, with regard to Cuba: although it made some bad decisions, as a result of the personal politics of the members of the Party, and because of its relationship with the USSR, the origins of its economic hardships, I believe, can be blamed on the USA (whose embargo is certainly justified in a sense, but on the other hand, it has long outstayed its welcome, and aggression on the part of the USA played a major part in the missile crisis). It's a moot point though.

North Korea is not a socialist country (it doesn't even pretend to be); the USSR is not a socialist country (Stalin's policies regarding collectivisation don't make it a socialist country, and Lenin's policies were social democratic ones at best - since the mid 50s, whether it was socialist or not is an argument that is completely up for grabs; some of its policies were, some weren't, but it's wholly unreal to say that ""the USSR was, in practice, a socialist country""); Cuba is a socialist country, or was at least, but it is still a single-party state with a bloody and (more) totalitarian past. 

The northern European socialist democracies are examples of nations with working socialist social policies, but capitalist economic policies (social democracies), and some of the South American nations like Venezuela are decent examples of democratic socialist nations (the issues affecting these countries, namely violence and economic disparity, being issues that affected them long before and independent of socialist parties being elected into power - one can trace them back to the military juntas of many of these nations, or to Western colonisation, or to human nature, but really, it's such a contested topic that there's little point discussing it here).

1,0,t1_c1xi9zg,starcraft2_class,,,"the fact is that since when do you see zerg do hydra before roaches? and unless they spot you going air THEN they make hydras or corruptor. so phoenix also has the ability to pull up hydra with gav gun. 

why run when you win? i don't understand. you have more unit then them by the time they have hydras( killing off overlord constantly), so gav all of them with all your phoenix, charglot kill off the remaining, when the gav gun ended, charglot finish the rest, move phoenix to overlord and continue to under food zerg, pump more phoenix and lot and up tech.

if you spot them having more lings and hydra which your zealot cannot compensate, then go for HT tech at the same time continue harrassing overlords and still building of phoenix(lower pace saving gas for ht), lots. open 2 more gates if needed.

why phoenix you ask, zerg has tendancy to go air after lings(80%), it kill overlords, muta, queens, drone and pick up AA or range unit. why not col? since we doing phoenix, they would have go corruptor IF we are unable to stop them from getting air and their mineral line is save.

phoenix is &gt; muta.
phoenix is &lt; corruptor

but corruptor is unable to hit ground therefore charglots and ht.


transit to whichever build in the field to counter and stay on top of the control is the key of winning.

what is so difficult to win zergie? 9/10 match on zerg are win, as long as a zerg keep harrassing you early, this mean they are doing fast expansion. so just push it at 5mins with mass. is that hard to see what your opponent is doing by experiences?

1,0,t1_c1xia0x,videos,,,"That's right, one girl did talk about about wanting their hair different, and the European statement was wrong,  but it seemed like the whole point of that clip was just about color.  For example: the paper bag thing, or being seen next to a dark girl, ""if she was only a little lighter.""  They had the little girl pointing to similar pictures, with different skin tone. If I would have seen the actual documentary, I might feel different, but I'm going with what was provided, and I must've not looked that deeply into what they were saying.

But on the other hand, how many people would think that a white girl with more African features; hair, lips, nose, and lets make her  fat (not saying that is an African trait), she is still white but how many people would find her attractive?  She would probably feel really insecure growing up, except it wouldn't be because white women are the epitome of beauty.
The fat white girl wouldn't even need African traits, she could have fucked up teeth, a crooked nose, huge eyebrows, acne, big ears, anything else that someone might find unattractive.
  This could be because, people are raised to believe that someone with flawless skin, straight teeth, straight nose, thin eyebrows, and smaller ears, are what make the perfect woman.
 what If we were all brown and women's physical traits were seen the same as they are now, what would there be documentary's on?  Probably girls with buck teeth, or short legs.  you can go ahead and blame the media.

1,0,t1_c1xicsi,canada,,,"I certainly agree with you that there's a lot more unique slang in Quebec French while the slang that is found in Parisian French is more or less shared with the other French European countries.

I think the issue is more complex than whether Parisian French is more formal or not though.  In some ways, yes it absolutely is.  In Quebec, it's not a really big deal if you use ""tu"" with somebody you don't really know instead of ""vous"".  But you will get serious sideways looks if you attempted that in France.  I tend to see this as more of a by-product of Quebec's anti-authoritarian and non-deferential mindset than because of formality though.

However the French from France are much much less formal when it comes to vocabulary than the Québécois (and other French Canadians).  Like I mentioned above, the French from France don't really care that their stop signs don't say ""arrêt"" and they're even more likely to use ""stop"" in a sentence than ""arrêt"".  They'll also say things like ""j'ai t'envoyé un email"" while a French Canadian will say ""j'ai t'envoyé un courriel"" which is the proper term in French for an email.",0,1427207618,t3_hq6ie,1307071843,1,,0,True,True,[deleted],c1xicsi,t1_c1xiabb,False,t5_2qh68
