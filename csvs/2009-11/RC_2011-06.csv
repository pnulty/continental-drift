Geography may be one of the factors is creating alliances but it's not the only one nor is it the most important. In Europe, geography was less important in creating alliances than blood lines, for a long time. Germany lost because it broke its alliance. Russians were able to stand because they received help from US and UK after switching sides (USSR was considered an axis power - The Urals were not as helpful as as the American war effort). Fighting a proxy war was safer for the US because the geography was not enough to protect it from an all out war. The 60 year conflict is older than 60 years and it's a war for land not for safety. Japan was always an expansionist power and an economical alliance with the US was in its interest. It welcomed American businessmen and it sent its people to train in American military schools.

You can't claim to have reason on your side without being reasonable yourself, and when it's this easy to discredit the original source (based on an in my opinion more trustworthy source) it should raise an eyebrow. 

I'll probably get down voted for this, but as a secular humanist the demonizing of muslims going on in Europe concerns me almost as much as islam itself does. It creates hatred for a group of people of whom the vast majority will be innocent, and we all remember what happened the last time we allowed that to happen. Islam - along with the rest of religion - should be fought by attacking the IDEA of religion, not the people who practices it - that is a battle no one can win, and one that could very well lead to a new world war. Little by little, rational and reasonable people must speak up, always respecting other people, without respecting their ideas.

What we're doing, as much as it may offend the Gadhafi-lovers, is supporting the Libyan people in their overthrow of a dictator. But knee-jerk simpletons will always find a way where Europe, the UK, and the US are evil and Gadhafi and suchlike brutal, murderous dictators are cuddly.

To go back to the original point:

We have soldiers in Libya.  We have warplanes over Libya.  We are not there at the behest of the (currently) legal government.  Therefore, this is an invasion and a violation of sovereignty.  They are fighting what amounts to a civil war, and its technically not our business.

At no point in all of the above rhetoric did I make a moral judgement on what the US is doing there.  I simply stated that the US does not enter into wars for humanitarian reasons.  That's because *there's no money in it.*  Wars are expensive.  We're dropping $500k bombs on $10k technicals, and someone's going to have to cough up the dough for it.

At no point did I call the US evil.  I only said that our government is not altruistic.

&gt; I don't think you're wrong on everything, I just think that viewing every single event in the world in exactly the same framework is as naive and unhelpful.

Riiiiight...  Just as naive and unhelpful as your belief that I'm calling the Western world evil and have a hard-on for Gaddafi because I think that there's actually motives *other than helping the rebellion.*  Sure, it's nice to help them...  Our leaders get to pat themselves on the back and be congratulated by the populace that elects them, and then they get to keep their highly lucrative jobs  (and if you don't think it's all about money, just remember that Congressmen are legally allowed to engage in practices that would get anyone else jailed for insider trading).

Frankly, between the two of us, I'm the one who's actually providing something bordering on a realistic point of view that contains something other than ""killing crazy people good!""

&gt; But over in the Alex Jones world, you can't just see what the geopolitical realities are (and, yes, oil plays a big part in that) and think about this issue in isolation. We have to switch into full-blown the US is evil blah blah oil blah whothefuckcares ranty rant mode. Because that's all you've got.

You know it's funny, because I had to actually look up who Alex Jones is.  I hit so many links while digging into a story.  I even watch Fox News every now and then so that I can keep up on how the crazies on that side of the fence are faring.  Sometimes they actually say something intelligent.  But you're pidgeonholing me in a way that is laughable...  You don't know me, and yet you can judge me on the fact that I posted a factual and confirmed-by-multiple-sources statement through a link to an Alex Jones website.  You don't know that I had to write a paper on this shit in college.  You don't know that when someone makes a really good point, I look it up to see if maybe I was wrong and change my stance accordingly.

I'll grant you, though, I walked into that alternate accounts/conspiracy theory bit.  Touché on making the most of that one.

&gt; I don't think your ideas are rooted in the real world; they are rooted in a worldview that demands a particular narrative.

And that narrative is that money rules the roost.  It's a little less so in parts of Europe.... and it's a lot less so in the back-woods... or sand... of Africa.  But here in America, your voice grows louder the more money you have.  If that's something you doubt, then you're being intentionally blind.  On a small scale, sure, I don't give a rat's ass about money so long as I can live comfortably and happily, and there are many people like me...  but on a large scale, the current generation in particular has been brought up to get while the getting's good regardless of the expense to other people, and that's pretty well documented in psychological circles.  Also, people who run big companies disassociate their actions from the consequences to other people.  I realize that he's not a licensed practitioner, but Ted Danson researched his role as a big businessman for some TV series by interviewing CEOs, and he came to the conclusion that the only thing distinguishing them from people in prison is the color of their collar. Take that as anecdotal or not, I don't care.  Frankly, we've cultivated a culture here that rewards the sociopaths with higher salaries and bigger bonuses... and you can verify that line with my Dr. Mom, who used to be a licensed therapist.

So, the TL;DR:
Didn't say US is evil, just profit motivated.  Saving peoples' lives is nice, but it doesn't pay the bills.  Gaddafi's nuts and could probably use a good killing.  Wondering about our motives in Libya when the situation is quite similar/identical in Syria/Bahrain/North Korea but we do nothing there is far from thinking of issues in isolation.  You saying I'm a wignut doesn't make it true.

Didnt say so.

&gt;evolution does not favor intelligence after you have become the dominant species on the planet and no longer have natural predators. which happened about 100,000 years ago.

This is one problem with Africa. They were sitting around mainly relaxing, while the rest of the world were fighting and warring and killing. This a) gets rid of the weak and b) prevents complacency like in Africa.

&gt;however human intelligence has not increased very much if at all in the last 100,000 years.

On that, I say you check out [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10,000_Year_Explosion). The author states that civilization accelerated human

Despite your best efforts on a statistical or even a longtidunal study you are not going to be able to accurately eliminate all other factors surrounding the lives of each individual in the study.

If this, ""consumption of alcohol is linked to cancer"", was all he was saying, I would agree.  Yes, it is linked to cancer.  But it does not specifically cause the cancers of these patients.

Not really.

In the late 18th century the traditionally held discoverer of the Indo-European languages' common descent, [Sir] William Thomas, proposed, largely for Biblical reasons, that this ancestral language originated in Iran.

Soon afterwards, as the idea of an Indo-European language family began to entrench itself within intellectual circles, the historical self-designating term (Old Persian: Ariya; Latin: Ariana; Sanskrit: Arya; English: Aryan) of the indigenous inhabitants of Thomas' hypothesized homeland became associated with all Indo-Europeans.  So the establishment of Aryan being accepted as equivalent to Indo-European occurred almost a hundred years before Hitler was even born.

Furthermore, although still debated among experts, it's not outrageous to suggest that the Proto-Indo-Europeans used a cognate of Aryan to refer to themselves.  At the very least, Aryan as a synonym for Indo-European is more accurate and justifiable in a historical linguistic sense than the current consensus usage of Semites (descendents of Shem) for Semitic-speaking peoples, or the less often used Hamites (descendents of Ham) for the Berber, Omotic, Chadic, and Cushitic peoples.",

Businesses do nothing... only *individuals* can act. Some individuals are amoral psychopaths, yes. That only has to be a problem to the extent you begin allowing people to increase their power by being masters at politics and coercion.

&gt; You shouldn't expect them to do otherwise.

It's completely fine that man is greedy. It only begins to be a problem when we structure society as if that is not the case.

&gt; The banks who felt they HAD to sell the negative amortiation subprime mortgages to people even when they suspected it would all end in a default were doing it because they knew that if they didn't their competitor would.

That's not all of it though. They did it because they knew that there was a bailout at the end of it all. If they thought there wouldn't be a bailout, then they would have let their competitors engage in those loans to their hearts content and suffer the bankruptcy of their firm afterwards. What you're describing there is not a problem that results from man's nature or banking. It's a problem with having a government that believes it ought to use its coercive powers to transfer wealth around the economy for purposes beyond defending individuals from aggression.

&gt; When those oil&amp;gas companies come in and do a fracking operation to get at the shale gas, they want to go to the place with the lightest environmental regulations so that they don't have to spend as much money handling their waste water.

So sounds to me like you're talking about a country that isn't very capitalist and doesn't have a strong respect for private property rights? I agree. Nations such as that are never a pretty sight. I am all for strong property rights and for making men pay who aggress against the property of others.

Yes. The West no longer practices capitalism and does not want an environment where voluntary exchanges can flourish. Government intervention is so entrenched in their system today that businessmen know that it is better to spend their time and energy lobbying Washington then it is to spend their time and energy trying to improve their product.

&gt; Have a look at BPs safety record. Those accidents weren't just bad luck.

What accidents are you talking about? What sort of work were the men engaging in? Is it a dangerous line of work? Did the men voluntarily agree to work for the employer in those conditions?

&gt; They avoid taxes with offshore tax havens and then lobby for a tax holiday in order to be able to bring in all their profits.

Agreed. People don't like being plundered from. If you want people to produce wealth inside your country, don't implement policies that discourage wealth creation inside your country.

Nuclear experts assume that much intelligence comes from Israel, the United States and Western Europe, though the I.A.E.A. in total has 151 member states.

&gt;The report cites concerns about undisclosed nuclear activities “past or current,” implying that the agency believes the Iranian arms program may still be moving ahead despite reports of its onetime suspension.

&gt;The seven categories of technology all bear on what can be interpreted as warhead design: how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, make conventional explosives that can trigger a nuclear blast, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction and design nose cones for missiles.

&gt;Two diplomats familiar with the evidence, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity under the usual protocol, emphasized that no single one of the technologies stood out as indicating bomb work. Some, they conceded, have peaceful uses.

&gt;But the totality of the evidence, they said, suggested that Iran has worked hard on multiple fronts to advance the design of nuclear arms.

&gt;“It’s the whole variety of information,” one of the diplomats said. “You have to look at the whole thing.” 

Now, that may be *shaky* evidence, or *spurious* evidence, or *inconclusive* evidence.  But it certainly isn't ""No Evidence of Iranian Weapons Program"", is it?",

We rented a house in Florance, a couple of blocks from the water. Now in Italy, and most of Europe, the beaches, including the water space, is owned. You have to pay to use the water and sand. Now this means that the lifeguards don't do much saving, and just yell at you to get you back into the beach space.

My cousins, brother, and I, being kids, wanted to swim out quite far, so we did. About a mile. It really wasn't us that took us out that far, see, there is this awesome thing called a riptide, that really wants to kill you. So it tried pretty hard. 

It was four of us, with two boogie boards. We tried swimming back in. There wasn't much communication, we were all really tired. Jack, my cousin, was trying to swim back in, and I was hanging on to a boogie board, not moving. He was moving backwards faster than I was. I sat there and thought to my self. 

""I am actually going to drown."" I looked around ""I am going to die in the company of these people."" WHAM!

That wham was me being knocked unconscious by three well muscled Italian lifeguards, manning a catamaran. They hauled us out of that water like a group of drowned rats. I woke up, sprawled out on the red plastic deck, seeing the man who had saved my life rowing rhythmically over me. I glanced over at my brother, Jack, and his sister. Happy to see them not sucking salt water, I slipped silently back into my mind.

Cue the boat running a shore. I got knocked off into the sand. The feeling of that dry, warm sand is the memory I most remember from that vacation. Of course we didn't speak any Italian, and kind of ran off before they had tied down the boat, horribly embarrassed. I never told those men how thankful I was that they saved my life that day. We ran back to our parents, about 1000 yards from the surf. Where they didn't believe us. To this day it is a memory my brother, cousins, and myself share. ",

The transit situation in NYC, Boston, Chicago, SF, LA, etc. can be hardly described as 'glistening lifestyle [bubbles]'. These systems are supported by the words of politicians, but hardly receive equivalent funding support.

&gt;Transit stations' size should be a reflection of their ridership. A station like Long Ping is of a size that reflects the high transit ridership (87%), and overall population (7m), of Hong Kong.

When establishing new transit routes, [an increasingly controversial topic](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstreetsblog.net%2F2011%2F04%2F28%2Fchasing-the-illusive-new-transit-rider-missing-the-bus%2F&amp;ei=5rDlTfikENHOgAeM8f3qCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUqh5rJTbjuBcOdgKUOwc4kWun1A&amp;sig2=EftPRpE_KHiiut1w6Z4UeQ) in established transit areas, it's good practise to size the stations to reflect **anticipated** ridership. A key move that many transit agencies in the US have failed to do until recently is something I have been repeating here on /r/transit and elsewhere, something the Japanese have been doing since the first half of the 20th century: we call it 'transit-oriented development', everyone else calls it common sense. Why squander a high-cost infrastructure investment like transit and leave ridership numbers to fate when you can develop directly on and over your owned properties adjacent the station and encourage developers to follow suit, the former of which brings back revenue to the system through rent and both assure ridership if executed across the system.

&gt;It would, however, be an order of magnitude too large—and expensive—for a midwestern city of 500,000 and an optimistic 20% of the population using it.

I think you're assuming that I recommend large, high-cost, elabourate heavy rail transit for all regions, which is far from what my original post was about.
If not, the assumption that larger-scale LRT (light rail vs BRT) cannot serve a population of 500,000 defies the many cases of successful LRT operation in areas of similar population in many parts of Europe, Japan, and other locales with similarly strict legislation regulating development outside of urban areas.

&gt;People don't use transit in the USA because it's inadequate, not because it's ugly.

As far as the sparse Midwestern cities that typify the America we've invested in (I grew up in American suburbs like Kissimmee, FL and my family was zoned for **THE** [Levittown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown,_New_York) school district - we lived in nearby Wantagh, NY, so I know what it's like to be 'trapped' as a kid in your own home in the suburbs), many are [having to downsize](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/reports/shrinking-cities/video-youngstown-ohio-the-incredible-shrinking-city/1225/) and are taking the opportunity to invest heavily in transit to serve these smaller footprint cities that have been encouraged to sprawl because cars were born there. Admittedly, this isn't happening in every Midwestern/typical sprawled American city, but many cities are at an impasse with how to bring their roads to SGR while still being able to balance their budgets.

This brings me to the point I probably should've addressed at first: there is a wide spectrum of applied transit. Most of my focus is on established transit in metropolitan areas because of the number of political and funding issues facing the transport systems that enable these metropolitan areas to generate the majority of the nation's GDP. That said, this particular example is to point out the need to create spaces that should be celebrated in cities, because too often cities/urban areas are derided as dingy places that should be this way or are inherently dingy. With the pressure of impending climate change and the need to reduce human environmental footprint, it is critical to fight the American social stigma of urban/higher density areas with amenities that make city living worth pursing, which includes transit worth using. Yes, we need transit that arrives on-time, but with the overwhelming focus on natural beauty that encourages people to move as far into 'nature' as possible, it is important to not underestimate the importance of places in urban areas that delight, whether you're waiting in that place for several minutes or just passing through.",

With the pumped storage though, how much do you really have?  I tried to look, but I can only find the generation capacity, not the storage capacity.  If you had those numbers, that would be really interesting.  It'd take a lot though - imagine a strange weather pattern going over the EU that stills the winds everywhere for a week.  You'd have some hydroelectric and geothermal baseload, but you'd need enough surplus solar during the day to pump up enough water to last the country through the night.  And if it happened during the winter, you would be in a worse situation.

&gt;The good thing about the hydro-storage is, that you nearly don't lose energy.

(I'm guessing you are ESL - you lose a game and loosen a necktie)

My guess is that you'll lose at least 10% in transmission, and maybe another 10% in pumping it up and running it back.  If you have other numbers, that'd be cool to see.  (my information is a bit out of date, and google isn't finding things fast enough).

The huge thing that rocks about pump storage is that it can be brought online within seconds, so if a cloud moves over our solar plant, it can start letting out water so that the grid remains stable.  I'm having a hard time imagining that they could make up for a still winter week.  Especially since the energy demands will most certainly go up.  For one thing, electric cars are going to be a big new drain on the grid.  We could use price to try to get people to charge them during the day, but we'd probably have to subsidize charging places at people's work.

Since you are currently getting [46%](http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/) from coal, can you see how replacing most of the with nuclear in the near term sounds easier to a lot of us than doing it all with wind/solar?

By believing that we are here for some purpose beyond simply living or enjoying life, belief in a deity logically follows. One's religious persuasion is simply a direction of that belief, not a necessity of it.

Can you explain how you think this is relevant to the question?  The question whether it is valid, in the US, for a state to pass a law preventing an atheist from holding office.  The Constitution's ""[no religious test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Religious_Test_Clause)"" clause, says, ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""  Requiring belief in a deity is fundamentally a ""religious test"", regardless of your point about philosophy.  Belief in a deity is a religious belief, by definition; and requiring the profession of belief in a deity to hold public office is a religious test.

Here's what Justice Hugo Black wrote for the court in the Torcaso vs. Watkins case, which was a unanimous decision for the atheist plaintiff, Roy Torcaso:

&gt; ""This Maryland religious test for public office unconstitutionally invades the appellant’s freedom of belief and religion and therefore cannot be enforced against him. [...] Indeed, it was largely to escape religious test oaths and declarations that a great many of the early colonists left Europe and came here hoping to worship in their own way. It soon developed, however, that many of those who had fled to escape religious test oaths turned out to be perfectly willing, when they had the power to do so, to force dissenters from their faith to take test oaths in conformity with that faith.""

Please read that carefully, because it encapsulates almost everything I'm saying about this issue, both legally and historically.

Black also wrote the following in that decision:

&gt; ""We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person ‘to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.’ Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.""

Back to you:

&gt; The problem with church and state in Europe had more to do with political disagreements than anything else. The state would use organized religion as an excuse for its actions and any form of organized religion would try to manipulate the state. The founding fathers established the barrier of church and state to prevent at least this from happening, although if you have additional explanations I would be happy to hear them.

The issue, as Black's comments hint at, is much broader than you suggest.  It's not clear from your short summary what you are or aren't aware of.  The prosecution of Puritans in England was fairly well known, and led to tens of thousands of them emigrating to America.  As another example, in the 17th century, thousands of Quakers were imprisoned in England for their religious heresy, many were tortured, and hundreds died as a result.  But these problems weren't restricted to Europe: the Puritans who came to America believed in uniformity of religion, that they needed to impose their religion on everyone in order to realize the supposed plan of the god they believed in.  

It was because of these sorts of conflicts in both Europe and early America that the Baptist minister Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, wrote [The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloudy_Tenent_of_Persecution) in 1644 which:

&gt; ""argues for a 'wall of separation' between church and state and for state toleration of various Christian denominations, including Catholicism, and also 'paganish, Jewish, Turkish or anti-Christian consciences and worships.' The book [...] is a response to correspondence by Boston minister, John Cotton, regarding Cotton's support for state enforcement of religious uniformity in Massachusetts. Through his interpretation of the Bible, Williams argues that Christianity requires the existence of a separate civil authority that may not generally infringe upon liberty of conscience, which Williams interpreted to be a God given right.

It is encouraging to see that in 1644, it was possibly for a Christian minister to be so wise in such matters; but it is sad to see that so many modern American Christians have forgotten these lessons and don't appear to have the wisdom to recognize them for themselves.

&gt; I would agree that a barrier between state and organized religion is a very wise idea, but that belief of higher purpose has other philosophical implications that I prefer in a leader.

Again, that belief is your right under the Constitution (although in my opinion, it makes you a kind of bigot), but it has no bearing on the legal issue in question.

&gt; And I understand your frustration with people that refuse to listen to scientific evidence, but will you please stop ragging on them? 

You apparently forget where this discussion is taking place.  This is /r/atheism, a forum for the discussion of atheism.  Over in /r/christianity, they ban people at the drop of a hat, for stating opinions that they don't like.  We don't do that here - we tolerate a great deal of ignorance and even trolling, because we generally don't believe in censorship.  If atheists are not permitted to speak their minds here, where do you propose they can do so?

&gt; Sorry, which values did I mention that it spits in? I honestly don't see what you're talking about.

You wrote that the people you're defending are ""probably coming from the perspective that atheism is technically in opposition to one of our country's earliest values.""  I'm pointing out that one of those earliest values is *freedom* of religion, which includes the freedom to disbelieve, the freedom of conscience that Roger Williams described.  To claim that ""atheism is technically in opposition to one of our country's earliest values"" conflicts with this fundamental early American value to such a degree that it seems to me to spit in the face of the history which led to the Constitution being written the way it is.  Both positions can't be true, and the one that's enshrined in the Constitution is no government establishment of religion, the free exercise of religion, and no religious test for public office.  

Religious people should be thankful that this is the way it is, because otherwise, the ongoing conflict for control of the government between religious sects would have destroyed or radically changed the USA long before now.

&gt; I agree that atheists should not be barred from office (there are many Christians in government who are far worse), however I disagree that banning states from doing so under the grounds that it violates the free exercise of religion clause of the Constitution on the grounds that belief in a Creator is a philosophical, not a religious, decision.

I'm not clear on what you're saying here - are you saying you disagree with the unanimous Torcaso vs. Watkins decision?  If so, I think that there may be points about Constitutional law that you're missing: in particular, that the Bill of Rights grants rights to all people present in the US, and a state cannot pass laws that abridges those rights.  While it's certainly legal for voters to choose not to vote for someone for whatever reasons they choose, it is not legal for a state to pass laws which discriminate against someone in such a way that it violates their freedom of religion, not to mention the fact that the ""no religious test"" clause is about as explicit as it gets in Constitutional law.

This, along with the semi-frequent visits by high ranking Russian officials, serves to give the people there the idea that they are in a situation similar to that of South Ossetia and the similar FSU breakaway republics. The reality is that Russia wishes to maintain their former sphere of influence in an increasingly EU friendly area.

Now that I look at it with a slightly more mature outlook, a lot of the name calling was just that - kids taking the piss out of each other. If he got messed up, the name callers would have defended him. 

Using skin color and race to evaluate someones Merit, is something I have personally, not come across. I'm sure it happens though - anyone got any numbers/anecdotes/studies?

That said, I know we are chauvinistic and bigoted in other ways - look at the caste system. We assume people from different regions will conform to their stereotypes, (hicks come from up north/this region/ etc etc)
I would also say that we are perhaps 'racist' when it comes to beauty - women are supposed to be fair, and dark skin is considered a major evil. 
I'm not sure that would count as racism though. A dark skinned woman in the north is as unlucky as a dark skinned woman in the east when it comes to the good-look sweep stakes in Indian culture.

What I am getting to is that racism in India is a complex thing and depends largely on the context, region and participants. 
I think in comparison to the wests history of slavery, we don't have the same set of baggage or context.
Perhaps a better comparison is between different regions of Europe. The Germans think that the Greeks are lazy good for nothings, and the Greeks think the Germans are colourless humorless androids who only want to save money. Racism of the western sort has its roots in slavery and the old belief that dark skinned people are inferior as HUMAN BEINGS. 
I don't think we had similar issues, someone please correct me.

There have been cases in the news that I have read about people yelling expletives at black foreigners, which I would put down to ignorance and a provincial mindset.

My university runs an event called Jailbreak every year where teams have 36 hours to get as far away from campus as possible without spending any money. Most teams manage to get into Europe and stuff, and me and my friend were hoping for the same. 

We got picked up on [the M10](http://www.bradfordschools.net/hotpot/Unit%208.1/m25.gif) by an Albanian guy who was in convoy, following his Lithuanian friend who had just bought an old Merc. He basically told us that he would take us down the M10, and then AROUND London on the M25, and then start to head down the M20 towards Dover and drop us off somewhere along there.

For most of the journey, he was very unsettling. He said he was a physics teacher and I could tell he was lying (I'm a physics undergrad). In fact, the whole time he seemed to just be telling us conversational lies. To make matters worse, my friend who was sitting on the back seat fell asleep and while she was dozing he used that as an excuse to lock the car doors.

I suddenly realised something wasn't right when he came OFF the M25 and actually started driving into North London – something which wasn't on the plan at all. I started to get pretty scared at this point; when I asked him why we were driving into London and not staying on the M25 he kept saying ""My friend, he know shortcut, we follow him"" (for non-UK people:driving through London city traffic definitely isn't shorter than driving around the M25) and even when I got out a map of London and asked him to point to where we were going, he was being very vague.

I asked him if he could just drop us off at the nearest petrol station and he kept saying like ""No no, we nearly there"" and stuff. Eventually, I told him that they were tracking our phones and that I had already texted someone else his numberplate and his friend's numberplate (all of which a lie), at which point he phoned his friend, spoke in another language, and then begrudgingly let us off at the next petrol station.

It was the scariest experience of my life.

Moreover, in nominal terms Japanese GDP has fallen behind China’s: US$1,336.9 billion for China against US$1,288.3 billion for Japan for the quarter.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – Looking at individual demand components, the domestic economy was sluggish, with the exception of private capital expenditure. Private non-residential investment grew by 0.5%, almost the same as in the previous quarter, on the back of improved profits. However, private residential and government investment spending declined sharply by 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – The contribution of inventories to GDP growth declined by 0.2 points. This is a bit surprising given the acceleration in imports, and might indicate that there is still room for an upward revision of growth at the next release.
 
Officials were particularly disturbed by the slowdown of personal consumption. Although the growth in consumer spending had been shored up by the government subsidies, such as those for the purchase of energy-efficient cars and the eco-point incentive program for purchasers of eco-friendly home electric appliances, the effects of these policies apparently wore off during the quarter.
 
The eco-car subsidies and eco-point system are due to end by the end of September and the end of this year respectively. Meanwhile, even though major corporations are awash with cash, they are extremely cautious about capital investment in view of uncertainties about the domestic and overseas economic situation.
 
Shaw Capital Management Korea: Japan’s Economic Growth Slowed Again Part 1 – Exports, the prime driver of growth, rose 5.9% on strong demand from Europe. But the pace of growth slowed from a 7.0% rise in the previous quarter amid signs of an economic slowdown in China, one of the biggest destinations for Japanese exports.
 
It is well-known that Japanese GDP data are volatile and subject to drastic revisions in both directions. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the economy has slowed considerably.

It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and Norway.[10] Instead, Cochineal (E120) is used in the red shells.

I'm not a huge fan of the U.S. or U.S. aid in all or even most cases, but it can be a way to possibly influence social policy in Ghana. Granted, this is coming from a Muslim group, but a lot of homophobia in African has been explicitly pushed by American Evangelicals and their missionary groups. In part because of these groups, there's a growing belief that LGBT people are the product of the undue sexual influence of the U.S. and Europe, an argument that has enormous political traction considering the longer history of exploitation between Europe and Africa.

Ghana is actually one of the more stable democracies in Africa, and denying aid on the basis of a Muslim group that, like Focus on the Family, represents a political organization that claims to represent a religious constituency. They don't necessarily represent Ghana. Most importantly, I don't see how removing aid (most of which is medical and infrastructural) on the basis of Ghanaian homophobia will lead to the improvement of LGBT Ghanaians' lives. Maybe the U.S. could offer to airlift the hundreds of thousands of LGBT Ghanaians to the U.S., but more than likely LGBT Ghanaians want the same opportunities to transform their own society that activists in other parts of the world have had. If LGBT people in America want liberation everywhere, then we're going to have to recognize that liberation is geographically and politically specific (think of the difference between SF and Atlanta, both of which have a vibrant LGBT politics but one that emerged before the other because of the geopolitical differences of SF and Atlanta). That means empowering LGBT activists in other places with as much support as possible, which I think the U.S. can only do through aid programs that attempt to stabilize electoral institutions and reduce the physical effects (starvation, malnutrition, lack of basic healthcare and immunizations) of poverty that inevitably destabilize states and leave the most socially and culturally vulnerable (in this case LGBT people) open to attack.

It's difficult to find LGBT Ghanaian or LGBT African responses to what is clearly an endemic problem, even if it's being exacerbated to a crisis point by American missionaries.

It's simply bad stuff....

1. Obesity started to climb when HFCS began to be widely introduced into the USA food supply 30-odd years ago.  
1. It has a higher Glycemic Index, which in general is a bad thing.
1. It has been proven to increase food and caloric consumption in cattle and humans, having some effect on the way we determine ""fullness"" and certainly induces calorie craving.  The sugar in HFCS, doesn’t stimulate leptin, a hormone which tells your body it’s full.
1. It is heavily subsidised to promote its use in US industry, and as it is so cheap it is used to bulk out foodstuffs in place of wholesome ingredients.  There are many labs sponsored to look for ways to introduce it into foods where it doesn't belong.
1. In blind tests, many people seem to be able taste the difference and say sugar tastes better.  I for one can taste the difference between EU coke and US coke, IMHO EU coke is **much** nicer.
1. Recent research says HFCS may be harmful to the liver and amongst things cause kidney disease.
1. HFCS has been found to contain levels of mercury.
1. HFCS is bad for the environment as corn is grown as a mono culture rather than a rotated crop. This maximizes yields, but it depletes soil nutrients, requiring more pesticides and fertilizer while weakening topsoil.
1. It can be dangerous for diabetics because their body doesn’t process it like sugar (glucose) which can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels.
1. HFCS is unnatural not just in its production, but in its growing as it often made from genetically-modified corn.

HFCS is the fucking devil ;o) , and I don't want it in my body, all I can say is I pity American consumers.

La Garofalo Infissi è nata a Castellammare del Golfo nel 2003. L’azienda opera nel settore della lavorazione del ferro e alluminio, affiancando all’esperienza del lavoro artigianale l’utilizzo di  moderne tecnologie di produzione  e qualità dei materiali. Nonostante sia presente sul mercato da pochi anni, la Garofalo Infissi è subito diventata un punto di riferimento nella produzione di serramenti e  infissi, grazie alla qualità dei prodotti, alle soluzioni personalizzate, e ai servizi offerti.
Il modernissimo laboratorio artigianale, recentemente costruito in Contrada Mortilli, lungo la Strada Provinciale Castellammare del Golfo – Ponte Bagni, al Km. 2,8, conforme alle normative europee ed italiane sulla sicurezza professionale ed agli standard ottimali previsti per queste tipologie produttive, dotato di attrezzature di ultima generazione, come ad esempio la nuova troncatrice elettronica-digitale che permette di produrre infissi fuori squadra e ad arco.
Gli uffici moderni e funzionali sono pronti ad accogliere i clienti per la preparazione dei preventivi, la definizione tecnica ed economica delle commesse e per visionare i manufatti prodotti dalla ditta esposti in un ampio show room.
Innovazione tecnologica tuttavia non significa affatto abbandono di quella parte del ciclo produttivo storicamente di carattere artigianale, quale la produzione di manufatti in ferro battuto tipici della cultura del territorio.
Dal 2003, anno di inizio delle attività della ns. azienda, abbiamo realizzato e messo in opera centinaia di infissi in alluminio ed in ferro, di qualsiasi tipo, forma, misura e soluzioni di apertura. Abbiamo sempre lavorato su commessa ed a seguito preventivazione dei lavori da eseguire. Operiamo su tutto il territorio nazionale isole comprese.

Gli accoglienti e funzionali uffici, il personale qualificato e gli strumenti informatici adottati permettono di “seguire” il cliente dalla richiesta di offerta/preventivo alla messa in opera della commessa, così come dettato dalle procedure di “qualità” e dalle normative europee.

As far as purchase, less than 7% of the land that became Israel was purchased legally. The rest was taken via expropriation - nationalization of private property after 700,000 Palestinian were driven out by Jewish forces during 1948.""-Credit to [Bumbaclaat](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bumbaclaat), as I am often forced to correct these misonceptions over and over, I am tired of writing, so thanks bumbaclaat.

The British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, so many Jews migrated to Palestine illegally. Over 100,000 people attempted to illegally enter Palestine. There were 142 voyages by 120 ships made to Palestine. The Jews created closed off militaristic farming settlements called kibbutzes when they came and even kicked off Palestinian Jews which they saw as squatters. They actually continued coming in the thousands, year after year, from all over the world. Between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine, but soon this number would grow and increase.

They were, however, NOT from the ""Ottoman Empire"" but mainly from Russia. This post is incredibily dishonest and I am angered by how many upvotes this received.

&gt;and weren't Israeli territorial expansions beyond those agreed upon by the international community a direct result of repeated invasions?

[The UN Charter forbid conquest as a legal form of territorial acquisition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest)

When the Jews invaded Palestinian villages they drove people from their homes, and basically had a shoot to kill policy of anyone attempting to return to their village or home, this decision would later result an the obvious blood feud we have today. Not only that, the Palestinians have the right of return under [UN General Assembly resolution 194](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_194), which was passed on December 11, 1948 and is still not recognized by Israel today.

&gt;(The General Assembly) Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.

Here's some more relevant quotes for you,

What about Jews basically erasing the identity of the native population?

* ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."" Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983. 

* ""Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist... There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population."" Moshe Dayan, address to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.

* ""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai."" David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff. From Ben-Gurion, A Biography, by Michael Ben-Zohar, Delacorte, New York 1978.""

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is that Palestine strikes me as just as contrived a nationality

The Palestinians are not foreigners to the region, as they have a right to be there as proven by genetic testing.

""'Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and Jordan...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills after the Romans expelled the Jews were a potpourri: farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity, descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old Canaanite tribes. -Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, ""Their Promised Land.'""

---------
""But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin."" -Illene Beatty, ""Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.""

Credit to Bumbaclaat for the quotes.

Palestine has existed for hundreds of years, the indigenous and native population(The Palestinians) have lived there for thousands of years. The boarders of Palestine have existed as early as the 1800s. 
Here are some pound notes of Palestine,
http://www.banknotes.com/PS10.JPG

Even the Israeli ""Jerusalem Post"" was called the Palestine post. Don't try this revisionist history stuff here. Don't deny the existence of the native population.

Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and Mongols, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were ravging ...The various cultures exist for brief moments in history before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine.

The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

This matter is very well established, and genetic studies have proven the Palestinians are actually genetically homogeneous among each other and different compared to Arabs in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan. Modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

I'm not going over 3000 years of history with you, but if you'd like, you're free to check out the histories of the people named in the map and in that write up, ""Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders""

&gt;  There are a number of sovereign nations which recognized Hamas as the legitimate government of Gaza, not many of them are G-20 nations, or EU/NATO members, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. 

And? Britain recognized Jordan's annexation of West Bank, what does this mean, that Jerusalem was legally a part of Jordan, or that Britain was trying to obstruct zionism? If Hamas is a legitimate government of Gaza, and Gaza is a de jure state, then there is no problem blockading it, and Hamas brass is liable for the crimes of war committed by allegedly (= not really) non-Hamas groups.

Which is not saying much. ""Der Einfluß der räumlichen Korrelation auf die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit bei bimolekularen Elementarreaktionen in dichten Medien"" and ""Untersuchung des Mechanismus von Zerfallsreaktionen mit einfachem Bindungsbruch und Berechnung ihrer Geschwindigkeitskonstanten auf der Grundlage quantenchemischer und statistischer Methoden"" has nothing to do with nuclear chemistry or physics. Or engineering. Or radiology. Or risk assessement.

She's not competent.

&gt; The 17 reactors have contributed heavily to the European giant's energy needs

This is incorrect. Nuclear power produced only 14% of Germany's electricity, and 11% of total energy.

&gt; Germany hopes to largely replace the lost nuclear energy with renewables such as wind and solar

Already only 4 reactors out of 17 are operating, and there are no shortages. This is all domestically generated, there is negligible additional net imports.

Nuclear is a paper tiger.

&gt; It will be a vital test case for a world fumbling to find the way toward cleaner energy

Not cleaner -- having *sustainable energy* at all. There are no options.

&gt; If Germany of all countries can’t make this work, it will send a bad signal to the rest of the world,

Far worse. If Germany can't make it work, we're fucked. It's over.

&gt; Few in Germany deny it is a gamble. 

It's not a gamble. It's what it happens when you wait long enough until your only option is a rushed last-minute conversion. There are no alternative. Lap up the pie, you made it yourself.

&gt; At present, Germany gets about 23 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants

At present, it's 7 GW. Out of about 50 GW peak at the moment. Look:

http://www.transparency.eex.com/de/

Electricity is about 590 TWh, so if this stays that way that would be more like 9.5%.

&gt; While it is a U-turn for Merkel

It isn't. The phase-out is the slowest she could make it without voters recognizing it as the transparent ruse it is.

&gt; The opposing, and indeed unavoidable, argument is that the cost of electricity will rise. 

No, it won't. More scare-mongering.

&gt; is appalled by the rigid deadline

Rigid? It's the slowest exit they agreed upon during the red-greens, so whence the sudden whining? The current plan allows operation until 2022, actually.

&gt; They are now considering legal action against the government.

And of course Merkel knows this, and in fact set it up to happen that way.

As for inclusivity, the highest tier was generally restricted for Nordic-Aryans (which included the British, but not the European-derived Americans because of their perceived ""melting pot"" heritage) and the lowest invariably included Jews and Gypsies, and usually Slavs and sub-Saharan Africans.  But within those parameters, other peoples status within the hierarchy was relatively flexible or undistinguished.  For instance, it wasn't unheard of for sub-Saharan Africans to be serving with the Wehrmacht in the Mediterranean, and, of course, countless Slavs fought beside Axis forces.

At least that's a general overview.  The actual intricacies of Nazi ideology changed with time, varied between different high-ranking officials, and never really congealed into an ossified doctrine beyond a few overarching principles—arguably by design.",

First and foremost is location, ESPECIALLY with the AK47.  Here in America where we have had assault weapon bans, bans on fully automatic weapons, and a general lack of AK47 manufacture, an AK is somewhat rare.  However, once you cross over to anywhere in Africa, the middle east, Asia, or even Europe in many spots, the AK47 is absurdly common.  In many African nations, I would assume you could get an AK47 for far below $100.  This is likely why they chose to buy real guns instead of props, but this is also a risky maneuver for obvious reasons.

Excluding location as a factor, prop guns can have a range as well.  Fully firing AK47 propane like we have were at one time live guns, simply converted to only chamber blank rounds.  As such, they cost about the same as a regular AK, plus a little to covert them.  But this is a company cost, the customer cost is a rental fee, which may be as much as $300 per gun per week.

For rubber replicas, the initial cost of a mold is very high, but once that is made, cost drops significantly.  However, even after the cast, they have to be scented, and all this costs time and thus money.

Aieaoft replicas will be fairly expensive too if you're looking for quality.  As such, buying cheaply over seas and not having to deal with American prices or American laws is not such a bad idea.",

Think of it this way. When you're standing on the ground, you are rotating along with the surface of the Earth. If you jump so that both your feet are off the ground, the Earth doesn't suddenly slip away under your feet, because you continue rotating at the same speed along with the Earth.

You might argue that this is because a jump is relatively brief, and if you were to stay aloft for a few hours, then the Earth would turn underneath you. But this doesn't happen either. Get in a hot air balloon, go up a couple hundred feet to break your contact with the ground, then stay there for a whole day if you like. You'll still be over the same spot where you took off from, the Earth won't rotate under you. You might drift randomly a bit due to local winds, but on a still day, not even that.

Because of inertia, an object in motion stays in motion, *unless* acted upon by an external force. Inertia will keep you moving at the same speed (the speed of rotation of the Earth's surface where you were standing) forever, *unless* some outside force acts on you. So what are the forces acting on you when you jump in the air or float up on a balloon?

Gravity is the only one (disregarding wind for the moment). Gravity ensures that your path continues to curve with the Earth rather than flying off at a tangent. But this is exactly what gravity was doing when you were standing on the surface too, so there is no change there. The atmosphere could slow you down and let the Earth slip away from under you, **IF** the atmosphere were stationary with respect to the Earth. But the atmosphere spins with Earth at a matching velocity, so that won't happen either. This is why you would continue sitting right over the same spot in your balloon, until the fuel ran out. Again, local winds might randomly push you in one direction or another, but this is not a systematic effect of the Earth's rotation.

Now given these facts, there is still stuff to explain regarding aircraft. These questions often cause confusion given the simple explanations given above, because they seem to contradict those explanations. Namely:

1. Why do airplanes take less time to go from west to east (say New York to London) than from east to west (London to New York)?
2. Why do aircraft sometimes have to make corrections for the Earth's rotation on north-south trips?

The answers to the two questions are different.

**East - West or West - East Travel**

Since the atmosphere as a whole spins along with the Earth at a matching speed, the trip east to west should take exactly as long as the trip west to east. But it doesn't. Why?

It's because of headwinds and tailwinds. There is a pattern of winds over the Earth - the [trade winds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_wind) and the [westerlies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies) that blow in some preferred direction. Over most flight paths through North America and Europe, the relevant wind zone is the westerlies, which blow from west to east. Therefore a plane going from NY to London usually has a tailwind, and makes a faster trip than the same plane on the return trip, when it has a headwind to fight against. You have to remember that winds are pretty strong at the altitudes at which planes fly. An ""average"" wind at these altitudes of 80 mph is about 15% of the cruising speed of an airliner, so it would create a 15% + 15% = 30% difference between the east-west and west-east times of the aircraft. That can be pretty significant on longer trips.

**North-South or South-North Travel**

This causes a different problem. Aircraft traveling long distances in these directions need to aim for a point slightly east or west of their intended location, in order to reach it. This is indeed due to the spin of the Earth, but not in the sense that Earth is slipping away under them while they are stationary. This is actually due to the [Coriolis Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect).

Here's a simple way to understand what's happening. Suppose you are at latitude 20 North, and wish to fly northwards to your destination at latitude 50 North. Remember that the Earth spins with some constant angular velocity, so the transverse movement of the surface is maximum at the equator, and zero at the poles. Obviously, since 20 N is closer to the equator than 50 N, you are spinning faster when you are at 20 N than when you are at 50 N. Your *angular velocity* is the same, but the *transverse velocities* are different.

So when you take off at 20 N, you are spinning eastwards along with the Earth at say 400 mph (just made up that number for illustration, don't take it literally). But your destination at 50 N is only spinning eastward at 200 mph, because it's farther north. That difference in eastward transverse velocities will make you end up east of your intended destination, unless you make a course correction. Similarly, if you were flying from north to south, you would end up west of your destination.

These directions are for the northern hemisphere. The effects would be the opposite in the southern hemisphere. You can generalize it for the whole Earth by saying that objects moving away from the equator curve eastwards, while object moving towards the equator curve westwards. This is the Coriolis Effect.

The Coriolis Effect is actually very small, because of the Earth's slow angular velocity (takes 24 hours to spin once). Over short distances you wouldn't even notice it. However, it needs to be corrected for in long range flights or long range ballistic trajectories that go in a north-south or south-north direction.

Finally, I should mention that the permanent winds I mentioned in the first section (east west travel) - the trade winds and the westerlies, are actually also partially dependent upon the Coriolis Effect. Winds are driven by temperature and pressure differentials, which are caused by differing solar insolation over the Earth's surface, which creates high and low pressure centers. Winds flow from high pressure to low pressure areas. However, when flowing north-south or south-north, they are also affected by the Coriolis Effect. This is what curves the trade winds westwards, or the westerlies eastwards. So you could say that east-west flight times are also caused by the Coriolis Effect, which in turn is caused by the rotation of the Earth. Both east/west and north/south flight are affected by the Coriolis Effect, but in a somewhat complex way as I've described. It's not a simple matter of the Earth spinning away under you.",

They specialize in competitive pokemon battling, and you'll find people are much more knowledgeable about it there.

I'd start [here](http://www.smogon.com/dp/articles/).  Those articles were written during the 4th generation (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum), but contain information that's general enough to be helpful.  You definitely need to know things like what items/berries do, EVs, IVs, Natures, how Hidden Power works, and more, and those articles cover that.

From there, go to the RMT (Rate My Team) forums, and read as many of the posts there as you can.  See how people try to build teams, and see what criticism people give them.  Also, check out the teams of last generation: there's a giant archive thread [here](http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=76508).

If you want to get battling experience, download the [Pokemon Online](http://pokemon-online.eu/) simulator.  It's a stand alone simulator of the Pokemon battle system.  It allows you to set up a team and see how it would perform against others, with feedback that's much quicker than you can get in Wi-Fi battles.

If you're interested in a specific pokemon, do a google search for ""&lt;pokemonname&gt; smogon analysis"" to find the forum posting for the writeup on that specific pokemon.  The writeups will give example movesets and strategies relevant to that pokemon, including what pokemon you should team it up with, and what strategies/pokemon are dangerous to what you picked.

Whimsicott is a good lead (in a doubles match, at least, I don't know how well he works in singles), but you should read the analyses to understand what its strengths and weaknesses are.  

And F.E.A.R. isn't a real strategy.  It's a gimmick that will, at best, kill one pokemon on the other team, and only if the other person has no idea why you're sending a level 1 pokemon at him (anyone with any battling experience will know what you're doing).  Spikes/Stealth Rock (breaks your Focus Sash), sandstorm/hail (again, breaks the Sash), Iron Barbs/Rocky Helmet/any other ability that damages you on contact, burn/poison/Toxic damage, Protect... the list goes on, and there's no way you'll come across a team that doesn't have *one* of those things.

I am all for social programs provided by the states to accomplish these kinds of things.

Anyway, parenthood is not easy -- it never has been. It is, however, a job that every generation has done, and a lot of people today want to continue to do, but can't for one reason or another. As I stated before, there are more people wanting to adopt infants than there are infants available for adoption in the US. It isn't a 20 commitment then, just 10 months.

&gt;There is also a pull back on social safety nets in our country, sure you saved a child but endangered them to poverty and unfit parents.

I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. Would you agree with the statement that ""it is better not to live than to have a difficult childhood?""",Christian (Cross)

Well, religion is foremostly an expression of needs, that serve a certain beneficial goal for a group of people. So religion is not very restricted in the way it can emerge. A sociologist like Émile Durkheim has very interesting theories concerning religion and it's function in society. By studying aboriginal groups he noticed how the totems they honored in their religion were actually a representation of the strong point of the society itself, thus it served the purpose of unification and group cohesion. If we apply this model on modern societies, you might draw the conclusion that the US' sacred realm must be different than Europe's. This leads to theories regarding civil religion (like by Robert Bellah) that describe a community's differences by pointing out the values and other customs we regard 'sacred'. 
Anyway, I'm rambling. The most striking form of religious flexibility I find to be the long gone notion of 'minhag' in Judaism. Basically, it states that when a group of Jews immigrate and adapt to a society, certain customs may be integrated that are nowhere found in other communities. Although they might differ, these customs are okay and will be part of Jewish Halachah (law) because these are part of the cultural majority. 
Another example: in the 19th century in the Netherlands there was a phenomena called pillarization. Every Christian denomination had it's own facilities and contact was often hostile, not to speak of marriage outside your denomination. This was nationally and regarded as the normal way to go. But in the '6o this system collapsed, churches began to stream empty and the Reformed soccer club flooded with Catholics so to speak. Now, not even 50 years later, Evangelicalism is the way to go. A system that depends on very different organisation than the Reformed churches: charismatic leadership vs theologically schooled ministers, a network of independent churches vs a hierarchical system, emphasis on emotion and spirituality vs rational belief and stoicism. Anyway, you might be right about the clinging to certain values, absolutely, but the religion that appealed to my grandparents, ceizes to exist in todays world. Anyway, I must have a reader lying around from my sociology classes, if you're interested I can mail you some stuff.

And regarding the second point, I was a little sarcastic. I really am not a supporter of religious violence in any way. ;)

I agree with your last part, in a way that it's time we challenge eachother, but also grant our Islamic neighbours their Mosque. I remember the moment it started to dawn on me that I might be wrong about my Christian faith, it was the moment some random guy on the internet took the time to write me a 2000 word reply to all my questions and worries. It was the moment I had the idea someone was sensible towards me and my beliefs, because he understood what was at stake for me.",

Moreover, having won 3 of the last 6 Champions Leagues, and 4 total, Barça is now among the best ever as far as results in Europe and is easily the most successful club of the 21st Century in terms of results.

However, on a purely personal level, Guardiola's Barça has brought me the most joy in all my years of watching sports (not just football) and this would have been true even if they had won no titles. The titles are deeply satisfying, because they prove a team doesn't have to sacrifice style to win trophies, but above and beyond the laurels what really makes this team special to me is that all this success is based on a solid philosophy of nurturing players and teaching them a truly innovative style of play which on the pitch manifests itself as a profound connection between 11 players who are all working for the team always while still showcasing the individual brilliance of some of those most astonishing talents I have ever seen.

It's not like there was a terra nullius they just happened upon.  Everyone only goes back to 1946 as if that date is so special.  This all really began in WWI when the last sovereign nation to rule that territory still existed, the Ottoman Empire.  The Ottoman empire dissolved and the territory fell under mandate from the league of nations which was administered by the British empire (we all know what a bang up job the british do with that).  Aside from their historic incompetence at administering foreign territories was their favoritism for the establishment of a jewish state.  I'm not going to pretend to understand what motivated british politics at this time, whether they were true believers in the calls of zionism or just wanted to be rid of jews like everyone else in europe since the high middle ages.  We do know however that the British pledged their support to the establishment of a jewish state in the area of Palestine as early as 1917 from the [Balfour Decleration](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917) Whether or not they intended to fully deliver on this became irrelevant following WWII.  The holocaust was the turning point of centuries history building up to the nation state and the era of imperialism.  What the nazis practiced was the culmination of european dominance over colonial territories distilled and purified to a frightening perfection.  They practiced at home what everyone else was doing away, and it was then the west realized how horrific they'd become, an honor allegedly belonging to the war to end all wars.  

The collective guilt of the holocaust was to signal the beginning of the end of old world imperialism.  From there came the dismantling of their former colonial holdings.  The jewish problem still persisted and this was in an environment of centuries old prejudices and institutionalized persecution with the new threat of a cold war.  Establishing a jewish state anywhere was a problem of ""not in my backyard.""  The easier solution was to leverage their dominance over a weaker people to solve the jewish question, much the same way a modern nation would send unwanted toxic waste to a third world country.  This is particularly telling in the lead up to WWII when the jews are fleeing germany and no one will take them, not the neighboring european nations, nor the U.S.  The irony that the U.S. turned back jews fleeing hitler's germany and we're the great moral keepers of ""never again!""  Meanwhile from the establishment of the [mandate of palestine](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine#The_Jewish_Yishuv) to the conclusion of WWII the jewish population almost doubled.

Basically there were zionist efforts in place that were further legitimized beyond any reasonable expectations as a result of collective western guilt over the holocaust.  It was an easy out, but merely moved one problem onto someone else's lawn.  The fact that there wasn't a palestinian for each and every square foot of land is irrelevant.  There was no jewish state and justifying the establishment of such psuedo-theocracy is absurd.  It's part of the heritage of empire, like a relative who dies and leaves you all their debt, but we don't have to own it simply because we fear being antisemitic (which is just stupid cause most of the paletsinians are semites).",

They believe you can only save money by spending less, even if it causes penny-wise and pound-foolish behavior. Just take the bigger picture: How much greater revenue will the government get due to GM profits, and future higher GM profits than otherwise, profits from suppliers, income tax from workers that weren't laid off, welfare savings from those saved jobs, increased consumer spending (the motor of the economy) from having people in work? Etc.

It's basic Keynesian economics - government spending doesn't cost as much as it appears to cost on the balance sheet. And savings during a recession can end up costing more than you save. (Several European nations are now providing live demonstrations of how counterproductive austerity can be)

It's not like this is news, countercyclical policies are well-established by now. It's just that the Right is happy to exploit people's ignorance while whipping up hysteria about the budget deficit. After eight years of unfinanced wars and tax-breaks, statements that ""Reagan proved deficits don't matter"" and with a staunch refusal to even consider raising taxes to Clinton (much less Reagan) levels, you'd think people would realize the hypocrisy.

Unlike a household (in particular a US one), the government isn't about to go broke for posting losses for a few years. It's got plenty of assets and even now, no problems borrowing money. (see the treasury rates) The current budget isn't sustainable, but as long as things even out over a cycle of the economy, you're fine. But if you post losses when the economy is in a boom, then you're in deep trouble.

The problem here is that the Republicans simply don't give a damn about a balanced budget, except as a tool for forcing through their goal of budget cuts. They've got no interest in 'the company' posting a profit, because their ultimate goal is to shut it down. And who can blame them, given that it's a tactic that obviously works for them?

The sad fact is that it _doesn't matter_ whether or not TARP or the auto bailouts worked. They won't even say ""It works but we're against it, since it represents an expansion of the role of government."" Instead they just spin their own narrative, and their voters will eat it up. In 1996, a majority of Republican voters thought the deficit had _increased_ under Clinton. So there's no question they'll focus on whatever negative facts they can dig up, spin or outright fabricate. The question is why anyone still takes the Republicans seriously when they talk about 'fiscal responsibility'.

The problem is that London is the economic powerhouse of the country - and successive governments don't care about it (if anything they promote it by not being willing to make it worth investing elsewhere - such as decent rail/air/road transport). There IS a reason why London and the South East is overcrowded and expensive - because that's where all the (decent) jobs are.

Since London is so rich, it is effectively supporting its own poor people - and that of the rest of the country too.

Just about every other part of the country requires subsidy - and in the case of some parts, EU subsidy too.

I think the case for subsidising towns in the same country as your own because they are not economically independent is not quite the same as giving aid to a country that clearly can afford to look after itself now.

It would also be a bureaucratic nightmare to somehow ringfence taxation based on what town it came from, and would you deny giving a less wealthy settlement some money because of that ringfencing? It is much easier to deny aid based on country - that is after all how they give it out in the first place - it's not some big lump sum for developing countries to fight over.

Israel wasn't the cause of the refugee problem the arabs were, and they admit it.

The Arab legions were the true cause of the refugee problem because they spreed blood libel about what the jews would do to the arabs if overtaken.

&gt; Some Palestinian leaders actually circulated false rumors that women had been raped. When confronted with the reality that no rapes had taken place a Palestinian leader said, ""We just have to say this, so that the Arab armies will come to liberate us from the Jews."" Haazam Nuseibi a journalist at the time told the bbc years later that the deliberate fabrication of the rape charge "" was our biggest mistake... as soon as they header that the women had been raped at Deir Yassin, Palestinians fled in Terror.""


In his 1972 memoirs, the former prime minister of syria, Kahlid al- Azm, placed the entire blame for the refugee problem on the arabs:

&gt; Since 1948 it is we who demanded the return of the refugees while it is we who made them leave. We brought disaster upon arab refugees, by invading them and bringing pressure to bear upon them to leave. We have rendered them dispossessed. we have accused to them to begging. we have particulated inaptly in lowering their moral and social level. Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder and arson, and throwing bombs upon them.


Even Mahmoud Abbas has said the following "" (Arab armies ) Forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland and threw them into prisons similar to which the ghettos in wich the Jews used to live.
I understand the Jewish perspective, but the world today is not the same. Jews in Europe and the US have no reason to go to Israel other than their belief that they somehow have a religious or genetic connection to the land.

Now the kill count.

During 2000-2005 When Israel was getting attacked by suicide bombers left right and center. They simply have better medical facilities, far more Israelis would have died if they didn't have such good care. They actually offered to treat all Palestinians during the second intifada. However, the Palestinians wouldn't have it, and it's a shame because It would have saved a lot of their lives. However, one could argue that the more Palestinians die the better for them, at least, because then someone can put up a graph like this and get responses from people like yourself (no offence).

Although you implied that it was illegitimate for Israel to have caused that many deaths because the Palestinian rockets hadn't killed that many people, I'm going to argue that this is exactly what Hamas wants. They fire rockets meant to terrorize a population, thousands and thousands of them 10,000 before the gaza war actually. This forces retaliation by Israel because they can't just let them keep shooting rockets at their civilian population it is terrorizing them ( A study found that between 75 percent and 94 percent of Sderot children aged 4–18 exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress. 28 percent of adults and 30 percent of children had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76438). Anyhow because Israel is forced to act they bomb gaza and try to avoid killing civilians, because believe it or not it's bad for them to kill civlians. However, it's hard to be perfect especially when Hamas hides among the civilian population. Hezbollah does and did the same thing during the 2006 war and that is why I really don't have any sympathy when people complain of high death count if your that pissed off about it then don't let terrorists launch rockets from your childrens school.

Usury, or loaning money at interest, was barred by Christians in the 13th Century, and as such the Jews had no way of making any money whatsoever. As such, they were of no use to the crown's purse, and were expelled.

Yes, the indigenous people do have rights as a collective.  They inhabit their land as a collective, and they are entitled to ""just compensation"" for the eminent domain seizure of their land.  Seeing as they reside on a piece of land with extraordinary value in terms of energy generating capacity (11 Gigawatts is huge huge huge), we're talking about compensation in the 10's of billions of dollars.  Perhaps property law works differently in Brazil, but we must ask ourselves whether the fundamental principles underlying U.S. property law should apply everywhere.  (I recognize that U.S. history with regard to indigenous populations is abhorrent, but the principles remain, and the same mistakes need not be made again.)

Here's a relevant hypothetical example: Say I own 25% of the mineral rights on a ranch that just had a huge oil discovery.  Until my partners and I agree to some sort of deal with an energy company, no one has the right to come and extract those resources.  We are the ones with the bargaining power.  If for *any* reason we don't like the deal, we can walk away and decide to wait until someone gives us a better offer.  On the other hand, if it's an eminent domain situation with a state run energy company, we at least know that by law we must be justly compensated.

&gt;people don't have a right to a particular lifestyle

People have right to live whatever lifestyle they want on their own land.  If they can live in a way that is self-sustaining on their own land, who's to stop them?  They aren't tradesmen who need to rely on being competitive in an ever-changing economy.  No, they live on their own land and mind their own business.  As such, modernization poses no threat to them because they are not incorporated into modern systems nor do they rely on such systems to satisfy their needs.  The only threat that modernization poses is that it will overstep its bounds and encroach onto their land.  If you prefer to say, ""Well it's really Brazil's land,"" then it becomes a matter of ""just compensation"" as noted above.  Nevertheless, I think a very strong argument could be made that these people deserve the same rights that a sovereign country with it's own globally recognized borders would enjoy.

&gt;these stone age indians living in the jungle

I sense in your description and tone a significant bias against their way of life.  In terms of sustainability and environmental stewardship, their way of life would probably score pretty high.  If they are happy living without modern amenities like TVs, cell phones, air conditioning, etc. who are we to judge them?  It's their own choice.  Are we justified in decimating their way of life just so others can have access to the very things that they are perfectly content to live without?

&gt;By giving them a vote and a voice, which they have exercised, and certain guaranteed essential liberties, which were perserved. Beyond that, they lost. That's the end of it.

Brazil didn't give them a voice, they always had a voice.  Brazil simply gave them a platform for their voice to be heard for a brief time.  But did Brazil listen to what they had to say?  No, because their ""votes"" weren't enough.  Of course their votes weren't enough!  They are a tiny minority that inhabits a tiny region of the country.  Suggesting that the voting system fairly represents them is just a fool's argument that attempts to legitimize the taking of their land.  Suppose all of Europe had been able to vote on whether Switzerland should be part of the EU?  In such a setup, the votes of the 77% of Swiss citizens who voted on March 4, 2001 not to join the EU wouldn't have really mattered.  Just as the Swiss people are a distinct and unique group within Europe, so too are the indigenous people a distinct and unique group within Brazil.  They ought to be given the freedom to choose their own future.",

&gt; Similarly with religion, if someone is religious then leave them be, you shouldn't feel the need to challenge them on it unless they decide to force their views on everyone else.

People who keep their religious belief to themselves won't find themselves challenged very much. That's the way life works in most of Western Europe, but not so in the US. Religious belief is not only tolerated but *expected,* to the degree that religious messages are found in our media, advertising and our politics.

However, God-belief is a fairly defining characteristic in a person, much moreso than owning a smartphone anyway.

You were, but regardless. A smartphone is a physical object. An argument or a belief reflects back on the person who espouses it. By disputing my argument that ""god belief is stupid"" is not an *ad hominem* attack you are claiming that I attack anybody who espouses god belief rather than the belief itself.

European cities, mainly the ones built in the medieval era used churches as their city centers, along with a few other buildings, like a palace, and were usually walled in, so the streets were laid out to emphasize these features.  Because of the walls, cities were usually very compact, and they laid streets where ever they had space.  American cities where more built on simplicity and egalitarianism, not to emphasize a certain building.

Fractional reserve as a system is quite good, but it must be national, for and by the people.

&gt; Don't care about the US, and neither should you.

Couldn't disagree more... NZ is tied up significantly from a financial standpoint - not including trade and loans to NZ and foreign banks that Kiwis then borrow from, most of the so called wealth producing funds sold by financial advisers have a number of US based components; this includes parts of KiwiSaver. Plus, every commodity in the world is priced in US$, so whether you choose to ignore it, the US is integral to the global economy. 

&gt; Banking gives us the opportunity to store wealth for use at a later date

On the surface that's true, but does the interest (minus fees and tax) keep the purchasing power of a 1980's $100 the same in 2011? No, is the simple answer. 

&gt; Greed exists wherever there is people, regardless of the presence of money. It is inherent in a world with finite resources, and is in no way restricted to banking.

Completely agree, which is why enforced and fair regulation, with an understanding that greed is human nature, must take place. Private banks self regulation is like putting the fox in the chicken coop.

&gt; Given that people place an arbitrarily high value on silver (due to the mistaken view that it is a safe store of value), silver is an easy target.

The CFTC, CME, US DoJ and LBMA et al are complicit - they're supposedly the police of the markets... 

Again, a little ironically, and related to the 'banking system storing wealth for later' and ""the mistaken view that it is a safe store of value"", the sytem and who runs it became apparent to me around 2004 and I moved from the UK to NZ, as the UK / US / Europe banking fraud and corruption was amazing - what was also amazing was the banks were being given help by the various administrations!. 

As I've watched the global economy crumble over the last five or six years (I trade forex and metals for my living), I've been buying physical gold and silver every month since 2008 - and as a store of wealth, silver and gold have beaten my paper Kiwi dollar by quite a considerable margin. So, calling it a biblical era savings plan is fine, but it's efficacy as a store of wealth is undeniable.

Oh how you can be SO wrong. You need to STOP buying into this MYTH.

The Kokoda Campaign was NOT won by successive allied assaults due to superior ingenuity by the Australians, the ONLY reason we won the Kokoda Campaign was because the Japanese had over stretched their supply lines and were no longer able to move fresh men and ammunition up into the area of Operations. 

You see it was the AIF that had stretched itself initially after pushing up the track to meet the Japanese, but it was ONLY after the AIF had moved back to an area where their supply lines and reinforcement routes were shorter then the Japanese that they could A) Move in the superior fighting forces of the AIF as compared to the Militia. B) Move serious amounts of equipment up the track. C) Clear away available jungle areas so that United States C-47 Skytrains could offload cargo.

That on top of the help issued by the FWA's helped them being able to move men quicker and supplies easier then the Japanese.

The Japanese ONLY lost the Kokoda Campaign because it was a rushed and ill-thought out operation. You're an idiot if you think that it was some magical on the spot learning from the AIF that saved Kokoda. (which I might point out, you've misspelt wrong, HOLY SHIT LEARN TO PROOF READ)

&gt;Also you really need to stop making things up, the King tiger was not developed in response to the T-34 and in fact the T-34 was out gunned by the Tiger-1 tank. Besides, having a bigger gun then other tanks does not a good tank make.

You're an idiot mate. The idea of a super tank had been around since the late 30's for a few European nations, but none of them saw action until well into the war. The KT was rushed into production after the battle of Kursk in which the T-34's went thought the the Tiger I's like a hot knife. The TI had a superior gun to the T-34 but lacked the T-34's sloped armour to deflect shots up and away from it, unlike the KT which nicluced an even superior gun and had total immunity from allied AT.

The King Tiger was THE most powerful tank fielded by ANY army in WWII, it had the most powerful main gun and it's frontal armour made it totally immune to ANY allied Anti-Tank weaponry. It was so effective the Russians would use set piece artillery that they had hidden in bushes and tree lines to try and use sheer kinetic energy to destroy them. This tactic while successful was extremely dangerous as artillery pieces are very hard to move in comparison to AT weaponry.

&gt;Also dont forget that before invading Russia in 1941, the German army had conquered France, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands. The majority of their army had combat experience.


No. No. No. No. NO!

The German Army units that took place in Operation Barbarossa DID have elements of their combat units operated by men from the earlier operations in Western Europe, but they deployed in total, 3.3 Million Men into Barbarossa while still keeping a toe hold on France AND North Africa. Your knowledge of WWII is lackluster at best, and you're obviously relying on things like Wikipedia to prove your points, which you're not doing very well at all might I say.

&gt;Its not that I have misread what you have written, but rather that you jump from point to point in a desperate attempt to defend a statement that you didn't think through. You are trying to weasel away from your original statement (see above) which you know you can't defend.

Explain to me this then: 

&gt;How are you meant to learn how to fight when you're sitting around doing nothing.
Armies learn to fight by fighting, not sitting in class rooms.

That there was my original comment, what that comment says is that Armies learn how to better themselves by evaluating and annalysing their mistakes and successes in combat, that is the TRUE key to being a **professional** army. Seeing as you think I'm trying to weasel my way out of things when all I've done is reinforce my stance with historical facts. From WWI ANZAC's, to WWI Wehrmacht and Russian tactics.

&gt;I also notice that you didn't address either of my points about our specialists fighting overseas or our joint training with our allies. Nor did you address whether we should start a war with a similarly developed power.

you know what. fuck it. You're obviously a civilian and never pulled on a uniform in your entire life. I'm sick of trying to explain how modern, professional armies operate in ways to better their training and field tactics by using assessments and evaluations of its own and it's neighbours fighting abilities.

I just pray to what ever God exists that if we are attacked, spastics like you stay as far away from a command and control interface.

/end of discussion, cannot be fucked wasting more time trying to drill into your head that training manuals are written after action has taken place and new and better ideas and tactics are invented.

It was part of a series of short campaigns I ran in this world.  Each was about 6 or 8 sessions long, then we rotated GMs to the other campaigns I mentioned in this thread: PowerDay and the one with the one handed kid and a few others) then we'd rotate back to this world and pick up new characters.  I wanted to investigate the world situation more than one specific place or idea.

The first in this series was about a massive invasion of North America by the Russians that uses a horrible plague to kill almost everyone, and the PC's were immune innocents caught up in it.  Then this campaign happened in Europe, a year after the invasion, when Europe was going nuts with self-protectionism and trying to keep to boogeymen and the plague out.  The political upheaval was still going on and these sorts of activist groups were common.

I moved away from my group in Ottawa shortly after this campaign ran ( :-( ), but the next stage I had planned was that Israel and the entire area was nuked into a glass parking lot.  The PCs were going to be Jewish Israeli refugees in a northern Australian refugee camp.  One of their member was going to be an Israeli scientist who had worked out the antidote/innoculation against the plague.  It would be suicide to just announce it, especially in the camp, and the politics among the Israelis trying to figure out how to leverage this incredible discovery into a new homeland would be neat.

After that, I only had some vague ideas, but I was thinking about a few things:

- the characters are very low-tech aboriginals in Africa when refugees from Europe and the middle east start to move in.  My group was very big on quality role play so I was thinking this would be a neat challenge.

- the characters are gun runners on the mediterranean among the new political mess the world is in.",

Palestinians refugee relatives abroad cannot return to Israel whereas Jews automatically qualify for citizenship because they are ""refugees"". 

There are no refugees left from the Jewish diaspora, so it's qualitatively very different, and equating the two is perverse. Zionism began simply as a movement to immigrate back to the region, and was not a nationalist movement. The newcomers in the 20th century and especially after WWII definitely brought a nationalist mindset.

what about the rights of the 1.5 million palestinian-israelis and of the rights of the 700,000 refugees who were kicked out in 1948 ?

The Palestinians are native to the land as proven by genetic testing. 

Why are you putting words in the Palestinians mouths? None of which you claim is true.

 Israel expanded beyond the partition plan boundaries, kicking out 700,000 Arab civilians and causing a massive refugee criss, and subsequently had repeatedly attacked Egypt in 1954 and again in 1956.

The Jews from Europe wanted to be nationalized into a country in which they had never lived and in which they had no intention of being loyal to so they can live in a property inhabited by other people, what's your point?

* ""We came to this country which was already populated by Arabs, and we are establishing a Hebrew, that is a Jewish, state here...Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages...There is not a single community in the country that did not have a former Arab population."" Israeli leader, Moshe Dayan, quoted in Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi's ""Original Sins.""

'Only an internal revolution can have the power to heal our people of their murderous sickness of causeless hatred...It is bound to bring complete ruin upon us. Only then will the old and young in our land realize how great was our responsibility to those miserable Arab refugees in whose towns we have settled Jews who were brought here from afar; whose homes we have inherited, whose fields we now sow and harvest; the fruits of whose gardens, orchards and vineyards we gather; and in whose cities that we robbed we put up houses of education, charity, and prayer, while we babble and rave about being the ""People of the Book"" and the ""light of the nations""'

Lehi would support sabotage and espionage operations in the Middle East and in eastern Europe anywhere where they had cells. Stern also proposed to recruit some 40,000 Jews from occupied Europe to invade Palestine with German support to oust the British who had legal mandate and wanted to give the land to its native and original owners, the Palestinians.

On 11 January 1941, Vice Admiral Ralf von der Marwitz, the German Naval attaché in Turkey, filed a report (the ""Ankara document"") conveying an offer by Lehi to ""actively take part in the war on Germany's side

Lehi proposed intervening in World War II on the side of Nazi Germany. It offered assistance in transferring the Jews of Europe to Palestine, in return for Germany's help in expelling Britain from Mandatory Palestine. 

So basically, they would help fight the British and destroy the allies, who would basically end up saving the Jews from concentration camps.

So they helped Germany deport the Jews who were living in Germany and wanted to live in Germany, in return for Germany's help in expelling Britain from Mandatory Palestine.. How are you going to tell me that's not immoral?

There's nothing odious about a man fighting for freedom from the British (who had, btw, promised to establish a Jewish homeland on his people's land) to talk to the German leader, who was fighting against the British. Please use your common sense.

In fact, the Mufti wanted to do the same thing that the Lehi wanted, expel the British.

If we're comparing the merits of socialism versus social democracy, then ""pure"" socialism is better for the simple reason that it replaces capitalism. Under social democracy, you have capitalism (albeit alongside a strong welfare state), which is a problem for several reasons:

* Social democracy is an adversarial half-way solution, an arranged marriage that is doomed to failure. Capitalism, by it's very nature, will try to reduce the size/scope welfare state because it will see it as unnecessarily constricting through corporate regulation/taxation and/or seeing taxpayer dollars going to the welfare state as something to be appropriated. Look at all of the European social democracies that have become neoliberal states. 

* Capitalism, under any system, is immoral. Workers' labor is still exploited by the rich, who keep getting richer on the backs of the people who actually perform the labor, whereas executives do relatively little work, and investors do absolutely *none*. And yet they reap the benefits of the many. And let's not forget things like wars for oil and defense contracts, environmental devastation, abuse of third-world peoples by major corporations, etc. 

* Capitalism is unstable. Instability is built into the system, in that things like ""bubbles"" and their inevitable bursting, banks gaming the system, etc., often run unchecked and wreak havoc on world markets, sending them into a tailspin and decreasing the quality of life for literally billions of people in ""advanced"" capitalist world markets. Check out David Harvey's excellent speech/animated video *[The Crises of Capitalism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOP2V_np2c0)* where he talks about the real reasons that led to the Great Recession. 
 
* Capitalism uses ""shocks"" to survive. Watch Naomi Klein's *[The Shock Doctrine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4pLoFIKmE&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL14AEE516BDE72CAE)*. In it she lays out her theory as to how capitalist societies use crises (natural or artificial, real or imagined) such as wars, natural disasters, economic problems, etc., to push through a radical, right-wing agenda when people are too frightened/distracted to care. 

* Capitalism stunts human growth. In the workplace, people are often looked at as just another commodity, like a lighting fixture. The ""rat race"" is a dehumanizing grind that treats a human being like oxen to squeeze every last drop of productivity out of them without having to hire another person and pay them. This constant stress diminishes human potential and leads to many health problems, both physical and psychological. 

* Capitalism, with all its talk of innovation, stunts scientific achievement. If something cannot be immediately commercialized, it might not get funded. NASA is one example of science done right, but their budget is notoriously prone to budget cuts. Meanwhile, the war corporations get lots of government subsidies, and I've read that half of the government scientists work for the military in some capacity. Scientifically-supported natural medicines are heavily suppressed so that a friend of mine has to pay $300/a month for a *single* prescription of Cymbalta (true story). Under socialism, all science would serve the public good, and be bestowed upon society instead of developed for profit and war.

It's also worth noting that the post-Industrialized world was quite obsessed with questions about ""the racial other.""  To the white world, Jews were undercover.  You can oppress a black person, an Asian person, an Hispanic person, a Native indigenous person, a Rom instantaneously because you can see it in their face and their language.  You can even deny them freedoms and wealth through systems of institutionalized oppression.

But Jews?  Jews didn't rely on the Anglicized white western world as the source of their wealth and education the same way that Italians or the Irish did through soft integration.  They had to learn how to be independently educated in the face of centuries of European oppression, and this systematic cultural self-identification along ethnic lines, which was actually imposed by *other white people*, led to a group of whites who are separate from other whites.

The irony is that, despite having plenty of economic power, they lacked the degree of integration needed to wield political power in much of the Western World, which is why they were so easily made targets.  They were a powerful *other* that could blend in with mainstream white society while not relying upon it for its survival, its education, its culture, or its moral and ethical beliefs.  A HUGE threat, and an easy scapegoat.

Also worth noting, there was no Jewish European national identity.  They were, in fact, some form of the other in countries that were constantly being pulled back and forth between Christian majorities.",

Case in point...we went to Granada, Spain back in 2007.

Shockingly, we entered a couple of places and they both said they were closing at midnight.  At the 2nd place we were really surprised so we asked the waiter---why are you closing at midnight?  We thought bars didn't close til 6am....
Bartender says, is a new EU directive.  We can't be open past midnight. Of course my british friends went apeshit, and as they told me, ""you see, this is what happens when the EU takes over.  They start taking away the country's cultural identity.""
 
Anyway, we had to go to another side of town to find restaurants open as those for whatever reason didn't violate the Eu directive.  
Granted---I have no idea if the bartender was talking the truth or not, but my point is that I think brits believe that the EU is there to take away national pride, and that's one reason they are eurosceptic.

Now, given the number of muslim refugees/illegal immigrants pouring into Europe now, and given that most of them have 3, 4 children, and most are all on welfare, eventually europe might turn to  shariah law, so all that cultural identity will be all gone anyway. :D

I know they have probably mixed this up because unlike the brown rat the Polynesian rat only mate seasonally - and because I've seen those numbers quoted before - its a common bit of hyperbole. 

These rats are also much  unlikely to become pregnant with a new litter before weaning IIRC - unlike brown rats.

&gt; Actually, this is good evidence for my part;

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

&gt; France has the lowest energy costs in Europe

That's because France still subcribes to the le Roi-Soleil autocratic model. Areva is &gt;90% state owned, and needs to be bailed out by the French taxpayer. The actual electricity costs are estimated to be south of 60 EUR/MWh. 

And of course France had its national peak uranium around 1985 http://www.theoildrum.com/files/Uranium_Production_In_France.png and needs to import it. Because http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%C3%A9nix is a failure as are all http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor as is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing nuclear power is not renewable.

&gt; Breeders and fuel processing have both stagnated because of a lack of urgency (uranium is cheap)

As nuclear power isn't cheap, and breeder/fuel reprocessing is considerably more expensive, and thin-film PV should be cheaper than coal in less than a decade the sun is setting on the nuclear power industry.

&gt; I utterly reject your contention that it is a technology failure.

Nuclear power production goes back to steam engines. Even steam turbines (technology producing 80% of all electricity world-wide) has been invented in the modern form 1884. Nuclear technology is roughly ~70 years old and has been in a mature state for at least 50 years old.

I'm sorry, I'm afraid this goose ain't going to lay your golden egg.

&gt; It's the exact same mentality that got us into this climate mess now, and its utter bullshit to use the same exact argument today.

Look, if you think that thin-film PV has got us into this climate mess you need to up on your meds.

A new feature was brought into the case in November 1917, when Mr Balfour, with the authority of the War Cabinet, issued his famous declaration to the Zionists that Palestine 'should be the national home of the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done - and this, of course, was a most important proviso - to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.

&gt;McMahon was British High Commissioner in Egypt and Ali Ibn Husain was the Sherif of Mecca during the First World War. In a series of ten letters from 1915 to 1916 McMahon tried to attract Arab support against the Ottoman Empire. The following excerpt is from a letter from October 24, 1915. The implied promise is of British support of an independent Arab state.

As for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:

(1) Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.

(2) Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability.

(3) When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories.

(4) On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British.

(5) With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special administrative arrangements in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.

I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke, which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them.

The result is that, even assuming that there were ""out"" atheists during that period, they were unlikely to have left much record of it. We don't really start to hear about specific people proclaiming their own atheism (at least, not in Europe) until the rise of literacy and the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. Even at that point, they wouldn't have called themselves atheist for two reasons. The first is that the word wasn't coined until a century later. The second is that it was initially used almost entirely as a term of approbation. People who did not believe in God would have been unlikely to self-apply it, and if they were called atheists, it would have been as an accusation. Often, the accusation was mere polemic, leveled against dissenters who would have been more accurately described as protestants.

That's not to say that there weren't people who denied the purported existence of God prior to then. Diversity of religious belief was actually much higher in the middle ages than we sometimes give it credit for. If it weren't, how could heresy have been such a pressing concern for the RCC? So it's almost certain that there were, among those who mixed gnosticism and manichaeism and paganism with their Catholicism, those who went so far as to suppose that there were no gods.

Seeing as they did not fight over 9 crusades for the land, of course they would not be ""sovereign"" rulers.

&gt;merely that Arabs wouldn't allow a sovereign Jewish state there.

Because a Jewish state was never meant to be established there.

* **'Unauthorized statements have been made to the effect that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Palestine. Phrases have been used such as that Palestine is to become ""as Jewish as England is English."" His Majesty's Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view.** They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded ""in Palestine."" In this connection it has been observed with satisfaction that at a meeting of the Zionist Congress, the supreme governing body of the Zionist Organization, held at Carlsbad  in September, 1921, a resolution was passed expressing as the official statement of Zionist aims ""the determination of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people on terms of unity and mutual respect, and together with them to make the common home into a flourishing community, the upbuilding of which may assure to each of its peoples an undisturbed national development""'.

&gt;This is similar to how French people might be tolerated to live as a minority in Algeria, but the rule of a foreign French minority over the Algerian majority was considered illegitimate.

So would be the rule of the foreign Jews over the Arabs. Are you actually using this as a talking point and implying it is not fair? The Arab population and land ownership was significantly more than the European Jews.

Not only that, the French were colonist and had no right or claims to Algeria, just like the Jews. 

&gt;but nowhere may they have equal footing to Muslims. 

This was untrue if you're claiming this was in the 1900s.

&gt;but the Muslims consider it an abrogation of the natural order and an affront against Allah for Jews to have sovereignty and rule over Muslim Arabs.

This is completely irrelevant, because you're making an attempt at turning this into a religious argument. 

&gt;Also, it was never mainstream among Zionists that only Jews could live in the Jewish state.

This is why Zionists not only sought ""Palestine"" but sought a state on both banks of the Jordan. Basically, they sought the whole British Mandate.

Oh yes, this is why Zionist militant groups like Irgun and Hagana did much of the ethnic cleansing in April. But the British Mandate did not end until May 14th and the war didn't begin until May 15th

* ""During May [1948] ideas about how to consolidate and give permanence to the Palestinian exile began to crystallize, and the destruction of villages was immediately perceived as a primary means of achieving this aim...[Even earlier,] On 10 April, Haganah units took Abu Shusha... The village was destroyed that night... Khulda was leveled by Jewish bulldozers on 20 April... Abu Zureiq was completely demolished... Al Mansi and An Naghnaghiya, to the southeast, were also leveled. . .By mid-1949, the majority of [the 350 depopulated Arab villages] were either completely or partly in ruins and uninhabitable."" Benny Morris, ""The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949.

* ""Before the end of the mandate and, therefore before any possible intervention by Arab states, the Jews, taking advantage of their superior military preparation and organization, had occupied...most of the Arab cities in Palestine before May 15, 1948. Tiberias was occupied on April 19, 1948, Haifa on April 22, Jaffa on April 28, the Arab quarters in the New City of Jerusalem on April 30, Beisan on May 8, Safad on May 10 and Acre on May 14, 1948...In contrast, the Palestine Arabs did not seize any of the territories reserved for the Jewish state under the partition resolution."" British author, Henry Cattan, ""Palestine, The Arabs and Israel.""

* ""Menahem Begin, the Leader of the Irgun, tells how 'in Jerusalem, as elsewhere, we were the first to pass from the defensive to the offensive...Arabs began to flee in terror...Hagana was carrying out successful attacks on other fronts, while all the Jewish forces proceeded to advance through Haifa like a knife through butter'...The Israelis now allege that the Palestine war began with the entry of the Arab armies into Palestine after 15 May 1948. But that was the second phase of the war; they overlook the massacres, expulsions and dispossessions which took place prior to that date and which necessitated Arab states' intervention."" Sami Hadawi, ""Bitter Harvest.""

Let me point out that **Menahem Begin**, the leader of a Zionist militant group was the sixth Prime Minister of the State of Israel.

&gt;Arab character who indicated that a significant proportion of the population of the Jewish entity would be Arab, and they would be full and equal citizens. That was always the mainstream of Zionist thought.

Your leaders disagree. 

* ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."" Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983. 


* ""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai.""

As you say, I don't know how we can go on if we can't secure our definitions. The only people i've ever debated who maintain that atheism is a belief, faith or a kind of religion in itself on a par with any kind of religion are the religious. Let's look at it in more detail:

Where is the formalised system and central teaching of atheism?
What are the tenets or core components of atheism?
What is there to believe about atheism when the term itself defines the lack of such belief?

Belief is the acceptance of the truth or actuality of anything without certain proof. Belief is a mental conviction. To believe is to accept something as true or real. It is to accept the truth, existence, value, worth, etc, of something. One of the primary meanings of ""to believe"" is to have religious faith. Religious faith is belief in the supernatural. 


The ""belief"" that Atheism should be classified as a belief is a view taken by religionists who cannot accept the simple absence of belief. The absence of belief is a benign, non-active status. There is no ""belief system"" involved. There is no ""system"" of Atheistic belief: no rituals, no practices, no rules, no set of doctrines or dogma. Yes, there are various philosophical opinions among people who can be described as Atheists, a conviction that there are no gods is not the primary characteristic. In it's elemental form, Atheism does not concern itself with gods.

Atheism is not a faith or an unquestioning belief that doesn't require proof. It is this aspect that the religious try and claim and persist in trying to bend the meaning of words so that it can be equated as some kind of belief system. If you can demonstrate coherently how this is so, I'm all ears.

I live my life without any gods in the equation, I don't consider them in anything I do, I don't deny them when acting, therefore it can't be a belief! I'm not denying the single set of definitions you posted, I just asked you to post more and get a broader take on what you are suggesting. I simply said I'm not able to find a definition like the one you posted in any of the dictionaries I own, that is certainly not a denial or a ignorance of your rebutal.

I'm motivated by religions' obvious poison to expunge it, not because I believe it is fake or that atheism is true. Whether it is fake or not, theism or atheism I'm concerned that humanity is doing itself a disservice by believing in a host of completely different myths that are divisive in nature and clearly they are not all true. I could be a Christian campaigning about the falsehoods of Islam because I'd be atheistic regards Allah-yet not wholly atheist but my motivations wouldn't be based on that, they would be in response to my Christian convictions and the fact that I believe it to be absolute truth. Every religious person is atheist, to every god except their own chosen one. The truth as I see it is the same as everyone else sees it, with or without religious instruction. I'm not pushing a form of truth on people I'm saying open your eyes to the reality of our surroundings and environment. Do you see any evidence of a god? As I've already said, to live in the world the same as all the other animals do. Is that not the truth? Are we all living in a computer simulation. Are we back to a solipsist view? I'm talking about universal truths that affect us all, god or no god, imagined or not. This is why I'm trying to say that my lack of a belief in any gods has no bearing on that, like the unicorns. So, talking of unicorns...

I don't see your point here. I haven't seen a pink unicorn. No one, to my knowledge (which is pretty vast these days with the aid of the internet to corroborate or verify claims such as this) has seen one either. It's not that I believe that they don't exists, same as atheism, the truth of the world is that they don't exist. Just like any other mythical or bizarre beast you care to conjure up in your mind. I don't want to get involved in the truth of parallel universes and the 'somewhere out there, it probably exists' I'm talking about what we face here as realities on our planet. Nothing metaphisical or supernatural, just observable, measurable 'truths' on our time and relative size scale. When you say that ""a pink unicorn did some such"" I'm already ignoring the rest of the claim since I know that such a thing doesn't exist. It's not a belief, it's a truth. I don't need to believe the sun will rise, it's a truth and no amount of belief will change that fact. That's what I'm getting at here! The rest of what you say validates my point about religion even further when you say about the person being harmed by such a belief. First you say I'm wrong, then you say it's understandable and then the right thing to do! How is that wrong from your position in the argument when you then agree with it? So is it right to remove the belief no matter how in error it is or not? I'm unable to determine your position here because it contradicts itself.

Again I refer back to my evidence that essentially atheistic countries, those who have total church and state separation and in fact in many cases where the churches are empty as in large swathes of Northern Europe don't have any increase in murders and the like. Are you saying the only thing preventing rape and murder is the faith in a supernatural debt owed to deity? This can clearly be demonstrated by those who have either abandoned their faith and have not committed such acts and I myself am testament to it since no god has ever been part of my life yet I have not committed anything remotely violent or morally abhorrent. You 'atheistic country of death and destruction' argument just doesn't hold water and for the reasons I already gave which you have not refuted, the Pol Pot and Stalin examples were cults of personality and not some kind of defined atheistic cultures. There were atheist by default definition only because religion formed no part of their structure, not that the structure was atheist in nature and I've already asked you to define that but not had a response. Again this was a retrospective label, not something they had printed on their money or written in their constitutions.

Of course people will find a reason to fight-competition for food and resources will always trump any religious battle but with so little examples of cultures and regions without religion for any significant amount of time, that's hard to quantify, let alone provide evidence for. We are in the midst of such a phase in humanity right now with the death of religion in large parts of Northern Europe. Let's come back in 1000 years and see what pans out. I have lived in a peaceful village for all of my life, never seen strife or trouble of any kind, not even mild civil unrest. Yes my country has been to war but separation of church and state has seen my country peaceful in terms of the situation on the ground for well over 500 years. You cannot say the same of countries where religion is high on the agenda like the Middle East.

Moreover, the judges sitting in the Supreme Court are the very best there are, and the judgements they produce are very highly regarded indeed - much more so, indeed than those of our own High Court.

(In fact Cadder only arose because of a much-criticised decision by the High Court ignoring a clear determination by Europe that access to a lawyer when being questioned by the police was a fundamental right).

Having a central point of appeal for human rights cases is essential where the signatory to the convention is the UK. When devolution took place, all parties agreed that Scottish institutions would be directly bound by the ECHR, and that determination of the constitutionality of their actions would ultimately be determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (to which the Supreme Court is the successor). If Salmond didn't like it, then he had plenty of opportunity to object at the time. To change his mind as soon as the court acknowledges the human rights of people he doesn't like, is just a little bit sad (though not unexpected - people generally get more authoritarian and opposed to human rights the more power they get).

Point is, if Scotland is independent, then Salmond can abuse human rights all he wants, if that is what he wishes. But until then, Scotland is part of the UK; the devolution settlement agreed in 1997 applies; and the human rights of Scots are protected against the abuses of those in power by the Supreme Court, however much that may upset the Dear Leader.",

Also, one last thing - is it possible to arrange both the job and the rent via long distance? I'm in north america, so I can't afford to go back and forth too much. Does anyone have any experience with ULB as a foreign student? Will they somehow help me out to settle down and get a job?

You do occasionally hear stories about teachers having to buy tissues and such out of their own pockets. I don't think however that this stems from a lack of general funds so much as where those funds are going. As I said earlier, we spend a ton of money per student - more than enough to supply them with a fine education. 

Unfortunately there is a large segment of the population, especially in poorer areas that doesn't seem to see the value in education. In fact often times children in these areas that do excel are looked down upon or teased. This creates a toxic environment where even if you want to succeed, its difficult. Combine that with our social safety nets (which aren't as extensive as Europe's, but still, enough) which offer no real penalties for not trying in school and you have a recipe for disaster.

If I live somewhere where my parents aren't involved, my peers ridicule me for trying in school, and even if I fail out, I won't go hungry, I'll still have a TV and a car, and I won't have to work... it kind of kills any last bit of incentive to succeed.

What I meant is that in my opinion, as media shows it, over 90% of cases shown in the media the suspected rapist has non-western background. 

**The following is translated from an article stating numbers and facts given by the police in their rapport on last year in Oslo:**

Out of 189 reported rapes in Oslo in 2010, non-western men were suspected in 65%. It is also thought than only 10% (older numbers show 6-12%) off all rapes are reported.

""The typical offender has non-western background, is in his 20ies. Some are 2generation immigrants, born and raised in Norway, while the rest are foreign citizens. 20% of suspected rapists have African background and are the biggest ethnic group beside Norwegians, 15% from the Middle East and 14,5% from Asia.""
By numbers of reported rapes to Oslo police 2010 with identification suspect/charged offender, show that men from the Middle East, Africa and Asia are strongly represented and significantly overrepresented when it comes to size of population. Of the police' 5 rape categories (ethnic Norwegian in () ):

*Party related rapes: 38,8% (32,7%)

*Relation rapes: 42% (40%)

*Vulnerable rape: 60,9% (34,1%) 

*Assault rapes: 100% (0)

*other: 54,6% (45,5%)

.

Acording to SSB from 1/1/2011 the group of immigrants and Norwegian born with immigrant background from Asia, Africa, Latin-America, Oceania (except Australia and New Zealand) Europa (except EU/EØS) 122 313 persons - 20,4% - of Oslo' population of 599 230 persons. 

Non-western men is behind all assault rapes in Oslo the last 3 years. And out of 21 victims of assault rapes in Oslo in 2009, 17 was Norwegian wommen with ethnic Norwegian look. 2008, 9 of 11 victims had ethnic Norwegian look. 

-------------------

As the numbers say only 10%ish of all rapes are told to the police. That's a scary as hell low number and a lot of rapes are going on with nothing done. That said, men with non-western background are overrepresented in rapes, especially when it comes to part of the population and when it comes to being behind 100% of all reported assault rapes the last 3 years. 

That said - the media blows it out of proportions. And that's my point. It makes non-western immigrants so much more stigmatized if you want to use that word.

(the article is [here](http://www.document.no/2011/05/ikke-vestlige-innvandrere-bak-65-prosent-av-alle-anmeldte-voldtekter-i-oslo/). I'm sure the police report could also be found. I'm really wondering were you got your numbers from...?)

*HIS TEXT BEGINS AFTER THIS*



So, i'm currently in the 2100 Elo area on the EU servers, i feel that i belong in that Elo area, might belong a bit higher, but overall i'm mostly comfortable
I haven't played a single duo-queue game since the ~1600 Elo Area as i feel that playing Duo is like throwing rocks at MM, which obviously makes MM go mad and throw you in with people you don't enjoy playing with (Personal opinion, just feel like it, i have no certain proof of it).

Phreak: incase you're reading this, Hi, i'm the guy who sat next to you during the Quake Live match during the CeBit just before the LoL events started, my brother asked you in german to let us through.
I wanted to shake your hand and say ""hi"" after the match but you left rather quickly ;&lt;

I thought i'd write down what i think about certain things and give some kind of feedback to Riot. I'm quite sure Riot is talking to high-elo players and already has alot of feedback, but this ain't gonna hurt and i had some time on my hands.

P.S. after writing this i noticed that i use ""MS"" for both, Mortal Strike and Movement Speed.


Items:

5g/10s
I got the feeling that 5g/10s items are too powerful on supporters, especially Heart of Gold. It gives them rather cheap survivability and gold income, getting one 5g/10s item will give you 1,2 wards per 1 ward time (1 ward holds 180 seconds(3minutes) -&gt; you get 0,5g per second, 180x0,5 -&gt; 90g, a ward costs 75g)

Tiamat:
only for ""fun"" purposes for aslong as i remember.

Wit's End:
Loved the old Wit's End if i had it and played against mana champions, hated it when i was a low-mana champion. The rework worked out quite well, though i usually see each and a single ""Tanky-DPS'er"" packing it.
Overall the reworked Wit's feels quite strong as it gives you a total of 50MR, 40% AS and a +42 magic dmg proc on attack for a mere 2150 gold, a BF Sword currently costs 1650g and gives you 45 AD for it, the 40% AS are exactly a recurve bow for 1050, 50 magic resist are more than what a Negatron for 740g gives, so that's pretty much (1650~+740~+1050) - 3440g packed into 2150g, admitted, the damage is magic and might not benefit from ARPen. Yet, this item scales incredibly well with itself as it gives you attackspeed (which increases the number of attacks whom get +42 damage and the speed of stacking)

Nashor's Tooth/Stinger:
I haven't seen those 2 items, ever.

Innervating Locket:
Please, never bring it back


Haunting Guise:
Just like brutalizer, it doesn't scale into lategame
I've seen a few AP carries rush Sorc boots and Haunting Guise combined with massive AP runes run rampabe, but overall, Haunting Guise is rarely ever used, probably due to it's high cost. Yoomus Rage Guise maybe?

Executioneers Calling:
The only way to get a MS effect on your team if you have no champion with it (apart from Ignite)
Maybe might wanna add an AP item with the same effect?




Champions:

Alistar:
I've actually played AP Alistar before his rework and it was quite satisfacting. Once the rework was announced, i knew a nerf would have to hit him as his old 1. AP ratios + lower CD's, new passive with 0.2 AP ratio would be too strong, especially since Headbutt doesn't decide to not work once someone has over 380ms.
After his nerf, he's a quite valid choice and i think that he's quite balanced.

Amumu:
(In my opinion(i do play Amumu) he's quite fine, just a few things bug me)
Bandage Toss has a MASSIVE cooldown at early levels, even if you initiate a gank infront of your own turret and run all the way back to the hostile turret (without boots) Toss won't be ready again, it's stun duration isn't too long nor is the damage incredibly high for it beeing a skillshot, given the range is quite high.
Tantrums Mana-Damage value just doesn't add up. If i wouldn't need it for my jungle early on, i wouldn't bother putting a single point in it, especially since it forces me to stop for a moment to cast it and has a rather insignificant range.
Curse of the Sad Mummy: feared by everyone, except Jarvan because his E+Q doesn't count as blink/movement, so beeing snared doesn't matter for him as he can just throw his flag, impale it and he's freed from the snare, i don't see any reason why 1 Champion should have an ability that lets him move while beeing snared (Olaf's is an ultimate, that's fine)

Anivia:
Probably one of the most annoying champions to lane against, she has a passive GA, can throw a Stun/Slow, wall you off and has 2x 1 AP abilities, her ultimate giving her an easy farm and a slow.
Laning against her is hell, chances to kill her are pretty **** low. Especially if she has teleport and uses it right before she morphs into her egg so she'll be teleporting as an egg (if this is still possible, haven't seent his in ages)
Yet, i rarely see her played, haven't played her myself, so that's all i can say about her

Annie:
The buff elevated her to the level of the other AP's, if not above
Sometimes, when aiming Tibbers DIRECTLY on a champion, they take no damage/aren't stunned, is this a bug, lagg or am i just bad?
Her Burst @ lvl 6~9 might be a bit over the top right now as she can easily take 80~90% of another casters HP with QWR+Ignite (but well, who can't?)

Ashe:
Well, Ashe
nerf her size
she's having backpain.

Caitlynn:
Incredible laner with her Q, maximum safety due to her 3 Traps and her ""pushback"" + slow
Performs incredibly well during early but drops quite fast in late, her ultimate is quite easy to block, i think it might make things more intresting if the ""line"" from her to her target would be removed so that taking the bullet would become a bit less unchallenging

Brand:
his range feels quite high and his ultimate depends on a lot of luck, i've seen Brands ult a champion, the Fireball bounces off on a creep, never to be seen again and i've seen Brands ultimate and hit the same 2 targets repeteadly, resulting in MASSIVE damage, i as Annie made the mistake of staying very close to him and my tibbers, resulting in me getting blasted for 670~ damage @ lvl 6 from Pyroclasm.

Cassiopeia:
played her for a week maybe, felt intresting to play but not satisfying as the amount of work you have to put into her does not pay off, not even slightly. She just completely underperforms compared to other AP's.

Mundo:
either goes where he pleases or dies trying, MS totally kills him (Captain Obvious)

Evelynn:
Well, Stealth+Stun, her Q giving her each possible Sheen/TF proc, an ult that increases her MS+AS and restores health on Kill/Assist, I'm quite sure Riot is aware of the problems with her and they're working on a stealth rework(as Morello said quite often?)

They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving the other essential chemicals in the coffee beans. The process is repeated anywhere from 8 to 12 times until it meets either the international standard of having removed 97% of the caffeine in the beans or the EU standard of having the beans 99.9% caffeine-free by mass.

So is there likewise no problem if *many* (or most) people find quality X attractive, and quality not-X unattractive?

If it then seems that there is a cultural preference for X, is that not the aggregate of many individual preferences?

&gt;The primary issue in this clip is that a dark skinned woman is not only thought of as less attractive, it's that she is seen as less of a person.

But isn't this true of *everyone* perceived as unattractive, whether it's because of skin color, blemishes, weight/figure, facial structure, teeth, intelligence, etc.? People who are attractive tend to have others gravitate to and admire them, while those who are unattractive (at a personal, subjective level) are ignored or overtly rejected.

&gt;Altogether inferior because of her skin color.

Skin color is an easily identifiable factor by which people can be grouped as a class. But aren't the obese similarly viewed as inferior/undesirable; or those with other certain combinations of features: for example, gingers, fetishized by some, but considered repulsive by others (especially ginger men, a group I belong to). 

My point is not that the treatment of dark-skinned women is not lamentable, or that it is not likely worse as a subjective experience, especially in first-world nations, than for most other identifiable groups: dark women indeed seem to fall to the bottom of the social pecking order. But it's that it's not simply ""colorism"", but ""lookism"" at large that is at work here, and that other groups experience similar social judgement and rejection based on factors they similarly cannot control.

There are in fact [some dark-skinned models](http://showstudio.com/blog/28518) [NSFW link] who would easily, by many people from disparate cultures around the world, be considered far more attractive than a dowdy, squat white woman from Northern or Eastern Europe. White skin isn't an instant beauty pass, and dark isn't necessarily a barrier to entry. So it's my belief that the negative treatment being directed towards dark girls, as described in the video, is not unique because many other people who are less attractive than average experience similar (again, perhaps not as harshly) social rejection. It's not simply that dark girls are (considered) inferior; but unattractive (edit: again, by that subjective, individualized perception that you above stated is ""no problem"") people in general.

There's two crucial issues in the debate - economics and culture - both are viewed differently according to class.

For the middle class their understanding is global. Their perspective is international, both for their career and pleasure. They assume they will need to move across borders if needed for both work and holidays. They aspire to living and working abroad. Politically they believe in global trade or global aid. They maybe members of the international jet set. Depending on their level they already are competing on a global level.

The opening of labour markets to Eastern Europe has meant cheap plumbers, shop assistants and other services. All culture is as fascinating as an ancient trinket in a museum or an exotic unpronounceable listing on a menu. Religion is nonsense so can't be taken seriously. They don't consider themselves as having anything as gauche as a ""nationality,"" they are internationalists. If they want multicultural area they move to get it. If they don't like it they move to a mono culture.  For them culture is a cross between a supermarket and a museum.

The ~~working class~~ underclass is selling their labour or living off the state, remember most poor people work. They are competing for temporary unskilled work. Often living in a former industrial area which has never recovered. They don't think about moving, their plans for ""getting out"" have not worked. Most people do not ""get out"" of the area and some come back. They are fighting for the menial jobs that the middle class look down on. They feel they are in a zero sum game with foreign labour.

Everyone has a sense of belonging. If people are under pressure and feeling alienated they will hold on to that identity even stronger what else do they have to hold on to? They don't have the choice about moving away from immigrants or even the choice to move to the ones they like. They live far closer to the poor of different ethnicities than the middle class and so they'll know the cultural differences of religion, education, drink, food and sex habits.

These two models are simplistic but its the context of why middle class white people might be less likely to be in the EDL.

Are the EDL racist? Sure. But where does racism come from? I suspect most from fear, both economic and cultural. Are we happy to tell a white family who move out of a predominantly Islamic area not to be so racist? Should we be forcing refugees to disperse around the country? In practice racism is not a scientific enterprise carried out with portable gene testing kits. Its a gut thing carried out by sight and sound.

Claiming the UK is a mongrel nation is both technically wrong and irrelevant. As if racism of any kind could be justified on genetic grounds. Cultures exist and races exist, even English cultures exist. Its still not the grounds for racism. 

The traditional answers to mass immigration were trade union rights, labour laws and wage control from the Left. From the Right they believed in very controlled immigration and a high degree of assimilation through cultural norms. But both sides have dropped these beliefs. The Left has embraced freer markets and dropped calls for labour rights and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking cultural norms. The Right has dropped culture and borders and is in favour of global markets and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking the welfare state. Why would people of different cultures agree to pay for the other?

I'm not saying I have answers to these difficult questions but I do look to Reddit for more thoughtful analysis of a difficult topic. I hope we can try to understand why someone might join the EDL rather than do some circlejerk reaction of saying ""ITS THE DAILY MAIL WOT DONE IT""

As for Wilders I get the feeling that he and the many similar parties that have sprung up around Europe are disguising their dislike of immigrants from non-European / Middle Eastern countries as purely a criticism of their religion. 

The problem is that religion is so ingrained in our various cultures that it sometimes becomes a problem discerning the difference between the two. Of course immigrants have to adhere to the same laws as all other residents in their new country but they should be free to express their own cultural peculiarities and thus contribute to the culture of their new country. Of course they should be encouraged to integrate in their new country but to assimilate completely into a new cultural mold as many parties on the extreme right are proposing is in my mind counter-productive.

The battle against Islam tends to extend into a battle against immigrants from Islamic countries and I find that rather distasteful. This continent has already experienced what racist propaganda will lead to. ",

Did I give you an impression that I was religious? Well you'll need more conclusive evidence.

&gt;links to verses claiming that all men and women have equal rights and should be treated equally would have helped here..but then again.

Well, I don't think quoting Hindu scripture is the right way to go about it for the following two reasons:

1) Exclamations of equality often do not translate to practice. For example the Sermon on the Mount in Christian scripture clearly exhorts a pacifist outlook on life but Christianity from the time of the inquisition has been extremely violent against it's own believers as well as the minorities in their locale. 

2) Hindu scripture is not some monolithinc entity defined by a single text but a collection of varied belief systems from which you decide what to follow.

Let us look at the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata as two texts which are sufficiently far apart in time.

The Rig Veda has a number of it's shlokas written(composed) by women. It is explicitly stated that women have the right to the choice of husband and the husband must acquiesce any sexual demands made by the wife. There are many other more explicit examples but I feel these sufficiently address the highly superficial argument we are having. 

Next, lets look at the Mahabharata. The text is replete with strong women who influence the fate of Bharat as much as the men. Let us look at one example of 'defiance'. When Draupadi is called before the assembly of the Kauravas, she refuses to come because she states that if Yudhistir lost her after he lost himself then he does not have any right over her. That she is forcibly brought before the assembly in a state of undress(due to her periods) and humiliated *and* that humiliation is repeated often as criticism against the Kauravas and their destruction is partly retribution for that act.  

Now let us understand a few more issues- The Mahabharata is NOT a religious text. It has literary and historic value but not religious. Next let us also understand that the freedom/equality of women of the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata are not the same. If we are to look at the position of women in India from the Rig Veda to the present day we find a dramatic decline but what is more interesting is that even in the Ramayana and Mahabharata the position of women has declined. Of course this is purely a intra-civilizational  analysis. Compared to the other cultures the Ramayana and Mahabharata exemplify respect for women. Which brings me to my next point: what exactly led to this decline? This is a very difficult question to answer since the chronology of the Mahabharata is disputed. But obviously accurate speculations can be made. For that a firm grasp on history is required(and patience). 

&gt;Can you give me a reason why we should have a varna system AT ALL.

This is a fair question. But this is also an ignorant question. The answer lies in exactly *why* this question is ignorant. Varna means quality. Varna is not an imposition but a description. Of what? It is a description of the form human society takes naturally. Let us look at society today(in order of importance): men involved with economics, men involved with war, men involved with academia, men involved with the 'baser' logistics of civic life. In other words Vaishya, Kshatriya, Brahmin and Shudra. Civil society, human society organizes itself into a similar combination in it's natural state. But what should be regulated in the importance of each varna or quality. I am sure it is obvious that Vaishya(materialism) and Kshatriya(aggression) should not have social sanction as the epitome of human existence. Which leaves us with Brahmin and Shudra. If you ask the communists they will say the Shudra should be on top since they are the actual producers. Fair point. Unfortunately for the communists, human biology has different plans because we should not forget that we are apes and as apes we have to have hierarchy. Why?- is an extremely interesting debate but alas outside the scope of our present disagreements. 

Now you next question is whether I am insinuating that 'caste' as I have described above has always existed in this form- as a quality as opposed to imposition. The answer is yes and no. You have to understand Indian history to understand sociological changes within Hindu culture. 

Let us look at the Manusmriti. In the Manusmriti there is great importance ascribed to the Brahmins to the determent of the Shudhras. Does this text begin to show the hardening of caste? The answer again is yes and no. The things we must understand about the Manusmriti is that it is a text written during the Scythian invasions. Scythians are hunnic people, a race of barbarians. The downfall of the Maurya kingdoms led to their successful domination over North Western India. What is important to understand is that the Manusmriti is also a peace offering to the Kshatriyas by the Brahmins. In order to preserve social order, this alliance was considered necessary by the author. Furthermore another important(reoccurring) aspect of the Brahmin community reveals itself: self preservation through isolation. This quality manifests itself whenever external duress overpowers the Kshatriyas- another example is during the medieval period when the Arab, Turkic and Tartar hordes decimated Indian society and polity. 

So in conclusion, we find the self hardening of the Brahmin community, whether from the points I make or from additional circumstances which need further study. The remaining castes mingled freely. An important case is that of the British country wide census in the late 20th century. British surveys indicate that before the census, intermingling of caste took place between 60-70% of the population(from Dharampal's collection of British correspondence I think). After the census however, caste lines hardened for the next 50-70 years *in the fashion of British(European) understanding of their supremacy based on a corrupted understanding of the varna system*. This is a much longer topic and requires pages and pages of European perspective and their destructive(for us) search for their historic identity.

&gt;I noticed that you conveniently ignored my example of sati and why we shouldn't defend it based on Indian culture

This is a very fair question. And it is a question that should be addressed. But I'll take a break from writing and in case you reply I will happily address Sati and the history of Sati. ",

They're perfectly happy to bomb, kill, maim, and enslave anyone they need to in order to get the oil.

It's quite a bit older than that, although you're certainly right about the oil.

Its to say that we are no better than rabid impulsive beasts. I reject that. The last 60 years of history rejects that. Take for example Western Europe. For centuries all they knew was war after war and yet in the last 60 years for numerous reasons what has been the ongoing reality? The longest period of peace that part of the world has ever known. What did it take? The death of tens of millions during two World Wars. It took that to learn the lesson. The US never quite got it. Then again the US has never experienced the kind of bloodshed and ruin that Europe did. For the sake of our species future I would hope that your assessment is wrong. The weapons of war will only become more powerful and indiscriminate.

&gt;The Qur'an does not justify any of what you mention above, neither do Hadith or Sharia. I know my own religion, and my father is a Hafidh (meaning he has memorized the Qur'an).

I have studied Islam as well, and Muhammed has many people stoned (and openly recommends the practice). This is easily used to justify it's practice in many parts of the world.

Muslim 017:4206 Bukhari 6:60:79 Muslim 17:4196 Muslim 17:4209 Ibn Ishaq (970) - ""The adulterer must be stoned."" These words were a part of Muhammad's farewell address to his people on the occasion of his final pilgrimage to Mecca.

Pretty easy to understand.

&gt;regarding stoning in ancient times: What do you mean 'where it belongs?' The behavior you mentioned (which doesn't happen) can't be justified, whenever it occurs!

Of course it never belongs anywhere, what I was meant was it occurred frequently in antiquity, and it has NO place in the modern world. I agree it's despicable no matter what age it occurs in.

&gt;Yes, it is propaganda. Why are you saying it isn't? What proof have you of that? If you've lived here all your life, why is it not possible that maybe the government spreads propaganda? It makes sense that a government tries to convince its good people that what it's doing is right, even if it isn't!

I've shown you video that proves these things happen. I do not listen to or like my government, this has nothing to do with them. Everything I am saying has only to do with me and my own interest with the religion of Islam and the Middle East in general. I am not saying the whole middle east is bad, I am not saying Muslims are bad, but I do think the religion of Islam is false and a poisonous ideology that ruins every culture it touches.

&gt;regarding Muhammed owning slaves: ...No, he didn't. He was a shepherd. Even if he was non-righteous enough to own slaves, he couldn't have. But Islam preaches against it and so does he.

The Qu'ran openly endorses slavery, as does Muhammed by his ownership of slaves. From wikipedia:

""The major juristic schools of Islam have historically accepted the institution of slavery.[1] Muhammad and those of the Sahabah (companions) who could afford it themselves owned slaves, freed many, and some of them acquired more from prisoners of war. ""

If you have read the hadiths you will have noticed he owned many slaves, he also did free some, to his credit. If you have read the Qu'ran, you will notice many, many verses dealing with the treatment and keeping of slaves. I'm not sure how you missed all of this as a Muslim.

Muhammed mostly liked to free slaves in order to marry and have sex with them. Here's a few examples:

-Safiyya bint Huyayy, according to Islamic accounts she adopted Islam and became a wife of Muhammad. She lived more than a decade after him as a widow and became involved in the first power politics of the early Muslim community and left a large inheritance to her Jewish family.

-Maria al-Qibtiyya, a Coptic slave given to Muhammad by Muqawqis, a Byzantine official. She gave birth to Ibrahim ibn Muhammad whom Muhammad loved dearly. It is disputed whether or not he actually freed her or not, but one thing is for certain: he had sex and a child with his slave woman.

-Sirin, Maria's sister. He gave her to the poet Hassan ibn Thabit who later freed and married her.

&gt;regarding muhammed killing people: What in the...? Many muslims were killed and tortured by the pagan tribe Quraish, and were not allowed freedom of religion. So they fought back as they had the right to. They fought for their rights. Muhammed was a GENERAL (and a very good one at that!). He fought WARS, and they were justified. Yes, you kill people in war.

How about the Qurayza tribe where up to 900 unarmed men were slaughtered and their women and children enslaved. That's not very honorable. On top of that, I've already referenced the Hadith's where Muhammed personally has people stoned to death. He was a murderer.

&gt;He did indeed have a wife that was 12 years old. However, in the society at the time, 12 was the regular age at which people get married, because they can (they develop romantic feelings by then) and that is the age when they set out to lead their own lives, after they have finished their education and training. She would have been called a child today, but she was not a child then, she was a full grown woman, and that's what matters.

Your math is off. Aisha was 6-7 when he married her, and 9 when he had sex with her. She herself says so in the Hadith. Muhammed was in his 50's when he did this. She was also not a full grown woman even for her time, because she mentions after Muhammed has sex with her that she gets down on the floor and plays with her dolls like a CHILD while he laughs at her. Are you really a muslim? Have you read the Hadiths? How did you miss all of this?

&gt;As a matter of fact, I do feel offended even if you didn't mean insult. I didn't see much respect for me or my people or my religion in your essay. Just putting that out there.

I have great respect for your people, they have given the world a great many things, but I'm sorry to say I have very little for the religion. I don't mean it as an insult, it's just honestly how I feel about the religion of Islam (and to be fair with you, every religion, but we aren't discussing them at the moment).

&gt;...Nope. The reason it's 'in the state that it is' is because of the US sending its military into every Islamic country. The countries fared fine before that. Imperialism says a lot about why so much of the Muslim world is in the state that it is.

This is an ongoing debate, but the Muslim world had not been fine for a very, very long time before the US had any involvement in it. It is Islamic law that ruined Iran and literally turned back centuries of progress with the Islamic revolution. Islam in parts of Africa that the United States has never touched (Sudan, Nigeria, Bhutan) has wrought havoc upon those countries.

Sure, the United States has it's fair share of involvement with the Middle East, but this is all not the US's fault. Poverty, illiteracy, closed-mindedness to ideas outside of Islam, ethnic conflict, corruption, and tumultuous relations with literally every other region on Earth (Muslims wage war on non-muslims in the Balkans, Africa, Russia/Chechnya conflict, Asia, India and of course with Europe and the United states), this is the real reason there is so much trouble in that region.

Let's not forget oil as well, which is an entirely new subject. I'm not sure we can argue much more about all of this, it seems we just have a very basic disagreement over what exactly Islam is. If you too have read the same books that I have and we are getting different things from what they say, well then I guess that says a lot about the vague nature of those books to begin with. This is why there are so many interpretations of Islam.

Which leads me to question whether or not it can really be the perfect text it claims to be. You can respond to me and I will be happy to read it, but it seems like our arguments are getting bigger and bigger, I had to post my response in two posts! I'm not sure I'll have the time for 3, but we'll see :) good talking to you

Therefore this report is a sign that policymakers are being told that it is costing too much money and causing too much disruption to continue on the former path.  If the money people and the human rights people are putting their heads together it might be worth hoping that the politicians will listen to them more closely than they do the old-fashioned conservative manufacturing interests who initiated the  trouble.

Those with mutations in both copies of the gene are almost completely resistant to the virus

See, even though people point to it as a beacon for easy-entry Pynchon, it's still fairly complex. Although I was lost a bit in the last 20 pages or so, regarding all of the European history stuff, even the plot of the play itself, I think I took away a lot of good notions.

Mostly, I'd say the story structure is built to mock mystery novels: stories written for a big pay off at the end. You might expect to find out the identity of the crier, at the end, but, alas, there's an abrupt cut-off. Combined with the fact that pomo stuff is so self-referential and so consciously aware of itself, and that Oedipa feared at the end, after a final meet-up with Fallopian, that maybe the whole convoluted mess of it all, the seeming pawns set against her at every turn, the again and again showing up of the muted posthorn, etc., all of it was just one big gag, put on by Pierce before he died, for whatever reason he may have had. (This whole part, I suppose, pointing to the ridiculousness of mystery novels, maybe? Something like ""it's about the journey, not the destination.""

Hopefully the following helps (I apologize in advance for the length and tone of the text, I'm literally copying and pasting):
Since the mid 1990’s there has been an exodus from Somalia. Before 1988, there were approximately 7.7 million people living in Somalia. Since then, about one million people have left the country and moved to various places around the world. 

Many of these Somali refugees settled nearby in East Africa and in the Middle East, with several new Somali immigrant communities settling throughout Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Finland, and England) and North America. Within the United States many Somalis initially settled in the largest cities such as New York and Los Angeles, however second waves of Somali immigrants have settled in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where an estimated 40-70% of Somali immigrants now reside. This makes the Twin City area of Minnesota the largest American home to Somali refugees (Greeson, Veach, &amp; LeRoy, 2001; Minnesota Foundation, 2004). 

Since most of this group is very new to the U.S, they are still in the early stages of acculturation to Western society. Many Somali immigrants continue to wear traditional dress and participate in other cultural practices. While some Somali adolescents feel more pressure to assimilate and wear Western clothing to school, most families still have their children wear traditional clothing at home and continue traditional practices. The children often attend religious schooling during the evening or on weekends. (Minnesota’s Somali Community, University of Minnesota – Academic Health Center) The most important values to Somali immigrants include family and maintaining their Islamic traditions and education. 

In recent years, Somali families have adapted to some of America's institutions, not hesitating to take advantage of the greater educational opportunities and access to government services available in the United States. Even though they have adapted some of their practices to fit into society, for example having women work outside the home and adopting Western styles of dress, the one thing that remains consistent among the Somali people, and that is the importance of family. Family is the ultimate source of personal security and identity. The protection of family honor and loyalty are extremely important to Somali families. 

With religious tradition and family as strong driving factors, and with the importance placed on continuing religious tradition among children, most Somali immigrants would not be likely to feel comfortable placing their preschool children into a traditional, largely non-Muslim U.S. daycare situation. Traditionally, mothers or extended family members watch the children, but with fewer family members here, and as women work more outside of the home and move into higher level jobs, there will be a growing need for child care. Somalis will continue to prefer childcare needs to met be met within the community, trusting other members of the Somali community who are familiar with the community’s Islamic traditions to care for their children while they are at work.
Data: Somalis in the United States

 Minnesota has three large immigrant populations in addition to the Somalis; Hmongs, Hispanics, and Russians. Compared to these populations, Somalis are much more familiar with the English language, and appear to be more determined to grasp the English language. According to a survey done by the Wilder Research Center and released in 2000, 51% of Somalis can, “speak and understand English very well”, much higher than the 13% and 12% reported by Russian and Hmong immigrants, respectively. In addition, only 11% reported they cannot speak English at all, and if not comfortable with their fluency, 51% were taking classes, compared to 17- 31% with other immigrant populations. No doubt, tendency towards knowing and wanting to learn English is probably due to Somalia’s colonial history, which means that many Somali immigrants spoke English in their home country as well.

The value Somalis place on their native language cannot be ignored. Many Somalis consume media to keep in touch with news in their country of origin, and especially value spoken word poetry in their native language. Somali poetry is split into two main styles, the more traditional maanso style, and the contemporary hees. Due to the fact that there was no definitive script of the Somali language until 1972, the oral tradition of poetry is still rich, especially the maanso style, with poets composing and reciting long poems entirely from memory. 

In addition, survey data has revealed Somalis commonly share an intention to eventually return to their country of origin, with 69% hoping to return. They are also more likely to use the internet as a source of news, with 42% using it in 2000, utilizing it especially to gain news from their native country. 

From our personal observations of Somali shoppers in Minneapolis, it is clear that there are some cultural differences in how Somalis shop compared to most Americans. The most obvious distinction is the separation of genders. While a few Somali couples were shopping together at Cub Foods, the vast majority of shopping was done by women while the men waited outside the store. From interviewing a few shoppers at the Somali shopping Mall on Pillsbury Avenue, we learned that women make most of the day-to-day shopping decisions. Even though men may make the bigger purchasing decisions, like buying a car, women have input into those decisions as well, wielding ulitimate “veto” power if necessary.

I think the issue is more complex than whether Parisian French is more formal or not though.  In some ways, yes it absolutely is.  In Quebec, it's not a really big deal if you use ""tu"" with somebody you don't really know instead of ""vous"".  But you will get serious sideways looks if you attempted that in France.  I tend to see this as more of a by-product of Quebec's anti-authoritarian and non-deferential mindset than because of formality though.

However the French from France are much much less formal when it comes to vocabulary than the Québécois (and other French Canadians).  Like I mentioned above, the French from France don't really care that their stop signs don't say ""arrêt"" and they're even more likely to use ""stop"" in a sentence than ""arrêt"".

However, I would like to point out this simple fact; If America, and Europe (where the vast majority of Afghani heroin winds up) were serious about eradication they could simply buy up the opium crop like we do with other countries.

The fact is there's just too much money being made by several links in the chain. From growing, manufacture and distribution, to alleged efforts at interdiction (that seemingly only target the extreme lower echelon of any narco group).

Until drug interdiction groups like the DEA and their numerous local, and regional spin-offs come to the realization that people want to get high, and nothing will stop them (least of all corrupt government officials) the failed efforts at drug interdiction, along with the overly severe punishment of users will continue on unabated.

The opium poppy is a hardy plant that can be grown almost anywhere. From the Golden Triangle (the Shan States of Burma, now Myanmar) to the jungles and open fields of South America, production goes on. It goes on for one reason only, demand.

The two groups who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo are the drug organizations, and distribution networks, and the law enforcement/prison/treatment industry.

Neither will let go of their profitable part of the industry. From unreasonable forfeiture laws that allow police to confiscate any large amount money (there is no standard of what a large amount of money is) on the mere suspicion that it may be used to promote a drug transaction, or be the ill gotten gains thereof, to the financial gouging of those caught up in the ""justice system"" for drug tests, ineffective 12-step counseling, and any other fess they can think up; the war on drugs has become a war on American citizens.

At least this guy realizes the absolute futility of his job, a definite exception to the gung ho ""lock em up and throw away the key"" thoughtless pukes who have deluded themselves into thinking they're actually providing a valuable service.

The desire to get high has its start in religious ritual as much as any where else. Conversely, much of what passes for drug treatment has its origins in mans alleged separation from God. 

Until addiction is addressed through direct efforts at harm reduction, and legalization the problem will only persist.

The sad reality is that the two biggest groups with vested financial interests in the distribution and attempted confiscation of presently illegal substances will never willingly give up their respective cash cows.

Are you seriously saying that most of the Islamic nations are living in an age a thousand year ago? Have you EVER been to any of these nations which you are claiming such false accusations against? Just look at [Turkey](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Istanbul_Montage_Wikipedia.jpg), [Jordan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Western_Amman_ZAHRAN.jpg), [Indonesia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Jakarta_Pictures-4.jpg), [Egypt](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/View_from_Cairo_Tower_31march2007.jpg). Your Xenophobic and biased thoughts are clogging up your brain from accepting other people. 

Haven't you ever picked up a world history book and read about [The Islamic Golden Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age)? For more than half a Millenia Muslims flourished in literature, philosophy, science, engineering, medicine, and the arts, while Europe deteriorated in almost every aspect.   

about 10% of Muslim nations are MAJOR oil exporters. Just stop and do one minute of research and you'll see Muslim nations, major oil exporter or not, do have access to modern technology.  last time i went to Turkey, almost every person had a cell phone, a lot of kids had ps3's, and blazing fast internet (faster than my city in the US). When i not too long ago went to Syria, i could say that everyone had access to modern technology as well. your statements that Muslim nations don't have access is absurd beyond belief. 

&gt;You should read more real accounts on the human condition in our past and not those romanticized versions of it. Life sucks now, it sucked even more back then. How do you think all those slaves felt back then? Not any better than all those migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, with even less rights back then.

Modern life has its ups and downs, life back than had its ups and downs. I'm just fantasizing about the simplicity about life back than, and not our regimented lives in the modern-era.

&gt;The only thing that makes life better is the scientific method and living in peaceful civil societies that are conducive to progress, individual liberties and that don't have antiquated notions of how human must live their lifes, to please their community.

It seems like your saying that only western nations are peaceful living societies. Just turn off your tv for one second and find someone from one of these ""barbarous"" nations and talk to them about life back in their own country. And this may come to a surprise to you, but Muslim nations do in fact have science, and plenty of it.

&gt; Back then you also had less people more space to spread out, but who is to blame for the high birthrates in islamic countries, if not Islamic teachings favoring big families.

Its due to the lane layout for bot as compared to mid. If you play a 1-1-2-j against a 1-2-1-j, you can get a 1v2 mid and a 2v1 bot. Since bot is a longer lane and has usable side bushes, your 2v1 bot will win their lane harder than the 1v2 mid.

To say that all 'British' people have some similar genetic trait is wrong. Culturally, perhaps, and obviously there's an element of societal influence, but there's no genetic link that would cause all British women to be flat-chested.

Because Europe's population is aging quickly and not reproducing enough to sustain its current socialized system. As the # of older people expecting benefits grow, the # of younger people providing those benefits is dwindling. Immigration is currently the only thing balancing that.

However I would advise against it. I am from a similar background (Hungarian), I understand the situation you are in, but the problem is that you have already framed the problem one way, capital vs. social rights.

Reading Marx would simply cement your views into this dichotomy, which is a problem, as long as you are young and open-minded you should try multiple points of view and analyze this problem from multiple of them.

What I would recommend is reading a bit about Distributism and Libertarianism.

Libertarianism would say that the problem of Eastern Europe is not capital but the government doing too much: spending a large amount of GDP instead of leaving it at the taxpayer to spend it, regulating a lot f.e. lots of permits needed to open a small family restaurant. It would say that this ""neo-liberal"" thing is basically a fake free market because the state is still doing a lot of things, but in the favour of doing it for the rich, corporations, politically well connected, and the corrupt. And it is saying it is not that it should be doing this in favour of the people but plain simply doing a lot less. 

Distributism is a bit closer to your current views. It is saying both big capital and big government are a problem, but see the solution not in the extension of social rights but in ""microcapitalism"" i.e. each family owning their home and a little land, a workshop or a mom and pop store.

At the end of the day it your choice, but you shouldn't settle down for the popular left-wing view before you explore the alternatives. The fact that these left-wing views are the most popular among young college grads in the west and the fact that Marx and Lenin are the most-quoted authors  alone should serve as a warning: popular ideas are rarely right or at least rarely expand the whole of the truth, they usually lack depth.",

I asked Libertarians to respond. Its a reasonable conclusion to jump to. 

&gt;I am no anarchist. Another poor assumption, in addition to being an invalid conclusion from the evidence. Also, I never claimed that constitutions are unjust. I said one particular constitution is a con.

Your entire argument has centered around the notion that no group has any right to form a constitution with any authority over the people of a land. You are now trying to say only the US Constitution is illegitimate, yet I doubt you can find one that does not violate your particular rules of a legitimate constitution. What you are arguing against is the very notion of a Constitution. The specifics of our Constitution have not been discussed, simply the notion of a Constitution.. So... no.. you are not going to get away with changing your argument now. You 

&gt;I told you, it's an annoyance, nothing more.

You entered the discussion trying to claim the Constitution has no authority over you and complaining that you had no choice to accept it because you were born here. Keep trying to change your story though... It might work if you keep at it. 

&gt;Except for the part where I haven't mentioned any conspiracy.

*And you can't figure out what a constitution does not do or WHY they REALLY have one.*   That implies a conspiracy.  In fact, many comments out of you imply some sort of ruse by the founding fathers or those in power that keep the rest of us in the dark.. So.. yeah.. you are mentioning conspiracies. 

&gt;Who has made such an argument? Not me.

Ok that argument was made in another discussion. 

&gt;There's a bad assumption at work here. If you assume the constitution is necessary for this, then you are simply begging the question.

And what bad assumption are you talking about?

&gt;Another bad assumption...

Oh so we can't have a constitution but you are somehow going to be able to enforce a demand for basic human rights? and how are you going to go about doing that?

&gt;Scan back in this post. There are five or six examples to choose from. I admit you did most of the heavy lifting by opening your mouth, but I did take the time to point things out for you.

just as i thought

&gt;Your life is tied up that way, not mine. Like I said, the system is a minor annoyance to me. I don't hate it. I simply see it for the con-job that it is. And just like with any con, if you smarten up a bit, the con-men move on to easier marks. Folks that toe the line actually make it much easier for me.

That is complete bullshit.. Almost everything you do in this country has some element that is tied to the government in some way. If you are driving, you are dealing with a whole host of government regulations that impose upon you a set of rules and obligations. If you are doing business then there are even more. If you don't vote, then you are exactly the kind of person they like. The kind of person that keeps their mouth shut but keeps paying taxes. The ruse being played out is the one that convinced you that engaging in politics is a waste of time. The suckers are the ones who believe they can go about their business and ignore what is going on in the state house. The con job, is the one where the elite in this country complain about how messy politics is as a warning to the meek to stay away. 

You already affirmed that you give up power by not voting even in local elections. If you aren't somebody with money who is at least giving to candidates then you are the perfect patsy.

&gt;If these things don't arouse your fear then why the need to defend against them?

It bothers me that people can live in this country and take it for granted. Mind you, I don't think this county is somehow the greatest on the planet. I would be happier if we could move closer to some of the Northern European nations with regard to social programs and economic policy. I have done my fare share of travel and understand the what makes some countries different from others, as well as what elements of society seem to transcend borders both physical and imagined. I wonder if you have done any traveling. I think it would be a worthy endeavor. 

If I am afraid of anything, its the continued complacency of the American public and the power that gives to Corporations and the politicians they buy. The influence that Corporations and special interests have over our elected officials is directly proportional to the size of their constituency that does not vote. 

&gt;I made no such claim. 

My mistake.. So where were you born?

&gt;Even if I had been born here, that's not sufficient to legitimately assign to me the status of ""citizen.""

I think maybe we had one copy where the speech bubbles were in English, it was a story about how Tintin was being put to death by a group of indiginous people and he knew from a newspaper clipping that there was going to be a solar eclipse, and he spoke to the sun saying punish these people for putting me to death, and when the sun seemed to listen, he was released.

All of the other comics in another language I simply tried to piece together the story from the pictures.  I remember the black bearded man with the blue sweater, and Tintin's dog that always said WOAH WOAH.

During the 70's, 80's, and 90's, all criticism of immigration policies were socially outlawed, with anyone daring to suggest that immigrants were different from the rest of us being branded semi-fascists. The idea was that everyone was equal, and any negative perception of immigrants was only due to racism and evil sensationalist media. This was impossible to disprove, since so many nations *didn't record facts* on the crime and unemployment rates of different ethnicities.

Then, during the early 2000's, something happened. One was the highly publicized murder of Theo van Gogh. The second thing was that, shock and horror, the authorities actually started to gather statistics on various facets of immigration. Here in Norway for example, it turned out that [100% of all sexual assaults](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_rHFKRwv5Y&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=26) were committed by ""non western immigrants"", which is a euphemism for muslims (we have a sizeable population of Vietnamese also, but no one thinks of them as immigrants since they generally learn the language well, do well in school and work hard).  So this left the pro-immigration ideologues with a little problem. Recently there has also been a couple of studies showing atrocious rates of unemployment and welfare use among immigrants - turns out that more immigration costs far, far more in terms of welfare than the tax money their work gives us. All over Europe similar results were found - not only in France, where unemployment is fairly high, but also in Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, where unemployment is extremely low.


Also, it turns out that even though immigrants are a minority group, this doesn't automatically mean that they like all other minority groups. In all neighborhoods with a majority of muslims, antisemitism is on a rise, and womens rights are more like lolmens rights. And don't even start talking about free speech.

Now, I think many of the pro immigration ideologues had gotten inspiration from the US, and had imagined Europe to manage multiculturalism as well as the US, only without slavery, and with an extensive welfare state net. But in spite of this, it turns out that immigration still creates crime and welfare leeching. So what can you do but conclude that immigration is impractical? ",

It sounds to me like there is a tinge of bitterness toward effeminate guys in your original post, and I'm glad you mentioned that here.  I've definitely seen a lot of gay guys cope with the stress they receive from gay bashing idiots by shouting ""well I might be gay, but at least I'm *NOT A FAG!!1~*"" and pointing fingers at someone more effeminate than they.

First, I want you to know I think its totally fine that you're not in to fem (fat,skinny,white,black,jock,nerdy,etc) guys.  There's nothing wrong with that, and there's not even anything wrong with saying that very directly.  I'm not in to all kinds of guys, and if there's no better way to handle it, I'll tell someone directly (and politely) that I'm just not in to them, and I think that's ok.  The alternative is leading them on which is even worse.

You seem like a nice guy who's just trying to figure all of this out, and I encourage you to look for the virtues the LGBT community has to offer, the greatest of which is tolerance of gender variance.  Look at all the dysfunctional straight relationships around you (and probably many of the successful ones): one of the biggest recurring problems you'll see is people fighting over perceived genders roles, everything from guys thinking a girl is either too eager to get laid or too 'frigid', too controlling/too irrational, too (insert female stereotype); to girls thinking a guy is too jockish, too afraid of commitment, not manly enough, not 'taking charge of/responsibility for the relationship,' taking too much resposibility for the relationship and being controlling/domineering.  All of this kind of shit comes from attributing someone's behavior to their gender or from being upset by someone behaving in a way that you don't think they should because of their gender instead of just seeing that person for who they are and dealing with it.  All of this tension is complete bullshit, and as a gay man, you have a chance to escape it.

People act however they act for whatever reasons they want.  How other people of their gender often act should not determine whether or not it is ok for someone to act one way or another.  All of this is really vague, so I'll get down to it: what's wrong with a man enjoying doing something that other men in his particular geographic area don't do?  Decades ago it was considered absurd/offensive/gender bending for women to wear pants (for further reading: Americans vs Europeans on Speedos).  This kind of stuff changes all the time, but the lesson to take away from it is that, what's important in a relationship is how people do act and who they are as a person, not how ""they're supposed to act"" or what's ""normal.""

You could waste your whole life fretting over ""normal,"" but I say, ""That's a waste of time"".  Just be happy, and be nice to your friends.",I bribed the mod with a pic of stuffed animals and all I got was

They seperate themselves so effectively that 50 years later many still do not even speak the language of the country they moved to.

Also, poor city planning has exacerbated issues, particularly in France.  Banlieues (sp?) and other places where the area is full of crime, education is poor, etc and immigrants begin to feel an increased separation from society.  

On a separate note, the prevalence of illegal immigration is partly due to completely stupid EU immigration laws.  Because you can move between borders unchecked, it is very easy for an immigrant on a short working visa to simply disappear when it's time to go.  A North African can simply show up, banana boat style, on the coast of Spain with no ID.

What you perceive as a spade.  In reality you're just painting millions of people as racists simply because you're a lazy liberal with no intellect or ability to argue a position on the merits and you've been trained by your lazy parents to be this way.  Hey, just calling a spade a spade.

&gt;Just because you are tired of hearing about it doesn't make it less pertinent.

Except it's not pertinent to any discussion on immigration law.  Your pathetic attempt to shut down the other side's position by proclaiming them racist is an abject failure in argument.

&gt;Please explain how our current immigration laws are so beneficial to our country.

They keep out those who may be a drain on society while allowing in those who may be a benefit.

&gt;Explain to me how, if the process were simpler and shorter, we'd still have a problem with illegal immigrants.

There may indeed be room to make the process more manageable, but doing so doesn't magically mean you'll get your wish of unlimited unfettered immigration.  Even if we did change the process a bit, it would still search benefit from those who may be good for the country while weeding out those who may not.  And then you'd still be here bitching all day about it.

See, I see right through your smoke and mirrors approach of making the immigration process ""simpler and shorter.""  That's not really what you mean though, you mean let's change our entire immigration system to allow unfettered citizenship to anyone who wants to come here.

&gt;Explain to me why, if you are in fact NOT xenophobic, how somebody born in another country who wants to live here has to jump through hoops whereas somebody born here gets a free ride?

Because that's life.  It's reality that lines have been drawn and laws made.  If you don't like it, argue the merits of changing the laws, don't sit around like a lazy liberal and yell racism.  You can cry me a river about how sad it is that they were born somewhere else and how we're all humans, but it's simply an appeal to emotion which falls on its face.

Also, generally the idea behind birth citizenship is that those who came before them have contributed to society in such a way that their offspring may produce the same result.  Meanwhile, those not born here have no such distinction and have to prove they would be a benefit.

&gt;WE ARE NOT EUROPE, WE ARE NOT JAPAN, forget their immigration policies, we aren't them.

Their immigration policies can be good to look at to see what is working and what is not.  To act as if we should just ignore them simply because you don't like how they operate is laughable.

&gt;This is a nation of immigrants and in the past 20 years we have absolutely turned our backs on that.

Not really.  We allow plenty of immigrants in through legal channels.  Just because we don't allow EVERYONE in doesn't magically mean we've turned our back on immigrants.

Reality is you won't be happy until we let every single person in the world who wants to come into the US in.  There's really no merit to such a concept so you appeal to emotions.",

Europeans do have that right since their race and their culture, their 'people', have lived in specific areas of Europe for most of history.

There is tension where there is a lot of immigration.  That is natural. The tension is actually part of the integration process.  There was as much if not more tension in America during the 19th century immigration and subsequent integration. If you think the process of American integration was smooth, then you haven't studied enough. 

Europe is not more or less racist than America. There's no comparison, because the US is a country and Europe is a fucking continent. Each country here is different. Very different. As different from each other as the US is from each of them. 

The Europeans need to be welcoming of the people they invite in. Which they are by and large, with a few exceptions. 

The people invited in, need to adapt because they are moving into someone else's country. Which they don't do so well. But these things take time. 

And the illegals need to be shipped home so that the social pressure of their continued presence will force reforms, so their own countries get better.  There is nothing wrong with enforcing the borders, so long as it's humane.

that describes the vast majority of americans

nearly 50% of americans would not be able to come up with $2000 within 30 days for a crisis:

http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/05/23/nearly-half-of-americans-are-financially-fragile/

to put $2000 into perspective, that's about the starting rate for just showing up to a hospital emergency room with a pulse and the fee goes up from there with every service. a night in the hospital is about $10,000, a broken bone is about $15,000, and these expenses stack on top of each other. that WSJ article discusses a few european nations as a contrast to US conditions, but fails to mention that those EU countries offer things like universal healthcare and have laws to protect disenfranchised workers, so a financial emergency to them is quite different than one in the USA. this is why the vast majority of american bankruptcies are from medical bills:

http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH

the USA is basically a third world country that lets its majority working poor pretend like they have better lives by getting themselves overloaded with debt which enables them to live beyond their means. this is evidenced by the fact that the average american has $16,000 in credit card debt, and the average american college grad has $25,000 in student loans.

**Germany** - lead by the Weimar Republic, had one party called the National Socialist party (aka NAZIs) and then they had their Reichstagg Building fire which they blamed on communists (since learned they started it themselves), they passed a law bypassing many of their republics constitutional laws, and eventually NAZI party was in charge and Hitler was raised to dictator.   They then blasted in blitzkrieg type attacks across borders all over europe and even into africa for reasons that they claimed to have justifications for.


**United States**- Democratic Republic - had a new branch infiltrate the Republican party and even some of the others known as Neo-Conservatives (Neo-Cons), we have 9/11 which we blame on Al Qaeda, We declare our ""War on Terror"" (which is a concept, not a person, or group), we pass the Patriot Act which bypasses most of our constitutional rights, the Neo-Con party rises to power, we invade Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and unofficially we've made strikes into Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.  We make claims of why we go into those areas but, then areas that have had the same problems such as Rwanda, and Yemen we more or less ignore.  The difference being that the places we do go into tend to have valuable natural resources.   Rwanda had amazing genocide occurring and they asked for our help.  That is what the movie Hotel Rwanda is about.   As far as dictators.   You tell me:  Obama authorized an act of war on Libya which is technically only supposed to be a power of congress by using some laws that were added that gave additional powers to the executive branch.  Under those provisions it claims that the president can authorize an action for 60 days without congressional approval.   That 60 days with Libya has come and gone and congress has not approved the act.  Yet, we still are in Libya bombing it.  That sounds rather Dictatorial to me.



So, yes they are making comparisons to the NAZIs and the historical evidence is there.   So, rather than a kneejerk emotional reaction take some time to think about it and think how we can stop this.  I can assure you the Germans were convinced by their leadership that Hitler's actions were justified as well.


**and no** - we are not like the NAZI's.  Our Dictatorship is not like Hitler's.   This is in the future.   Those in power have learned from past mistakes so, they are better at it than the Nazi's and Hitler.",

Your attitude is racist and there's no other word for it. That being said let me tell you why it appears that you're correct:


Why is immigration so successful in Canada and the United States? Our immigration policy is based on importing the middle class from other countries. We take educated, relatively wealthy individuals who produce a net benefit to our society. Coupled with decreasing birth rates immigration becomes a powerful and necessary tool to keep up our societal wealth and benefits.


Why is immigration not so successful in Europe? Most immigrants are imported labourers: uneducated, poor, often more orthodox in their religious beliefs. 


Now let me ask you this: who commits the petty crimes in society? The uneducated, the poor. The fact that immigrants are hurting your precious European society is not to do with the fact that they're immigrants, it's a side-effect of demography. Your society has placed immigrants in the bottom rung, and that's where they'll stay and there's where they'll lash out.


Empower, educate, and integrate your immigrants just as we do in Canada and the United States. While you're at it, empower, educate, and integrate the poor white people of society too. That's where the problem lies, not with the colour of their skin.

3: Generally everything is ""at par"" (parity) with US prices, especially moreso now that our dollar is just that- at parity (or above!) the US figures.  And gasoline is a ripoff anywhere that isn't the middle east, apparently, and we Canadians can't even get good figures on what's going on with Albertan petrol exports, so don't rely on the European painting entirely (I hear Europe is negative towards ""the oil sands"" [Alberta] in every possible way).  With the rising cost of fuel the price of everything has gone up ""a bit"" (gasoline fuel drove the price of dairy products up as much as 25% over the past 5 or less years) or at least that's what the supermarkets/grocery/industry will tell us ;)

4: Prepaid plans are bountiful here.  Our telecommunications industry is a joke, so be prepared to either have to use Rogers[.com] or Bell[.ca], unless you're going to be lucky enough to live somewhere where there's actual ""competition"" (not price fixing or collusion, like you get in a province like Ontario).  Some other brands are Virgin Mobile (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell), Fido [a wholly owned subsidiary of Rogers], Wind [Rogers and Bell complained to the national regulator that this brand didn't meet CRTC regulation requirements, and effectively are pinching them out of the market because they're not meeting CRTC imposed national ownership requirements], and other provinces will occasionally have other providers like Telus, who offers TV services only on the west coast, while they offer cell phone service nationally.  

You should be able to get a plan for ""as low as"" 15/20 dollars a month, but that'll be limited amount of daytime talking and probably pay-per-text.  Also, here in North America we're billed for incoming calls on landlines so your minutes will be consumed or you will pay depending on the plan to accept calls, which can be free in Europe if my understanding is correct?

5: Insurance is another industry that is not regulated as tightly as one would expect nationally.  As some posts have stated, so you wind up paying a lot in some provinces and less in others.  If you're landing in BC, you may need to process your drivers license to ensure it's accepted here, and I don't know if an car rental agency would rent you a car without Canadian insurance, so you may need to figure that out, which may just be cheaper to buy a bus ticket and meet some weirdos on your way to MB, and deal with that once you're there.  

If you chance plans and choose Ontario, I can fill you in with more specific information ;)

First of all, for disclosure: I'm Brazilian, of Italian and Portuguese descent, married to someone of Japanese descent. The Portuguese came here about five centuries ago, while the main Italian and Japanese waves of immigration happened about just a century ago.

It was not just exploitation by the rich Europeans. Brazil was also a land of opportunity for many impoverished immigrants. My great grandparents and everyone after that worked their asses off to provide a better life for their offspring. You (rich countries in general, Europeans in particular) shouldn’t do this (responsibly manage your immigration policies) out of guilt or historical responsibility. You should do this out of honor, of pride that you managed to have a nation able of attracting more people in than it loses people seeking for a better place to live. All my country had to offer five and even one century ago was its natural resources, everything else was still left to be built.

Second of all, while I recognize the rights you just mentioned, I also ask you to be “practical”. I value both liberty and equality, but what I mean for equality is equal *opportunities*, the possibility of realizing one’s full potential. But it also implies that in order to realize one’s full potential, one need not only that the State provides “equal grounds” among its peers, but also a great deal of hard work by oneself. I would guess that this is the spirit with which most of the immigrants arrive at a foreign land. But I also recognize that failure to adjust the size of this “help” given by the State might creates a *moral hazard*, and some people (not necessarily —nor ‘mainly’— immigrants, let’s be clear) might prefer to rely on this “compassionate crutch” than on its own efforts to overcome life’s hardships.

I think it still is, unfortunately. Look at the reception of Deutschland schafft sich ab, the book of Thilo Sarrazin, a respected left-wing politician with excellent credentials, a member of the German SDP, the oldest and probably biggest socialist party in Europe, when it was published last year.

The essence of the book is that certain demographics in Germany are more associated with welfare claims and crime than others, namely those associated with a certain religion (of peace). He doesn't blame the immigrants, who can blame someone for moving to a country with a welfare state that awards parents 250 euros a month per child even if the parents are employed. He blames the system that allows it to happen.  The book is full of statistics; graphs and tables which back up his claims. What I noticed is that no one who was offended by the book ever disputed the facts but just called him a 'racist'. Around 50% of the population agreed with the sentiments of the book.

Unfortunately it seems, even if you have the statistics and facts to back-up your points, frank discussion about immigration is still off the table unless you want to be tarred a 'racist'.

&gt;No other religion in Europe makes so many demands. No immigrant group other than Muslims is so strongly connected with claims on the welfare state and crime.

I don't understand the black-and-white outlook shared by so many commenters over here. I'm sure many understand that immigration, especially immigration in Europe, is a rather complicated issue and yet many fail to address this view in their comments.

In order to understand immigration in Europe one must look at a number of factors, including of course history, militarism, political ideas, economy and city planning. Just looking at city planning, for example, one quickly finds out that certain European cities were designed to keep the unwanted from ever attempting to integrate into the established, ""normal"" society. Of course, immigrants are not the only group affected by artificial ghettos of cities like London or Paris (""la Haine"" is a film worth watching by the way, if you are interested in Parisian city construction and systematic ghetto creation), no it's mostly the poor and underprivileged that live day in and day out in a catch 22 situation. 

Those council housing projects of London are a good example, so are the huge brick complexes on the outskirts of Paris. Once you are in you are guaranteed to stay for at least a couple of generation. The systematic destruction of a good public schooling net in Britain, for example, does not aid this problem very well either. As you know ""A university education, begins in the kindergarten"". 

So how is this related to immigration? Well, in many ways. In the end, you reap what you sow. France certainly didn't make herself any favours by ghettoizing the people that helped rebuild Paris and the rest of France after both world wars went down, luring them in with false promises. Other European countries, sans a couple of exception, followed the same strategy.

Of course comparing then and now is not the smartest thing that one can do. So, I will just leave it at that. The faults of the current, ""happy-immigration"", system are many, yet this shouldn't be used as an argument against multiculturalism. Neither should it be used as an argument against immigrants themselves. The two concepts are barely related, if they are at all. What we are essentially doing right now, is creating parallel societies, that serve to only further disintegrate our feeble notion of a multicultural construct. The efforts involved in creating a division of cultures, through ghettoization, ""welfaring"" and the likes should be directed at proper established and well thought out integration programs.

Yes, I'm certainly aware of welfare-pirates. I'm certainly aware of a large number of immigrants abusing the welfare-state systems of Europe (This German paper states that immigrants make up around 1/8 of all benefit receivers  &gt;http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Publikationen/Querschnittsveroeffentlichungen/WirtschaftStatistik/Sozialleistungen/Sozialleistungen2009,property=file.pdf ). Yet, why stop at  immigrants? As it is with the local poor and underprivileged (who I'm sure are also in on the whole, ""giving-welfare-state-readytobefucked"" idea), they too are somewhat struggling to find a great outlet of integration. 

I also find it very funny how a lot of people, here as well as AFK, subscribe to the notion of ""integrate or get the fuck out of the country"". Well, I'm afraid it's not all that simple. I would like to see you try integrating in France. Something as simple as getting a flat in a rather sparsely populated city such as Strasbourg for example, will prove to be a problem if you happen to come from, say, Romania. So, what goes on if you happen to be non-white? Well, have fun with veiled  racial profiling, getting stopped by the police and so on and so forth. Integrating is not an easy process. Integrating well is even harder. 

What really needs to happen is the establishment of proper channels for those that want to integrate as well as for those that can not do it on their own and this does not apply to immigrants only, by the way.",

I know and obey one fundamental rule: to be able to live a good life as an immigrant *you have to let yourself be assimilated into the host culture*. Full stop. You can preserve your heritage just as long as it does not conflict with the host culture. Further more, you may be able to enrich the host culture, and that will be, sooner or later, welcomed. The keyword here is *host*.

You don't go visiting people at home, then put your feet up on their table and take a dump in the middle of their living room or whatever, because that's ""what you do"", ""your way"", ""your heritage"", and if it's a ""cultural"" thing, no one can object - reminds me of that town in Spain that has no library, no theatre, etc., but the locals have this wonderful habit of throwing a live goat from the top of the church tower, because it's ""cultural tradition"".

The host didn't ask you to come in (yes, a very select few of them did: the large unscrupulous corporations looking for cheap labour). The host has its own ways, and traditions, and culture (many of which deserve ""quotes"", no doubt), but they're *their own*, which are obviously the norm.
 
Think of reverse immigration, how would that feel? Ah, wait, it happened already, it's called an invasion. But unless you are willing to call European immigration revenge, imagine you would emmigrate in Eastern Europe, Asia, Turkey, or Africa. You think your habits and traditions would be welcomed with songs and poems?

You want to preserve everything about your cultural self? Fine, preserve your current location, too, then. Else prepare for change or suspicious looks.

A few Muslim chaps in UK found it reasonable to protest the Wars with signs reading stuff on the lines of ""Death to British soldiers"", right in the Midlands. Well, that's provocation, and ""asking for it"", by any standards. Done by a few individuals that probably don't care if they get deported, but it does do a tremendous disservice to the Muslim community. The masses don't have the time or disposition for the finer points, so, next thing you know, it's gonna be ""bl••dy muslims"". And ""f•••ing blacks"", and ""d•••ed Eastern ba••••ds taking our jobs"".

The World is full of tension, and Europe is old, and poorly managed. The wars rage on, and now, more than ever, a butterfly flapping its wings in Asia causes a hurricane on the old continent. There are immigrants in Europe who have family in the war zones. It's a curious situation in which you get, i.e., Iraqis in your country, while your country wages open war with Iraq. It's like so many things go on way above our heads in terms of decision and action, and what pours down on us from there translates into very real economical issues, suspicion, intolerance, outright hate.

Anyway, as I said, the main principle is assimilation. On top of that, bring the good things and paste them of the host culture, if it'll have it. I wish I could say ""Or you can always go back home"", but for many people that is simply not possible.

It was pretty much the enclave of liberal white English and Europeans during the apartheid years. Most people there very left leaning for the times. That was exacerbated by the geographical distance from the capital, Pretoria. 

After 1994 though, the rest of the country was forced to change. As a result there was a period of turmoil in cities like Jo'burg, that Cape Town didn't experience as severely. So, many of the liberal whites saw that as a failure of the new government. 

Now, for true transformation to take place, those who had previously benefitted, need to give back the excess they have. But the ""liberal whites"", after having observed the failure of government to maintain order, felt thy should have to suffer. And that has in a way created a ""Democrat/Republican"" type split.

Both of these points are actually valid(with other factors) reasons to apply as a refugee or person seeking political asylum. If you are persecuted for the generally darker color of your skin, the US government may actually give you special treatment.

(A shallow orthography means an orthography that's close to 'one sound, one symbol').

For me, growing up as a native English speaker (you guessed right), dealing with French orthography wasn't that tough - I was already used to letters not being pronounced and letters affecting the pronunciation of other letters. It was just a matter of learning the new system. Plus, learning French for English speakers is, I imagine, similar to learning Swedish for Finnish speakers. Even though there's no family relationship between Swedish and Finnish, and the family relationship between French and English is very distant, the fact that there's been so much linguistic and cultural interaction over so many centuries between the two different languages means learning them is much easier. In fact, even though English and German are actually quite closely related, English speakers usually have a much easier time learning French than German because of the centuries of cultural interaction. French and other European languages share words, for sure, but English shares over *40%* of its vocabulary with French. Plus, with another 15% of its vocabulary coming from Latin, there are additional similarities there. In other words, if I don't know a word in French, nearly half the time, there's an English word that has a similar meaning in French.

Back to the orthographies, I think I can (sloppily and broadly) break them into 4 categories:

* Simple and logical (Finnish, Italian, Tagalog, Korean)
* Maddening, yet logical (French, Irish, Thai)
* Maddening and illogical (English, Tibetan)
* Chinese.

(I'd include Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mayan glyphs into the fourth category, but nobody really uses them any more)

So I think that going from a language higher on that scale to another language at the same level is pretty easy, but going down it is a bitch, because you constantly end up asking yourself ""WHY DOESN'T THIS JUST MAKE SENSE??? WHO THE HELL CAME UP WITH THIS???"" In other words, even as a person who's education has always been in a language that has a madcap spelling system, Tibetan and Chinese scare the hell out of me.",

Unlike many European countries, America never had a well-defined ""proletariat.""  Most American Marxist movements stemmed from immigrant populations.  For the majority of the American working poor, then as today, their economic situations aren't seen as the oppression of the upper classes but as either a failure of themselves to succeed or as a temporary state of poverty that could, at any moment, reverse itself.  

In today's world credit has had a lot to do with this as well.  In poor areas people still have computers, large televisions, and DVD or Blue-ray players, even though they can't afford them.  This dependence on credit and debt provides the illusion to the lower and working poor classes that they are, in fact, middle class, which is how the vast majority of American's describe themselves.

I feel that this ties into the American perception of socialism because the American idea of socialism is one in which tax money paid to the government is used to fund social programs, such as medical care, infrastructure, and education.  But most people frankly don't care about those things, they have had to scrape and struggle and plunge into debt to live their lives and they don't want their money ""wasted"" on people who in their opinion are too lazy to suffer along with them.  They don't trust the government to handle their money because, in a socialist system, it is the government that decides where it goes. 

They imagine their tax money going to people that they don't like, in the example of my area there is the opinion that socialism will help ethnic minorities, illegal immigrants, and the ""lazy poor.""  For them socialism = the dictatorship of ""the other,"" not benefits to them.

I see this all of the time, and I imagine that it is a likely case.  Any thoughts?",

The first thing is that the cool thing about immigrating to the US is that you can gain full US citizenship (voting rights, unemployment benefits, etc. etc.). This is almost impossible to do as an American to most Eu countries. I've lived here for over a decade and for 7 years I had to renew my visa (based upon independent contractor status). This meant that at any point my Visa could've been revoked and I would've been sent packing. During this time if you are caught breaking any law (no matter how small) the police have a right to hold you, and deport you. I had one friend who was riding the metro without a ticket, he didn't have his papers in order, the metro cops called the real cops as he didn't have his passport on him, and he was held for 8 months in jail before he was finally deported. He even had a child here which would've made him eligible for a family visa but because he didn't do the necessary paperwork beforehand he couldn't even apply for it after he was arrested for riding the metro without a ticket. Now he is waiting for three years to pass before he can simply reapply to live here. And even then there's still no guarantee that they will let him back in. Imagine the outcry which would occur if random traffic stops resulted in deporting an illegal immigrant in the US (cough cough...Arizona). Yet this is the way it is around most of the EU. And yes, all Americans who travel abroad are required to carry their passports on them at all times. If a cop stops you, and you don't have a passport you can be held (until someone brings in your passport) and then fined for not carrying it. While I admit that this is uncommon it is still the law. 

Also. I'm a 10 year resident of this country (which is now governed under EU laws concerning immigration), I have a child here, and I've been married to a czech national for 4 years. Even with these factors I was still only given a 5 year family visa to stay. At the end of five years I can apply for a long term visa. And even after getting the long term visa I'm still never a citizen. There's no voting rights, nothing. In the US this process moves much faster.

Currently it is estimated that as many as 1 in every 15 people in the US are there illegally. They work, have children, get drivers licenses, (in some cases) social security, and their children can of course attend public schools in the US. Because of the fact that anyone born in the US in the US becomes a citizen complicates matters even more. Since obviously it is rare to deport the parents of an American citizen. Try doing the same in any EU country. You think if you went to the UK and had a baby that the government would recognize the child IMMEDIATELY as a British citizen, and then allow you to live in the country indefinitely just because you had a baby there? fat chance.

TLDR: Immigration laws are extremely complicated everywhere, and the speed and benefits of becoming a US citizen are far better than anywhere else on the planet. ",

The emirate is also a generous backer of Hamas; the Iranian regime’s propaganda station, Press TV, recently reported that the Hamas leadership may even be relocating to Qatar from Syria. Given that Qatar has been a key base for the Egyptian Islamist leader Sheikh Yousef al Qaradawi, and that its Al Jazeera satellite network has long been a mouthpiece for Hamas, such a move seems eminently plausible.

The Qatar Foundation itself is directly implicated in the financial network of Islamist terror. Professor Hatem Karanshawy, dean of its faculty of Islamic studies, chaired an Islamic Development Bank committee which just awarded a prize for “the promotion of Islamic economics” to the Islamic Foundation in the United Kingdom, a body closely tied to the global Muslim Brotherhood and Pakistan’s Jama’at-e-Islami. The Foundation is also linked with the Union of the Good, an umbrella body of Islamist organizations which includes other ostensibly charitable Qatari institutions, and which financed the pro-Hamas flotilla to Gaza in May last year.

Buying a stake in the world’s most popular sport, through its most august club, provides Qatar’s rulers with an excellent instrument for fending off the criticism that Hamas terrorists, if they didn’t insist upon civilian clothing when fighting, would, like Barcelona’s players, be wearing uniforms embossed with the emirate’s name. Indeed, last year’s successful bid by Qatar to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, a project for which the ruling family enlisted the assistance of Barcelona’s dashing coach, Pep Guardiola, was the investment’s most handsome dividend yet.

Except that the Qataris may have overextended themselves. Right now, soccer’s governing body, FIFA, is mired in a bribes scandal, and the Qataris are up to their necks in it. Already, Theo Zwanziger, Germany’s soccer chief, has called for an investigation into just how this thoroughly nasty little kingdom landed the most coveted prize in international sport.

Will that bounce back onto the Barcelona deal, or even derail it? So far, there’s precious little indication from the club itself that its distinctive version of the Red-Green alliance is to be dumped. However, if this agonized Barcelona supporter is anything to go by, the Nou Camp faithful may feel rather differently — and it is this “army of assorted liberals” that holds the key to the club’s policy.

Maybe, just maybe, we are about to see an isolated example of the European left shrugging off the Islamist embrace. Mes que un Club? We’ll see.",

First of all, this is a clear story of bullying, I do not defend the girls' actions, and believe there should be strong consequences for their actions.  So please don't misunderstand.

But!  I hate when people look at examples where people from a marginalized group perform a wrong against a member or members of a privileged group and ask why things aren't equal.  Well...because things aren't equal.  Sorry, but when a person of color, in America, performs an act of bigotry or prejudice against a Caucasian or person of European descent, it just doesn't have the same context.  It just doesn't.  White people in America do not have the same history of oppression and do not continue to suffer with the societal repercussions of said oppression.  

Same for an act of bigotry performed by a gay person against straight, or female against male.  It doesn't magically make that bigotry *okay*, and anyone who said so would be psychotic, but it doesn't exist withing the sphere of *institutionalized* oppression, and comes with a different background.

You can't ask 'why the double standard?' when the double standard ""benefits""(in terms of them getting less punishment or repercussions) the marginalized group, and then ignore when those same double standards penalize that group -- which happens *far more often*.

I too have lived in America (in Texas) for a good 5 years, and I am currently living in Europe. What a lot of the Americans commenting in here need to understand is the massive difference between Mexican immigrants and European Muslim immigrants. They are worlds apart. Yes, Mexican immigrants do tend to live in communities with other Mexicans. This is more to do with economic necessity than anything else. None the less, they itegrate into society to a certain extent, and usually by second generation they are pretty much fully integrated and contributing to society. Also, you have to remember that the Mexican culture is pretty much simular to American culture. Same religion. Same social customs. Same general understanding of western norms. Apart from Language barriers (and even that language is a simular raomantic language), there is not really much seperating Americans from Mexicans, and so the immigation experience is really not too bad. Personally I would kill to replace our European immigrants with some Mexicans. Yes there are a few Muslim immigrants in America, but it is very hard for them to be illegal, due to geographic reasons. The only country boardering America is Mexico (yes yes, and canada), and its not really a muslim country. The only muslims you get are legal ones, and so that means they are educated and have something to bring to society. In order to get to that level, they have to have had an already western worldview, and language understanding anyway. Its not like illegal muslims immigrants can get to America by plane (well the last time they did, was on 9/11 and see how that worked out for you?)You pretty much get the creme de le creme of the muslim world. Europe gets the shitty uncivilized shitty Muslims. 

Now compare that to the Eurpoean experience. The immigrants we get here are of very little value. This isnt like Mexico, which could be argued to be semi-civilized. These are immigrants from Africa, and the middle East. Sometimes it is hard to fully comprehend just how backward-ass these cultures are. They are  like barbarians with their customs. It is like going back 1000 years. These immigrants all live in very isolated communities, and do not integrate at all with the country they are in. Many are openly hostile to its customs and norms. Many can live for decades without knowing any of the language. They only shop in muslim shops. Go to muslim schools. Cannot be friends with non-muslims. The majority of their money is sent back to their home country. They are violent towards the host nations population. You don't need me to go into all the shit they bring with them. Burkas, honor killings, discrimination. Every time someone uses it in an argument they get accused of picking out the extremes. The thing is, it happens all the time.

honor killings - I'm using an extreme example!
Discrimination/ attacking gays - I'm using an extreme example!
constant terrorist plots - I'm using an extreme example!
Degrading women - I'm using an extreme example!
female genital mutilation - I'm using an extreme example!
massive sexual assult figures - extreme example!
anti-semintism - I'm using an extreme example! RACIST!!!!111
etc, etc...

When a culture has that many ""extreme"" examples, then you have to ask if we are really being hysterical, or racist. This isn't stuff I have seen in the papers. I see women wrapped up in burkas, and violent muslim harassment on an almost daily basis. How many ""extreme"" examples of Mexican culture can you list off? How many mexican terrorist networks are there plotting to bring down the USA? How many mexicans do you see harssing Americans all day and refusing to talk to them?

It is not racism. I don't give a shit about race or colour or what country you are from. Heck, I am not even against the concept of immigration, when it is done correctly, i.e, immigrants integrating and bring skills/culture/experience, etc to the country. This is not what we have here. This is like a giant spoon came down from the sky, and scooped up a massive part of the middle east/Africa and put it in the middle of Europe. You may as well just draw a boarder around these communities and call them a new country, because for all practical purposes, thats what it is. 

The concept of good immigration policy is that in the short term it costs the country, but in the long term they pay it back with their kids, and when they get better jobs etc. This is not the case in Europe with these people. Most money is sent home. They are a massive burden on the welfare system as very few of them can work. The women aren't allowed to work due to their shitty culture, so thats 50% of them being a drain on the system right off the bat. The rest are so uneducated and unwilling to learn or integrate, or let their kids integrate, that its just a constant drain. They just reproduce and ensure their kids keep all their home country customers, to they are almost like trojan horses in the long term. Thats not even to mention the fact that a very large number of the ones coming from Africa have HIV, which drains the health care system, as well as giving it to the local population (voluntarily, or by force...statistics show sexual assults is many magnitudes larger by immigrants than locals. those are govt figures...not tabloid propoganda)

Yes, I know I am summarising, and I know that there are good muslims who do assimulate, etc and thats fine. But you cannot deny that Europe has a serious issue here, and that the western world has a serious problem with muslim culture. I know its nice to just do the knee-jerk reaction of branding anyone who calls attention to it a ""racist"", but that isnt going to get you anywhere. 

Racism is discriminating based on your race. That means your genetics, or country of origin.

We are discriminating people based on their behaviours, like you would anyone else in a society. Its like not discriminating a burgular because its their own personal ""culture"" to rob people. Its absurd.

Anyway, rant over.

&gt; Why is immigration not so successful in Europe? Most immigrants are imported labourers: uneducated, poor, often more orthodox in their religious beliefs. /.../ who commits the petty crimes in society? The uneducated, the poor.

So you did not write ""primitives"" but you are stating that immigrants are criminals -- which is the core of the message you are responding to -- and along the way, you are insulting the ""uneducated"". My grand-parents would appreciate your theories.

Please backup these claims with statistics or stfu.

Because that is the ethnic group that seems to cause the most division in our society. We (the UK) have had a lot of immigration from Poland, and apart from the far-right newspapers not much has come of it.

However, as I mentioned in another post, Islam is a deliberately invasive culture. Its mission statement is to assimilate other cultures - they* make no attempt to fit in).

The US and Canada doesn't have the illegal immigration (of those from African/Asian countries) problem that Europe has, as it doesn't share any close borders or small sea channels (the English Channel, for example). It is harder to kick someone out once they're already here, and if someone overstays their welcome, as many do, then there is by definition no point in assimilating into the culture as you can't live as a normal citizen anyway!

* And I'm speaking generally here; everyone is an individual with individual circumstances, but the teachings of the Muslim faith are such.",

You can't just ""keep"" a currency down. It either de-values because no-one wants it in order to buy stuff, or the country prints money like crazy.

A currency can loose value, if people panic, thinking that there is no guarantee behind it (the GDP of a country, or EU GDP for our discussion). This is what EU is avoiding by giving new loans to Greece - these are loans which are never going to be repaid in full

It boggles my mind how you can't see a major obvious difference: the US is a country that was formed through constant immigration in the recent past (compared to european societies).

With very few exceptions, there is no country like that on earth. The US is simply used to immigration and can identify with them. A country like the Netherlands or Sweden that used to be pretty homogeneous culturally and ""phenotypic"" for a long time is now faced with something rather new.",
