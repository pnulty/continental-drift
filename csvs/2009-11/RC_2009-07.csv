The US were the country which defeated Japan (along with China and others, but the US role was crucial). But had Leningrad (St. Petersburg), Stalingrad (Volgograd) and Moscow fallen, the Nazis could have destroyed the Soviet Union and dominated all of its territory, and exploited its natural and human resources. This would have left Germany in *much* better shape to come-what-may continue to dominate western Europe as well and militarily pursue much harder their interests in other parts of Asia and Africa.

While I entirely agree that the US was ""pretty important"", the Soviets defeating Hitler was even more important. 

&gt; This isn't jingoism or propaganda. It is a fact.

Thanks for pointing that out.

&gt; The fact that their factories and supply lines weren't being destroyed meant they could out produce everyone else in the world at the time. 

Yes.

&gt; Without the supplies and manpower from the US, the Brits most likely would have capitulated and next the Russians.

The Brits, with their famous stiff upper lips, probably wouldn't have capitulated or --Hitler's preferred option-- switched allegiance to, or otherwise arranged themselves with the Axis unless having suffered extremely heavy losses. The Battle of Britain took place in summer/autumn 1940, and was won by the UK. Hitler invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. The US formally entered WWII in response to Hitler declaring war on the US on 11 December 1941. Before that, Germany's interest in defeating Britain had been reduced, as Germany considered the war in the West as essentially won. The Soviets would not have capitulated following a hypothetical British capitulation, which, after them winning the Battle of Britain, would have taken significantly more time and effort to secure. The Soviets would definitely not have capitulated after winning the battle of Stalingrad (17 July 1942 - 2 February 1943). Had the US stayed out of the war and also not supported Allied European powers before entering the war themselves, the Soviets would have continued to push westward, and eventually reached Berlin all the same. D-Day didn't take place until 6 June 1944. By that time Hitler had already very clearly lost in the East. Sure, the Nazis might well still have staged a late invasion of Britain after Stalingrad, but it would only have delayed the inevitable. That said, the US staying out of WWII would have dramatically increased the Soviet body count, because it would have made the Soviet campaign longer both in time and distance and Nazi opposition much more concerted. But after Stalingrad Europe could at most have turned all red. It would not have stayed brown, even without the US.

There were many points in WWII when things were a lot closer than people like to think today, and the outcome not at all a foregone conclusion. After Stalingrad, the Soviets (NB: Soviets != Russians) had the same advantage the US had: a huge *hnterland*. And while the Soviets in the battle of Stalingrad were indeed comparatively ill equipped and trained, their military, and technology, and production numbers got better and better afterwards. But ok, maybe saying that the US would have lost without the Soviets is the wrong order. It's probably more accurate to say that the Nazis being tied up and losing in the East made D-Day possible.

While I can't argue for the quality of IE, I do see some issues with the lawsuit.  I do understand that it targets MS because they have a lions-share of the market, but I think it isn't exactly a fair targeting of them.  I think that if MS is being sued, the legislation should apply to other OSs as well.  Apple should be forced to do the same.

To counter your arguments (A) Apple has 69% of the smartphone marketshare in the US* (can't find numbers for Europe) and (B) Google, a la Android, is pushing for more openness in smartphones.  WinMo is very open and Palm has released it's Pre sourcekit to developers.  In my opinion, since phones are arguably becoming less of a phone and more of a portable computing device, I see them opening themselves more and more to such litigious action.  Ironically, MS has had the most open of the mobile OSs till Android (looking at pre-Pre Palm, RIM, and Apple).  While I can't say it's an amazing phone OS, I do respect the openness of it.  They allowed users to install their own browsers (Fennec, Webkit/Gecko, Opera Mobile) have even gone so far as to allow HTC to recode entire elements of the OS for their phones.  Outside of Android you do not see this openness.

&gt; Apple has 69% of the smartphone market in the US

That number sounds high to me, though it's possible, but in any case 69% isn't even close to 90%. Apple has a lot of muscle in the US market, but they can't yet shut other smartphone developers out arbitrarily.

The wireless providers are a much bigger issue in the smartphone realm, since they don't compete in any meaningful way.

Also, a smartphone could probably be classified in many cases as a luxury item, which may or may not reasonably be subject to the same laws as necessities or more general consumer goods. It's in a different class than a PC.

&gt; Google, a la Android, is pushing for more openness in smartphones.

Well, clearly they should sue somebody in the EU then. ;) But more seriously, Android and free/libre phones are something completely new. The PC has been an open platform since IBM introduced it in the '80s, and it's had viable free/libre OSs since at least the development of Linux in the early '90s.

Burkas are a cultural thing that existed way before the spread of Islam. In Islam, it's widely accepted that a simple headscarf is enough, which doesn't even have specific rules about completely covering all of the hair. This is for modesty, not oppression. Men AND women are told to wear modest clothing, rather than tight, revealing clothing.

Anything tied a cultural/religious significance regarding sexism or double standards is still disgusting.  It *is* for oppression to force one sex to dress a certain way, in either scenario.  Whether one nation or all nations under Islam condone sexism is beside the point.  

&gt;Secondly, Islam doesn't promote the killing of all the Jews. It does, however promote self defense. Do you expect Palestinians and other Arabs to stand still while Israel is committing ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians? Hitler's case was much, much different. He believed in the true Aryan race, which was supposed to be Christian, so he believed in freeing all of Europe from all Jews.

I don't condemn self defense, in fact I applaud it.  However, Islam is not a perfectly innocent country that was always the victim.  They are tied to numerous religious wars just as much as Christianity and Judaism.  And Islam does not promote the killing of the Jews?  That's odd, as I clearly remember a Muslim speech in the film, ""Religious,"" stating just the opposite.  If you look closely at [this list](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/int/long.html) quoting from the Quran, I'm sad to say you're dead wrong.  Hit ""ctrl + F"" and type in the word ""Jew.""  Have fun.  And Godwin's Law much?  Genocide for whatever cause is disgusting.  Stalin was much more insane than Hitler ever was, and if you don't believe me, read up on his history *after* WW II was over.

&gt;Finally, the Crusades were two sided. Muslims weren't the only ones involved in it. While I do realize that the violent history of other religions doesn't eliminate the history of Islam, I must say that your original post was only against Islam and seemed very bigoted. Not to mention that you don't have to agree with what goes on in a building to appreciate the building itself. And all that goes on inside mosques is prayer. What's so bad about a building that people go to to pray?

Why should criticism of something qualify as bigotry?  I'm not trying to offend you or mock you, but I'd like it explained to me how my condemning a center of worship for a proven bigoted religion is in itself bigotry?  Again, don't take offense that.  Sure, the mosques are beautiful.  I admitted that.  But I disagree with their purpose and function in the same way people disregard the Nazi internment camps for what occurred there.  In mosques, women are treated as the lesser sex.  Why would I applaud a building that places my value above my wife's?  The building is indeed designated for prayer, but prayer to a god of a religion that has historically been shown to be just as damaging as Christianity and Judaism.

The same is applicable for plantations in the south of the USA.  Sure, the homes were beautiful.  How were they built?  Off the backs of slaves to maintain such lofty lifestyles.  What did they represent?  A time where dominion of one man over another as property was accepted.  Thus, why should we admire a building that places man over woman for worship?

I hope none of this manages to offend you.  Please take into mind what I'm explaining.  Good luck to you and your endeavors.

° Haiducii din doine, balade si idile erau liberi si fericiti
ca pasarile, animalele si pestii care zburda prin codri. De cum venea
primavara, haiducii cei harnici plecau in padure. Acolo ei cintau

° Nichita Stanescu este un poet care se mira de orice. El se
mira si de faptul ca oamenii aud si au urechi. Pai de ce? El n-a avut
urechi? A vazut el vreun om fara urechi? Ma rog, da se zice ca asa
este in poezie, sa te miri de toate si sa le pui pe toate unele subt
altele, in rânduri scurte, ca sa se vada ca sunt versuri.

 La Otopeni erau numai gropi si avioanele le ocoleau si tunarii

 Si tunarul ochi bine si lovi avionul cu teava tunului.

 Dupa ce lupta mult timp, soldatului îi cazura creierii într-o gamela.

 Tudor Soimarul era apt de lupta, cu vizita medicala facuta.

 Dragu-mi era satul meu si pomul unde lega mama porcul!!! - citat din

 Eminescu este un mare clasic, pentru ca se studiaza între peretii claselor.

 În versurile: ""Ce-ti pasa tie chip de lut / Dac-oi fi eu sau altul?""
poetul ne vorbeste despre aspectul fiintei cu care Luceafarul este în
gagicareala si ea îi spune ca nu stie daca va fi al ei sau va fi

 Danila Prepeleac era tovaras de copilarie cu Ion Creanga si cu el
pleca iarna la sanius.

 Eminescu a publicat frumoasa poezie ""Pe lînga plopii Slavitesti"".

 La începutul fiecarei poezii eminesciene sta plantat cîte un tei mai
gros sau mai subtire în functie de cîte strofe are poezia.

 Si eroul, ca sa nu fie gasit, se ascunse într-o pititoare.

 Cînd eroul muri împuscat de nemti pe cîmp, simti miros de marar si de
patrunjel.

 El mergea pe bicicleta cu picioarele goale, bagate în portbagaj.

 Ioana îi zise eroului sa-i bage aparatul în priza.

 Cînd veni fata, baiatul îi mîngîie pisoiul.

 Soldatii îi urmareau pe nemti si, cum îi vedeau ca se urca în
avioane, sareau calare pe tunuri si îi urmareau pe tot aeroportul.

 Patima s-a pus pe capul oamenilor ca curca pe curcan.

 Personajele principale din povestirea ""O ora din august"" sînt:

 Pe aeroportul Otopeni se luptau nemtii cu americanii, iar românii
trageau, cu succes, cînd în unii, cînd în altii.

 Privind atent plugul vede ca e de fier si privind si mai atent
taranul, Arghezi, ca un poet bun ce este, vede ca e de bronz.

 Liviu Rebreanu are placerea de a ne aduce la cunostinta, în operele
sale, iubirea de pamînt a taranului.

 Semnele de punctuatie explica ca limba româna de aceea a aparut, ca
sa aiba virgule si puncte.

 Tu nu stii sa înoti, pentru ca nu ai vrut sa înveti carte.

 Creanga a scris povesti ca: ""Cocosul babei"", ""Gaina lenesa"", ""Punguta
cu bani marunti"", ""Lupul si capra"".

 Vlaicu-Voda era un functionar model care avea un randament deosebit ca domn.

 Sinonimul cuvîntului ""pace"" este ""hai la razboi""!

 În drama ""Apus de soare"" Stefan cel Mare era asa de batrîn, încît
picioarele nu-l mai tineau, dar el mergea înainte cu inima.

 Ceahlaul este situat sus pe munte.

 Mos Danila sta pe vine sa prinda vulturii de pene.

Insurance companies might have the money to pay for chemo treatment, but they don't have the sole ability to provide treatment.   Assuming they do have sufficiently high profits that they can pay for the medical treatments of those who can't afford them, I still don't see why it is more their responsibility to pay for it than anyone else who spends money on luxuries.

A hospital that has has the equipment to help those people is in a slightly different position, but even if they have the equipment, providing the treatment still costs them other resources.  I still don't see why they are more responsible to give up these resources than anyone else who has money they could give up, to pay a fair price for it.  

Remember that if a large company has a large profit, that money doesn't just sit around waiting for someone to play with it, and it doesn't necessarily end up in the pockets of a rich person.  Many of the shareholders will be investment and pension funds. The profit is being used to pay the interest on people's savings accounts and pensions.  People who chose to invest their money in these hospitals or insurance companies (and usually it is chosen for them by their bank or pension fund) don't deserve to give up the return on their investment any more than someone who chose to invest in another industry.

Cuba isn't a third world country.  It is a lot poorer than the United States, so its a valid example, but just bear in mind most countries (by population size) have less money than Cuba.  I don't know much about the Cuban healthcare system, except that they spend about $400 per capita on healthcare (PPP).  European countries mostly spend $1500-$3000 and the US spends $5000.  Do they really have better medical facilities on a budget like that? I'd be extremely  impressed.

If insurance companies or hospitals are colluding on prices, that is a much more serious problem, and I would support government efforts to stop this.  It doesn't mean the profit incentive has to be taken from the system entirely, just that we need more effort breaking up cartels.  This can be a problem in any industry.

I would support government paying for the health care of those too poor to afford it (I would guess this is the system you support as well).  This system doesn't expect insurance companies in particular to pay for the healthcare of those who can't afford it; it spreads the cost of this evenly across the population. This is very different from expecting insurance companies to deal with it.

Essentially, Scheuer is wishing for an act of unimaginable violence, death and destruction to justify his desires for his country to be more violent.

It is a well substantiated fact that IDF and the Israeli Government are occupying lands that are not theirs and enforcing a system of Apartheid and perpetrating many different crimes against the native population. The routine imprisonment of Palestinians, the destruction of property and institutions, preventing Palestinians from reaching their places of education, works, or their residences, land grab, settlement activity, and daily brutality and humiliations are all symptoms of a colonialist and racist regime and are all well substantiated facts.

Now I do acknowledge that Israelis have their own story and justifications (which they really believe in) for what they are doing. They give a plethora of reasons, beginning with ""Security"" and not ending with the ""Demographic Purity of the Jewish State"". I also acknowledge that there are many Israelis who do not agree with their government's actions and stand up in solidarity with the Palestinian People; those are commendable and extremely courageous individuals.

But whatever the different sides of this story, whatever the different justifications Palestinians or Israelis may give to the world; reality is there for you to judge it. The reality is that there is a long lasting system of Occupation and Apartheid which is directly enforced by the Israeli regime and indirectly supported by the International Community (through US Aid and European Donations). No matter how many sides to the story there may be, this simple fact should stand in your eyes and you are obliged to judge upon facts.

Please tell me you are joking.  I wish this was true.  At least then we would get something back.  What we did was give the Iraqi people more control over their country.  If they can ever settle their religous differences they will be one of the strongest countries in that region.  The US is hoping that they will be a strong ally, but I doubt it.  

&gt;Unless you want the US to be as poor as Mexico, invading Iraq was a smart move. 

You have no idea what you are talking about.  Tell me, how is Iraq going to be profitable for America?  Even if we took every drop of their oil do you know how long it would take to pay for the Iraq War?  Well, lets see.  Iraq can produce 2,000,000 barrels a day.  At $70 a barrel that is $140,000,000 a day.  Lets say the Iraq War cost $1 trillion.  By my math, it would take 20 years for the US to generate $1 trillion, and that assumes all that is profit, which of course it wouldn't be.  It would take over 50 years to make back that investment. 

So, no.  Invading Iraq was not a smart move financially for the US.  ",0,bcisme,t1_c0aq8m8,0,,True,True

¨LEFTIST COUP BY HONDURAN PRESIDENT THWARTED!

-PRESIDENT NOW EX-PRESIDENT SENDS LETTER OF RESIGNATION TO HONDURAN CONGRESS-

( Ray Auxillou , Belize Falconview News, June, 2009 )

It is strange to hear that the unilateral Coup d’etat in Honduras being created by ex-President Zelaya was thwarted by the judicial branch and the military, which acts as the Federal Police Force in that country.  According to the stories on the news and interviews.   President Zalaya was attempting a constitutional coup in Honduras , by circumventing the Congress, Executive and Legislative branches in regards to an on going program, allegedly devised and formented by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela .

A judge of the judicial branch was being interviewed on Honduras television and confirmed that President Zelaya was arrested and deported by the military, according to an arrest order issued by the Supreme Court,  judicial branch.  President Zelaya was deported by military aircraft to Costa Rica , which has accepted his entry into exile.

Zelaya was attempting a similar take over coup of the Honduras government, similar to what Chavez has done in Venezuela .  The current step that roused the fury of the legislative and judicial branch in Honduras was that he unilaterally was holding a referendum to change the constitution of Honduras without approval of Congress.  The referendum was thwarted by the military, on orders of the judiciary.  The straw that broke the camels back, so to speak was that President Zalaya appointed a Coordinator Popular, or a popular coordinator in the middle of Friday night, after midnight, to circumvent the prerogatives of elected government, as in a democracy.  This is in line with the current leftist Presidents in the Americas, forming totalitarian states, using the elected party political process to get into office and then subverting the government by steady political incremental changes in a slow coup  d’etat to become lifetime TYRANTS.

There was no military coup d’etat said the Judge or female spokesperson this Sunday morning in a television interview, but only the rest of the pillars of government protecting Congress and the Constitution.  President Zelaya wanted to change the Constitution so that he could run for more than one term of office.  The Supreme  Court acted to arrest Zelaya, since he committed the crimes of violating the Honduras Constitution in his ambition to become TYRANT( President for life ) of Honduras .

Zelaya led Honduras into strong ties with the leftist IRON CURTAIN of newly minted seven, PRESIDENTS FOR LIFE descending over Latin American , TYRANTS club, for totalitarian states in the Americas .  The  so called ALBA BLOCK of countries.  Zelaya was attempting to consolidate rapidly his hold on the organs of government and the Judge of the judicial branch, or Vice President of Congress, Maria Villedi said; there were contingents of Nicaraguan, Venezuelan and Cuban agent provocateurs inside Honduras , trying to destabilize the democratic functioning of the government of Honduras .

The female Vice President of the Honduras Congress said:  that the world should know, that in Honduras there was no Military Coup d’etat and even as we speak, the Honduras Congress has been recalled into session on this Sunday. Democracy is well in hand.  She also said that the President of the Senate also becomes now the President of Honduras, by constitutional law.  Zelaya had submitted a letter of resignation to the Congress signed in front of the media as witnesses.   Congress and Zelaya had been at odds for a month in dialogues refusing him permission to take the unilateral actions he wanted to take, which his Honduras Congress told him were in violation of the Honduras Constitution.  He refused to obey Congress  and committed illegal acts.  When the media interviewed his wife, Mrs. Zelaya  admitted her husband wanted to be PRESIDENT FOR LIFE, or a TYRANT on the model of Fidel Castro, or Hugo Chavez.

This was a legal arrest and deportation and the military acted on the arrest order of the judicial branch ( Supreme Court ) of the Honduran government.  Ex-President Zalaya was guilty of circumventing the lawful rights of the elected representatives in Congress, in his own ongoing coup attempt.  In the REPUBLICAN system of governing, a sitting President has a lot of power, but in this case, the military and the legislative branch refused to obey his constitutionally  illegal actions.  They would not agree as a Congress in what he wanted to do, to change the Constitution of Honduras permitting him to be President for Life.

In Belize here, we do not have the Constitutional  law that one political Prime Minister of one party, cannot be re-elected to continuous terms.  This can prove disastrous as many African countries have shown, that once belonged to the British Commonwealth .  Perhaps we should have it, that a political party cannot go more than one term in office in Belize , and that term reduced to three years and campaigning for office not be allowed for more than three months, instead of the full year currently in practice in Belize ?  There is too much wastage in our own Belize political system.¨ –End of Post–Thank you Ray!

And this is a copy of an email from a woman living in Rotan, Honduras:

¨Just wanted you to know that things are quite and peaceful here, regardless of what you see on the TV. The government asked people to stay at home today, and so did the Peace Corps, so I – along with most of Honduras -, have stayed at home. We expect the banks to be open tomorrow, and business as usual.
Around noon the electricity came back on and just now, my internet came back. I’ve been watching CNN en Espanol and working on a quilt square.
The airport is expected to remain open, there have really been no demonstrations in this part of the country. I’m told the ones you saw on TV were paid demonstrators. Mel Zelaya has not been a popular president; the country does not like his leftist leanings, the congress asked him to step down yesterday and he refused, so….
People around here are delighted that he has been deposed and Micheletti has been voted in – and the congressional vote was UNANIMOUS. Both parties voted to dump him.
So that’s all the news here. We’re just waiting for international recognition.¨ -End of email-

My Comments: Now these people are both closer to what is going on and are not the biased press that exists in the USA, Europe, Canada and Venzuela.   So now we know what is really going on!

The absolute fact is that the US has more gun deaths per capita than any European nation. The weapons used in a recent school killing (I forget which, you guys have so many of them) were legally owned but they were still used to kill innocent people. The Virginia Tech killer's weapon was bought from a regular gun shop. Do you honestly think he'd have gone out of his way to get hold of a gun if he'd had to go through 'other' channels? No, of course not. That's exactly why we don't have those massacres here. And in Germany the recent school shooting there was with a legally held weapon (held by the shooter's father). Would he have done what he did if the gun hadn't been 'right there'?

I love that you think because you were brought up in a house with guns and have no urge to shoot people that that somehow proves your point. How wonderfully naive.

You can't answer it, you can only make lame comparisons to Apple, a comparison that isn't even valid.

""It should be noted here that Seventh Day Adventists are often studied in population analyses to prove that a vegetarian diet is healthier and is associated with a lower risk for cancer (but see a later paragraph in this section). While it is true that most members of this Christian denomination do not eat meat, they also do not smoke or drink alcohol, coffee or tea, all of which are likely factors in promoting cancer (44).

The Mormons are a religious group often overlooked in vegetarian studies. Although their Church urges moderation, Mormons do not abstain from meat. As with the Adventists, Mormons also avoid tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine. Despite being meat eaters, a study of Utah Mormons showed they had a 22% lower rate for cancer in general and a 34% lower mortality for colon cancer than the US average (45). A study of Puerto Ricans, who eat large amounts of fatty pork, nevertheless revealed very low rates of colon and breast cancer (46). Similar results can be adduced to demonstrate that meat and animal fat consumption do not correlate with cancer (47). Obviously, other factors are at work.

It is usually claimed that vegetarians have lower cancer rates than meat-eaters, but a 1994 study of vegetarian California Seventh Day Adventists showed that, while they did have lower rates for some cancers (e.g., breast and lung), they had higher rates for several others (Hodgkin's disease, malignant melanoma, brain, skin, uterine, prostate, endometrial, cervical and ovarian), some quite significantly. In that study the authors actually admitted that:

    Meat consumption, however, was not associated with a higher [cancer] risk.

And that,

    No significant association between breast cancer and a high consumption of animal fats or animal products in general was noted. (48)

Further, it is usually claimed that a diet rich in plant foods like whole grains and legumes will reduce one's risks for cancer, but research going back to the last century demonstrates that carbohydrate-based diets are the prime dietary instigators of cancer, not diets based on minimally processed animal foods (49).

The mainstream health and vegetarian media have done such an effective job of ""beef bashing,"" that most people think there is nothing healthful about meat, especially red meat. In reality, however, animal flesh foods like beef and lamb are excellent sources of a variety of nutrients as any food/nutrient table will show. Nutrients like vitamins A, D, several of the B-complex, essential fatty acids (in small amounts), magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, potassium, iron, taurine, and selenium are abundant in beef, lamb, pork, fish and shellfish, and poultry. Nutritional factors like coenzyme Q10, carnitine, and alpha-lipoic acid are also present. Some of these nutrients are only found in animal foods--plants do not supply them.""

I really like your spirit.  My first trip, I went to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.  Aside from the plane ticket (roundtrip about 1000$), everything was extremely cheap.  You can find decent hostels that cost about 5 dollars a night.  Meals shouldn't cost more than a few bucks.  Cost of living is extremely cheap in these countries.  The same goes for most of central and south America.  I backpacked from Guatemala down to Argentina and in some of the countries I spent less than a couple hundred dollars in a few weeks.  It is hard to give specifics on this type of thing because people travel very differently.  If you want to do more activities and touristy type of stuff you will inevitable spend more money.  If you make your own adventures and just roam around doing cheap things you can have a great day and only have spent 10 dollars.  It really depends.  Sometimes you will be forced to spend money like on a bus ticket or something.  

My advice would be for you to pick where you want to go first.  And if you are on a budget I would definitely recommend Southeast Asia or Central America.  Both places are backpacker hubs.  You could hypothetically touch down in Bangkok with no plan in mind, go to the Khao San Road, party a few nights, make some friends, and tag along wherever they are going and have an amazing time.  You will need some sort of idea though.  My favorite website for Southeast Asia was [TravelFish](http://www.travelfish.org/).  Otherwise, Lonely Planet books have been pretty helpful to me.  They are more geared towards younger people on budgets.  They will lead you to large groups of people that are just like you, which is a good and a bad thing.  Because you traveled all this way to find something new and a lot of the time you end up in a hostel with a bunch of American and European people sitting on computers.  It is up to you to make your own adventures.

If you are developing an operating system, programming language, or data base manager to exploit a processor with 80 cores, as promised soon by Intel, then you are trying to plow new ground and at times some advanced work in computer science and mathematics might be crucial.

But let's assume, instead, that mostly you are trying to program applications for immediate use by end users.  That is, you are trying to be an 'applications programmer'.

There are some results in computer science useful in applications programming.  Heavily an applications programmer ends up using such results mostly by using code developed by others, e.g., an operating system, compiler, or data base manager, but some of the computer science results can at times be useful more directly.

The main goal of high end academic 'computer science' is 'research' on the 'principles' of computing, maybe hopefully for some good benefit in the future, maybe even the far future, and helping people who want to learn to be good applications programmers now is not the main goal.  In two crude analogies, the research is (1) trying to find a cure for cancer, not train family doctors, (2) trying to find a battery that weighs less than 50 pounds, costs less than $200, is efficient, safe, reliable, and long lasting, can store the energy in 40 gallons of gasoline, and can deliver 500 HP until its energy is exhausted, not train auto mechanics.

That computer science research can find important principles of computing is a guess and a hope but so far not much of an accomplishment.  Instead, what is useful in computer science remains fairly simple.

So, for being an applications programmer, don't feel inadequate because you didn't spend $100,000 on tuition and several years of your life listening to computer scientists teach courses in programming.

So far the connection between mathematics and either computer science or applications programming is not very strong.  For what might be important for applications programming, math through, say, first high school algebra, should be enough.

You have learned several programming languages:  Good.  That's a significant fraction of what is needed to be a good applications programmer and shows that you likely have plenty of ability for the rest.

You have learned to use If-Then-Else and For-Next:  Fine.  Those are the main 'control constructs' of 'structured programming' (as in E. Dijkstra) 'in the small'.

Below I outline most of the rest of what you are supposed to know.  Fill in the outline on your own and save the years in classes and $100,000.  Likely good details on all of these topics are readily available for free on the Internet:

1.0 Data Representation

It is most convenient for the electrical engineers to build digital electronics where a circuit is either ON or OFF.  So, regard one of ON or OFF as a 0 and the other one as a 1. Regard 0 and 1 as 'bits'.  Then can use digital electronics to represent, store, communicate, and manipulate bits.  That's the main idea of electronic digital computing.

A 'byte' is 8 bits.  How many different bytes are there?  Well if we number the bits from 1 to 8, then we see that for bit 1 there are two patterns, 0 and 1. Then with the first two bits there are 4 patterns, 00, 01, 10, 11.  In general for an integer n &gt;= 1, with n bits there are 2^n patterns so that with n = 8 there are 256 patterns.

So, with 256 patterns, we have enough patterns to represent all the upper and lower case letters of the Roman alphabet along with the more common accented letters common in Europe along with digits 0-9 and a lot of punctuation and special symbols.  Mostly that is what bits and bytes are used for.

But we can also use bits and bytes for numbers, sounds, pictures, computer programs, and more.

2.0 Computer Hardware

You should understand the basics of computer hardware.  So there is a processor that executes instructions.  There is main memory with data at memory locations.  Each such location has its own address.  Mostly the instructions use the addresses to read and write data in the locations.  There are means for input and output, either to/from the processor or to/from main memory.

There are privileged instructions and user instructions.

There is cache memory, and there may be more than one processor (or processor core).

Now nearly always there are address spaces in virtual memory.  You should understand the broad idea of locality of reference.  There may also be virtual machines.

Read a few pages that cover these terms and you will be fine.

3.0 Programming Languages

Here is an overview of the traditional work in programming languages:

We say that a 'string' is a sequence of printable characters.  So if a string has, say, 10 characters, then there is a character for each 1, 2, ..., 10.  These characters need not be distinct.

A 'programming language' is a set of strings regarded as 'legal' in the language.

To specify what the legal strings are, the usual approach is just some set notation written in a slightly different way called Backus-Naur form (BNF).  That is, we use BNF notation to specify the set of all strings that are legal in the language.

To 'parse' a language, we take a string and a definition of the language in BNF and see if the string is in the language or, if not, where is the first character of the string that shows that the string is not in the language.

Given the BNF, we can use a 'parser generator' to write the code, automatically, to parse the language.  The details of how to do this in an organized way were considered a good step forward in computer science.

For more details, see a book on compiler construction and, maybe, look at DeRemer's work on LALR parsing.

As you read you will see the roles of lexical scan, syntax, semantics, and symbol tables.  Then to run the program, you can use an interpreter or just do compilation to machine language, that is, on Windows, an EXE or DLL file.  For compilation you can learn about intermediate code, code optimization, code generation, and link editing.  The result, then, say, on Windows, is an EXE or DLL file.  There is nothing fundamentally difficult here.

If you take enough courses in computer science, you may learn how to write a compiler, but it is unlikely that an applications programmer (or now anyone) can get paid for writing a compiler.

Bohr and Heisenberg answered such questions with an austere vision of the theory now called the Copenhagen interpretation. With no observer present, they said, any given particle exists here, there, and everywhere in between, dispersed like a wave. Introduce an observer to measure the wave, however, and the quantum wave ""collapses"" into a single particle. Before the measurement, the particle could be described only by an equation that specified the probability of finding it in one location rather than another. The act of measurement itself forces a particle to assume a single, definite position. The sharp boundary between an objective world ""out there"" and subjective observations blurs in this version of quantum theory. 


""Bohr believed that it was meaningless to try to describe the quantum world because we have no direct experience of it,"" says Valentini. ""Bohr and Heisenberg thought that quantum mechanics showed we had reached the limits of human understanding. ... Physics no longer told us how things are—it only told us how human beings perceive and measure things."" 


Some conference participants, most notably Einstein, de Broglie, and Schrödinger, rejected Bohr's arguments. Physicists today remember Einstein as Bohr's chief antagonist. But their famed disputes over the validity of quantum theory must have taken place off the record, Valentini says; the published conference proceedings don't mention them at all. 


The proceedings do, however, contain 24 pages of discussion of a rival interpretation by de Broglie. Unlike Bohr, who viewed the quantum wave equation describing a particle as a mathematical abstraction, de Broglie thought such waves were real—he called them pilot waves. In de Broglie's picture, particles never exist in more than one place at the same time. All the mysterious properties of quantum theory are explained by pilot waves guiding particles along their trajectories. In the two-slit experiment, for example, each particle passes through only one slit. The pilot wave, however, goes through both slits at once and influences where the particle strikes the screen. There is no inexplicable wave collapse triggered by observation. Instead, Valentini says, ""the total pilot wave, for the particle and the detectors considered as a single system, evolves so as to yield an apparent collapse."" 


Bohr, Heisenberg, and their supporters at the Solvay conference were unimpressed. The details of the particle trajectories were unobservable, and Bohr insisted that physicists shouldn't traffic in hidden, unmeasurable entities. ""De Broglie wasn't happy with the Copenhagen interpretation,"" says Valentini, ""but he gave up trying to argue about it."" 


Bohr and Heisenberg's vision of quantum theory prevailed; de Broglie's languished. David Bohm, a prominent American physicist, rediscovered de Broglie's work in the early 1950s and expanded on it. But Bohm's work, like de Broglie's, failed to attract much support, because it could not be distinguished experimentally from conventional quantum mechanics. 


The past decade has seen renewed interest in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics, and physicists have devised several competing interpretations of the theory (Science, 25 June 2004, p. 1896). Valentini has been in the thick of this quantum renaissance. In the early 1990s, as a graduate student studying with the late Dennis Sciama, a cosmologist who also mentored Stephen Hawking, he learned about the work of de Broglie and Bohm and became convinced that it had the potential to resolve all the mysterious paradoxes of quantum mechanics. He has spent most of his career almost single-handedly building on their work. 


His single-mindedness has cost him. Although Valentini's colleagues acknowledge the originality and importance of his research, spadework on the foundations of quantum theory has not been a fast track to tenure. For years, he has survived from grant to grant in a succession of temporary positions; his current one at ICL ends this year. 


""I used to do private teaching just to get by,"" Valentini says. ""Things have changed in recent years, but I'm still just living year by year. It is a field where there are these wide-open, in-your-face problems with interpretation that are staggeringly fundamental, with virtually nobody in the world really dedicating the bulk of their time and attention to working on them. So how do you expect there to be much progress?"" 


** Beyond the quantum? **


In Valentini's physics, the ""laws"" of quantum mechanics are not really laws at all but accidents of cosmic history. Particles in the universe today conform to the supposed rules of quantum mechanics, Valentini suggests, because they settled into a sort of quantum equilibrium immediately after the big bang, in a process roughly analogous to the way a mixture of hot and cold gases gradually reaches a uniform temperature. Immediately after the big bang, particles could have existed in states not allowed by the normal rules of quantum mechanics but permitted in pilot-wave theory. 


""Quantum physics is not fundamental; it's a theory of a particular equilibrium state and nothing more,"" says Valentini. ""To my mind, pilot-wave theory is crying out to us that quantum physics is a special case of a much wider physics, with many new possible phenomena that are just there waiting to be explored and tested experimentally.""


The place to look, Valentini says, is in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the remnant radiation from the big bang that fills all of space. The radiation is almost perfectly uniform, with only slight variations in temperature. Theorists think those small temperature differences resulted from quantum fluctuations that were magnified as the universe expanded. In a paper Valentini has submitted to Physical Review D, he argues that if his pilot-wave theory is correct, some of those temperature variations will not have the distribution that standard quantum theory predicts. Deviations are more likely to survive at long wavelengths, he says. CMB measurements by the WMAP probe have revealed ""intriguing"" anomalies in precisely that domain, Valentini says, but pursuing them will take time and effort. ""I need to do a lot more work to refine my predictions,"" says Valentini. ""Part of the problem is that I'm the only person working on it. It is a difficult thing."" 


Confirmation of Valentini's idea would be one of the biggest advances in physics in decades. The Planck spacecraft, launched in May by the European Space Agency (Science, 1 May, p. 584), will take a closer look at CMB and could conceivably find evidence supporting Valentini's predictions. 


""One of the most attractive features of Antony's proposals is that they're testable,"" says David Wallace, a philosopher of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. ""If tomorrow there is some experiment that Antony's theory gets right and quantum mechanics gets wrong, then end of story."" 


Valentini knows he faces steep odds. ""Maybe in 200 years people will look back and say the time wasn't right to reexamine the foundations of quantum mechanics,"" he says. ""Or it might be that they'll say, ‘My God, it opened up a whole new world.’ We can't tell. One thing is certain: We won't find out if we don't try."" ",0,blackf1sh,t1_c0aql63,0,,True,False

France is like that. France does whatever France wants. The USSR too. The USSR was against the invasion as well because they had multiple business deals going on with Saddam. 

There are a few major world powers. Countries within these blocks are closely related (usually by business) and act together in the sense that a frat house is a single unit acting together. 

Here they are:

US Block: Japan, Taiwan, most of SE Asia, South Korea, Australia, Most of the pacific, UK, India, Pakistan, most former UK colonies, Germany, Spain, most of Western Europe, Almost all the middle east oil-producing nations, Israel, Canada, Mexico, most of Latin America (okay, all of Latin America, Chavez is still with us in spirit), I'd even throw Cuba in there

France Block: France

Russia Block: Most of the former USSR (this is the least unified block)

China Block: China, Tibet, Mongolia, North Korea (NK is problematic, but still closer to China than anywhere else) 

There you go. When you read the news, those are really the players. US, France, China, Russia. All international affairs are originating in those countries somewhere, somehow. The US has been trying for years, since the Clinton presidency, to suck China in. Russia and France are independent entities through force of will. Well, Russia mostly because it's a super corrupt, run by the KGB, and is such a shitty country no one wants to do business there. but whatever. 

Long answer short. When I type ""Western multinationals"" I'm referring to the US block. 

&gt;2) I'm not sure you can even prove this. What company complained to our government that Saddam was an evil dictator? Is that company making money in Iraq now?

I probably can't. But it was all over US media. Did they just make that shit up? The only people who knew how Saddam was governing were businessmen and diplomats. I doubt the diplomats were comparing him to Hitler. Seriously, what he did was nothing. We did about just as bad after we took over the country. 

&gt;3) Saddam wasn't an evil dictator? The national government didn't decide this. His oppression and use of chemical weapons did.

""Oppression""? Chemical weapons? Please! This discussion is too huge for this space really so we can agree to disagree. Saddam was no more evil than any number of leaders *currently in charge* around the globe. Not only that, he did a good enough job that the US didn't really complain until he invaded Kuwait. (An invasion, BTW, approved by the first Bush administration. Saddam was our puppet. He wouldn't have done *anything* to piss us off at that point.)

&gt;4) So the Iraqi government is a puppet government...interesting theory. I'd like to see you prove this.

How about Saddam was installed by the CIA and received weapons and support for years from US entities. Dick Cheney himself sold the guy weapons and here's Donald Rumsfeld shaking the guy's hand in 1983:

http://catherinemacivor.com/2009/05/18/rumsfeld-paid-tax-dollars-for-war-propaganda/

Are you referring to the current administration in Iraq? Hell, they can do whatever they want, as long as they don't develop a military and don't mind our permanent bases and thousands of troops in their country until the end of time. 

&gt;&gt;There were multiple financial incentives for the US to invade Iraq - not just oil.

&gt;Really? What exactly are those? The US had almost zero financial incentive to invade Iraq. We spent over a trillion dollars on that shit war and there is no way we are going to make a return on that investment. You think the Iraqi's are going to give us a trillion dollars in oil? If you think that, you're an idiot. They own all their resources. They won't give us shit, and if they do, it will be for market price. The Iraq War is the single worst investment ever made by the US.

The problem is the US dollar maintaining reserve currency status. This is all tied to whatever oil is sold in. Saddam announced he was selling in Euros. One year later, he's living in a hole in the desert. Coincidence? If the dollar loses reserve currency status, it will be next to worthless. We are currently using our military to enforce countries to sell in dollars. Chavez and Russia might be problems, but with Iraq, we might have the cheapest supply of oil in the world. Everyone won't mind dollars as soon as production ramps up over there. 

&gt;&gt;What you're seeing in Iraq is no different than anything European powers did during the colonial era.

&gt;Please tell me you are joking. I wish this was true. At least then we would get something back. What we did was give the Iraqi people more control over their country. If they can ever settle their religous differences they will be one of the strongest countries in that region. The US is hoping that they will be a strong ally, but I doubt it.

I hope you're right. Unfortunately, I'm a little cynical. The Iraqi people might do okay now. Good for them. As far as I could tell, however, they were doing just as well under Saddam. I hope history proves me wrong. 

&gt;&gt;Unless you want the US to be as poor as Mexico, invading Iraq was a smart move.

&gt;You have no idea what you are talking about. Tell me, how is Iraq going to be profitable for America? Even if we took every drop of their oil do you know how long it would take to pay for the Iraq War? Well, lets see. Iraq can produce 2,000,000 barrels a day. At $70 a barrel that is $140,000,000 a day. Lets say the Iraq War cost $1 trillion. By my math, it would take 20 years for the US to generate $1 trillion, and that assumes all that is profit, which of course it wouldn't be. It would take over 50 years to make back that investment.
So, no. Invading Iraq was not a smart move financially for the US.

Keeping the price of the dollar up is what's really valuable about Iraq.

It doesn't matter what they bought, they're fucked.

So the question becomes: ""What do I buy so that I will keep as much of my money if the economy merely goes into a recession?"" One of the major problems with a recession is that the US dollar (and most other currencies) become worth less due to inflation.

Therefore, buying any asset whose value is based on the value of currency (i.e., stocks, bonds or other investments that depend on the health of the dollar) is a bad idea.

Gold's value isn't based on any currency. There's no dollar-peg for the price of an ounce of gold (that's what makes gold different than oil). So gold retains its value no matter how any world currency might fluctuate.

Also, the odds of the entire world economy crashing all at once? Infinitesimal. The US economy may crash and burn for ten years, but Europe and Asia's economies are not tied nearly closely enough to ours that they will just turn over and die because ours does. We can make small dents in their economies by screwing up ours, but we don't ""control"" their economies in any real sense of the word. And gold can be sold anywhere. So if you don't like the economic climate in the USA, just sell your gold for Euros or Yen or whatever. (This ability to quickly convert your investment into currency is known as ""liquidity."")

You'd still rather have some kind of appreciating asset - something that becomes more valuable over time. But in times of trouble, many people want to buy gold, so the value of an oz of gold goes up due to the fact that everyone wants it. So gold can be an appreciating asset as long as the market is bad/getting worse. That said, the rate that gold increases in value is not usually very high, even in pretty bad times. And inevitably the economy recovers, and then the value of gold starts going down. At that point you're usually better off buying stocks. Which - if you're both lucky and good enough to pick the right ones at the right times - will go up much faster.

Even if you don't meet all the qualifications, apply anyway.  It can't hurt.  Employers post what they want, not what they're willing to settle for.  Especially if you're willing to work for less than someone with a BS.  If you see an ad on craigslist and you don't meet all the requirements, call the company and speak to the person doing the hiring.  If they're hesitant, tell them you'll work as a paid intern.

They certainly don't own the earth and the water and the air in our world. The very idea of it is absurd once you start thinking.""

Ownership of property is a social structure. It's something that many societies have not had, especially the notion of ownership of land. However, when farming came about, we discovered that it was valuable for someone to have a sense of investment in the land; valuable for someone to work hard in the spring, tilling and planting and watering, in order to be able to reap the harvest in the fall. Of course, without a notion of ownership of land, anyone could just come in and eat the fruits of his labor; thus there wasn't much incentive to do all that hard work to plant. 

So we developed the notion of ownership of land; allow someone to benefit from the result of their hard work, and they have an incentive to do the work in the first place. This meant that we limited people's freedom (no longer could you simply go into any field you please and pick all the wheat you want, nor could you hunt cows the great herd of complacent cows and have a tasty steak dinner), for something that was seen as being a general good, because it promoted useful labor. This notion of property is so thoroughly ingrained in us that we sometimes see it as a natural law, but it's not really all that fundamental. There are small fences that you could step over, or even just a few piled up rocks, but they have a very strong meaning that the stuff on the other side is owned by somebody, and you shouldn't just cross that fence and take all of the food that you want (and when people do, we call that stealing, and if we catch them we throw them in jail to punish them and keep them from doing more of it).

Of course, ownership of land can be taken to absurd extremes as well. Look at medieval Europe. An entire class of landowners rose up to rule, with a tiny fraction of the population owning all of the land. You had the noble landowners, and the common serfs, who were essentially slaves; the owners used their ownership as a method of asserting near total power over those under them for hundreds of years.

Back in the middle ages, when this was happening, books were extremely expensive to produce. It took a scribe (who is a skilled professional) weeks to copy a single book; in todays dollars, one book would probably a couple thousand dollars. There were very few books produced, and basically all of the money went to the scribes. When Gutenberg invented his printing press with movable type, all of a sudden mass production of new books became possible. While the printing press itself was expensive, and you still had to do a lot of manual labor to set the type on the first copy of the book, you could easily sell books for a much lower price if you produced them in a large volume. Suddenly, the work of an author became much more valuable relative to the cost of copying.

As mentioned, the printing press itself was expensive, as was setting the type on the first copy. So if you were selling books at low prices, you needed to sell a high volume before you could make much of a profit. If you paid an author for his work, and paid a typesetter to set the type, and paid for a printing press, and then your book became popular, someone else who owned a printing press would be able to print the same work, and sell it, and either undercut your price or make a better profit margin, because they hadn't bothered to pay the author. Furthermore, this would cut into the profits that you would be able to make, reducing the value of the investment you made on the initial printing. So, by analogy with the farms from earlier, we decided to create another, similar notion of ownership, called copyright, that said that for a limited time, the creator of a work would have the exclusive right to publish that work, in order to protect the investments made by the original authors and publishers. In order to provide incentives for people to do useful work, we took away a little bit of freedom of other people to exploit that work without paying.

Of course, we've started to reach a medieval-level imbalance in copyright these days. That ""limited time"", which was essential to return that freedom to the public after the initial publisher had a chance to profit from their investment, has been stretched to absurdity, and with no end of extensions in sight, may cease being a limited time. We are starting to institute technological protections, which rather than being small stone fences, are towering walls, that loom over and block out the sun on the fields of those outside them. For software, we have not even one or two, but myriad forms of protection (copyright, patent, trademarks, binary compilation, trade secrets, copy protection, TPM, software as a service, and so on).

So copyright has been taken to absurd extremes, and many people are rightfully pissed about that. But copyright is not completely non-sensical; it's a trade of a small amount of freedom (the freedom to benefit from the fruits of someone else's labor without compensating them), in order to be able to allow people to invest time and effort into creating new works with an expectation of being able to profit from that creation if their works become popular.

Now, if you disagree with proprietary software, and the abuses of the copyright system, the right approach is not to simply use that software without compensation. There is an alternative model that has been proposed; of sharing the software, and letting the software grow and improve because it is in everyone's interest to do so. That model is called free software by some, open source by others. The point is that many people can benefit by allowing everyone to share in the result of their labor, and as the cost of copying the software is negligible, the cost of production is the only one worth worrying about. By using free software, and becoming engaged in the community, whether by filing bug reports, writing documentation, writing code, testing beta versions, or even just running the software and encouraging others to do so, you can help fight against this over-extension of copyright, and copyright protection, without cheating someone out of their hard work by using it without paying them.",0,annodomini,t1_c0aqpb2,0,,True,False

The 250 mill. urban Chinese live and work in very different conditions and have very different attitudes and aspirations from the rural Chinese. I guess the first world has an overwhelmingly large urban population and therefore more homogeneous.

The Indian urban society is pretty large in percentage terms numerically (about a third) as well as economically, much larger than many first-world countries. It's a mistake, therefore, to treat India as a homogeneous lump - there is a large, distinct, economically active subgroup which is much less caste sensitive.

Again, this is nothing unexpected; similar economic movements led by the Industrial revolution were responsible for dissolving a lot of birth-based stratification of European societies.

I've seen this with some of my American friends, who've got this idea that caste is the bogeyman which keeps India back. While it is a factor, it's not the biggest one - not even close. There's lots of other things - endemic corruption, regulatory hurdles to entrepreneurship, sharp religious/communal divides. To a Muslim, all Hindus are the same, and vice versa.

Egypt government is definitely screwed up and appears to have taken the side of Abbas against Hamas which is definitely complicating the situation.

Egypt, Abbas, Israel, EU and the US are all working together against the true interests of the Palestinian people. That's why the Palestinians have turned to Hamas. It's not that they love their politics that much, but what alternative do they have? And in reply the West declares Hamas a terrorist organization. The West is trying to force the Palestinians into the arms of Abbas. 

So no, it's not as simple as some people would like to paint it. But the really simple part is that Israel is the number one culprit making the Palestinians suffer. Egypt isn't the one dropping bombs on Gaza - Israel is.

As the Free Gaza movement has so vividly demonstrated, Israel controls all movement in and out of Gaza. Even the seas are blocked. Gaza used to have an airport, but Israel bombed it. In other words Israel has a choke hold on Gaza. Of course they couldn't get away with this without some cooperation from the international community, but again it's Israel that is the one dropping the bombs on Gaza.

Hell no. Even if they were aware of their actions they might feel it entirely justified. That's exactly the way in which it is *systematic*.

I know the plural of anecdote is not data, but an uncle of mine runs a furniture factory; he's not overtly racist, but after a string of bad black employees he now judges them systematically. He's much more likely to hire someone who is white or asian than he is to hire someone who is black.

I've quizzed him extensively on the subject, and he doesn't feel that he's being particularly unfair or racist - he's just hired three black dudes in a row who all turned out to be lazy or drunks. 

This works in a myriad of cultural ways. I grew up in a very ethnically homogeneous area in rural Europe and I have all sorts of irrational hang ups that I occasionally have to consciously address - and I'm probably unusually introspective.

So you're correct in that being poor is the greatest disadvantage, but also consider that if you're black you're also statistically much more likely to be poor.

Fuck, there is a whole generation of people alive today that were racially segregated. The civil rights movement was a very recent phenomena. A lot of those hang ups are very much alive today.

If I have any vendetta about Airbus it is not because it is European.  I don't like their reliance on fly by wire very much, but I don't trust that Boeing could do it any better.

AFAIK, this obsession predates the arrival of Europeans to India, as it is even mentioned in some ancient (more than 2000 year old) religious texts. I'm not an expert, but from what I can remember, these are stories about Shiva and those comparing skin color between the darker Krishna and his fair/light-skinned (girl) friend Radha and others.

Inside specific Indian communities, skin color was never a sign of ""race"". Even in my immediate family (Marathi, from central/western India), the variation in skin color ranges from pale-white to nearly black..(not like Wesley Snipes, but more like Denzel Washington).

IMO, in the past (around the world), white/lighter skin has been a sign that the person is not a manual laborer who works out in the sun.. Hence, white/light skin is a symbol of a ""higher class"" (economic/social). While this classification is no longer valid in most developed countries, in countries like India, which are only recently seeing industrialization, this distinction is still followed by people. 

Personally, in the little time I have been in India, I have worked this to my advantage..:)

Crib or cot death is the leading cause of death during the first year of life. In their study on mice, a team of scientists in Europe has found that an imbalance of brain-signaling chemical known as serotonin, which regulates mood, can kill infant animals; in fact, they have identified a possible genetic cause of this imbalance. if the genetic link is confirmed, the research could lead to ways of identifying babies at risk, the times reported.

However, according to them, the abnormalities could also be a result of environmental factors particularly parental smoking.”Ultimately, we hope it will give new idea to diagnose babies at risk for SIDS,”enrica audero, who led research in Italy, said.

And here are some quotes about the Jesuits.

&gt; ""My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order’s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.""

John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)

&gt; ""It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.""

Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)

&gt; ""The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.""

Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""

Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)

J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)

&gt; “[Jesuit Adam] Weishaupt established the [modern version of the] Illuminati specifically to be a front organization behind which the Jesuits could hide. After being [formally] abolished by [Pope] Clement XIV in 1773, the Jesuits used the Illuminati and other organizations to carry out their operations. Thus, the front organizations would be blamed for the trouble caused by the Jesuits.”

Bill Hughes (Author of The Secret Terrorists and The Enemy Unmasked)

&gt; “If you trace up Masonry, through all its Orders, till you come to the grand tip-top head Mason of the World, you will discover that the dread individual and the Chief of the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Superior General of the Jesuit Order] are one and the same person.”

James Parton (American historian)

&gt; “I have learnt most of all from the Jesuit Order. …So far, there has been nothing more imposing on earth than the hierarchical organization of the [Roman] Catholic Church. A good part of that organization I have transported direct to my own [Nazi] party. …The Catholic Church must be held up as an example. …I will tell you a secret. I am founding an order [Ed. Note: the Nazi SS].
…In [Heinrich] Himmler [who would become head of the Nazi SS] I see our Ignatius de Loyola [Ed. Note: the founder of the Jesuit Order].”

Adolph Hitler (1889-1945; Nazi leader and chancellor of Germany from 1933-1945)

&gt; ""When are people going to learn their still being manipulated when they think they know truth? We continually see the Papal Knight of Malta family, The Rothschilds branded as the ultimate group. These are mere puppets just on a higher level than the likes of George H.W Bush and Henry Kissinger, incidentally both of these are Knights of Malta Papal Knights. The Rothschilds tried for years to be allowed to interbreed with the powerful British Cecil Family. The Cecil's looked down their nose at the unworthy Rothschild's until they finally proved themselves. The Cecil family were controlled by the powerful Jesuit family known as the Pallavicini. Maria Camilla Pallavicini is far more powerful than Queen Elizabeth II. We see the same so-called truth sayers making out QEII is more powerful than she really is. The Queen and Prince Philip are totally subordinate to the Papal Bloodline the Breakspear Family and their Jesuit UKHQ at 114 Mount Street. Please go and study who funded Elizabeth I that astronomical amount of money to fight the Spanish, yes Pallavicini.

These powerful bloodlines are the Breakspear, Somaglia, Orsini, Farnese &amp; Aldobrandini. You'll notice David Rothschild marrying into the Aldobrandini with the pretty, Princess Olimpia Aldobrandini. The Rothschilds are mere pions compared to these Roman hierachy. Another real head of this is Henry Breakspear who resides now in Macau in China. Many of the Papal Bloodline heads now live in Asia and India. What does that tell you? The current Black Pope, Adolfo Nicholas was bought forward for the position due to the Jesuits bringing about of Asia as the next power player of the agenda. Both this Black Pope and the white Pope aren't of Papal Bloodline, they are both commoners. So forget the Micheal Tsarions when they make the real families a mystery under the title of Atonists tied to Akhenaton. I've named the most powerful families on the planet. I've named the Grey Pope the one inbetween the white and black but unseen. The Order and their intelligensia have a field day manipulating those who think their waking up. Infact their merely chasing pions and acting like an Ouroboros chewing its own tail going in circles of Lucifer! The Rothschilds are merely loyal Hofjuden Sabbatean Frankists. Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank all came about thanks to the Papacy as usual. One day people will finally wake up."" -CRAIG OXLEY

Population growth is a major component of economic growth.  Population decline is a major component of economic decline.

Look at the demographics of Japan.  Look up the terms ""Big Japan"" and ""Little Japan"".  Japan has chosen the latter which means economic contraction over the next 50 years back to 1950s levels of population and economic output.  Japan peaked in population around 2000.  They will soon have more people over the age of 50 years old than people under that age.

The other two dominant factors are natural resources (growth or decline) - think Peak Oil, and technology - which is the modern manifestation of economic efficiency.  

At least Germany (and most other European countries) is radically improving the latter - their per capita productivity trends with negative oil consumption growth while the opposite is strongly true for the US.  This is what causes the US to get into Oil Wars - we suck at efficiency and our economic prospects are strongly tied to oil consumption.  

A large part of this is that we have abandoned technology creation - you wouldn't think so based on how we like to consume it but we don't produce it well - if you are involved in technology creation and innovation, and know something about that process and its history, this is painfully clear.

Think about it for a minute; the idea that you can't just go out and collect food and eat it is a pretty radical notion. It's part of the reason why European settlers in America and Aftrica were so disruptive; the notion that someone could own the land, and prevent other people from hunting and foraging there, was just something that many societies didn't have. In western societies, we think of property rights as so fundamental that we don't even question them any more, but I'm trying to make the case that really, these ideas of ownership of land are just about as strange and freedom limiting as that of copyright.

Think about copyright in terms of the printing presses. There is no dispute that Random House and HarperCollins each own their own printing presses. If they are indeed the ones who own them, should they have the ability to arrange the type in them any way they want and then print and sell something that the other has invested in? The point of copyright is to provide some protection for the investment of creating and publishing a work in the first place.

In terms of theft, if you go to an artist, and say ""I'll pay you $1,000 to design a logo for my business"", and the artist does that and sends you the logo to review, and then you say ""haha, sucker. I'm not going to pay you after all, but I'll use this awesome logo"", is that not theft (or at least gross fraud)? You have not taken anything physical from the artist, but you have taken their time and effort, and are now profiting from their labor without paying them. Sure, the logo is just bits on your computer; should you not be able to arrange them how you want? And you're not taking exclusive use of that logo, the artist could use it for something else; does that justify using the results of their work without paying them?

If you would not do this to an artist, then why would you do this to a group of thousands of software developers, who have put in over 20 years of collective work? The fact that software is cheap to copy means that instead of having to pay all of those software developers yourself, at a cost of millions of dollars, you (along with millions of other people), can simply pay a couple hundred dollars, and all take advantage of that work. However, if only one person paid that couple hundred dollars, and everyone else just copied it from them, then those software developers would never recoup the costs of years worth of their labor.

Copyright, when applied appropriately, should be like those little stone fences separating farms. It should be a way of saying ""the stuff on this side is the result of my hard work, and you shouldn't take it without compensating me for that work."" As applied now, of course, it is far more intrusive and draconian than that, but that doesn't mean that the fundamental idea of giving the creator of the work the exclusive right to copy that work, to give it or sell it to other people, is a bad idea. Just like preventing people from foraging for food anywhere they like takes away a fundamental freedom (being able to eat any food that you find) for the purpose of encouraging useful labor, so does preventing people from copying and distributing any computer programs they like.

Anyhow, the point is, if you don't want to pay for your software, and think that you should be able to copy it to whomever you want, then why not use free software; software that is built around a model of encouraging re-use, rather than artificial scarcity? You cannot take full advantage of proprietary software anyhow; you do not have the source code, and so you cannot fix it if something goes wrong (or pay someone else to fix it for you). If through your actions of not paying for the software Microsoft goes out of business, then you're left with an unmaintainable blob of binary code. If instead you use free software, even if the company that produced it goes out of business, another can come along and sell support and updates to that software. Or you can fix it yourself.

Here is Tucker, the individualist anarchist, quoting Ernest Lesigne, who Tucker said had already accomplished the task of perfectly summarizing the relationship between anarchism and socialism:

&gt;There are two Socialisms.
One is communistic, the other solidaritarian.
One is dictatorial, the other libertarian.
One is metaphysical, the other positive.
One is dogmatic, the other scientific.
One is emotional, the other reflective.
One is destructive, the other constructive.
Both are in pursuit of the greatest possible welfare for all.
One aims to establish happiness for all, the other to enable each to be happy in his own way.
The first regards the State as a society sui generis, of an especial essence, the product of a sort of divine right outside of and above all society, with special rights and able to exact special obediences; the second considers the State as an association like any other, generally managed worse than others.
The first proclaims the sovereignty of the State, the second recognizes no sort of sovereign.
One wishes all monopolies to be held by the State; the other wishes the abolition of all monopolies.
One wishes the governed class to become the governing class; the other wishes the disappearance of classes.
Both declare that the existing state of things cannot last.

Then there is Proudhon, the mutualist anarchist.  This was the first guy to ever call himself an anarchist, so he essentially founded the philosophy *as such* and in one form or another all the traditions trace back to either him or Godwin.  Those two figures also happen to be great barometers for determining just how far modern traditions depart from anarchism as it was originally conceived.  He also wrote this before Karl Marx wrote the communist manifesto, so it is a bit hard to claim that it represents ""reformist diluted communism"".

&gt;Thus society finds itself, at its origin, divided into two great parties: the one traditional and essentially hierarchical, which, according to the object it is considering, calls itself by turns royalty or democracy, philosophy or religion, in short, property; the other socialism, which, coming to life at every crisis of civilization, proclaims itself preeminently anarchical and atheistic; that is, rebellious against all authority, human and divine.

Kropotkin, anarcho-communist.  This fellow is going to require some reading, as he is even more long-winded than I, quite well educated, and isn't describing the monolithic tradition you seem to expect.  I also have an article in which he decries how the word socialism has come to be misused and co-opted in his time, predicting what it has come to mean to folks like yourself today, if you are interested:

&gt;And it was immediately after the Great Revolution that the three great theoretical founders of modern Socialism--Fourier, Saint Simon, and Robert Owen, as well as Godwin (the No-State Socialism)--came forward; while the secret communist societies, originated from those of Buonarroti and Babeuf, gave their stamp to militant, authoritarian Communism for the next fifty years... In fact, it was only after the Revolution of July, 1830, in France, and the Reform movement of 1830-1832 in this country, had begun to shake off that terrible reaction, that the discussion of Socialism became possible for a few years before the revolution of 1848. And it was during those years that the aspirations of Fourier, St. Simon, and Robert Owen, worked out by their followers, took a definite shape, and the different schools of Socialism which exist nowadays were defined. In Britain, Robert Owell and his followers worked out their schemes of communist villages, agricultural and industrial at the same time; immense co-operative associations were started for creating with their dividends more communist colonies; and the Great Consolidated Trades' Union was founded-the forerunner of both the Lahour Parties of our days and the International Workingmen's Association. In France, the Fourierist Considerant issued his remarkable manifesto, which contains, beautifully developed, all the theoretical considerations upon the growth of Capitalism, which are now described as ""Scientific Socialism."" Proudhon worked out his idea of Anarchism and Mutualism, without State interference. Louis Blanc published his Organization of Labour, which became later on the programme of Lassalle. Vidal in France and Lorenz Stein in Germany further developed, in two remarkable works, published in 1846 and 1847 respectively, the theoretical conceptions of Considerant; and finally Vidal, and especially Pecqueur, developed in detail the system of Collectivism, which the former wanted the National Assembly of 1848 to vote in the shape of laws... State Socialism has certainly made considerable progress. State railways, State banking, and State trade in spirits have been introduced here and there. But every step made in this direction, even though it resulted in the cheapening of a given commodity, was found to be a new obstacle in the struggle of the working-men for their emancipation... On the other side, we see that countless attempts have been made all over Europe and America, the leading idea of which is, on the one side, to get into the hands of the working- men themselves wide branches of production, and, on the other side, to always widen in the cities the circles of the functions which the city performs in the interest of its Inhabitants Trade-unionism, with a growing tendency towards organizing the different trades internationally, and of being not only an instrument for the improvement of the conditions of labour, but also of becoming an organisation which might, at a given moment, take into its hands the management of production; Co-operation, both for production and for distribution, both in industry and agriculture, and attempts at combining both sorts of co-operation in experimental colonies; and finally, the immensely varied field of the so-called Municipal Socialism --these are the three directions in which the greatest amount of creative power has been developed lately. 

Do we only find socialism used to refer to anti-state and anti-capitalist economics by anarchists 100 years ago or anarchists on this subreddit?  Not at all.  From the book, Star Fraction by Ken MaCleod:

&gt;what we always meant by socialism wasn't something you forced on people, it was people organizing themselves as they pleased into co-ops, collectives, communes, unions... And if socialism really is better, more efficient than capitalism, then it can bloody well compete with capitalism. So we decided, forget all the statist shit and the violence: the best place for socialism is the closest to a free market you can get!

No, I didn't, actually.

&gt;You do compare Israel with Al Qaida after all.

Please show me where I made this comparison.

&gt;Let see, Israel must be either a terrorist group or not

This is a tautology; I can say x must be y or not y.  It's called the law of excluded middle, and it's totally irrelevant to this discussion.

Terrorism is also not particularly well defined.  For example, the EU and the US both consider Hamas to be a terrorist group.  I wouldn't call them that.  Likewise with Hizbullah.  What is your definition of this term?

&gt;Israel is a terrorist group. If this is true then the people of Israel have no say in what gets done, just like I suppose with Al Quaida

I'm sorry, but leaving aside the weasily word terrorist, how does this follow?  It sounds like you're trying to outline a proof here, but these aren't rigorous mathematical terms derived from a set of logical axioms.  All these words are fuzzy.  Having said that, why would you assume that members of ""Al Quaida"" have no say in what gets done?

&gt;But then you have admitted that Israel commits terrorists acts -- I guess that's state terrorism.

Where did I admit that?  And what exactly constitutes ""terrorist acts""?

&gt;Israel is not a terrorist group. If this is true then the people of Israel, where they have elections, have a chance to change their leaders ...

Again, I don't see what this has to do with Israel not being a terrorist group.  Hamas is widely seen as a terrorist group and yet I'm relatively certain they were democratically elected (again, I don't see them as a terrorist group, but you're making an awful lot of assumptions about ""terrorist groups"" without defining your terms at all, which is problematic since that unspoken definition seems to lie at the heart of your ""logical"" argument).

However, it is certainly true that Israel is a democracy and its citizens have the ability to put leaders who would not condone anti-Palestinian violence in power, and it is also true that they have not done so.

&gt;... and Jews worldwide have a chance to put pressure on these elected leaders of their religion to do good instead of committing atrocities.

What do non-Israeli Jews have to do with it?  Why are they better able to put pressure on Israel than say, the United States, who funds Israel? Or any other country?  Jews make up a tiny minority of the world's population.  Why do you take as given that they have some sort of special sway over the politics of a country they aren't citizens of?

&gt;There is likely no chance of changing a terrorist organization but one based on a shared religion and culture is possible to change. If people want to.

I have no idea what you're trying to say here.  Again, you're making lots of assumptions about ""terrorist organizations"".  Here's a hint: ""terrorist"" is a slur word.  It has no accepted definition, and it is used by both sides to smear the other.  US guerrilla tactics in the war for independence were widely condemned by the British as uncivilized terrorism; the Mujahideen who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan were freedom fighters in the 1980s, and those same people are terrorists now that they're fighting us.

Trying to make a proof-like argument requires well defined terms, and yours rest on emotional slur words.

&gt;Then you end with the obligatory ""anti-Semite"" accusation which is thrown around all the time nowadays.

Antisemitism is one of the most overused terms in global politics today, and we have the ADL to thank for that.  They call everyone who deigns to criticize Israel's policies antisemitic.  So I agree with that aspect of what you're saying.

However, just because everyone and their mother uses the word antisemitism with abandon doesn't mean that it is not occasionally appropriate.

In this particular case, all your nonsense about terrorism aside: the only thing I was asking was that you not talk about ""the Jews"" and instead talk about ""the Israelis"".

**We do not disagree that Israel is perpetrating atrocities in Palestine.  We do not disagree that it is immoral and must be stopped, and that allusions to genocide are not wholly inappropriate given what is happening, especially in Gaza.**

Where we *do* disagree is in who is responsible: you are painting it as a Jewish issue, when in fact it is entirely an Israeli issue, and *those two groups are not the same.*

My ""obligatory"" antisemite accusation comes from this fact.  It is anti-muslim to suggest that all muslims are bomb-wielding fanatical terrorists who want to destroy America; it is anti-christian to say that all Christians are gun-wielding evangelical rednecks building bombs to blow up abortion clinics.  We accept those views as bigoted and inaccurate because we know that the vast majority of Muslims and Christians do not support the violence that some fanatics do in their names.

Where does the double standard regarding Jews come from?  It's not difficult at all to see that the situation is entirely analogous.

The word for ""anti-Jewish"" is ""antisemitic"" and if you insist in the face of this evidence on constantly smearing the Jews with Israel's policies, including Jews that have nothing to do with the state, then I don't think the accusation is inappropriate at all.

Israel is a screwed up place (as is Iran, for example, and Syria) but its majority religion is irrelevant, just as Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy being Catholic nations was irrelevant.  Atrocities are atrocities, and the people who commit them should be brought to justice.

Those who have nothing to do with it should not be condemned with them because they happen to share some quality or other with the perpetrators.

A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
  
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
  
Two things result from this fact:
  
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
  
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
  
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
  
  
**I -- BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS**
  
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
  
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master [3] and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
  
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
  
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
  
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other -- bourgeoisie and proletariat.
  
From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.
  
The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.
  
The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolized by closed guilds, now no longer suffices for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed aside by the manufacturing middle class; division of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labor in each single workshop.
  
Meantime, the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturers no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, MODERN INDUSTRY; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.
  
Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.
  
We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.
  
Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance in that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association of medieval commune [4]: here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable ""third estate"" of the monarchy (as in France); afterward, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general -- the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative state, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.
  
The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.
  
The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ""natural superiors"", and has left no other nexus between people than naked self-interest, than callous ""cash payment"". It has drowned out the most heavenly ecstacies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom -- Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
  
The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers.
  
The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation into a mere money relation.
  
The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigor in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades.
  
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind..................

This was the part I was disagreeing with you about.  Here is another post with more details: http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/8rhv4/6_million_died_in_the_holocaust_no_11_to_17/c0a7jp7



    According to the estimate by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), some 3.3 million Soviet POWs died in Nazi custody out of 5.7 million. This figure represents a total of 57%, nearing the European Jewish death rate of over 60%[6]) and may be contrasted with ""only"" 8,300 out of 231,000 British and American prisoners, or 3.6%.[7] Some estimates range as high as 5 million dead, including these killed immediately after surrendering (an indeterminate, although certainly very large number).

    By September 1941, the mortality rate among Soviet POWs was in the order of 1% per day.[9] According to the USHMM, by the winter of 1941, ""starvation and disease resulted in mass death of unimaginable proportions"".[13] This deliberate starvation, (leading many desperate prisoners to resort to acts of cannibalism,[12]) was Nazi policy in spite of food being available,[14] in accordance to the Hunger Plan developed by the Reich Minister of Food Herbert Backe.

    Between 140,000 and 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps,[13] most of them by shooting or gassing. Some were also experimented on; in one such case, a Dr. Heinrich Berning from Hamburg University starved prisoners to death while performing ""famine experiments"";[24][25] in another, prisoners were shot using dum-dum bullets[17]).[

How you define ""tightly packed"" in any other way than population density is beyond me. Btw, if you want to discuss irrelevant, then your argument of tightly packed is a shiny example of it. I should have called you out on it before, but not only is it untrue it is also irrelevant. Saying country is rich because it is tightly packed and small would leave Bangladesh as one of the riches countries in the world, which it clearly isn't.
In regards to your argument on the domestic policies. When did the US last think about the global impact of it's domestic policies? Well I guess if you disregard the past 6 months? You'd have to go some years back. Now when Norway invests part of its income in socially responsible funds, where companies that deals with arms and tobacco is banned exactly because of it's impact in the world. 
I'm not saying everything is perfect but any industrialized country that does not affords it's citizens universal health care has missed the mark.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGTzbj3fRSw

In addition, since Scandinavian countries are so small every single decision any large country makes affects them. For instance in trading with the US or EU small countries policies are dependent on the larger unit policy. If a small country tries to subsidize an industry the country will be met with trade embargo's because the larger country sits with a lot of the negotiation power. 

Wow, I think I disagree with everything you say. Not only does it seem to me that you argue two sides of the coin when you say a small country can disregard anything outside itself, AND that it is mixing foreign and domestic policy. Just the fact that a country has a foreign policy means it deals with other countries. 

Now I don't think everything is perfect in Scandinavian countries, that is not what I am arguing, but saying that everyone in Scandinavia lives in the same community is disregarding a vast cultural diversity, and large geographical area. Saying Scandinavia is successful because of uniformity leads down an argument path where racism is not far off. I'd warn you against following that path. Based on actual research again read you Hofstede, I'd venture to say that Japan and Korea will be much more homogeneous societies as their societies are much more collectivist and has much more respect for authorities. My point is that not only do I disagree with your points, I think the 'information' you present is bogus, and more or less thought up, not based on actual facts.

It is only included to show the degree to which decriminalization has worked (or not) as opposed to their previous methods still in use by the rest of the EU.


I agree the article linked at SA.com overstates the positives (or what they claim to be positive) of decriminalization.  But that is the author's problem and not the Cato Study, which stands on it's own.  Ad hominem attacks can be appropriate, especially in this case where much of the data is anecdotal in nature, as they are in this paper.  But that doesn't mean that one *automatically* dismisses the conclusions on that basis alone.  The paper looks solid to me.  I don't like how it being exaggerated and twisted by the decriminalization crowd, but that is why you read the original in the first place and investigate the source of its funding, authors, etc.  


You must see more into this, a conspiracy perhaps, but you are free to make your own conclusions.  I'll also one more thing - that I don't believe most people here understand Portugal is experimenting with decriminalization and *not* legalization which is far different.

In reply to what was the worst, he said it was going through towns where locals had probably never seen a tourist, let alone a white person and he used to get swarmed, which was fun and great the first few times but he said, when you have the kids run out and grab your brakes, going over the handlebars wasnt fun after the second time.

A good example is France, although not a Protestant country it has certainly been destroyed by the Blacks as evidenced by the rioting not so long back twice. Yes we know British SIS using British SAS were behind the organisation but thats not the point. I wouldn't like to meet you in real life, it's bad enough hearing diversity crap on the TV and Internet without the flesh also. Thats why **I try to surround myself with thinking white people locally**, who all see what the blacks have done to our once fine country. The only problem is that most of these people do not realise above this about who allowed these **apes** to enter our fine once great and prosperous land. I feel sick being amongst all the blacks in this City, they've ruined everything just as the Jesuit wished. --Craig Oxley

The use of the word cult has technical connotations in the article which are along the line of ""a group with enthusiastic members"" 

Scientology is certainly a group with enthusiastic members.

So are certain political parties, etc (the Pirate Party, for example, in Europe)

You have a displayed a tendency to conflate that with the definition of cult which is ""a group who I find offensive"". 

Given the ease with which this could be taken out of context, I exercise caution. 

. . .

Because, the trap is to go to a place where someone like yourself says:

*See, he admits he's evil, manipulates people, and is knowingly in an evil cult for evil purposes*

That statement would be a total lie, in my opinion. 

It ignores my opinions, my viewpoints, my sense of ethics, my purposes, etc. and puts something else in its place, by a means and method which would be considered unfair in any other context. 

The basic idea of groups with enthusiastic members as being responsible for change in society is spot on. The technical use of the word cult is easily confused with the nontechnical definitions.

A similar case is the word propaganda, often used in Europe in the simple sense of advertising or promotion.

If I talk about the ""propaganda of Barack Obama"" many heads at Fox News would nod in agreement, with the hidden agreement to the idea that Obama is a genius at lying.

---

a good deal of what I have been saying has been right along this line, and you have proven the case for my caution by conflating the technical usage of the word cult with it's disparaging sense.

Bullshit.  I'm simply pointing out that people poured a historically disproportionate amount of money into housing in the post-dot-com-bubble period, motivated by historic low interest rates from the fed (a policy of inflationary lending).  Plenty of legitimate investment went on in that period, as in nearly all periods, but the historically unusual mal-investment coincides with the inflationary policies of the time.

&gt; Makes zero sense.

Capital investments with strong likelihood of return will be invested in under non-inflationary environments as well as inflationary environments.  Inflation encourages putting money into marginally less attractive, or marginally more speculative investments.  These are the investments most likely to be of negative net present value, or, in other words, destroyers of value.  This is what we have with the housing boom.

&gt; I'm citing the entire time that the DJIA has been in existence. Average out the retuns and you get over 6%.

From Wikipedia:

&gt; The Dow averaged 5.3% compounded annually for the 20th century, a record Warren Buffett called ""a wonderful century""

And a wonderful century it was, with great technological advances and a lucky avoidance of certain terrible setbacks.  But this does nothing to prove your point for inflationary policies.  The 1800's too, were a wonderful century, and not coincidentally, as they both occurred during [the Great Divergence](http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/conor_clarke/2009/07/paul_krugman_is_the_new_thomas_malthus.php), in which modern, free economies were able to far out-innovate those with more strictures.  The argument is not the 1900's vs the dark ages of Europe, it's the 1900's vs what the 1900's would have been with a stable currency, or, failing that, as a proxy the 1800's, which also went quite well.

&gt; So did Mexico.

America had the freest economy by far as well.  Not so familiar with the situation in Mexico, but I'm guessing it wasn't a counter-example, that is they didn't fail to be more powerful *despite* having a value-backed currency.",0,TheWama,t1_c0arthi,0,,True,True

I can give you a few dozen more: from those caused by the Federal reserve's policies, from the dot com bubble to the Great Depression (which followed the Roaring 20's, conspicuously coinciding with the commencement of the Fed's open market operations in 1922), down to the bubbles which followed inflationary war-time spending, when countries would temporarily abandon their peace-time gold standard.  See the Long Recession, following the Civil war and the retirement of the Greenback, or the Post WWI recession.

&gt; Inflation was ~2% during that time.

Sigh, when you follow that definition of inflation, you ignore the means by which new money comes into existence.  When the money supply increases, the new dollars do not automatically get distributed to all goods everywhere.  They are focused on those goods which are in high demand, and may be influence by the method by which the new dollars are introduced.  For example, if the new money was distributed by dropping a heap of cash on a poor ravenous family, they might use it on food, increasing demand for and thus prices thereof.  If it was dropped on an art-collector, it would first increase the demand for art before dissipating into the more general economy.  In this case, it was ""dropped"" on those attracted to long-term, low-interest loans, such as those looking to buy a home.

Home prices inflated *first,* and inflation was in effect then, and over time shows itself in rising prices elsewhere.   However, it may *never* show itself even in rising prices, if productivity is increasing at a rate fast enough to offset the price effects of the inflation.  In this case the people are in essence robbed of being able to enjoy the natural deflationary abundance of technological progress.

&gt; You keep saying this without providing any data to back it up.

Because it's self-evident.  Investors seek the highest-value investment goods.  Those will be those with the highest returns, considering risk and reward.  As new money seeks new investments, it must *necessarily* fall to marginally less attractive investment possibilities, as the more attractive possibilities are already occupied.  This is just simple, inevitable logic.

&gt; In the 1800s the U.S. was a third rate power with a lower standard of living than the Netherlands and France, about on par with Russia.

The U.S. went from Colony to prominent contributor to World industry and technology in the 100 years of tremendous economic progress that the 1800s represents.  Where it was relative to other nations is historical artifact secondary to it's rate of economic progress.  I'm talking velocity, you're talking position.  Position is a consequence of earlier acceleration and velocity.

&gt; You're conveniently ignoring the fact that the U.S. pulled far ahead of every other world economy during the 20th century

A few other minor things happened over that century, previously mentioned, e.g. the 2 world wars.  And I wonder how you can say that Germany surged forward while England and France lagged?  Germany has had progress as well as terrible (inflationary) setbacks, under the Weimar Republic.

&gt; No. After the 1930s America had all kinds of minimum wage and maximum hour and child labor laws and shit that other countries didn't have.

Seriously, you're debating this point?  Europe had universal health care, far higher tax rates, entrenched unions and politicians, terrible destruction of infrastructure and human capital under war, and so on.  You think France was on par with USA, in terms of government spending as a percentage of GDP?  Not to mention that the U.S. has free trade within it's borders, which Europe has only recently reached with the E.U.  It's a complex, multifaceted issue, but in short, your claim that the US, even after the progressive revolution, was *more* economically oppressive than Europe is prima facia laughable.

Basicly, German history classes are of a MUCH higher level than in the US. You study history from grades 5 to 13, and about HALF of that time the subject is European history of 1900-1950. The whole third reich thing was viewed very negativly, and teachers can actually get fired if they somehow view it too positivly.
I think almost a whole school year was spent analyzing how Hitler came to power und why it was possible with the political system back then.
The war itself was also covered intensivly, all the important battles, relationships of the different countries, etc, but it was done very objectivly. I don't think anybody had something like ""DAMN WE LOST"" in mind while in history class, especially since post-war Germany became one of the most influencial and productive countries in the west.

I also don't think ""history is written by the victorious"" applies to WW2. The most terrible things Hitler did are pretty much verified by facts, and i think there are actually MORE people in Germany that disagree with his methods than there are in other countries (more neonazis in the US than in Germany etc).

Depending on the system, it can actually encourage it. For instance, if you take a look at EU parliament elections, the parties create a list of candidates and they get to seat X number of them based on their vote totals. That puts ALL the power in the hands of the party leadership.

What I think we really need is a system like the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system where you prioritize the candidates but you are still voting for a local candidate. Of course they are still chosen by the party apparatus, but at least it is the LOCAL party apparatus as opposed to the national or provincial one (though it's further complicated because  the national/provincial party still has levers of control, primarily through access to funding).

Of course, all of that still doesn't matter too much, because even if you do bust your hump to influence things locally, get some one acceptable on the ballet, and then get them elected, there's no guarantee they'll be in government rather than the opposition benches. And if they ARE in government, why, it's entirely up to the leader of the governing party, chosen by the national party apparatus (of course), to decide if that person gets to be in the minority of government MPs who actually have any ability to do anything (in other words, a Cabinet Minister) or if they'll just be a warm body who is basically only there to increment the government vote count by one.

We're still together, and I think this and similar other experiences have made us stronger for it; for example, she's a strategy consultant and is on the road for long times (she's had 3-4 month projects on other continents and different, closer countries), and I have been working outside the country for the last year or so (although I come home every weekend, or we go somewhere together.)

I think once you have the right mentality about yourself and relationships with others (guys, girls, whatever) you'll be fine. I wrote this in another post about a guy that hasn't had a girlfriend yet (he is 29), and I think a lot of the same things I wrote ring true here:

--------------------------------------
There is something shallow about some of the comments to this post (*Edit: this is referring to the other thread, not this post in relationship_advice*). I feel like root_access is writing down ""rules"" to a ""game"" that doesn't really exist; or rather, exists for some people but not all. Being in shape, or having a ton of money, or cool clothes aren't what gets women. I mean, there are ton of exceptions to his rules, that I would only treat them as ""ok"" and not really a set of more fundamental rules to live by. Also, there is something almost uniquely American to his post, namely number 2. European women in my experience don't care as much about the big swinging dick ""alpha male"" culture that is pervasive in the US. If you don't believe me, go to Croatia and meet some of the most beautiful women in the world that will love you for being caring and nice. This needing to be an ""asshole"" to get girls in really only an American concept -- it's trashy, at best, and only enables you to hook up with vapid whores. 

If you want quality women in your life, here are my rules:

1) **Be yourself**

2) **Be confident**

3) **Be confident** -- this cannot be emphasized enough. Know yourself and love yourself for who you are. American culture breeds this stupid ideal of the ""alpha male"" that makes a lot of money doing something stupid like ""Account Manager"" or ""Senior VP of Business Development"" some other bullshit like that. He probably has a company-paid blackberry and looks at that shit everyday thinking how awesome he is for it. He probably has been surrounded by a few too many people that think like him, so he gets to accept as truth that he is the ""alpha male"" and is the shit. The truth is: this shit doesn't matter. The point is: *people are full of shit (even me)*. Knowing this will help you out, because rather than comparing yourself to others, you just need to be yourself and be confident (**but not cocky - cocky is just insecurity wrapped up in a layer of bullshit, and people are very perceptive of it**). 

4) **Be nice**. I know there's some idiotic truism that floats around that ""nice guys finish last"", but don't listen to it. It should be ""**weak, insecure guys finish last**."" I consider myself really nice and have been successful enough with women thus far (for context, I have dated a smoking hot, incredibly nice and caring Abercrombie and Fitch model - I don't mean to brag, I just want to tell you that I kind of know what I'm talking about. She really liked that I was a caring guy... it's refreshing when dealing with cocky, ego-driven, drama-queen men. Also, this has nothing to do with my looks - I'm 21 and already have a very noticeable receding hairline). If you can be a really nice guy and have a ton of confidence, there's no woman you can't get that you really want to be with. I promise you. Women seek confidence in men because it makes them feel protected and sure of themselves because they have a confident man behind them. If you can be confident with yourself and be a really nice, affectionate guy, you have it made, I promise.

The truth is, you won't have trouble finding a girlfriend. To me you seem like a genuinely nice guy that has just had some trouble ""figuring it out"", maybe. Or maybe you haven't really placed an emphasis on finding a girlfriend? In any case, it doesn't matter. Know you want companionship and go for it. Never be ashamed of who you are -- **you are who you are**, and that's the truth for better or for worse. Might as well be the best you can be and be the most confident you can be. Never compare yourself to anyone else. Love yourself and love who you are with for who she is, and you'll be fine, trust me.

-----------------------------------------

In my case, what made my friendships tough was also because I didn't really like the friends I had. I was so desperate for companionship that I clung onto them and annoyed them, but, I never really liked them. Again, I don't know if that's your situation, but I found going to college (and now graduate school) to be somewhat helpful. I just graduated from UNC, and my dentist gave some interesting insight; he told me to look forward to the future because I haven't met 4 out of my 5 best friends yet. You seem to be pretty young, so realize what you are doing now, in the big scheme of life, doesn't matter. Even if you love that girl, if things go sour for whatever reason, you'll find another girl that will make you wonder why you ever loved any other girl in the first place. That's just how life goes. 

You seem to be a nice guy -- that makes you better than most people in my book. People always have the tendency to be an asshole; some do more to hide it, others don't give a shit. **If you can be nice to girls and be really confident in yourself, you have it made.** Charm and all that other shit comes with genuine confidence. 

**Edit:** Also, listen to pi3832 about being an introvert. That's one of the first things I thought about when I saw your post. Play to your strengths and arm yourself with knowledge about your personality so that you don't feel ashamed for who you are. 

**Edit 2:** What helped me stop being so insecure was to stop listening to everyone around me. Dr. Bill Cosby once said, ""I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."" Just be you -- if you have an iota of intelligence, chances are you are already smarter and thinking differently than most people. If something people are doing around you doesn't resonate with you, learn to be able to say **""fuck you""** and walk away. That's not to say to *actually* say it, but *be able to say it if you need to*. There's a big difference there, so make sure you understand what I'm talking about. You think if someone comes up to like Barack Obama, George Clooney, or Pierce Brosnan or whatever and starts giving him shit, do you think they get scared and back down? Hell no -- that's not to say they get angry and start yelling back, but they have the fortitude to know that the other person's opinion shouldn't affect how they feel about themselves.

I think the thing is for you (at least for me) was that you feel different from most people -- *that's 100% ok*. Everyone is different, maybe your differences are more magnified, so use that and play to your strengths. Don't ever let anyone diminish you -- accept advice, but don't let anyone try to make you feel bad about yourself. **You can't control how people will react to you, but you can control how you will react to them**. 

**Edit 3:** I never actually answered your question. How to stop being insecure? Just grab your balls and go for what you want. Fake it 'til you make it -- it'll come with time, and you'll have trouble getting there, but just **go for what you want and be who you want to be**. I can't emphasize this enough. Following your goals and ambitions will give you no time to feel sorry for yourself, and eventually you'll just replace insecure feelings with positive feelings, because you'll be too busy being happy being yourself and doing what you love.

I'd say living expenses depend on about four factors, some of which are up to you:

 * Retirement saving. You just need to take that into account, if you're self employed.

 * Health insurance. You *must* have health insurance in Germany, and that depends on age and income. If you're young, private health insurance with a co-payment can be less than 70€/month, but it gets expensive when you get older. You can voluntarily go into public health insurance even if you're self employed, and pay between about 300 and 600€, depending on income. If you're employed, it can be less (15% of income, split between your employer and yourself).

 * Rent: Depends on location. The good (inner city, well renovated) apartments are ~5€/m^2, if you don't mind being further from the center it can be half of that, possibly even less. Plus heating, electricity, Internet... Rooms in shared apartments are ~150-300€/month, usually including everything.

 * Food etc. Pizza delivery of a normal pizza is 5-8€ depending on what and where, you can get kebap for 1€, but I recommend going somewhere where it costs 2-3€. Very cheap pubs start at about 1.50€/pint, but you can easily pay twice as much (or even more, depending on where you go).

You really don't need a car. There's public transport, obviously, but I prefer walking (center, train station, super markets, park, bars and clubs are all in walking range from where I live, take-away or restaurant food -- various East-Asian, Indian, Pizza, Kebab, one Mexican, even Afghan and Iraqi -- are all within ""cigarette-distance"", but BK and McD are only in the center. There is a Subways, if you like that).
If you need to go somewhere, you can take the train, or the international airport outside the city. Berlin is 80 minutes by train.

So, there are cheaper places in the world, but I don't think they had retirement saving and health insurance in that $500 figure. For a proper city, in Europe, Leipzig is as cheap as it gets. This is mostly because there are so many empty apartments, so rent is cheap. Cheap rent means the waitress works for cheap while she studies, and that in turn makes your beer cheap, too.

Edit: Oh, *zero* German... Well, you could *get by*, but unless you move exclusively within a circle of ex-pats, you'll need German for a proper social life. Most speak some English, many well enough for a normal conversation and they'll jump at the opportunity, but when you're within a group of Germans there will be at least one who doesn't speak English well enough for the conversation to remain in English. Everybody has to learn English in school (but this is East Germany, so those over 35 have learned Russian), you need to have learned at least two foreign languages to go to uni, but it's still only school English (typically about 7 years). Once you're out of school, it quickly deteriorates if you don't use it regularly. That's just how it is.

The High School movement that took America from simple literacy to full blown education was ahead of it's time. For once we took the initiative before Europe and mandated real education and the result was our nation skyrocketed in wealth and power mostly via technology. 

Investing in high school educations was one of the single smartest events in the 19th century, before that school was little more than literacy with very basic math for most people and. of course, academics for the rich kids. 

This is a horrible argument against government funded projects. Attacking public education is a losing proposition. I needs reform, not to be removed so our people can revert to even less science, math and history understanding. It would be national suicide to not mandate education in the US.

A few tips:
1. Buy a GPS. In the end its cheaper than buying maps for every region you bike through and sometimes its nice being able to hunt down little cafes to stop at.

2. Try Couchsurfing.com or hospitality network to find free housing along the way. There's some good camping in europe, but its always nice having a warm shower in between days. I didn't have any trouble finding somewhere to couchsurf in every city i stopped in.

3. Bring light rain gear and keep it easily accessible. Some of those European storms can come out of nowhere, and then only last for 20 minutes or so. It's nice to be able to change what you're wearing fairly qucikly!

Anyways, beyond that it should be fairly common sense. Goodluck and have fun!

The First Aliyah was in 1881, and was prompted by pogroms in Eastern Europe. Shortly after, ""Der Judenstaat"" was published, bringing the movement of Zionism cohesion. Among Jewish communities, Zionism was very controversial, because many Jews felt that they needed some sign from God to return, which they did not have.

Around 1910 the Second Aliyah brought some 40,000 more Jews into Israel. They came from Russia (now Moldova) after anti-Jewish riots that had not been stopped or punished by the authorities. A lot of these people were socialists, and they are responsible for the kibbutz movement.

During WW1, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, which said that Britain had a favorable outlook on Jews settling in Palestine. Groups of Zionists helped Britain conquer Palestine, and the Third and Fourth Aliyahs brought maybe 100,000 more Jews to Palestine. 

The Fifth Aliyah, which coincided with the rise of Nazism, brought about 250,000 Jews from Germany, despite British immigration quotas. Many of these people were educated, wealthy individuals who went to Israel not because they particularly wanted to live there, but because they wanted to feel safe. Many other countries at this point were no longer accepting Jewish immigrants. This brought the Jewish population up to maybe 40% of Israel.

Of course, during this whole time the Arab Palestinians were not very happy. Britain found that not only could it not settle any kind of peace between the groups, but that the Jewish settlers were becoming increasingly violent. Thus, they withdrew, and by 1948, the UN decided to split Palestine in two. ",0,[deleted],t1_c0asam5,0,,True,True

Hardly. The idea of leaving Europe for a new Jewish state was started by the first Zionist congress in 1896. They settled on Israel because of their heritage, but also because they saw it as somewhere that would not be hotly contested (bad choice, eh?). The U.S. really had nothing to do with Israel, and only recognized the state in 1948 because the U.S.S.R did the same. In fact, in the Suez War in 1956, the U.S. opposed Israel and sent out the American navy to block French and British ships backing up Israeli troops.

&gt; The only problem there was that there was already people living in that particular part of the desert, the Palestinians. The U.S. keeps giving the Israelis more money, since we kinda feel bad we dumped them there instead of letting them live in the U.S., and have grown in size

This is also untrue. At first, Palestinians were happy to have Jewish immigrants. They were wealthy Europeans who came and bought up a lot of land, which raised property prices for Palestinian landowners, and because the Jewish settlers brought lots of farm equipment and modern irrigation techniques, they ""made the desert bloom"" and gave lots of jobs to Palestinians. However, when the world economy crashed in the 30s, the Palestinians got fired because the Jewish owners favored other Jewish workers over Palestinians. Many people were left homeless and unemployed, and subsequently revolted against the Brits.

&gt; They are taking over the Palestinian land, blocking humanitarian aid from entering Palestine, and then Palestine gets pissed, some radicals starts shooting rockets into Israel

It happened in a series of wars. In 1948, when Israel declared independence as a 2nd state, Palestine was unwilling to accept this, and invaded as part of a coalition with Syria, Jordan, and Egypt (the main players, at least.) They drastically underestimated Israel, and were sorely beaten, and lost a lot of territory. The worst war for Palestine was in 1967, the Six Days war. They surprise attacked Israel, which is when American aid started. Our weapons and technology allowed them to beat back the Arab forces and take even more territory, including Jerusalem and the West Bank (which had been part of Jordan). 

Because they took so much territory, they suddenly had a huge native population of Palestinians to deal with. The 'enemy' was now inside their borders, instead of outside. After so many defeats in war, Palestinians realized that they would not be able to really beat Israel as an organized army, so went underground and started using terrorist tactics in order to persuade Israel that holding Palestinian territory was too costly. 

&gt; Israel basically fucks their shit up even more and now the Palestinians are dying and living in shit conditions, all the while America is still paying for Israels arms and everything

Pretty much. Israel is very heavy handed in trying to catch/discourage terrorists, which affects the whole population. For example, to prevent smuggling of weapons and attacks deep in Israeli territory, they do not allow Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. Although this has caused a decrease in suicide bombings in Israel and Tel Aviv, it also means that innocent people cannot cross into Israel where the jobs are. The terrorist groups just adapted and started shooting rockets over the checkpoints from safe points. To appease their voters, Israel occasionally goes in and kills some people to make it look like they are doing something to prevent terrorism. They do kill terrorists, but again, the civilian population is unduly burdened by this. They also try to influence the civilian population using embargoes and controls on food and power, thinking that if the population is deprived, they will vote Hamas out of power. So far, that strategy has been unsuccessful.

I'll go first. Disclaimer: keep in mind that this is all pure conjecture and **most probably wrong**.

Iran will probably continue to crack down hard on the protesters, using tried-and-true methods of governmental terrorism. The US, who are still heavily engaged in Iraq and whose citizens have by now caught on to the fact that you can't just waltz in on other countries, blow stuff up willy nilly and expect things to go smoothly, will not intervene. Neither will the rest of the free world.

Once the dissenters are properly, err, ""placated,"" Iran will forge ahead and entrench their brand of ""democracy"" until everyone in Iran who opposes the government will have either fled the country or been killed; throw in concentration camps for good measure. Fearing the rise of ""terrorists"" (and a loss of profit), corporations engaged in Iraq will take steps to bolster the country's defenses (both military and cultural defenses) against foreign influence from their northern neighbor. Ultimately, we will see a situation not unlike the division of East/West Germany, with one country backed by powerful economic interests and the other suffering from political and ideological oppression.

Unlike East Germany though, Iran sits on a ridiculous amount of wealth in the form of oil. This could allow the country to avoid many of the GDR's economic woes, but in effect the ruling elite will use this wealth to enrich themselves and further the oppression of the Iranian people (think Saudi Arabia with a serious chip on its shoulder). This relative economic wealth will lead to a level of political stability and perhaps even a slow build-up of ties with other countries who aren't necessarily fans of free speech and free citizenry either (hellooooo China!).

Fast forward fifty, maybe sixty years, and we're right back in what could be called ""Cold War Light"" (with 75% fewer calories) between the nations of Europe, North America, India (who are by now a first-rate superpower of their own), and some Middle Eastern countries on one side and China, Iran, Russia, and parts of South America on the other.

Turkish television station Kanal T hopes the answer is a ratings success as it prepares to launch a gameshow where spiritual guides from the four faiths will seek to convert a group of non-believers.

The prize for converts will be a pilgrimage to a holy site of their chosen religion -- Mecca for Muslims, the Vatican for Christians, Jerusalem for Jews and Tibet for Buddhists.

But religious authorities in Muslim but secular Turkey are not amused by the twist on the popular reality game show format and the Religious Affairs Directorate is refusing to provide an imam for the show.

""Doing something like this for the sake of ratings is disrespectful to all religions. Religion should not be a subject for entertainment programs,"" High Board of Religious Affairs Chairman Hamza Aktan told state news agency Anatolian after news of the planned program emerged.

The makers of ""Penitents Compete"" are unrepentant and reject claims that the show, scheduled to begin broadcasting in September, will cheapen religion.

""We are giving the biggest prize in the world, the gift of belief in God,"" Kanal T chief executive Seyhan Soylu told Reuters.

""We don't approve of anyone being an atheist. God is great and it doesn't matter which religion you believe in. The important thing is to believe,"" Soylu said.

The project focuses attention on the issue of religious identity in European Union-candidate Turkey, where rights groups have raised concerns over freedom of religion for non-Muslim minorities.

Detractors of the ruling AK Party government, which is rooted in political Islam but officially secular, accuse it of having a hidden Islamist agenda, a charge it denies.

Some 200 people have so far applied to take part in the show and the 10 contestants will be chosen next month.

On one occasion, we flew an airline in the Amazon with a bad reputation (our reasons were complex and involved threats from the US Treasury), not believing that an airline in a reasonably civilized country could be *that* unsafe, for only two flights.

We were wrong... we had a stop midway through at an airport with *no* instrumentation. This would have been fine in a small plane, but we were in a 737. And there was a low, thick cloud layer obscuring visibility - in the US, no one would be allowed to land in this situation. The plane was flown by an ex-fighter pilot who apparently didn't realize he wasn't in a fighter any more: the g-forces experienced when he aborted the landing after breaking through the clouds and realizing he was in the wrong place were the highest I've ever experienced in a plane. Then again, that may have just been him panicking.

After landing, we got to wait in the plane while it refuelled. This wouldn't be that bad, except that the captain was apparently sociable, and decided to tell those of us in front about how he was afraid of running into some mountains nearby, because the weather conditions there made them almost impossible to see much of the time, and he wanted to wait to see if the weather would get better. It didn't. Fortunately, he avoided the mountains this time, and had managed by chance to find the runway when landing after two tries.

**One year** later, in the same plane, and on the same flight, the crew didn't come out of the clouds in the right place, forgot to abort the landing, and crashed, killing everyone. In an airline with a fleet of four planes, it would be their second major crash in **three** years.

EDIT: Sorry, I had my numbers mixed up here. We flew in 2004, and the crashes were in 2003 and 2005, which would make for three years of operation, not five; however, if I recall correctly, their licence was suspended for some time after the 2003 crash, so that would make for significantly less than three years of operation...",0,[deleted],t1_c0asda6,0,,True,True

LEGO Star Wars/Batman/Indy Jones: All manage to capture the fun of the console versions, and if played over link are practically identical to their big brothers.  Gameplay is 99% identical, so just pick your favorite franchise.

Looney Tunes Duck Amuck:  It's practically a law that you have to have a couple lousy minigame collections on your DS.   This one was animated by Warner Bros animators and has as its sole purpose *pissing off Daffy Duck.*  If you're a fan of Chuck Jones, this makes it vastly superior to all the other minigame collections.

Mario Kart DS: OK, it's one of the canonical must-haves, but seriously: you can play Kart battles with people anywhere in the world, any time of day, from the comfort of your couch.  We are living in the goddamn future, my friend.

Metroid Prime Pinball: Almost certainly the best pinball game on the DS.  Loads of fun.  Also comes with the rumble pak, if you find a complete copy.

Moon: From the same guys who made Dementium, it's probably the best single-player FPS on the system.  Criminally overlooked, in my opinion.  

Nanostray / Nanostray 2: If you like shmups, these are THE games to get.  They're really the only PS1/Saturn/Dreamcast style 2D-in-3D shmups on the system.

Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution: Do you like Civ?  Do you want to play it anywhere in the world?  Go buy this.  (I suspect you're in Europe from your spelling, but if you are in the US, I recently saw several Gamestops clearancing it for $10.  Incredible deal for the money.)

Speed Racer The Videogame:  No, I'm not joking.  It's got a few playability issues, mostly in that it's too easy, but in terms of sense of speed and just being *fun* it is the best arcade-style racer on the DS.  (If you want a serious racer, get GRID.  And for the love of god, *avoid* the port of Burnout.  It's absolutely terrible.)

Super Princess Peach:  It's 2D.  It looks like a SNES game.  It's nausiatingly girly.  It'll be your guilty secret.  It's probably the most fun pure platformer on the system.

Theresia... : A very weird hybrid FPS\Adventure\Survival Horror game.  It's also surprisingly absorbing and tells an interesting story, once you get used to its strange play mechanics.  (Hint: if it's metal, it will hurt you.  Always.)

And finally, I would suggest: even if you don't succumb to the lure of piracy, get a flashcart.  The DS has probably the most thriving homebrew scene of all the consoles, and the amount of quasi-legal crap you can put on it is just amazing.  

Edit: And if Retro Game Challenge sounds like fun to you, **please** actually buy it.  There's a sequel out in Japan and whether it gets localized pretty much depends on whether anyone buys RGC1.",0,innocentbystander,t1_c0ase5q,0,,True,True

(Most Americans, for example, never even paid the religion the least bit of attention until 9-11.)

Le Chanson de Roland may not have been the first chanson to depict Muslims (erroneously) in a negative light, but it was certainly the most popular, as it was translated into multiple languages and recounted by traveling minstrels throughout Europe. It also became one of the founding myths of France.

While Europe was wallowing in the Dark Ages, its peoples living in huts and  suffering a hardscrabble existence, Muslim Spain had magnificent cities that were centers of learning and culture. While Charlemagne was brutally conquering and consolidating Europe, forcing everyone to become Catholic, Muslim Spain allowed Christians and Jews to keep their faiths and even appointed them to high administrative positions.

Atrocities were committed by Muslims, of course. I'm not whitewashing the fact that they did, at times, kill all the male inhabitants of the towns they conquered, and sold the women and children into slavery. But this was no worse than what Julius Caesar did when he was on campaign, not to mention other Western conquerors. 

The fact is, compared with their contemporaries, Islam was a tolerant religion that did much to foster trade and learning. It's time we understood that, so we can better understand Islam and Muslims of today.

Fair enough. There are a few issues I want to address, so this may be lengthy, the tl;dr is that I think the author is probably a terrible teacher and somewhat racist.

First, it feels like this author is completely unaware of his own cultural experiences and what has become naturalized to him, and when he encounters different cultures acting out the same routines his lack of self-awareness causes him to perceive them as crass, uncivil, and other undesirable things. In short, he applies a double standard. Examples: his remarks about the ""crudest terms imaginable"" used in sexist rap, as the students groan ""she suck dat aaahhh."" This is portrayed as some sort of black phenomenon. Yet it was a band full of white people that wrote ""Givin' The Dog A Bone"" and gee, if that's not a crude male-dominant sexual metaphor on par with anything he describes, I don't know what is. It's not as though sex is absent from modern music either.

People - particularly teenagers - *like* the idea of lots of easy sex, of being important, of being wealthy easily. Black, white, hispanic, whatever students express these desires in different ways, but it is often the same essential desires. Now, these are admittedly not what I think kid's highest priorities should be, but they were probably mine when I was younger, and hey, they're still really attractive to me. Some people want to be a rock star living in a hilltop house and drivin' fifteen cars, other people want to be a rap star. Whatever. The assertion that this behavior is particularly endemic or unique to black students is absurd. 

It's the same with a lot of his other examples - gee, your students aren't super interested in researching Marcus Garvey, even though they're black? Guess how many white kids I've had not be particularly enthused about researching some dead old white person they've never heard of before? Sometimes, adolescents aren't real into history. Even I wasn't at times in my youth (and I think it's awesome now). 

Again, I'm not saying this is *good* or *desirable* - part of the teacher's role is to help kids overcome their distaste of these subjects, make them exciting and accessible, and get them to like it. But instead, this dude decides that they don't like it because they're black (because all white students are just the most engaged, studious little devils ever, eh?). 

A lot of his stories are interesting and relevant to some extend, but the way he frames them in racial absolutes - 'this is how black people are, this is how they act in groups, this is how lazy they are' - completely miss the reality that this has a lot to do with the way poorly educated students everywhere are. 

Second major point - a general critique that thinking in categorical black and white terms, particularly around identity issues, is often a sign of simplistic and biased thinking. He opens by saying ""Most whites simply do not know what
black people are like in large numbers,
and the first encounter can be a shock."". 

What the fuck?

No more need be said about that. 

Third, the issue of violence. There's some confusion between correlation and causation in his essay (as a teacher, he should know better) - he teaches in a majority black school, sees a lot of blacks fighting, declares ""hey, those black people are violent."" In reality, extremely poor school settings, particularly ones with poor teacher quality (I do not think this fellow is very good at his job), are prone to violence by all races. 

More on his bias in teaching - I think his anecdote about the history of philosophy day is particularly telling. On the one hand, he has a point - people like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau (or Hume - I forget exactly who he was talking about) - are both important to learn about, and white. But, there are also black people who have had political thoughts, and when the students ask why they aren't represented, ""they aren't European"" is not a very good answer (unless you're teaching a *class* on European History/Philosophy - which I gather he was not, since he describes covering other course material at other points in the class). His answer is essentially ""I arbitrarily decided we're talking only about European theorists, and they all happen to be white, so coincidentally it's all white people today."" I am *not* saying he shouldn't talk about those people, and maybe it is a little bit of pragmatism-induced-racialist-attitude-acceptance on my part, but if black students want to learn about black theoreticians, why on earth would you not accommodate that request? 

In fact, for me that might be a golden opportunity - his kids were very close to *asking* to hear about some particular philosophers. In a poor, urban school setting, few things scream ""learning opportunity"" like that. His tactic of shutting them down probably doesn't contribute to their overall academic engagement (which, of course, he later blames on them being black. Gee....)

""Black people"" aren't some crazy monolithic category of lazy incompetents. There are lazy black kids, just like there are lazy white kids who want to smoke pot and listen to rock and roll all day. There are promiscuous black people, and there are promiscuous white people too. Black kids were disruptive and dancing during his classes? Shit, when I was going to a rich, majority white private school growing up, some white kid opened the window when the teacher's back was turned and helped six people climb out of class. That probably qualifies as disruption too. 

I've had black students in my classes who have come to realize that they can care and learn about history, about philosophical abstractions, about politics, and so on and so forth. This gentleman appears to have decided in advance that it is not possible, and reacts to his students accordingly. Teacher-fail. 

*Edit* I just wanted to acknowledge I feel there are complexities I glossed over and points I didn't make, but even a request for a ""thorough"" explanation has its limits, and looking at the length of this, I think I hit ""thorough"" about four paragraphs back.

&gt;""If you have to pay money [to a politician] to have the right thing done, is is only just and fair to do it.... If a [politician] has the power to do great evil and won't do right unless he is bribed to do it, I think... it is a man's duty to go up and bribe""

&gt;President Theodore Roosevelt provides Morgan with $25 million in government funds to use to control the panic. Morgan, acting as a one-man central bank, decides which firms will fail and which firms will survive.

Now, one of the Europeans (little dude, funny mustache) was kind of crazy, hated quite a lot of people, he loved blonde hair, blue-eyed types, pretty much hated everyone else. Anyway he had a real hard-on for these jews, made them wear funny yellow stars n shit so they could be easly identified. Anyway while everyone was involved in this gigantic pissing match, little german dude was killing all the Jews he could lay his hands on. Anyway little german dude ended up getting his ass handed to him by the rest of the world an so he shoots himself. Game over. Well actually then things get interesting, as per your submitted question.

So after this war all the winners find these death camps, where german dude was killing he Jews, he killed loads of others too but the Jews were able to make quite a fuss about the whole thing. Anyway the winners felt terrible and promised to do something to help. Britain pretty much owned the globe at that stage so they said they would take care of it. They had to get rid of some countries after the war anyway (because they were skint and could not afford the upkeep). So they gave them a bit of desert which, coincidentally, the jewish people said was where they were originally from. So they started living there, however the Palestinians who used to live there were not too happy about the arrangement, they thought they had got rid of the Brits, only to end up with the Jews.

So then, between the 2 groups, there was a bit of tension. They both retired to their Holy Books to see what they should do to sort this issue out and they both came to the same, simple, stunningly-obvious conclusion. That was that they should just kill the other group, in keeping with their religions stated positon as one of peace and love.

Lots of other countries have tried to get involved and try to play peacemaker, but both sides start telling eachother to STFU n' stuff and it all falls to pieces, they build more walls, launch moe rockets and there are more dead people.

As for why I think I can give an unbiased account, I'm a History major focusing my Honours on the Middle East and have spent time in both Israel and the West Bank. Everyone has their biases but  I think one can give a general account of the historical narrative without pushing an agenda. 

A good place to start is the breakup of the Ottoman empire after World War I. The area known as the Levant (Modern Israel/West Bank/Gaza/Jordan/Syria/Lebanon) was given to the French and the British in a Mandate by the League of Nations, the precursor to the United Nations. The French controlled Syria and Lebanon and the British controlled Palestine and Jordan. From the late 1890s there had been a small amount of Jewish Immigration to the area known as Palestine, the immigrants were generally socialists looking to create a homeland where they were free of the persecution Jews regularly faced in Europe and elsewhere. This movement became known as 'Zionism' under the leadership of Theodore Herzl. It's important to note (I think) that the early Zionism was more of a political and social movement than a religious one, Herzl being a staunch socialist and identifying his Jewish heritage as one of ethnicity rather than religion. 

During the Interwar period Jewish immigration continued largely unhindered by the British Authorities who viewed the European immigrants as a group they could easily deal with. Jewish groups set up highly organized communities, helped by their high level of education and experience in civil management. These Jewish groups would buy up large areas of arable land from landowners who generally lived in the major cities, something that infuriated the local population who mostly rented their homes from the wealthy landowners and were thus forced to leave. As tensions between the local population and the immigrants increased, the British cabinet member Arthur Balfour said in a letter than became known as the 'Balfour Declaration' that:

""His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""

This was obviously a very vague statement, but Zionist groups both inside mandate Palestine and outside it viewed this as a victory in their fight for a national homeland while Palestinian groups saw it as a stab in the back and an attack on their own homeland. Thus tensions increased between the local palestinian population, the British occupiers and Zionist groups. With a massive increase in Jewish Immigration and the occompanying land buyups as well as a downturn in the local economy, a breaking point was hit. These tensions culminated in what is known as the 'Arab Revolt'. Palestinians organized a general strike, attacked Jewish settlement as well as institutions of British rule. With armed Jewish para-military organizations helping the British in quelling the unrest, many Palestinians came to see the goal of expelling the British as part and parcel of expelling the Jewish immigrants. 

The British government was finding that their position in Palestine was becoming increasingly untenable. The costs of fighting an insurgency as well as policing fighting between Jewish and Arab groups convinced the government that something had to be done. The result was Winston Churchill's 'White Paper' which called for a limit on Jewish immigration. Zionists were up in arms, quite literally, at this development and were convinced that they had been cruelly stabbed in the back by the British government. In 1946 the King David hotel was bombed by a militant Jewish organization, the leader of which went on to become Israel's P.M. 
In 1947, the Brits had had enough and the U.N created a partition plan, splitting the county in two. It's important to remember however, that the Israel/Palestine conflict is all about numbers and while the land was split 50/50 (roughly) the Jewish population was considerable lower than the Arab population, I think somewhere around half. This made the partition unworkable in the eyes of the Arabs, who declined to agree to the resolution and favorable to the Jews who not surprisingly, agreed. 

Amid general chaos the British pulled out of Palestine as Ben Gurion declared a state of Israel inside the U.N Partition lines.

Um, because he didn't leave power as he was supposed to? Deportation wasn't a punishment, he sought and received asylum in Costa Rica. He would have faced criminal prosecution if he stayed there. They did him a favor.

&gt; It doesn't matter if it's a criminal trial or not - Habeus Corpus is a common principle of justice to which Honduras subscribes.

You have absolutely no clue what you're talking about. I don't think you even know what habeas corpus means. Habeas corpus has nothing to do with the impeachment process.

&gt; You cannot arrest somebody and then impose punishment without giving them a chance to defend themselves through due process.

You're right - but Zelaya hasn't been imprisoned and he isn't facing any charges. He was removed from power as president. If he comes back to Honduras, *then* he will face arrest, criminal prosecution, and will have to go to court.

&gt; Impeachment doesn't mean kidnapping and throwing on a plane. No defense, no due process = illegal.

No, but defiantly resisting impeachment is against the law, and he was not kidnapped. He was temporarily arrested for staying the president's palace even though he was impeached, and then was flown off to Costa Rica to receive political asylum there. That was of his choosing. How many more times do we have to go through this before it begins to sink in?

&gt; Anything that serves the interests of the poor majority, but does not serve the interests of the corporate, political class - since right now, the political class controls the constitution, and the political process - as was the case in Venezuela before Chavez.

There's five things in the Constitution of Honduras that cannot be changed - none of these have to do with the interests of the poor. Everything else can be changed by Congress with 2/3 majority. Again: which of these unchangeable tenets in the constitution is it that Zelayas wanted to change on behalf of the poor?

There is none. He wanted to scrap the constitution because of the unchangeable law about presidential term limits. Get a clue already.

&gt; Sorry - I couldn't hear you over the cheers of the 63% of Venezuelans that voted for Chavez in the last election that was certified by the OAS, the EU, the Carter Center, and Mercosur.

Well, it sure does help when you subvert all the other branches of government, fill the electoral boards with yes-men, and devote several hours a day on TV to yourself. It sure does help that most of those people who voted for him are poor, uneducated, and let's be honest - brainwashed.

Chavez is spending much more money on the military than anything else, and most things in the country are going to hell. 

&gt; Really, who cares about an economy that's doubled

The GDP in the US has nearly doubled since 1999 as well, but that doesn't mean that things are going swimmingly well, now does it? It's called inflation, look it up.

By the way, who is it that releases the statistics for Venezuela? Oh, Chavez. Right.

&gt;Sorry, but what can you possibly see as wrong in that? They can't have a truce with Israel unless they recognise Israel. Basic logic.

In diplomacy and international relations recognizing someone means not merely recognizing their *de facto* existence but their *de jure* existence and their right to exist.  Recognition means making peace with someone, not just saying to your foes in a war that you'll now call them by their proper name.

&gt;Are you suggesting that Israel shouldn't withdraw from the illegally occupied West Bank? Or end the illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip? Or establish a Palestinian State? Or grant the right to East Jerusalem?

Israel *should* withdraw from the West Bank and should maintain their security around Gaza Strip (the blockade is perfectly legal in a state of declared war, especially given that it's the Hamas government which declared the war).  Establishing a Palestinian state is up to the Palestinians, but Israel should withdraw from aforementioned West Bank so that they have territory to establish one in.

They simply realized (around the 17th century) that by supporting a Jewish state in Palestine (composed mainly of European Jews) that they could have allies in the region.

3) Jews moving to Palestine in the late 19th century had less to do with swamps and malaria and had more to do with anti-semitic sentiments in Russia.  Despite that, money from abroad did help make Israel nicer, but did not inspire mass Arab immigration to the country.  There had been many Arabs there since the end of the crusades.  It's been one of the most populated places on earth for a while (especially since it's surrounded by desert).  And your claim that there was never any attempt to 'rid' the area of Arabs is untrue.  At the very least there was a campaign to buy Arab land, but there were also Zionist terrorist groups that tried to scare Arabs off their land.

4) The area designated for Israel in 1947 included many lands owned by Arab-Palestinians.  Many were naturally upset that they were losing their control to *European and Russian* Jews.  Many Arab-Jews had lived in Palestine for centuries with little problem.  The issue came when a massive influx of Europeans came and displaced the Arabs.  So, your classification of ""arab 'Palestinians'"" and ""jewish 'Palestinians'"" is misleading, because the problem is not one of religion or race as it is of perceived imperialism.

5)Last, but most important.  You're right, Palestinians probably need to recognize that European and Russian immigrants are not leaving.  They should ""suck it up"".  But, it's a two-way street.  Israel need to allow Palestinians to run their own borders and control their own country without checkpoints.  In short, Israel must respect Palestine's right to exist (as a sovereign state) just as much as Palestine needs to do for Israel.  Most everyone agrees on this, it is the Palestinian rocket-shooters and Israeli settlers that are (equally) the problem.

It was ""legal"" (in that the Arabs push the British to set up immegration limits on Jews), but it certainly was not ethical to deny those people the right to escape death.

Three things. One, denying Jews, Poles, and Gypsys from fleeing the Holocaust was horribly immoral. But the blame for that falls squarely on the shoulders of every allied nation who turned away refugee ships. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the Holocaust is that the rest of the world did so very little for so very long.

Two: However: many of the land purchases, and the immigration waves, we are discussing happened either before or after the first world war, and before the onset of the holocaust. It must be noted, though, that pogroms in turn-of-the-century Russia caused many Jews to emigrate west, and eventually to Israel/Palestine. However, Jewish immigrants in 1915 can't really claim to have been escaping the pogroms of 1905.

Three: Lastly, the oppression of any group can never justify that groups oppression of another. Jewish immigrants to the land of Palestine expelled the indigenous population from land they had lived on for centuries. European Jews would be the targets of kidnapping, mass-murder, and slavery 10 years later does not justify that action; nor does it justify the continuation of that action today in the form of settlements on Arab land, the denial of clean water and medicine to Arab populations, and the control of transportation through and between Arab population centers.

&gt; But it does pull the rug out from under the argument that the Palestinians were their first.

No it doesn't. It just means that there were Jewish populations on that land. Just as there were Arabic (""Palestinian"") populations on that very same land. The issue is that Jewish immigrants came and displaced only the Arabic population; and when we talk about the land which that population had inhabited for centuries, they *were* there first.

&gt;If you want to call the Ottoman uncivilized, fine. But don't complain that the Jews dared to follow the laws set down by their oppressor. What would you prefer?

Seriously? You've got to be fucking kidding me; are you actually defending the Ottoman empire in one sentence, only to call them oppressors in the next? Are you trying to distract me from the issues by playing to my emotions, or by confusing me with ... awful rhetoric?

Anyway, what I would have preferred is this: that Jewish immigrants to the land that the British denoted ""Palestine"" had settled on unclaimed or empty land, rather than summarily displacing all the Arabs from the land they had inhabited for centuries.

&gt;How is it pretense and why the scare quotes around ownership?

It's pretense because ethically, while the Ottomans could sell that land, they could not sell the right to live on that land. Let's say the US government, by Eminent Domain, declared all of California to be public land, and sold it to China. Technically, the PRC then owns California, and can claim that legally they can force whomever they want off of that land. Ethically, however, they do not: and the reason is that in this hypothetical, Californians never voluntarily or by breach of contract (breaking the law, etc.) forfeited their right to inhabit that land; that right was simply revoked. In the same way, the Ottomans in selling that land revoked that very same right; except nobody but the possessor of a right can ethically waive that right.

That's why there are scare quotes around ownership. That it was ancestrally Arab land should have given the new Jewish owners pause as to evicting populations off of it; and that the inhabitants of that land had not voluntarily or by breach of contract waived their rights of habitation ought to have been enough to precipitate some kind of more humane solution.

This document is public, published in many places. The [Dept of State website](http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/64967.pdf) publishes an edition, the quoted data are page CRS-3

&gt; how come France has cheap electricity, when they are 4/5 nuclear powered?

(As a sidenote: I'm French and living in France, et connais assez bien la question)

Many countries have cheaper electricity with much less nuclear-produced. Think Greece, for example, IIRC cheapest one in Europe with no nuke plant (the Democritos reactor is tiny and only used for research). But such comparisons are difficult because in some contexts producing the needed 'amount' of grid electricity is more easy.

The pertinent fact is, here, that the French governments uses huge amounts of public money in order to help the nuclear industry and its customers (Areva, EDF...), hidding the real cost of the venture. Many [useless thingies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superph%C3%A9nix),  [promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Criticism)... each costing huge amounts of money... Even the rare sold projects often are [major failures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Pressurized_Reactor#Progress) paid for by our local Uncle Sam (often thru the [COFACE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coface))

And, again, we don't know about various costs: decommission, serious waste disposal, potential boo-boo...

Yes, you can make tons of cash working in trades such as plumbing, but some people are only in roles such as teacher, historian, actuary, engineer, researcher, etc. A degree is one way to measure your skill in the field of your interest, both for yourself and for potential employers.

Lots of people like to cherry-pick examples of a highschool drop out raking in millions, while a master's graduate is languishing, but the fact is, on average, degree holders make more than non-degree holders. Insurance companies too recognize the value of a degree and offer lower premiums to graduates. 

College is only as useful as you make it. Just as you can get through high school without learning all that, often you can do the same thing in college.

Yes, Jews did buy some land. Most notably in the north around modern-day Tel-Aviv. But the vast majority of it was captured by force during the ""war of independence"" (btw, care to tell me ""independence"" from whom exactly?)

[Check out some of what happened in 1948](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus) and the [list of Palestinian towns depopulated by invading Zionish forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_Al-Nakba).

More land (mainly Jerusalem and the West Bank) was captured in 1967 by force. This land was NOT bought and is still designated by the UN and the whole world as ""occupied territories"". It is illegal by internation law to build any civilian bases on them, yet Israel ignores all of this and built huge settlements that are still expanding to this day.

&gt; I bet you also think that America still belongs to the British, don't you!In all honesty, Britain has more of a claim on America than the Arabs have on Israel. And that's saying something.

Nope. I don't believe that since the British left America and recognized it as independent.

I have worked in several African countries (DRC, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, etc…). Invariably that is what I found – it is an inconvenient truth. Maybe it is not that way in West Africa, but I highly doubt it.

There is a reason why the AIDS prevalence in Africa is so high. It is not because of closely bonded monogamous relationships (like in the west).

Now for a bit closer to home:

You are either a white person living in that country (some who are with their heads in the clouds) or you are one of the black elites. I don’t think very highly of the black elites. Like DRC pricks who only speak French because they think they are better than the rest of the population and the others that send their kids to the best private schools in Europe or South Africa.

There really is no need for the EU to impose what people will do willingly. So yeah I'd like to see some EU wide response to issues like energy security, not hardwired into the core of the EU but agreed upon as a one time issue with no granted powers outside that needed to pursue the specific aims. This has been done several times in the past both with the development of the Eurofighter and nuclear power.

That for me is the major issue. The US didn't start off as it is today. The slow accretion of 'the issue of today' led to what was meant to be a set of interacting states turning into one large super power. Once given powers are rarely returned.

Ideally I'd like to see much of what has already been transferred to the EU (such as CAP) be redesigned not as a far reaching and eternal power but as something agreed by the nations on a finite and specific basis.

This would allow the EU to focus in on the issues it really needs to deal with like keeping trade open between the states and ensuring we don't allow American corporations to break our patent laws.

I personally think this is why Euroskepticism has blown up. Most of us would prefer to keep the EU core small but recognise a larger and dynamic European picture.

Mine was a general statement. I'm sorry it offended you.

Natives to the continent now known as North America were an extremely divided people with no singular name for anyone to use for all of them. They had no collective name for the continent since they, as individual civilizations or a collective one, had not advanced to the point where they knew that it was a large landmass and thus would give it a name to universally recognize it by in contrast to the names of other landmasses.

Things have names for reasons - So you can refer to them in one word without shit-tons of descriptors. It's the reason why we have an address system rather than what is used in some places (e.g. Dubai) of drawing a fucking map and using shit-tons of descriptors to find a place. You come up with names for things because it is a damned good idea for things to have names. Hell, Mormon is a derogatory term that some Mormons use for themselves because it is a name that is recognized, and thus serves the purpose of a name. Hell, a native American tribe is known as ""apache"", even though ""apache"" was just the word for ""enemy"" in the language of its neighboring tribes who interacted amicably (at the time) with the Europeans, who later became the dominating society of the area, taking that word along with it as the name for that tribe.

They don't have a term for themselves. Is that so hard to understand here? Cut the bleeding heart bullshit. Bad things happened in the past. Lets change the words for everything to defeat the purpose of language (which is the communication of ideas) just for the sake of political correctness. That will make everything better!

Wait: No, it won't.

Hey, I know! I don't like being called a caucasian! I'm not from Georgia or from anywhere in the caucuses! I should come up with my own fucking word just because I don't like the origin of the current one, *thus defeating the purpose of language just to be an oversensitive prick*.

They still have a very undemocratic regime, they still haven't come to terms with Tianmen Square, they still have to waste a lot of resources just to censor and control information.

Whilst I don't much like the situation in China, I think the above may be something of a western view (and I would apply the same to Iran now that I have managed to talk to a few Iranians).  We project our positions onto these places and sometimes get it very wrong (I should probably disclose that I spent 6 years living in Hong Kong so I like to think I have a handle on it to some degree).  But yes, China is a massive diverse place so anything could happen in theory, but then so is the US..

&gt;Then you have China's huge reliance on exports.

Indeed, this is an issue, although how big an issue it will be remains to be seen, much of what is coming out of China is either necessary (certainly their heavy manufacturing) or very much needed in economic terms to maintain our own GDPs in the US and EU.

&gt;Will the internal market be enough to offset the diminishing exports? I don't think so.

I think it probably will, mainly because Chinas exports diminishing would require massive retooling in places that simply cannot afford it, and even then they probably wouldn't be competitive without either isolationist moves or a masive collapse happening before hand.

&gt;Finally you have their aging population, a result of their one-child policy, and the situation is bound to get worse and the first generation of one-childers reaches adulthood.

That is far less of an issue in China than it is elsewhere though (and one that remains some way off) partly because life expectancy is still 5-10 years behind the US and EU and partly because there isn't the same 'retire at 60' mentality.  I don't think that China is likely to see that particular nightmare crop up for some time.

My apologies. I certainly was not trying to be insulting. However, I was also not saying that ""medieval European culture was essentially defunct and non-existent."" My point was simply that medieval Europe was not as educated and open-minded as Muslim Spain (and yes, religious tolerance only went so far in Muslim Spain, but it was still more tolerant - far more tolerant - than Charlemagne's Europe, even if ""only"" two other religions were allowed).

&gt;However smart, educated, and wealthy the elite literati are, there are a hundred people barely eking out a living for every one person who belongs to that upper class.

You are correct, but this was also true in non-Muslim Europe, no? - that there were ""a hundred people barely eking out a living for every one person who"" belonged to the upper class. My point is that the educated literati of Muslim Spain (and those who fled to Muslim Spain) were more learned, and had more knowledge at their disposal (thanks to trade fostered within the Muslim Empire), than their counterparts in Charlemagne's Europe.

And while the Muslim intellectuals were certainly more learned than their European counterparts, it had much more to do with, as you yourself said, having ""more  knowledge at their disposal.""  Had the Europeans been in possession of Aristotle's work, as well as dozens of other Greek thinkers, I hope that we would both agree that development would have been equal between the two.  The fact that Muslim intellectuals had access to these materials and the Europeans didn't made it impossible for the latter to come even close to Muslim advancement in these realms.  Had it been the other way around, we'd be having this conversation with ""Muslim"" and ""European"" switched.

I'd also like to add another possiblity: the encroachment of Islamic rule was threatening to the Europeans.  This seems like stating the obvious, I know, but if, let's say, the Chinese had done the same, conquered Spain as the Muslims did, we would have had a Chanson de Roland about the barbarous Asian peoples.  What I am trying to say (not very well, I know), is that the vilification of Muslims was a natural reaction to a very real territorial threat.  Yes, it is quite true that this grew out of control and has sullied relations between the West and the Muslim world for centuries, but we cannot say that the Europeans didn't have some sort of right to be upset, and frightened, for that matter.  The Muslims were a very real threat, exactly because they were so advanced.  If tomorrow the Moon were colonized by technologically superior aliens, we'd probably have the same reaction.

&gt; Even in the face of a black president your inability to identify nurture from nature is baffling.

Obama is not my “black president”.  (I lived permanently in Africa). You accuse white Americans of being bigoted (and responsible for all the ills of black people), yet if they were so bigoted, why did they vote for a black president?

&gt; I see you worked in South Africa...notice where ALL the search results are pointing you to?

I grew up in Zimbabwe and later southern Zambia. I have worked in S. Africa, Namibia, Zambia, DRC, Botswana and have visited Mozambique and a few other countries (basically worked in all Southern countries where there is mining).

Here are a few quotes from a study called “MAJOR TRENDS AFFECTING FAMILIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA” by Betty Bigombe and Gilbert M. Khadiagala

&gt; Another factor that is undermining kinship-based family structures is the prevalence of
single parenthood, particularly among young urban females. As increasing numbers of
women have joined the labor force, single and female-headed households have become a
discernible pattern on the African social landscape.

One thing I have not mentioned (that is a pretty significant social factor) is the rampant alcoholism in all the countries that I have been.

&gt; UK they have the HIGHEST rate of single parenthood in the whole of the industrialised world.

You are comparing apples and oranges. The UK has the highest rate of single parenthood ** in the whole of the industrialised world.** That is a nice exclusion of Africa. What is the benefit of comparing then? One industrial country should have the highest rate of single parenthood in the industrial world (someone has to lose). Yet it is probably 10 times lower than African countries.

&gt; Nope, can’t be that white people are prone to casual sexual encounters and sham marriages...

It is still a lot lower than in African countries. The AIDS prevalence rate in W. European countries is significantly lower than African countries. 

You are living in a dream world that is totally at odds with reality.

- The state employees don't give a shit. They are underpaid and bored. Many of them are incompetent but nobody fires them even if they kill patients because the State always protects its employees. In France they knowingly used HIV infected blood for transfusions ! 

- It's not cheaper in the first place and it becomes extremely expensive because of the corruption . Beside the money you pay on every paycheck (17% !!) one still has to bribe the doctors and nurses. No bribe - no treatment or just a watered down version of it. Even if you pay bribes, in many cases that doesn't solve your problems and you have to go to the private system for treatment and so you pay twice. 

- Huge bureaucracy eating up a lot of the funds. Even in USA the state run health care bureaucracy already eats up more than 1/3 of the budget and it's getting worse.

&gt;In 1969 administrative personnel accounted for 18.2% of the health care work force in the U.S. By 1999 administration's share had risen to 27.3% of total employees - a 50% increase. This figure excludes the 926,000 employees in life/health insurance firms, and 724,000 employed in insurance brokerages. Overall, at least 31.0% of health spending was devoted to administration in the U.S. in 1999.

http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php

- They use to refuse the patients (no beds available, no this, no that, it's not in your area - you have to go to the area specialists even if they're idiots - because the State says so) or simply because they don't feel like working. Many died in the ambulance being carried to 5-6 different hospitals. The state ambulances show up in an hour or two if you're lucky and they're always out of oxygen or something else. If there weren't private ambulances in here I would have died last October. As for those, it's true competition - the equivalent of 100 $ for anywhere to anywhere in a 2 million city.

- Our great Government, having financial difficulties a few years ago (too many tax exempts to their corporate friends) *took all the funds from the insurers* (even if that was illegal) and let the people die in hospitals from lack of funds for their treatment. 

- The state buys all the shit. The employees being corrupt they buy at outrageous prices from private firms (that also happens in USA) the result is that the patients have to buy their own treatment from the private market and bring it in the state run hospital. Or die if they don't have the money. 

- People in serious condition are refused while people who can be treated at home (but have money for bribes or know somebody in the system) are accepted.

- If you rely on that important matter on the state then you are dependent on the Govt. More power to the State to control you.

- You have dealt all your life with moronic state employees who don't give a shit or are happy to harass you. Do you really want to trust *them* with your life? 

IMO a private system *but with real free market and competition* (not like in the USA) is the best. BTW, the free competition in the USA was destroyed by the *State* through regulation in order to serve their Corporate donors.

Point at the living body in the hospitol saying 'see, he isn't dead, so I did not attempt to commit murder'... makes about as much as sense as this defense.

I do not agree with the actual resolutions of the EU in this matter though. I don't think they make sense at all. I think the debate should be: is one company allowed to be active in so many different markets? The answer should be: NO. The IE team should split out of Microsoft and so should the XBox team and the Office team.

In a more theoretical economic sense, a big corporation the size of Microsoft is very much like communism at the inside. The strong supporting the weak and the market mechanisms not correct distributing the resources. In the end the consumer is treated by such companies much like inhabitants of a communistic state: no freedom of choice. And yes, this applies to many many many more companies.

His actions showed intent.

This is at best myth, at worst propaganda.

The ""opinion poll"" the author refers to would have been, in fact, a referendum. Zelaya wanted the people to decide if he could convene a national assembly which would change the constitution.

Critics (pro-military-rule Hondurans) argue that the reason he wanted to change the Constitution was to allow himself a second term -- something the current Constitution prohibits. However, this is a bold-faced lie, preying on the ignorance of foreigners. In fact, his reasons for wanting to change the Constitution was that it didn't allow his country to progress out of poverty fast enough -- his goal is to emulate Bolivia in wrestling the country's wealth out of the hands of rich foreigners and back to the people -- *sooner rather than later*.

It is *not* true that he was seeking reelection. The timing of the referendum he was pushing for is key: in fact, this referendum would have taken place -- according to the Constitution -- *on the same day as the presidential election he's accused of wanting to run in*. His being president for a second term is therefore impossible.

As for sources to the above, you won't find anything in American media. I got this information from an article in *Le Monde Diplomatique* -- a respected French publication whose principal audience is diplomats. Here it is:

&gt; [Ce golpe a eu pour point de départ sa décision d’organiser ce même jour, appuyé par quatre cent mille signatures, une consultation populaire sans caractère contraignant posant la question suivante : « Etes-vous d’accord pour que, lors des élections générales de novembre 2009, soit installée une quatrième urne pour décider de la convocation d’une Assemblée nationale constituante destinée à élaborer une nouvelle Constitution politique ? »](http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2009-07-01-Honduras)

* find one or more flatmates as soon as possible and rent something together. For the beginning you might be able to just rent a room somewhere, not a whole flat

* London is full of job prospects. There are jobs for everything, have a look on the websites, they certainly seem amazing. If you are prepared to work on any job (i.e. not neccessairlly IT job) you will definitely find something

* if you like to drink or eat a lot when you go out then you might want to quit this habit

It was not just the collapse, the USSR under Gorbachev became more and more open and less willing to fund foreign experiments. Most white people in South Africa feared two related things – the first one was the “Rooi gevaar” (Red danger) – i.e. the threat of communism. This was a pretty real threat and the ANC/SACP got funded by the Soviet Union. Another was the “total onslaught”. 

So yes, Mandela was released before the Soviet Union collapsed – but the Soviet Union in 1990 wasn’t the Soviet union of 1980.

You should maybe understand South Africa’s economy. The biggest shock for South Africa was the oil sanctions from Iran after the Shah was deposed (in the 70ies or something). That started the creation of SASOL (that makes fuel from coal). South Africa’s economy under Voster had a large part of import substitution. 

Our major exports were commodities (like gold, iron, chromium) and the imports were low (due to not being so dependable on oil and having import substitution). Most commodities are simply exported through an intermediate country (i.e. sanction busting). As for imports, Israel and other countries did a fair share of sanction busting.

Just to show how ineffective sanctions was – S. Africa had a much higher GDP per capita than all other African countries – which did not have divestment campaigns or sanctions going.

The sanctions were also not blanket sanctions. Here is a quite from WP:

&gt; Between 1985 and 1987, U.S. imports from South Africa declined 35%, although the trend reverses in 1988 when imports increased by 15%. Between 1985 and 1998, U.S. exports to South Africa increased by 40%.

&gt; or the combined economic might of 99% of the Human Race?

Uhm… The USA only had limited sanctions (it is the largest economy in the world). And yes, you only need one unsanctioned country to bust sanctions.

&gt; It is obvious to all but you and other Reagan loving scum.

I did not even mention Reagan. It is clear that you have some issues you need to resolve.

My point is that political contributions are so small that you can't reliably correlate them with the will of the Canadian population. Minorities tend to band together more and fight harder for what they want because they haven't gotten it in so long. This totally explains the current Conservative situation Canadian Liberals simply take our Liberal values for granted.

Well Harper says our country is Liberal (he once called us a Northern European Nanny State, and he recently talked about how we as a country were getting more comfortable with small c conservative values). Americans would say our country is liberal as our Conservative party while being ideologically linked to the Republicans is forced to act like the Democrats to maintain its minority government. As well I mean Liberal in the ideological sense not specifically the liberal party. Every Canadian party other than the Conservatives is Liberal in an ideological sense. There was a vote trading website up that speculated there would be a Liberal minority government with the Conservatives in 3rd place after the NDP if Left Wing Canadians voted for the Left Wing party most likely to win in their riding instead of their specific left wing party. The Liberal party is also now ahead of conservatives in the polls even without vote trading. Recent elections also don't show Canadian ideology for a few reasons: 1. The Conservatives came to power because people voted against what they saw as a corrupt Liberal party; 2. As head of a minority government the Conservatives have been forced to act in most ways like the Liberals did anyway slowly trying to introduce us to Conservative values; 3. If you take into account that there are multiple Left Wing parties you see that even current elections show a majority of Left Wing support.

Actually Lincoln used slavery as a reason to enforce a to that point unseen federal power over the states. This was the first of many big tipping points toward federal control of power. Not that ending slavery was a bad thing, but in actuality it was more of a byproduct of what he was really working toward. Alot of why he gave the emancipation proclamation wasn't to free the slaves but rather to assuage European powers from supporting the South. Lincoln himself was actually a pretty staunch racist.

And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.

That figure didn't include all the unoccupied/For Lease commercial properties that *had* been occupied, but were then vacant. I moved to San Jose in '74 and *fled* in '93; apparently things only got worse, even though they FINALLY(!) fixed the fraking roads! The cost of living, the traffic and the outsourcing of jobs and industry were killing the area back then; I drove 13 miles to/from work in the mid eighties and it took 2:40 to 3 hours to get to work in the AM and 1:45 to 2.5 hours to get home in the PM. The only happy workers I knew were *hourly* swing shift and graveyard shift workers in waferfab! Everyone else was being crushed by the hours, the stress, the best &amp; most productive people being 'quitted' and the cost of living. At the end of the '80s I lived 5 miles from work in Santa Clara and it took over an hour to get to work! 
101, 237 and the 17/880 corridor were a nightmare, with 680 &amp; 280 not much better. I love the state; there's not much surfing, abalone diving, placer mining, whitewater, mountain climbing and snow skiing in Texas. The government of California is an example of how bad it *always* gets everywhere else after CA screws it up *first*. The people of Sillycon Valley are cold, ruthless, backstabbing users and the women are the worst. If you have an *expensive* german car, a leather jacket and heavy gold jewelry with nice casual or formal clothes, women will chase you across town, through traffic, to beg to suck your cock! I know that is hard to believe for most people, but I have experienced it many times. If you don't have an impressive job title and dress down for work, women will taunt and vilify you in public places merely for making brief eye contact; God help you if you smile at them, say hello, or ask them to pass the salt! I went into the Sunnyvale *TGI Friday's* on a Saturday night in 1987 to meet some people for dinner. I arrived early and went to the bar and took the only available chair, next to a moderately attractive young woman in formal evening attire (waaay overdressed for *Friday's*). There were over thirty men at the bar and a male bartender who were all watching me, but I couldn't order a drink. When I turned to the woman to ask if she was having any problems being served, she said ""Don't even talk to me unless you're a doctor or a lawyer!"" while avoiding eye contact. I was somewhat taken aback by such rudeness, but I'd seen this before. I was wearing designer jeans, an open collar shirt and a leather jacket, but I didn't wear jewelry because I worked with electronics systems and I wasn't wearing my old Swiss watch, just a Seiko diver's that had seen the bottom of Monterey Bay many times, so I wasn't *dressed to impress* by any means. I noticed the bartender and the guys at the other end of the bar were watching, pointing and having an animated discussion, so I twigged to why this was the only empty seat and everyone at my end had scooted their chairs away, leaving the overdressed sociopath slightly apart from everyone else. Thinking quickly, I said in my best 'parade ground' voice, ""I'm a Venture Capitalist and I wouldn't speak to you if you were the last *cunt* on the planet!"" and got up and went to stand at the other end of the bar. At least twenty guys all shouted ""YES!"" and started high-fiving each other and most of them started slapping me on the back, congratulating me like I had made a 3-pointer from half-court with one second on the clock and a dozen guys tried to buy me a beer, but the bartender who wouldn't wait on me gave me one and said ""It's on the house."" The red-faced woman was so humiliated by the outcry she left.
I only tell that as an illustration of what society was like in Silicon Valley from the mid-seventies until at least the early nineties when I left. I have lived all over the US and in Europe and I have *never* experienced anything like this anywhere else.

I spent the first half of the sumer studying law in the Netherlands and decided to meet a female friend of mine who was traveling through Europe in Brussels, Belgium for the weekend. Our first night there, we went out bar hopping. As the night wore on, and after we had downed several drinks already, we were enjoying some beers while sitting on a stoop in an a small side-street. We looked up to a second story window across form us and see a guy with his shirt off, putting on a bra, then a dress, and a wig. We look down and realize that there is a drag show going on in the bar in front of us. Without hesitation, we go inside.

It is a small place inside, no bigger than a bedroom, with a small bar, a small stage, and staircase up to the second floor. My friend is the only (biological) female in the bar, and we ended up having a pretty good time enjoying the ridiculous show. About 20 minutes into our arrival, she turned to me and said part-jokingly, ""I've got to piss, if I'm not back in 15 minutes call the police."" We both laughed and she walked off. Instead of checking to see if the bar has a bathroom, she decided, for whatever reason, to go *outside* and start walking around Brussels by herself without a cellphone at 3am in order to find some place with a bathroom. Meanwhile, I'm at the bar drinking some more, avoiding the hawkish glares of some of the guys there and politely turning down drinks that they had bought me. Uncomfortable, yes, but by far not the most frightening moment of my life. We'll get to that. 

Eventually, I checked my watch realized that she had not only been gone for 15 minutes, but almost an hour had gone by. I went upstairs to the bar's bathroom and it is empty, and she definitely is not downstairs. I dipped outside to see if she was smoking a cigarette, and she was nowhere to be found. This is when I started worrying. I'm thinking she's a goner for sure. I started imagining how I'm going to explain to her sobbing parents how I lost their daughter in Brussels while I was at a drag show at a gay bar. Talk about uncomfortable. 

I started walking circles around the surrounding blocks because I figured that she found a place to piss, and then couldn't find her way back. I walk and walk, asking people if they've seen someone who looks like Marilyn Monroe (she's a splitting image, and she was getting that *everywhere* we went, so it was my best shot). Of course, people just looked at me like I was from outer space and continued on their way. I tried to remain calm, but can't help picturing her dead body and the years of therapy that are in store for me. 

It's nearly 5am, and I am out of ideas. Do I go to the police? Do I keep searching until dawn? Exhausted, I sit on a cement planter on the side of a busy intersection. The bars had let out at 4 and there were still tons of people milling about and eating fries before hopping into taxis. I really didn't know what to do at this point. I lost my friend in a foreign country. I. Am. Fucked.

Suddenly, I heard the ear-piercing screech of tires as one car broadsides another in the intersection right in front of me. The car that got hit, which was going at full speed, was sent hurdling in my direction. At this point, time slows down. I vividly remember my eyes locking on to eyes of the driver and his eyes locked on to mine. He is screaming. He has no control over his car and it is barreling straight toward me. I dove to my right, airborne and completely horizontal, and slid across the sidewalk as the car slammed head-on with the cement planter, totaling the car. The front was flattened like an aluminum can. A hubcap skipped past me down the sidewalk. 

I rolled over, and sat there, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. A dozen or so people ran up to the car to help the driver. He was smart enough wear a seat belt but still got hurt pretty badly. I stood up and brushed myself off. Besides a few scrapes on my arms and elbows, I was in good shape. A few people ran up to me, but were only speaking in French and Dutch, and managed to explain that I was OK. 

After somehow living through that whole mess, I said to myself, ""Fuck this shit, I'm going home."" I hailed a taxi and took it back to the hostel. By the time I got back, the shock had worn off. I was really sore and back to worrying about my MIA friend. That walk down the hallway to our room seemed like the longest part of the night, because I knew that I had failed. I set the alarm on my phone for two hours later so I could go to the police and file a missing persons report. I made a note to look up the number for the U.S. Embassy. I stood in front of the door for a moment, still trying to figure out how a fun night out took such a turn for the worse. I opened the door to find my friend passed out and snoring loudly in her bed.

Presidents Obama and Medvedev are due to meet on Monday 6 to 8th July.

The letter was coordinated by PND Nuclear Flashpoints John Hallam, who together with the Association of World Citizens Doug Mattern, and nuclear weapons expert Steven Starr, coordinated an appeal by 44 nobel prizewinners that resulted in resolutions in the UN General Assembly in 2007 and 2008 calling for nuclear weapons to be taken off quick - launch status. (Mr Steven Starr, now scientific adviser to Physicians for Social Responsibility will be speaking on Hiroshima Day (6Aug) in Sydney)

According to Mr Hallam:
“When Presidents Obama and Medvedev meet on Monday, President Obama will have an opportunity to make good on his election promise to negotiate with Russia to take US and Russian nuclear weapons off high - alert, a step that will quite literally ‘take the apocalypse off the agenda’. There are still roughly 2000 nuclear weapons in the 23,000 nuclear weapons still held by the US and Russia, that are able to be launched in less than two minutes. The launch of these weapons would, still, terminate civilisation and possibly end the human race. High-level bodies from the 1996 Canberra Commission to the 2006 Blix Commission, and more recently the editorials by Henry Kissinger and others have recommended that nuclear weapons be removed from a status in which they can be quickly launched. Obama has promised to do so. Now is a good time to make good on that promise.”

The letter has been signed by major disarmament organisations and parliamentarians worldwide, starting with the Mayor of Hiroshima on behalf of Mayors for Peace representing over 3000 cities and towns worldwide, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (1985 nobel peace prize recipient), International Peace Bureau, the Association of World Citizens, the World Federation of United Nations Associations, the International Association of Peace Messenger Cities, and the vice-resident of the European Parliament, MEP Luisa Morgantini.

LETTER BY ORGANISATIONS WORLDWIDE TO OBAMA, MEDVEDEV, PUTIN, BIDEN, LAVROV AND CLINTON ON OPERATING STATUS OF NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS
PRESIDENT BARACK HUSEIN OBAMA
VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR,
PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV
PRIME MINISTER VLADIMIR PUTIN
FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI LAVROV
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
US SENATE COMMITTEES ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ARMED SERVICES,
RUSSIAN DUMA COMMITTEES ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE,

RE: OPERATIONAL READINESS OF NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS

Dear Presidents Obama and Medvedev, Vice-President Joseph Biden, Prime Minister Putin, Secretary of State Clinton, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and Congressional and Duma Committees on Foreign Affairs and Defense/Armed Services:

The authors of this letter write also as the joint coordinators of an appeal to lower nuclear weapons operating status/operational readiness that was signed by 44 Nobel Prize - winners and which helped lead to resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly in October 2007 and 2008. (see appendix for UN Resolutions)

This letter is signed by NGOs and distinguished individuals from around the world who believe that nuclear disarmament is a matter of urgency, and that taking nuclear weapons off quick-launch capability is a vital first step toward nuclear disarmament.

We suggest that the current negotiations between the US and Russia over a successor to START be also used as forum in which the US and Russia negotiate an agreement to cease maintaining their large nuclear forces in quick-launch status.

We are very much encouraged by the repeated committments made by President Obama to negotiate with Russia to lower the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, as well as by the statements to that effect to which Dr. Henry Kissinger has lent his name, as well as by his involvement in a successor to START.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, in a September, 2008 article entitled ‘Avoiding Human Extinction’, placed the lowering of the operational status of nuclear weapon systems, reductions in warhead numbers, and the complete abolition of nuclear weapons at the top of a list of measures needed to protect humankind, ahead even of climate change mitigation measures and monitoring of large incoming asteroids.

U.S. scientists now predict, with a high level of certainty, that:

(1) the detonation in urban areas of as little as a half of one percent of the explosive power contained in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals could cause major disruptions in global climate leading to the starvation of hundreds of millions of the already hungry, and;

(2) A war fought with even a few thousand strategic nuclear weapons, such as the U.S.-Russian weapons now maintained at high-alert status, would cause such cataclysmic changes in global climate and environment that growing seasons would be completely eliminated for years, thus dooming most of humanity to perish from famine.

It is unrealistic to assume that nuclear deterrence will work perfectly forever. With the passage of time, the use of nuclear weaponry, due to madness, malice, miscalculation, or malfunction becomes an inevitability. Thus it is imperative that as a first step towards reducing and eliminating the immense danger these weapons pose to all nations and peoples, that the U.S. and Russia agree to remove their nuclear weapons from high-alert status.

We urge the US and Russian governments, Presidents Obama and Medvedev, Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Ivanov, to use the opportunity of the renegotiation/replacement of START to negotiate to immediately lower the operational readiness of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapon systems. This single act will do more than any other immediately available measure to make humanity and civilisation secure in accordance with our shared objective of progress towards the abolition of nuclear weapons.

Categorical oppression has been a multi-directional thing throughout history and it continues to be so. Anyone with some historical education in this should not be too surprised. 

The truth is that America is one of the few countries in the world to ever address its racism formally, as a problem. In many parts of the world, racism isn't even considered racism, it's just *the way things are* It's ironic that America seems so plagued by racism. In reality it is largely more tolerant than many places, but it's also more mixed than many places, and its history of slavery is a legacy not easily set aside. But at the same time, other countries operate fully formed caste systems to this day, while the US has had a constitutional amendment franchising all races for over 120 years. 

Gay rights are far down the totem pole in terms of whose oppression gets addressed first. The historic order of things has been 1) racial issues 2) gender issues 3) what else do you want? reverse racism, blah blah quack quack. 

The fact that there is a national debate about gay issues is fantastic. I know it's been several decades since Stonewall, and people are right to demand full equality for gays and to demand it now. But the fact that it's being discussed at all is a sign that we're deep into #3, and that's a good thing for the US. I'm not settling for crumbs here, I'm just noting that the arc of history is long, and it continues to move in a good direction for gays.

Racism is prevalent in many places around the world, but homophobia is so ubiquitous it's hard to even describe it as ""institutionalized."" Something that's never talked about, is taken for granted, and is just THERE can hardly be called institutionalized, except perhaps in an unconscious way. Fucking think about it: what is it like to be gay in China, India, Morocco, Chile, Kenya, Saudi Arabia? I'm not trying to pick on these places. I really mean it: think about gay rights around the world. Europe is pretty liberal. Thailand is uniquely so. I am sure some spots in South America are better than others. But show me the list of these countries who recognize gay marriages on the federal level. It's short. 

The freedoms that gays enjoy already in the US are quite liberal by standards held around the world. My father is from the middle east and thought for most of his life that homosexuality was a mental disorder. He told me about the scant few homosexuals he ever knew of growing up in Damascus, and they were all 1) drug addicts 2) fuckups or outright criminals 3) genuinely mentally ill from the sound of the stories. 

I realized that gays in that part of the world must be so far underground that only the unstable ones ever let it slip. Everyone is engaged in an elaborate societal lie, and only those already unhinged from society in some way are reckless enough to show their colors. Naturally, if only the only gay people you ever knew were criminals or druggies, you'd think it was a fucked up way to be too. And this is the self-reinforcing cycle of the closet. Only the looney ones tell. However, I also eventually realized that this is only half the story.

The other half is a story many of us know. There's someone in your life who you think is gay, but you aren't sure and they don't tell you they are. You might like some of these people a whole lot. They might be your boss, your neighbor. They could be some of the nicest, coolest people you know. There's just something a little bit off about them, which you only sometimes notice. You hope it's nothing. You speculate about it with your friends or your spouse. ""I bet he's gay,"" but you don't actually know. 

This happens in the unfriendly parts of the world, too, even though the smart gays there remain thoroughly, completely closeted. They may even be sexually active, but they have hetero marriages, and never ever let on. Their lives may well depend on that. 

Their sexual identity is been compressed into a small box labeled ""what I like in the bedroom,"" which, after all, is quite private for most of us. So why not private for them, too? Is it so bad to be closeted, they'd ask? Watch Milk. You'll find even he was asking that same question well into his 40s. 

Those who supported Prop 8 simply wanted this historic ""don't ask, don't tell"" arrangement to continue. And, in some twisted defense of them, I will point out that ""don't ask/tell"" has been the norm for a long time.They don't really want to eliminate homosexuality; they know it's always been there. They just want it out of sight. For untold generations, gays have supported this arrangement too, because it was all they had or could imagine. 

Prop 8 supporters already feel like they are compromising by allowing gays to exist. I believe their thought process - AT BEST - goes something like this:

""Hmm. You live across the street from me. I have that funny feeling about you, I think you're gay, because of the way you dress and the way you keep your yard. And yet I would like to point out that, to my credit, I haven't firebombed your house or taught my children to hate you. But now you want me to get up, get out of my house, and vote in favor of your bald and naked right to be recognized by the federal government?? I beg your pardon, but that's too much. I'm already tolerating you. I'm in fact a lot more liberal with you than my parents' generation. Now learn your place. You're going too far.""

Of course, this is a two-front battle. Obviously, closeted gays are in a completely deluded and self-defeating position. Far from ""what I like in the bedroom,"" one's sexual identity is who you are, who you love, how you live. There is no valid way to put this under wraps and carry on as if you're the same as everyone else. To do so is to surrender one's individuality to society to an extreme degree. You might as well be living in North Korea and worshiping Great Leader while you live on grubs you dug up from under the peat. I don't give a shit if you moved to San Francisco and have a nice apartment. You're still a second class citizen. And from what I've seen, a lot of folks are all too willing to live with that. 

I really don't know what excuse blacks and hispanics have for failing to support the civil rights of gay people. My angry side would like to say that they clearly don't deserve their own hard-won rights if they're willing to deny them to others. But it takes me back to the priority order. 

Remember? It's 1) race 2) gender 3) maybe other stuff. Women know damn well what it feels like to see a civil rights movement succeed, but then be left out of the warm afterglow. Black men got the vote in America 50 years before women. That's right! Look it up. 15th and 19th amendments, folks. It seems bizarre, but it's true. Ex-slaves could vote in America before white women from good families. 50 fucking years before. Goddamn 1870. It was 1920 before women got the vote!

It's worth noting that gays can vote. And barring a few draconian municipal statutes in various hellholes around the country, it's not actually illegal to be gay. The frontiers of gay issues these days are military service and marriage, not mere survival, not human rights but civic rights - and only certain ones at that. I don't mean to diminish the marriage cause - I support it completely. I'm just guessing at why some of my gay friends don't really seem to care much about it. 

My own wedding was two weeks ago, in California, and I was sure to address the guests and ask everyone to support marriage equality. We specially chose a church that was friendly to GLBT folks. My lovely bride, whom everyone loves happens to be a different race than myself, and interracial marriage was illegal in some states until 1967, for fuck's sake. My brother was born that year! I knew I had some folks in the crowd who were not that comfy with gays, but given that we had 1/2 the room full of chinese people looking over at the other 1/2 full of syrians, I thought it was the right comparison to make.

I'm sure it is. It's not expensive to drop a mass-produced V8 into an engine bay, but you're missing the point I was trying to make.

Petrol is much more expensive in Europe. To keep a car like yours on the road over here for every day use would cost you a small fortune both in fuel costs and tax (we're a lot stricter about emissions, CO2, Kyoto etc.).

If you *were* in a position here to be able to spend that kind of money on daily basis on fuel etc. then it's most likely you are in a higher income bracket than many others. People in this particular bracket in Europe tend *not* to drive American muscle. If they want to go fast, they can afford the M5/M6's, the RS4/RS6's, the AMG-tuned Mercs. They would much rather been seen in one of these than a Chevy.

The difference being, people will look at a 23K Chevy and see it as an unrefined tractor used to carry a fat person (or indeed group of fat people) around in. Doesn't matter what's under the bonnet. It's American, they're going to assume it sucks.

That's just the perception. I don't know how to explain it any better.

They'll see a BMW/Merc/Lexus a superior, slick, autobahn cruiser full of cutting-edge technology, comfort and power.

I'm not trying to be patronizing here, but do you get the point I'm trying to make?

Europeans (and a heck of a lot of Japanese) will *always* opt for a German/Japanese brand over an American brand in this particular market. Always.

In your equivalent segment (32K US = about 23K EUR), if people want speed they'll go for something small, light and tuned like an R32 Golf, Impreza, Evo, Mazda RX-8, Lotus Exige, Type R Civic, VXR Vauxhall, Focus RS/ST or a RenaultSport Megane (of which I am the a proud owner). Much cheaper to keep on the road, doesn't weigh a metric fuck-tonne, and can actually go around corners.

Jap imports are very big in the UK and Ireland as the cars are specced pretty much the exact same in both countries. You'll see a lot of Skylines, 350Z/Fairladys, Imprezas, B4 Legacys and Evo's on the roads over here.

The nearest thing you'll see to an American car will be the odd Chrysler Crossfire or a Hummer (painted pink)  used for tongue-in-cheek, novelty purposes by a taxi company.

It's just a different market here, different attitude.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to drive to work every day in 500+ BHP Corvette. I could probably afford to buy the car. I couldn't afford EUR 150 it would consume in petrol every week. Or the tax. Or the insurance. Or the broken neck I would experience when it encounters a bend in the road.

Yes.  To my mind, the early paragraphs of the document, particularly the first line of the first table, make an iron clad case that the job cannot be done, in some sense.  It cannot be done without making some arbitrary decisions.  The goal then is to make the algorithm pas the test of least surprise.

&gt; I don't see how asking for an all-ascii version of peoples' names is going to help you. Even if you convince them to go to the trouble, an all-ascii key doesn't resolve the question of how to sort names that end up identical (Mônica and Mónica, two Portuguese names, for instance).

The idea of all-ascii is that there is no argument about collation, and that folks on the net in my experience understand it (I do deal mostly with people using European alphabets).  

As to identical names, I don't know what to say -- how does a person alphabetize two Mike Brown's?  (Of course, there is a difference between two names that start identical and two names that hash the same, but I happen not to see that in the data I have.)

Even if you stopped the US FMS and FMA, Israel will manage.  The impact will be higher unemployment in Israel and US.

The PA economy is totally dependent on UN, US, EU and Israeli handouts, it will fall off the cliff.  So it is undeniable that the people on **both** sides will be hurt *but* the Palestineans will have to change their behavior first, hopefully towards ending the conflict and not starting a new one.  Witness the fact that Hamas is not lobing rockets into Israel anymore; there is an economic impact there.  Until there is an economic benefit for the Palestineans leadership to wait and do **nothing about the end of the conflict**, they will be perfectly OK with waiting and oppressing their people 

THE UNCONVENIENT TRUTH IS, of course, that nothing more can be done on the part of Israel. Unintentionally, Olmert took the veil of moderation off the face of the PLO. When the claim is raised that the PLO would actually suffice itself with a symbolic gesture concerning the thorny refugee issue, its refusal to accept Olmert's proposals proves that the PLO truly intends to apply the ""right of return"" of refugees to their original homes in Haifa and in Jaffa, in Lod and Beersheba. PLO leader Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) explained lately to Haaretz that ""it's not fair to demand that we recognize you [Israel] as the state of the Jewish people because that means... a predetermination of the refugees' future, before the negotiations are over. Our refusal is adamant."" To prevent misunderstanding, Mahmoud Abbas, in his Washington Post interview, rejected the possibility that the PLO recognizes Israel as a Jewish state because it would imply renunciation of any large-scale resettlement of refugees.

The real dispute does not concern the natural growth of Ariel but the natural right of the Jewish people to sovereignty in Carmiel (in the Galilee).

THIS IS not a futile theological debate but a practical and vital issue. Its severe significance was proven last year, when in the course of talks PLO negotiators were explicitly asked whether, after an agreement is reached to their satisfaction, they would agree to include in it a specific article stating that this puts an end to the dispute and terminates all further claims. The Israeli government did not bring to the public's attention the fact that to this simple question, the PLO leadership ominously answered in the negative.

The necessary conclusion therefore is that the moderate organization for the liberation of Palestine from Jewish sovereignty is not interested in the ""two- state solution"" but rather in a ""two-stage solution."" In the first stage, an Arab state is to be established alongside Israel and in the second stage, following the resettlement of refugees within Israel, one Arab state is to be established, stretching from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean Sea.

In an attempt to test this conclusion to the utmost and to refute it, Israeli governments have resorted to all possible political experiments. All excuses have by now been used up. In other words, as a mechanism for establishing permanent peace west of the Jordan River, the ""two-state solution"" cannot be realized. There will be no end to this dismal hundred-years dispute so long as the position of the Palestinian leadership does not fundamentally change.

There are a few reasons for that.  There's an old joke: ""Only the Jews would be unlucky enough to claim the one sliver of land in the Middle East without a drop of oil.""

Taking the joke more seriously than was intended for a moment, it does seem like Israel wasn't particularly lucky in that regard.  However, *because* Israel has never been able to depend on easy oil money in the way some other Middle Eastern countries have, Israel was forced to diversify its economy early on to be successful.  Most of the other Arab nations adopted a more socialist model fueled by oil revenues, leading everyone to wonder what will happen to them when their oil runs out (and it will).

Then there are historical reasons.  During the cold war, there was a short-lived movement in the Middle East and parts of North Africa called ""Pan-Arab Socialism"".  The Baath party (which doesn't seem very socialist today) was born out of this movement, and it took control in Iraq and Syria.  Qaddafi in Libya supported it, as did many other influential Arab leaders.  The socialist aspect meant diplomatic and economic support from the Soviet Union, which may have been beneficial at the time but meant, in the long term, that much of the Middle East chose ""the wrong side"" in the cold war.

Israel played the cold war in a much smarter way.  On one hand, early Israel was very much a socialist experiment, based on communal farming (kibbutzim) and housing many leftist intellectuals of the period.  Its relationship with the Soviet Union was thus not ideologically stretched, and furthermore the USSR has always taken pride in its involvement in the deposition of Nazi Germany, making supporting (or at least not opposing) Israel something it was relatively happy to do.

At the same time, Israel courted the west, positioning itself as the only thriving democracy in the Middle East other than Turkey.  Many nations, who were horrified by what had been done to the Jews during the Holocaust, saw supporting Israel as a way of making amends (that Zionism had had little support among Jews in pre-Holocaust Europe was something of an irrelevant side-issue).

So basically, you have a recipe for success: a lot of smart people in a small nation, receiving financial and diplomatic support from all sides, and at the same time (due to lack of oil) being forced to diversify economically.

For the Arab nations, well, Pan-Arab Socialism fell apart, the Soviet Union collapsed, and most of them have economies that are entirely dependent on oil, which everyone knows is running out.  Lots of them have been left with fairly despotic regimes that are at the same time not economically savvy.

And then there's Lebanon, which used to be a beautiful and dynamic nation but has been ravaged by war with guess who for the last 40 years or so, on and off.",0,808140,t1_c0auezn,0,,True,True

&gt; False dichotomy.

I think not, see below

&gt; You're wrong about the plants not being tested, countries other than the US have built newer plants.

Much less during the last 20 years than in the decade before. Moreover thinking that practical (applied) experience gained in other countries will benefit to the US may be difficult to prove... In theory the nuclear industry tries so, but in practice secrecy, lazyness and commercial competition often have the last non-word.

&gt; Generation IV plants are far better in terms of maintenance, design, efficiency

Before the Three Mile Island accident, nearly every expert professed that there will be absolutely no problem, that the design was ultra-secure, that nothing could go wrong (TMI was not a major disaster only by sheer luck, nothing went as planned). In Soviet's newspapers the nuclear powerplants were, prior to the Chernobyl disaster, presented as secure to the point of being potentially installable on the Red Square floor.

&gt; A closer analogy might be: ""would you rather drive across the desert with the best car from the 1980s, or the best car available today?""

Well, I may not have clearly stated that I was thinking of plants DESIGNS, not buildings (instances)! I mean: a proven design is often more secure than a new one. When it comes to critical material most experts prefer it.

Moreover the new nuclearplants designs (gen 3+ and 4) are barely revolutions, in my opinion showing that the guys behind the drawing board also know that a too innovative design may have some hidden major quirk waiting to hit.

Even this approach is not perfect, for example the very first [EPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Pressurized_Reactor), generation 3+, was already sold to Finland when experts commissioned by the customer discovered a major design problem (see Nucleonics Week ; march 11, 2004): some ""sump strainer clogging"" may prevent the ""core catcher"", a thingie designed to protect the reactor during a steam explosion, to work properly. In fact the design error could transform the protective device into a booster for a steam explosion threatening the reactor.

That honestly wasn't my intent.  I merely meant to explain why so many atheists go into these debates with the implied notion of superiority and, perhaps, hubris as a result.  In my own experience, the most likely person to debate me is likely to have stopped at High School.  The higher you go in education, especially in the hard sciences where I ended up, the fewer believers you run into.

Occasionally I run into a believer I can learn something from and I try my best to keep my mind open to that experience, but after refuting the same arguments, day after day after day, it gets hard to see the flowers for the weeds.  I'm sure you can say the same.

&gt; I can believe that God guided and inspired the decisions made by the Council without getting too worked up over the fact that humans were involved -- just as humans were involved in writing down, then recopying and translating, each of the books in my Bible.

Then you have rationalized something I could not.  Claiming the Bible as word of God, inerrant or not, when so many fallible humans have put their input into it always rang hollow with me, especially with so many clear examples of gods and goddesses in our past that have risen, lived and died, entirely within the human experience.  I've read too much history to look past the fact that at one time Rome was in its ascendancy and they felt Minerva was going to last forever.  Same thing with the Greeks and Apollo.  Our Christianity based society is in its ascendancy, but the cracks are already beginning to show, so I feel that while you and I might not experience it, our descendants will get to see Yahweh his the scrap heap with all those other deities.  That is the human pattern, after all.  If Yahweh were to be the one god that stuck it out, it would truly be a first for mankind.  

Up here in Canada, for example, we've gone from 72% church attendance in the pre-Boomers to 17% church attendance in Gen Y.  All five generations on the go up here will be dead and buried in 100 years.  Halfway through that point, our major churches will be empty and bankrupt unless that trend gets blunted or reversed.  By the end of it, they will be lucky to even exist.  That pattern is replicating itself all over western Europe, to a lesser or greater extent.  In a lot of ways, the US will be one of the only truly Christian nations in a decade or two and even it is showing signs of fading at a much slower rate.

&gt; I agree it is difficult to reconcile ""picking and choosing."" For me, it is purely a matter of starting from a premise of a just and loving God, then reading the Bible in that light.

I agree wholeheartedly.  I can admire and respect the stance you've chosen, too.  All the same, if most Christians approached their religion with the wherewithal to see as you have, I don't think the pendulum would be swinging as far back the other way as it seems to be.  You wouldn't need atheist activitism if there wasn't Christian bigotry to butt up against, would you?

But you're right -- that may be the way America *is*, but that doesn't mean that that's how it *must* be.  And really, it is precisely American unwillingness to depend on public transportation that holds its development back.  Large American cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco have public transportation infrastructure that people actually prefer to use over driving their cars, and the quality of public transportation in even small European cities puts American public transport anywhere to shame.  So clearly good public transportation is *possible*.

There are reasons for European superiority on the public transportation front.  One is that European cities, by virtue of their higher density (due to having been built largely before the invention of the automobile) are tremendously inconvenient to drive in.  Another is that European countries charge tremendously high taxes on gasoline and other automotive services, making owning and operating a car much more expensive than in the US.  Yet another is that unlike in the US, zoning ordinances don't prevent commercial buildings (such as supermarkets) from being in the same place as residential buildings, meaning you're much more likely to be able to find a shop that isn't attached to a gas station within walking distance.  Europeans also aren't philosophically opposed to government-provided services in the way that most Americans are.

New York and San Francisco manage to make driving inconvenient in a less state-directed way than their European counterparts, but with similar results: there are lots of people in a relatively small area, and so parking is expensive because demand is high; both cities were built on limited land space (Manhattan is an island, and SF is built on the tip of a peninsula) which reinforce their population densities.  The end result?  Just like in Europe, driving is expensive and, even if you can afford it, annoying.  Result: high demand for quality public transport.

Most American cities, in contrast, were built after the introduction of the automobile (or experienced most of their growth then, resulting in sprawling distances designed for drivers rather than pedestrians), are zoned in such a way that guarantees that your home will be *at a minimum* 15 minutes drive from the closest supermarket, are dotted with parking lots (just look at downtown Anchorage on Google Maps' satellite view to see the typical ratio of buildings to parking lots) which increases distances between buildings all while making driving more convenient -- in short, they're just optimized for private car use.

Really, there are a few things I see as necessary when it comes to spurring the adoption of public transportation in mainstream American cities:

1. Relax zoning requirements, allowing commercial and residential areas to mingle.  Expect a lot of NIMBY foot dragging from suburbanites.

2. Widen sidewalks in downtown areas after removing curbside parking.  This will decrease parking supply and drive the cost of private parking up.  Of course, it also means that the local city government will lose parking meter revenue.  Expect resistance.

3. Tax parking garages and parking lot companies through the nose, to increase the opportunity cost of owning and operating such establishments.  This will be offset by the rising profitability of operating such garages (due to step 2), so this will probably need to be aggressive.

4. Massive investment in public transportation.  This costs money and most cities are broke right now, but it would need to be done.

5. Closely related to step 4: cities need to recognize that the role of public transportation, like public libraries and public roads, is not to be profitable, but to provide a public service.  If the system can be profitable, that's good -- but many public transportation projects have routes cut and schedules reduced to nothing because of (short term) profitability concerns.  Remember, in the long term, if more people are using public transportation, profitability will improve (from increased ticket sales), and increased usage will also spur economic investment from the private sector along route lines, creating an avalanche effect.  It's like building a road to a small town: the increased traffic makes the town grow and causes shops to open up along the road (which wouldn't have done so otherwise), and those new shops bring more traffic, etc.

5. Other taxes or costs can and should be levied on car users, but these should be introduced slowly and only when viable alternative public transportation infrastructure exists, or you risk introducing a regressive tax scheme that will hurt the poor most, which is (ideally) not what you're trying to do.

Life is just easier for rich people, or people in power (or close to it), in all aspects. To try to counter that from the angle of whatever kind of discrimination misses the point completely. It just breeds resentment.

The only kind of discrimination and prejudice that is demonstrably real, and not just the ideological interpretation of some sociological phenotype, is a host of [cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) that are pervasive in *human nature* and end up leading to all kinds of imbalances when present in a complex social setting. 

For example, by now it is known that taller men with the best hair, posture, booming voice and chiseled face are more likely to reach positions of power. That's not **THE PATRIARCHY** – they get the job at the expense of more qualified but less ""powerful looking"" *men* as well. It's a bias in human perception. Those *characteristics* innately convey ""security"", and we want to feel safe in our leadership. 

Research has shown that [parents are more protective of good looking offspring](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/health/03ugly.html) even though ""there's absolutely no evolutionary reason for parents to invest less in ugly kids"". ""Beautyism"" or perception bias in human nature?

And part of why white men continue to earn 25 percent more than equally well performing women and minorities is that managers and business owners must pay a premium for white male employees because [customers prefer them](http://www.wisbusiness.com/index.iml?Article=160610). That includes people of all colors and genders. Again, the leadership bias seems to kick in. Racism and sexism or perception bias in human nature?

When you start to delve into cognitive research, you learn there are *tons* of examples like that. Some anthropologists posit those biases might have even contributed for the global domination of the European people – accounts of white explorers being treated as gods by the natives are not uncommon. They are as recent as [1930s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frum) and [1950s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip_Movement).  ""Self-racism"" or perception bias in human nature?

Amongst UFO enthusiasts who believe there are alien races taking active interest in Earth and humanity, the ""good"" race are the [Pleiadeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiadeans), or ""Nordic"" aliens: very white, very tall, very blond, very beautiful. The bad ones are the Greys, who are the physical opposite of everything the Pleiadeans are. Racism or perception bias in human nature?

And it might even go farther than just perception bias. Sperm banks do not accept donations from men standing under 5' 11"" in height because the women who use that service are not interested in them. [Why are these father-cleansing feminists choosing to ""mate"" with a stereotypically patriarchal symbol of physical dominance?](http://www.nationalpost.com/todays-paper/story.html?id=1702952). Apart from the fact that their tall offspring will cash in on a couple of those bias mentioned above, height, or bigger size, is a physical trait that demonstrably confers [evolutionary advantages](http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_12755749).

I hope it's now easier for you to see how misguided approaching the issue of inequality from the angle of whatever form of discrimination really is. That was an interpretation derived from the Marxist ideology that put everything in terms of simplistic clash of social classes in the quest for power. It reads like a Tolkien book. It's an idea *everyone* can grasp, since it puts problems in terms of a simple fight between good and evil (with both sides thinking they're battling evil), and thus [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) easily kicks in. If Marxism had appeared before the germ theory of disease were fully consolidated, we would think of diseases in terms of clash of classes - us fighting the germs for *power*. No wonder it became so popular. But it's not standing up to scientific scrutiny. It was devised before science even started to study social phenomena objectively.

And if the problem *were* the kind of discrimination people like to think it is, you cannot solve a problem with the same thinking that caused it in the first place – using reverse discrimination to counter discrimination. That might improve the quality of life of the select few who get to be carefully placed here and there to give the impression of social justice, but, in the long term, society-wide, it just fosters discrimination, inequalities and resentment.",0,[deleted],t1_c0auny7,0,,True,True

My wife, an American-born Jew (as am I), lived in Israel for three years in the 1970s before permanently returning to the States.  As a result we have a number of friends (some are Sabras, while others emigrated in the '60s and '70s. mostly from the U.S. and Western Europe), all of whom are moderates or left-wing liberals -- which matches our personal politics as well.  To a person they are appalled at the hatred that comes out of the religious right wing, which only seems to be getting worse.  Sadly, that voice is given greater credence due to the nature of the Israeli parliamentary system, which forces middle-of-the-road political parties to lurch rightward in order to capture enough votes to rule.

It seems as if the very nature of ""left"" versus ""right,"" no matter what nation you examine, is defined thusly: Leftists are always fragmented and thereby offer little opportunity to form coalitions, while rightists usually operate in lockstep and therefore present a more unified voting bloc.

I'd like to think that a more moderate Israeli voice may yet rise above the fray and capture the imagination of the population, much the way Obama has done in the States (despite his too-much-like-Bush pronouncements in certain areas).

Really, even if you deflect 'almost every arrow shot at you', which I highly doubt, you haven't got many kills, based off the amount of headshots, especially if you're actually aiming them. The arrow has such a big hit-area that it has probably a 20% chance of hitting the head, and a 80% chance of hitting the body, if you fire it in someones general direction without too much aim. If you hit 4 headshots, the most we can really expect is between 20 and 30 bodyshots.

&gt; In Honduras something similar happened. The impeachment process against ex-President José Manuel Zelaya started a week before he was deposed, soon after he triggered an institutional crisis by repeatedly violating the Constitution and challenging judicial decisions issued by the Congress of that Central-American nation. 

&gt; Zelaya was already moving toward despotism in 2008 as his relation with Hugo Chaves became closer. He began to execute the methodology of a gradual coup d‚État that had already been exported by the Venezuela president to several Latin American republics. This system included persecution of the free media and implementation of an illegal procedure to change the Constitution in order to keep himself in power. 

&gt; The fuse that set off the crisis was Zelaya's plan to hold a popular referendum last Sunday, June 28, that called for a vote on the dissolving of Congress and the installation of a Constituent Assembly to allow for his presidential reelection. 

&gt; Even though the Supreme Electoral Court of Honduras considered the referendum unconstitutional, Zelaya ordered the Army to distribute 15,000 ballot-boxes for the referendum. This order was not obeyed by the military since it violated the sentence of the due authority. 

&gt; Next, José Manuel Zelaya dismissed the military Commander, General Romeo Vasquez. In response, the Supreme Court commanded Vasquez to be reinstated in his functions and the ballot-boxes to be kept inside the military headquarters. Zelaya counter-ordered his sympathizers to invade the headquarters, take the ballot-boxes and set them up for the referendum. 

It's also noteworthy that Zelaya had no authority to discharge the head of the military. This is the strict authority of the congress. Chalk up another constitutional violation.

&gt; A multi-party commission named by Congress to investigate the President concluded that Zelaya had violated Honduran law. That commission asked Congress to declare him unfit to govern and begin a legal process of impeachment. 

&gt; It is necessary to stress that the juridical basis for such an impeachment is in the Honduran Constitution, which establishes in article 239: 

&gt; ""Any citizen who has already served as head of the Executive Branch cannot be President or Vice-President again. Whoever violates this law or proposes its reform, as well as those who support such violation directly or indirectly, must immediately cease in their functions and will be unable to hold any public office for a period of 10 years.""

&gt; One sees, therefore, that the Honduran Congress took action to prevent a coup d‚État by Zelaya against the democratic institution of the country. It voted unanimously to depose José Manuel Zelaya and named as the new head of country the president of the Congress, Roberto Micheletti, to whom this responsibility normally would fall according to the Constitution. That congressional decision was duly supported by the Supreme Court. This is how Congress carried out the legal impeachment of Zelaya. 

&gt; Adding to the tense political picture was the fact that, authorized by Zelaya, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan military forces were present in Honduras posted close to the Congress. This means that when the Honduras military took action, they were also proceeding in defense of their sovereignty. 

&gt; As expected, this democratic counter-coup against Zelaya caused a hysterical reaction in Hugo Chavez and his allies of ""21st century Socialism."" They called for an emergency meeting in their ALBA group - Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America - a new version of the Warsaw Pact. There they offered harbor to their deposed disciple and threatened to invade Honduras to reinstall him in power. 

&gt; At this meeting, where Presidents Raul Castro (Cuba) and Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua) were present, statements were issued in favor of what those ""moral authorities"" consider to be democracy in Honduras, that is to say, only under Zelaya's rule. Consequently, they condemned the decision of the Honduran Congress as a ""coup d‚État."" 

&gt; Another quick reaction responding to the alarm sounded by Chavez came from the Secretary General of the American Organization of States (OAS) José Miguel Insulza, who everyone knows owes his position to the diplomatic maneuverings of Hugo Chavez. 

&gt; What is lamentable is that, in addition to these expected moves of Chavez's chess pieces, came the unexpected reaction of Barack Obama's administration and European governments, who expressed incomprehension over the situation in Honduras. Perhaps this is due to manipulation of information or confusion about the present day situation of Latin American governments which is quite different from past epochs.

As to whether his relationship with Hitler was the reason why he was not given another significant command:
&gt;Rommel traveled the paths of glory not just on the strength of his record and abilities, but also from his personal relationship with Hitler. Rommel met Hitler briefly in 1934 and again in 1935, but it was Rommel's temporary tours of duty as commander of Hitler's headquarters party for the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland that cemented the relationship. Hitler read and enjoyed Rommel's book Infantry Attacks, which was based on his exploits in World War I. In 1939, Rommel was promoted to general officer and assigned as the Fuhrer's headquarters full-time commander. Less than three years later, Rommel was a field marshal, surely one of the most meteoric rises in any modern army. Rommel was neither Prussian, an aristocrat nor a member of the general staff, factors greatly increasing his appeal to Hitler. Rommel was, to Hitler, a wholly acceptable ally, one disenfranchised from the army's usual social elite that Hitler detested and distrusted. In 1940, Rommel was assigned 7th Panzer Division command through Hitler's intercession. On arrival at the division, he shocked his new subordinates by using the ""Heil Hitler"" greeting.
(Len Deighton, Blitzkreig: From the Rise of Hitler to the Fall of Dunkirk (New York: Ballantine, 1982), 54.)

and

&gt;Goebbels guided the building of Rommel's reputation in Germany. Like Hitler, Goebbels saw the political, social and psychological benefits that accrued to the Nazis from the handsome, dashing Rommel, whose political acceptability was rewarded with extensive press coverage. He was the first division commander to receive the Knight's Cross for efforts in the fall of France, and he received the lion's share of press coverage. Even Goebbels, though, recognized Rommel's unpredictable nature and the risks of his actions. In an April 1941 diary entry, Goebbels wrote, ""We have our hands full trying to hold him back.""
(Joseph Goebbels (Trans. &amp; ed. by Fred Taylor), The Goebbels Diaries, 1939-1941 (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1983), 339.)

In never being given a significant command again he was not being punished for his retreat from North Africa.  The fact of the matter is that the German General Staff had finer officers than Mr. Rommel to fill senior positions.  His only major victories came during the North African Campaign, and when he tried to apply the lessons of North Africa to Northwest Europe he was rebuffed by the likes of von Rundstedt and von Schweppenburg.  Like I said before, Rommel was an okay commander, but was not the ""greatest battlefield general of the last 100 years.""",0,[deleted],t1_c0auwjo,0,,True,False

That is most definitely true.  Most major churches are shifting their efforts overseas to Africa and/or South America because they consider N.A. a lost cause.

All that being said, the single fastest growing group is non-belief, even in the US.  In Europe and Canada, that group is skyrocketing.  With no church at all reinforcing ANY sort of belief up here, we'll be hard pressed to show any religious behaviour whatsoever except in the very insular groups, ie. Evangelicals, in very short order.  In the US that is blunting in that the growth is slowing, but it is still faster than all the rest.

&gt;For these people, they may simply be unwilling to credit a spiritual aspect of the human experience.

I'd wager you're bang on.  When you live in world with concrete examples all around of you successful application of rational thought and clear benefits you use daily of that, it is easy to assume that this where the bulk of our advancement will come from.  When the other option is religious benefits, most of which clearly come from the social aspect of the religion itself (and not necessarily from the belief system) or religious phenomenon that always have plausible alternative explanations, you don't have much to work with for a rank empiricist.

I think we are only disagreeing on semantics. The point I was trying to make was that an ecosystem can always sustain an inhabitant species because that species is dependent on that ecosystem. One can't have overpopulation because the environment will always limit a population.

Your point that it is overpopulation when the population reaches a size that the environment can not support is equally valid. From the perspective of the given species, population crashes caused by the environment can be traumatic. So, population sizes that may cause a crash could be considered overpopulation if the goal is to avoid the crash.

If I understand you, this leads to our disagreement. I would much rather have the environment manage the size of the human population than human governments. When I think of humans trying to manage their own populations I look at what we do to dogs in trying to manage their populations. In that case we have a bunch of breeds loaded with genetic defects who are in most respects inferior to their wild ancestors. China's attempt at population control and the inbred European aristocrats are two known attempts at managing population and genetics both of which give me little confidence human leadership is up to the task of managing human population.

By Hermione Eyre
01 August 2006

‘I’ve got a quiet voice,” says Daniel Tammet, in his gentle monotone. “I think it’s because as a child I did-n’t speak very much. I used to put my fingers in my ears to feel the silence, which was like a lovely trickling motion in my head.” His eyelids flutter at the memory. “It was hard for me to find my voice because I was, for so long, absorbed in my own world.”

Daniel’s world is a rich and strange one, where every number up to 10,000 has colour, texture and emotional resonance. “The number one is a brilliant and bright white, like somebody shining a torch beam into my eyes… Four is shy and quiet, like me. Eighty-nine is like falling snow…” More remarkable still, he has described it all in Born on a Blue Day, his memoir of his life with synaesthesia and savant syndrome, a rare form of Asperger’s. Dr Darold Treffert, a leading researcher in autism, says: “Such first-person explanations of savant abilities are extremely rare, in fact nearly non-existent.”

Daniel’s condition brings him great riches: his visualisation of numbers means he can perform extraordinary mathematical feats, and he holds the British and European record for reciting pi from memory to 22,514 decimal places. It also has its limitations. Forming relationships was difficult (“until I was eight or nine, I didn’t realise that other children were people with thoughts and feelings”); supermarkets still are (too brightly coloured, too confusing).

When I meet him in the quiet London offices of his publisher, there are only a few signs of how different he is, a slight creakiness in his gait, a subtle overintensity in his gaze. “I had to teach myself to look in some-body’s eyes, to make eye contact,” he explains. “Before that, I used to look at their mouth, because it was the part of their face that was moving,” he says, as if it were the easiest mistake to make in the world. Which, in a way, it is, or certainly the most logical.

There’s also a stiffness, a vulnerability in his bearing. I watch as he stands before The Independent on Sunday’s photographer, as rigid as if he were in front of a firing squad. Sunlight flashes on his face and he begins to squint; immediately, his boyfriend, a mild-mannered computer programmer called Neil, bounds towards him solicitously. “Are you OK?”

Later, I ask Daniel if the pho-toshoot was such an ordeal that he used numbers to help him through. “Yes. While we were outside I noticed a spiral staircase in one of the buildings which was nice as it reminded me of doing a fraction in my head.”

Mental arithmetic is a gorgeous kaleidoscopic process for Daniel. “Squaring numbers is a symmetrical process that I like very much,” he says. “And when I divide one number by another, say, 13 divided by 97, I see a spiral rotating downwards in larger and larger loops that seem to warp and curve. The shapes coalesce into the right number. I never write anything down.”

His mathematical abilities are so extraordinary that it took a long time for them to be recog-nised. Daniel struggled at school (why, he wondered, were the numbers in the textbook not printed in their true colours, nine in blue, and so on?). He got a B at Maths GCSE. He wasn’t diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome until three years ago, at 25.

Sooner would have been better “both for me and my parents”; consciousness-raising is part of his motivation for writing his book. “My condition is invisible otherwise.”

Scientists at California’s Center for Brain Studies were astounded when, two years ago, they discovered his facility for discerning prime numbers. They had assumed he must have been trained to do it. But to him, it is more like an instinctive process: “Prime numbers feel smooth, like pebbles.” The centre stays in close contact with Daniel.

“The scientists and researchers come to me so I can help them design the parameters of their experiments,” he says in his habitual monotone, neither proud nor modest. It is important to Daniel that he uses his gifts responsibly, perhaps for science, perhaps for teaching: he is already devising a new system of visualisation to help with language learning and dyslexia.

“When I was growing up, my parents were very concerned that people shouldn’t just get me to do tricks for them,” he says. (He is a whizz at crowd-pleasers such as working out, from your date of birth, which day of the week you were born on.) “My parents had this phrase ‘performing seal’. They didn’t want me to be one.”

Growing up as an undiagnosed savant was never easy. Daniel was lonely. “I was desperate for a friend and I used to lie in bed at night thinking about what it would be like. My younger brothers and sisters had friends and I used to watch them playing to try to work out what they did and how friendship worked. Then, I would have traded everything for normality. But I’ve since learned that being different isn’t necessarily a bad thing.”

Falling in love with Neil has been a large part of this. Emotions used to be difficult for him to understand without recourse to numbers. “If I heard somebody was sad I would picture myself sitting in the dark hollowness of number six to help me understand the feeling.” Now his emotional life is more like everyone else’s. “Love by its very nature puts things in perspective, joins the dots and helps me see life in a bigger way.” Neil and Daniel, who have been together for six years, share an odd kind of domestic bliss. They have their tea together at exactly the same time every day; they have exactly 45g of porridge for breakfast, weighed on an electronic scale. “Neil is very patient with me, and the routines I need to have to help with my anxieties,” says Daniel. “I don’t know what I’d do without him.”

Generally, Daniel feels he is progressing all the time towards “outgrowing” his autism. He cried for the first time in his adult life a few years ago, when his cat died. “My face was wet, and I knew that I was crying.” Latterly, he has acquired a strong religious faith, which grew from an intellectual appreciation of the writings of G K Chesterton. And he is getting steadily better at social interaction. “Every experience I have I add to my mental library and hopefully life should then get easier.” In this, he seems to sum up the progress we all hope for.

But some experiences remain unique to him. “I don’t normally like films about emotions because I can’t understand them. I enjoyed March of the Penguins, though. But when I watched the trailers first, I found that because they show the most dramatic moments one after another in quick succession, it made me feel so overwhelmed I burst into tears. No one else was affected, of course, and I felt silly. Next time I’ll know to maybe not watch the trailers.”
A life in numbers

‘Pi is for me a beautiful thing’

Daniel Tammet can speak 10 languages, including Lithuanian and Welsh, as well as his own invented language, “Mänti”, which has about 1,000 words.

As part of a documentary that was made about him, called ‘Brainman’, Tammet learned Icelandic in a week, in front of the cameras. The culmination of the challenge was a live interview on Icelandic TV, which he coped with brilliantly.

He can recognise every prime number up to 9,973.

In 2003, he gave a public recital of pi in Oxford, in aid of the National Society for Epilepsy. Tammet recited it for five hours nine minutes, reaching 22,514 decimal places. “Pi is for me an extremely beautiful thing,” he says, “like the ‘Mona Lisa’ or a Mozart symphony.”

On The Late Show with David Letterman, he calculated instantly that since Letterman’s birth date was 12 April 1947, he must have been born on a Saturday and would reach 65 on a Thursday.

Latin America, predominately Christian, yet has lots of trouble. Numerous African nations, Christian, trouble. US, Christian , trouble.

Numerous African nations, Muslim, trouble. China, athiest, trouble. Iraq, muslim, trouble. Afghanistan....get the drift?

Lebanon, Christian, and Muslim, trouble. Yugoslav states, Christian, and Muslim, trouble. Cyprus, Christian, and Muslim, trouble. 

Syria, Muslim, not much trouble. Jordan, muslim, not much trouble. Most of Europe, Christian, not much trouble. Malaysia, muslim, not much trouble. 

Iraq under Saddam, Muslim , internal trouble. North Korea, atheist, internal trouble. 

Let's take into account the last 200 years...on average 'trouble' seems to be well spread across the globe with no real concentration in Muslim areas...but it's been quite a show in Europe. 

It's been about the last 50 years that the middle east has turned into a fire pit........interestingly enough in the same 50 years Africa has become quite the fire bed too. 

Maybe you should take up reading a book or two; you just might figure out that most 'trouble' involving Muslims doesn't seem to be instigated by Islam directly. The religion, any religion for that matter can be used as a weapon, but it's hard to argue the first blow dealt in the middle east or any Muslim nation had anything to do with Islam in almost any conflict in the past 50 years or so. the tones of conflicts in the middle east may have echoed the stereotypical muslim teaching, but for the most part, it was used as a weapon, and rarely the instigator.

2. How does it compare to renting
3. What are the factors that determine appreciation
4. What affects those factors that cause appreciation or depreciation
5. What are some of the theories with regards to how those factors are affected over time.

The Irish-owned airline Ryanair
announced the possibility of domestic
flights between Porto and
Faro, following an agreement with
ANA, the company in charge of
the nation’s airports, to open a
new base in Porto and its decision
to increase operations in Faro.
Communications director for Ryanair
Europe, Daniel de Carvalho,
said last week that the company is
also keen to operate low-cost domestic
flights between Porto and
Lisbon. During a press conference
last week in Porto, Ryanair’s
Michael Cawley said that the airline
will open its 33rd base in Porto
during September this year and
will be investing about €100 million
in two new aircraft that will
be based at Porto’s Sá Carneiro
airport, creating around 16 new
routes with 50 daily departures
and sustaining more than 1.500
jobs in the city.
Celebrating the new base in
Porto, Ryanair offered more than
a million tickets at a single €5
cost and a further million tickets
at only €9 each, although the offer
closed last Sunday. Several new
routes into Porto are being created:
Basel, Eindhoven, St Etienne
and Tours. Ryanair estimates that
the new Porto base, along with
increased operations at Faro airport,
will bring up to 1,5 million
passengers annually, 50 per
cent more than 2008 figures. According
to Cawley, Ryanair is also
doubling the number of flights
from Porto to Paris Beauvais airport
probably harnessing a large
number of the Portuguese emigrant
market. He also said that Ryanair
is “doing more to join Portugal
to Europe” than the proposed
TGV high-speed rail link will ever
do, “if it ever will.”
The Minister of Public Works,
Transport and Communications,
Marío Lino, said that Ryanair’s
plans “carried out in a particularly
adverse economic climate, shows
a quiet confidence from both
ANA and Ryanair.”
Cawley also reiterated the goal
of Ryanair to reach 100 million
passengers across Europe in 2012,
setting the goal for this year at 67
million passengers. “We’re still
comfortable about the targets,” he
said, noting that “while prices are
low, people will travel”. Ryanair,
the first foreign company to set
up airline operations in Portugal,
plans to reduce prices by 15 to 20
per cent this year.
Whilst Ryanair has seen a record
98 per cent increase in passengers
flying to Portugal, other low-cost
airlines, including easyjet, Monarch,
Air Berlin, Hapag-Lloyd Express
and Thomsonfly have seen
losses. According to ANA, overall
passenger traffic fell by 11,3
per cent from January to May this
year, with the biggest losses coming
from the UK market. The only
other exception to the rule is
British Airways, with an increase
of 96,7 per cent, although last year
BA’s traffic into Faro was almost
zero.",0,sempre_conectado,t1_c0av9s6,0,,True,False

La presentazione del famoso architetto portoghese è stata curata personalmente dal prof. François Burkhardt, storico e critico internazionale dell'architettura, nonché profondo conoscitore dell’opera di Siza.

Burkhardt ha presentato ad una platea straordinariamente attenta ed interessata gli esordi di un Siza profondamente umano, sensibile ed in perfetto equilibrio professionale tra architettura ed arte.

Un grande appassionato d’arte che, alla stessa, ha dovuto rinunciare in giovane età per limiti concettuali dell’epoca che la vedevano espressione comunicativa non professionalmente riconosciuta. Una passione profonda, soffocata però solo in apparenza, che lo porta a compiere un percorso parallelo che negli anni ha trovato più volte occasione di intreccio con quel primo amore represso.

Nei suoi numerosi viaggi il giovane Siza conosce le più svariate espressioni dell’architettura, e proprio a questa decide di dedicare la sua vita, i suoi studi ed il proprio futuro, fino a diventare architetto per poter offrire un contributo funzionale alla società. Dai suoi scritti emerge una consapevolezza coltivata: “con l’arte non si può incidere sul reale impatto della realtà sociale”, ma con l’architettura ciò diviene possibile e fattibile, e Siza in questo è un autentico maestro.

Dal convegno è emerso un secondo aspetto di Siza, quello del disegnatore, che imprime nelle sue illustrazioni metaforiche la stessa forza espressiva comunicata attraverso le opere architettoniche, di cui si è reso celebre autore nel corso di tanti anni di proficua attività.

L’opera del Siza-disegnatore trova straordinaria applicazione nella Fornace della Cava, che ha avuto il privilegio di ricevere in esclusiva uno schizzo prodotto dal maestro, la cui realizzazione su ceramica è attualmente in fase di sperimentazione nei laboratori dell’azienda metelliana.Gli ospiti intervenuti al meeting, insieme allo stesso autore, hanno infatti avuto modo di vedere esposta per la prima volta l’opera intitolata dall’autore “Costruzione di un angelo”, riprodotta in diverse applicazioni cromatiche. L’angelo, presentato oggi alla platea, costituisce lo step più recente di una ricerca sul soggetto iniziata dall’architetto Siza già nel ’76.

L’intervento diretto di Siza ha conferito all’incontro un tono quasi familiare, in cui è l’uomo, con la sua formidabile passione per l’arte, a parlare dell’architetto. Un racconto che presenta, con lieve rammarico, gli impedimenti che hanno ostacolato la sua formazione come artista da giovane, ma che trova un senso di orgogliosa rivincita nel dimostrare come proprio l’arte sia stata in grado di rendere diversa la sua opera architettonica.

Rispetto per le “ragioni dell’esistenza di un progetto” e reinterpretazione delle stesse con il linguaggio nuovo e fresco dell’arte: questa la linea di pensiero di un architetto del calibro di Siza, che così facendo riesce a conferire alla stessa architettura uno slancio innovativo e diverso.

Un incontro istruttivo e piacevole, curato dall’agenzia di comunicazione integrata MTN Company e ambientato in un contesto fortemente caratterizzato dall’emozione e dall’espressione artistica delle numerose realizzazioni della Fornace della Cava, concluso con il gustoso buffet realizzato per l’occasione dal prestigioso chef Rocco Iannone, del ristorante PappaCarbone, nominato chef dell'anno 2008 per l'«Unique», una delle più raffinate guide gastronomiche europee.

t3_8yth5,-3,t3_8yth5,c0avbbx,False,,t5_2cneq,,1246955182,-3,1425995049,0,politics,"&gt;Leftists are inclined to be aggressive activists, promoting their utopian convictions publicly with evangelical zeal. Through their fervor, in the heat of the moment, they often unveil the ugly side of their character by inadvertently blurting out their eager anticipation of the time when they will administer, with relish, the coercive measures upon their perceived enemies. For the Leftist politician the desire is to enact legislation for grandiose collectivistic and economically leveling undertakings. For the Leftist academician and intellectual the desire is, to put it simply, to force everyone to think and act in a manner that would conform with a model of human behavior in an ideal egalitarian society conceptualized by Leftist philosophy. For the blue-collar Leftist street fighter the underlying motivation can be as simple as hatred for the boss. 

&gt;The principle that the end justifies the means is in individualist ethics regarded as the denial of all morals. In collectivist ethics it becomes necessarily the supreme rule: there is literally nothing which the consistent collectivist must not be prepared to do if it serves ""the good of the whole,"" because the ""good of the whole"" is to him the only criterion of what ought to be done.'

&gt;George Watson, a historian of the modern era who is presently engaged in writing a comprehensive history of socialism, puts it well in an article in the Dec.31, 1995 issue of the National Review, titled ""Never blame the left"". He writes: ""The Left is perceived as kind and caring, despite its extensive history of promoting genocide.""; and further: "".. in modern Europe, genocide has been exclusively a socialist idea, ever since Engels proclaimed it in Marx's journal the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in January-February 1849. Ever since then everyone who has advocated genocide has called himself a socialist, without exception."" He concludes the article with: ""What we need now is a serious and unblinking study of socialism, of what it said and what it did: one that does not fudge the evidence: one that is brave enough to tell it as it was.""

&gt;The above theory sounds preposterous, to say the least. How can it be claimed that the millions of compassionate, well-intentioned Leftists who populate the Western democracies all harbor within them such malevolence? The answer is that here we are dealing with the deep recesses of human nature, where a predisposition for evil can lie dormant for an entire lifetime and never surface, unless the ambient social conditions invite its development. For example, we recognize envy, which is in all of us to some degree, as a powerful motivator for evil actions. And without a doubt, intense envy hides beneath the patina of righteous egalitarianism of the Leftist.

I don't know about NRC monitoring or whether it's funded more by reactor licenses or taxes . But again, the costs are comparatively TINY: the entire NRC budget is about $1.0 billion dollars, whereas US nuclear generation is 800 billion kWh/year. So dividing, the NRC budget is equal to about 0.12 c/kWh of electricity generated, a negligible 1-2% of costs.

Criminal penalties http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery#Criminal_penalties

Western countries

Most western countries have decriminalized adultery. Adultery is not a crime in most countries of the European Union, including Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland or Sweden.

In the United States, laws vary from state to state. In those states where adultery is still on the statute book (although rarely prosecuted), penalties vary from life sentence (Michigan)[30], to a fine of $10 (Maryland), to a Class I felony (Wisconsin) [31]. In the U.S. Military, adultery is a potential court-martial offense.[10] The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States has been / is being questioned following Supreme Court decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults, in cases such as Lawrence v. Texas.

There is a natural role for the government of a Republic in some, but not all, aspects of health care, I say.

For example, from the richest scion to the poorest slob, nobody wants a waiter with Typhus. Never. Nor any communicable disease. If we agree this is the case, then the government should be involved in health care for all communicable diseases. I'd say STDs, too, since I think they are all potentially communicable without sexual contact.

The first relates to the mind/body problem. There seems to be a particular aversion to making claims that indicate that certain cognitive traits are quite limited by our genes. If you were to tell the average person that they do not have the genes that would allow them to be a professional basketball player, it is unlikely they will get offended. Sure, there are people who are of average height or shorter who play professionally (e.g. Nate Robinson, who is 5'7'' or 5'9''), but they are genetic freaks. The average person just doesn't seem to react to physical limitations that are likely due to genes the same way they react to cognitive limitations that are likely due to genes.

Tell some parent that since their kid has an IQ of around 90 that they will likely not be a doctor or lawyer and the parents generally react in horror as though you're passing judgment of their child's worth. They will then spout off illogical arguments about how trying hard matters (with the implication that traits like conscientiousness aren't as heritable as traits like intelligence and the implication that the person they are speaking to does not realize that achievement involves both raw intelligence and other psychological traits) or about how IQ doesn't measure everything (but the correlation between intelligence alone and income ranges from 0.4 upward, so 1/6 of the variance is explained; pretty powerful for a test that doesn't measure anything).

I haven't quite developed an explanation for why this is, so I cannot provide a full explanation. I sense it has something to do with the fact that we all value intelligence and as such do not want to admit that we may have the short end of the stick in that regard.

The other dichotomy that seems to be involved is free will/determinism. People just do not want to admit that macro-level behaviors may be influenced by something that they cannot control. Sure, they will admit that on the micro-level there are things that we cannot control and seem wholly unaware that we cannot. For example, the fMRI studies that have found that you can artificially stimulate various brain regions to get people to undertake actions, like looking behind them, and the people will confabulate reasons for why they are doing so, like 'I wanted to check to see if my purse was still there'; I cannot for the life of me remember the guy's name who did these studies, some Norwegian neuroscientist. Or that we seem to make decisions fractions of a second before we are aware that we have made a decision. It's not to say that these studies do not have alternative explanations that keep our egocentric notions of free will in tact, but that the revulsion that people have to these studies pales in comparison to the outrage that they will express when you study something like rape. It's as though the neuroscience studies are about a ""micro"" lack of free will. The ""macro"" lack of free will that evopsyc (and related fields) touches upon are disproportionately offensive compared to the ""macro"".

Why the Left in particular seems revolted? Partially because the Left has traditionally aligned itself with ideas that implied that human nature can be malleable. According to them, all the offensive -isms (racism, sexism, etc) can be eliminated if we just set up the proper societal influences. So anything that tells them to stop being so naive can be offensive, especially when they use the guise of science to make their pronouncements.

Some parts of the Left have been overly infected with post-modernist ideas, so the fact that white European males are parroting so called biological truths does not impress them in the least (this partial explanation is better for the radical feminists who got butthurt when Pinker tried to bring reason to the Larry Summers situation).

Other parts are just irrational. They think that people who voice sociobiological ideas must have hidden agendas, even when you provide evidence that plenty of these people (e.g. EO Wilson and Richard Dawkins) have leftist sympathies.

To begin with, free market means a system in which the government does not step into private business making decisions for it. The government has no involvement and lets companies do their own decisions without intervening. I honestly don't know where to start answering your novel of a comment, since all of it shows is you have no idea of how the market works.

&gt; Big corporate using their muscle to control public policy is not a free market.

I suppose here you are referring to companies lobbying for extra rights. Yeah, that's a problem in the government side, which over the years has taken on a lot more responsibilities than a government should. Cut the governments power and you won't need lobbying anymore. I agree at the moment even in the states it is not a free market. Government still steps into the market to make the changes they thing need to be made.

&gt; It is a place of winners and losers where the losers and their families rot.

Drama Llama. Nobody is going to rot, give me a break. You're just dramatizing. Also, that's life...it's full of winners and losers. You can't save everybody even if you try, but a free market does not mean people being worse of. To give you an example, Ireland has recently relaxed its market laws (less taxation, less gov control etc.) and guess what, people are doing better than they have ever done. Their GDP has risen over the last years, being one of the highest in Europe. In fact, in every country where the economy is left to do as they please without intervention, they are doing better. Do some research. So much for your theory.

&gt; In the current capitalist system, the wealthy pay far less for goods and services that the non wealthy. This destroys you free market concept entirely.

Where do you get these ideas? How the fuck do the wealthy pay less for goods and services? If they want to see a doctor, they pay the same amount, same for food, gas, electricity and telephone. And don't forget, most likely they are the ones that made all these things possible in the first place. Entreprenours that made supermarkets and phone companies and so on so that you can benefit from those services. That's free market that got you those things.

&gt; The more money your have the easier it is to make money. This destroys your free market utopia.

Depends what your plan is. Google started in a garage and now it's a multi-billion dollar company. Why does this destroy my free market ""utopia""? By the way, I never said it is an utopia. I just say it's a better system.

&gt; It has nothing to do with being a good manager or service or quality.

Bullshit. That's the basis of the market system. That really shows you have zero clue about what you are talking.

&gt; You seem to have decided that 'good managers' are deserving of more than people who are not good managers.

Yes, and that applies in all areas in life, not only business. If a person can manage their shit correctly, then they are more deserving of rewards and safety and whatever in contrast with people that don't manage their stuff correctly, e.g. people that take credit for shit they don't need, can't pay it back, banks that make wrong investments and so on. And usually people that can manage their money, plans and future correctly get more from life than people that are disinterested and wasteful. This is really just a fact of life, no longer economics.

&gt; You seem to support the goals of the greedy above the goals of the humble.

There's nothing wrong with greed. Everybody is greedy to one extent or the other. Because somebody was greedy and wanted some money, they invented an operating system and now you can benefit from that product because someone was greedy at some point in their life. Greed and vileness are not synonyms and people tend to forget that. Again, fact of life: people that strive more usually get more.

&gt; You have to decide if you are for free market capitalism or if you are for the equal opportunity values of the United States. The two philosophies oppose one another.

Honestly, while you don't see as many Caucasian/Indian relationships as some others, I've almost never known an Indian guy who was attracted to Caucasian women and who wasn't able to date them.  The problem might require some work on your own part, but none of the problems are insurmountable.

It's relatively clear that the various Asian peoples have significantly less muscle tone, on average, than those of European or African descent.  While East Asian cuisine tends to keep them thin, Indian cuisine is hearty and creamy (surprise, as it was heavily influenced by the British), and therefore Indian people who don't work out tend to be naturally 'rounder'.  Maybe it's a coincidence, but the Indian guys I've known that had success with Caucasian women are either gym rats or professionally quite successful (or both).  Plus, mentioning cuisine means mentioning the fact that spicy Indian cuisine, while absolutely delicious, tends to result in spice running through the pores, through the clothes, and through one's furniture.

Second is the Asian cultural work ethic.  While us Caucasian nerds/geeks know from a very early age that we are naturally nerdy, and can learn to compensate if we so desire, the combination of the expected stereotype, and the educational focus of your parents combine to make many Asian-Americans oblivious to their own nerd-dom.

Now, of course, none of these may apply to you, or some might apply, and some might not... but the one thing that is obvious is: *no confidence*.  I'm sure you could go up to a Caucasian slumpbuster at a party and become a couple, but if you want to date *attractive* women (of any race), you need confidence in yourself, which you obviously lack.

The lawsuit issue is an interesting one. People are harmed by malpractice and their peers assess a penalty, which you consider to be high. I'm not sure I agree that limiting the magnitude of such lawsuits is the right approach. Probably a better approach is a clarification of the law to more clearly spell out liabilities assumed by a doctor or surgeon. I am by no means an expert on malpractice lawsuits and malpractice insurance. However, just passing a law saying no malpractice lawsuit can be more than $x million is a pretty dumb solution and can only disenfranchise someone truly harmed by malpractice.

Insurance companies are not the ones doing research; providers and their suppliers are. Don't let yourself be confused about what market forces are at play here just because there is a third party payer system. Health service is still a transaction of a service for a price that includes a profit margin.

Yes, they will fire their lab workers and close up shop. The number of total customers is not going to save a company if their profit margins are tiny, nothing, or negative.

Look, I agree that cost is an issue and needs to be handled. I also agree with you that malpractice insurance rates are a big part of that (and I admit that I probably do not know enough about malpractice to decide on a solution there). But you cannot simply mandate costs down and at the same time increase demand (# of consumers) without either supply shortages or terrible degradation of quality. You also can't reduce or eliminate profit margins and still expect the supply of medical workers and research to stay the same. There are a ton of people here claiming that other countries have done it, and it's akin to saying pigs can fly because they've seen it in Europe. Gravity exists in Europe the same as the US; the laws of physics don't change.

There is about a 27% ""ghost"" profit margin given to health insurers by every US taxpayer because employer health insurance benefits are paid with pre-tax dollars. Because it is due to a tax subsidy, this margin is in a market vacuum and will never be subject to reduction through competition. I think if you eliminate this margin, get health insurance out of the business of business and back into the hands of individuals (just like car insurance, home insurance, and most other insurance), and eliminate predictable, routine procedures like yearly physical from the health ""insurance"" coverage, then market forces will finally apply to health care again.

I agree. I generally consider myself a progressive, but the Right is onto something in their disgust of the rise of the victim mentality. America is eating itself alive with preventable illnesses related to smoking, over eating, alcohol, sexual promiscuity without protection, and lack of exercise. 

Bad choices are not ""diseases"". The term ""disease"" is useful only for describing the cumulative social effect of these bad choices. We all pay for peoples' stupid choices, it is time to start telling them they are stupid and putting in place the regulation frameworks to mitigate the social costs associated with their bad choices.

Here is my take on how to correct some of these issues:

1. Incentivize good choices with tax law. This includes preventative medical treatment, good diets, exercise, etc.

2. Regulate the hell out of tobacco products. NO ADDITIVES ALLOWED. Only 100% natural (preferably organic) tobacco. Native Americans were not smoking 3 packs of Peace Pipes per day. Tobacco isn't nearly as harmful as cigarettes.

3. Improve our dismal food system. Do away with ag subsidies that favor large scale corn production. Increase consumer visibility into food production with better labeling laws (origin and ingredients). Incentivize sustainable healthful food production. Crack down on food additives. The Europeans do a much better job with this than the United States.

4. Improve and expand sex education. Sorry, Evangelicals, you can't be against abortion and for abstinence only education. Start dealing with the way things are, not the way you think Jesus wants them to be.

5. Decriminalize illicit drugs. We don't need to go over this again, suffice it to say that it will lead to less drug use, less crime, and curb the spread of infectious disease (see Portugal). Use cannabis to treat alcohol and hard drug addiction.

6. Supplement all of the above with educational programs that reveal the true cost (both at the personal and societal level) of bad choices. Our education system needs to better prepare people for choices related to diet, exercise, drugs (including alcohol, smoking, and caffeine), finance (credit!), and sex.",0,useless_idiot,t1_c0avihv,0,,True,False

Slavery was just the excuse. The reason has always been money. The Republicans was a northern regional party. It thus had an incentive to use taxation as a means to support its constituency. 

It is funny that the USA never attacked other countries for slavery. While slavery is morally wrong, is it right to kill one person for every three slaves? Is killing somehow less wrong than slavery? There were other measures that the North could have implemented without resorting to violence.

The Civil War was nothing more than a Federal and Republican power grab.

&gt; Note that at no point was the South prohibited from actually industrializing.

It is a simple fact that the North had an industrial type economy. This is usually coupled with higher population density, trained people, natural resources, etc… It is pretty fucked up to disadvantage one group of people for the benefit of another group of people.

Generally, and extremely un-PC, one would categorize masculinity in this scale from lower to higher:   Asian - European - African.  The same goes for average penis sizes according to the World Health Organization/most views of pornography.  Additionally, it would go for vaginal sizes, if one assumes penis size and vaginal size generally correlate within a racial group (I had not thought of this before an E. Asian-descent girlfriend suggested the idea to me). 

Generally, men prefer to date women from the same or lesser masculinity group than them, and women prefer to date men from the same or higher masculinity group. 

That seems natural, if a bit unfortunate, and seems extremely reinforced by interracial marriage rates: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage

As in:  African-descent men marrying Asian-descent women is EXTREMELY more common than African-descent women marrying Asian-descent men.  Or...European-descent men marrying Asian-descent women is much more common than Asian-descent men marrying European-descent women. 

I think, at it's heart, that's the case.  It's quite biological, and quite offensive, but there you have it...both statistically and intuitively (if one is dispassionate).  It's only in general, and doesn't apply to all cases naturally, but would in a large part explain such a phenomenon.

&gt;Had the Europeans been in possession of Aristotle's work, as well as dozens of other Greek thinkers, I hope that we would both agree that development would have been equal between the two.

I don't think Christian Europeans would have appreciated Aristotle's work or let it be read, frankly, because the church tended to view the writings of such authors as a challenge to the Bible and their dogmatic views of Creation, history, etc. The Muslims, on the other hand, did not see such writings as a challenge to the Koran, and thus saw no contradiction in having the state foster scientific and philosophical inquiry.

&gt;I'd also like to add another possiblity: the encroachment of Islamic rule was threatening to the Europeans.

I assume you mentioned this as an explanation for the origins of the ""clash of civilizations"" btw the West and Islam. I agree with you on this point. There's no doubt the Muslim incursions into Europe scared the bejesus out of the Westerners. In fact, it probably galvanized Charlemagne's efforts to conquer and unite the continent.

Some historians say it is a pity this happened. They ask, ""What would have happened if the Muslims had defeated Charlemagne and conquered all of Europe?"" And the answer (of some historians) is, ""The West would have gained 268 years"" in scientific and medical knowledge.

Re the book, I find it utterly fascinating b/c it goes into detail on the impact Islam had on Europe, from the founding of Europe and before. It also explodes myths (like the chanson de Roland and the real significance of the Battle of Poitiers) and stereotypes (that the Muslims were filthy and evil).

""But the implementation has been difficult and one size does not fit all.""""

I don't think I'm particularly proud about that, in fact, that very sentence points out the core of the whole problem, IMHO, because this sentence discloses a particular kind of dishonest NewSpeak. I mean, my main problem is not with the situation itself, but with the wording of the sentence, with the description of the situation, with the ""rights"" language in which the situation is explained.

A ""right"" presupposes some activity with an active and a passive party to it, and the ""right"" is defined from the viewpoint of the passive party, not from the viewpoint of the active party. A ""right"" of the passive party is an ""obligation"" of the active party. Thus, one could describe it both ways, for example, you can say ""everybody has a right to life"" (passive party), or, you can say, ""do not kill"" (active party). ""Right to free speech"" (passive party), or ""obligation not to use violence against others for expressing their views"". ""Right to healthcare"" (passive party), or ""obligation to pay for the healthcare of the other guy"" (active party). *These are same and equivalent*. Is this absolutely clear to everybody? 

When choosing to describe such an interpersonal action as a ""right"", instead of as an ""obligation"", we are shifting our attention from an action (someone *doing* something to someone) to a circumstance (something *is happening* with somone). This means a certain *loss of the perception of reality*: we are forgeting how the circumstance comes about,  what causes it, why and how it happens. We are becoming somewhat less realistic, we are using a language more detached from reality, more abstracted from reality.

So, instead of using the passive language, ""everybody having a right to healthcare"", it would be better to use the active language: ""the taxpayer has an obligation to provide health care for everybody"". 

Expressing it this way is more realistic, has more to do with how things actually work, because it describes not only a circumstance, but also the cause and the conditions the circumstance depends upon.

And putting it this way raises uncomfortable questions. Do all taxpayers accept this obligation? Under what conditions? Will they be always willing to provide healthcare for everybody, even if the number of freeriders grow? How should the burden be shared amongst taxpayers? What can disagreeing taxpayers do? More importantly: how much money are taxpayers willing to spend, what sort of quality do they expect in return, and what will happen when many, even, most taxpayers will decide they are unwilling to keep up their part of the bargain because they are thinking the other parties are not keeping up theirs? 

Most importantly: all taxpayers the only party who has obligations? That would really look imbalanced. What about the obligations of others? What about the obligations of patients (i.e. an obligation not to abuse the system), what are the obligations of the state (i.e. no corruption, transparency), of doctors, and so on?

These are all hard and realistic questions, and the ""rights"" language does not address these question, these questions can be answered only in an ""obligations"" language. The ""rights"" NewSpeak tends to hide these questions, tends to sweep these questions under the rug.

For example, I'm fairly sure really many UK taxpayers are furious about the NHS. In some other countries, most notably The Netherlands and Sweden, it works better. Germany is so-so, their famous ""duty-consciousness"" (Pflichtbewusstsein) helps mitigating the problems of abuse, but there is abuse nevertheless in big numbers and disappointment and unhappiness with the healthcare system is slowly growing.

*But you cannot address such problems if you are talking about rights instead of obligations.*

To give it a more philosophical bent, this is a core problem with ALL rights: with human rights, dear to the Left, with property rights and natural rights, dear to Libertarians, with animal rights, dear to the Greens, with gay rights or minority rights or other sorts of rights: rigths can only exist if 

1) someone has a corresponding obligation 

2) is willing to uphold said obligation or can be _successfully_ forced to do so. The language of rights hides these problems. 

So why aren't we talking about obligations instead of rights?

Not only about healthcare: about everything. It's really crazy most political philosophy is about the human rights folks (Left) arguing with the natural rights folks (Libertarians). Let's talk about obligations already!",0,[deleted],t1_c0avjix,0,,True,True

I played competitive ut2k4, the scene didn't last as long as q3 did, but it was quite healthy in its prime and was played in CPL and other events for a while. Within the competitive community, pretty much everyone had the map memorization and power-up timing as close to perfect as you could get - and yet you'd still see players consistently beat other players 30 to -1, and those players themselves get consistently beat 30 to -1 by better players, and so on up the skill ladder until you reached the guys who represented the US in international events, and they would still usually get pummeled pretty hard by european pros.

&gt;First any Govt must prove that is able to cut the costs and only then expand the system.

Government revenue should be in line with spending, that much I agree with, that is usually either achieved through a cut in spending or an increase in taxation, depending on what the voter is more comfortable with (again, in Europe people are less likely to see an increase in taxation as terrible if it brings with it something that they like, whilst in the US a decrease in services is something far more popular (

When you roam from country to country in Europe, do you get charged differently?  Is the service completely seamless?

No?  Thought so.

Network upgrades are constantly going on.  Every provider constantly is working on its network.

Or if that sounds unrealistic, surely some MBA from Harvard is working on this potential?  Maybe they can offer a phone for $8.99/month nationally over millions of square miles.

Why wouldn't Sprint or the TMob do this?  They are churning customers, surely they could lower their rates in an effort to stand out against the competition?

Such as?  For the last time - I don't think you understand statistics very well.  Let me try a completely different argument, since you are not smart enough to follow the other one - if there was an error large enough to make the difference in American life length equal to those of western europe/Japan/etc, it is equally likely that the US life span was overstated, and is actually less!  

Now then, since you're making the argument that the difference is tiny anyway, fine, let's say that you're right.  Well, then, we're paying, on average, twice as much per person for health, and apparently, we get nothing for it.  Sure, as you keep insisting, we may have lower wait times for some procedures.

But apparently this effect is so minute as to not make a difference in life expectancy.

And I was not implying that the US is a police state.

Regarding europe, the EU just passed regulations creating uniform cellular roaming. Crossing national boundaries is hardly comparable to traveling in the US. Each telco operates under different regulations in a different market in every country. Though so long as you have a 4 band gsm phone  you can roam anywhere. And if its really an issue, you can by a local pay as go sim card and pop it in your phone. Wait, what's that, not in the US where every phone is locked to the service provider.

Verizon wireless is owned and operated independently of the rest of Verizon. So null on that argument.

The cellular infrastructure in the US is almost entirely controlled by four companies. If you want to start your own service one either has to purchase service from on of the telcos (priced so you can't undercut their consumer services).  The initial outlay for infrastructure is huge, so unless you've built your infrastructure up over decades initial rates will be quite high, but prices should drop off as infrastructure is payed for.

Both Spring and T-mobile appear to have made the calculation that they can make greater profits by losing customers but keeping their margins high on the customers they retain.

Where is this sprint plan for $10 a month, I can find neither hide nor hair of it on their website.

I would have a great deal fewer issues with american telcos if they just let me use my own phone. But I can't, and if I buy a phone I have to either unlock it, or if its cdma toss it in the bin if I switch services.

Anyway, how about the lack of proliferation of the signs produced by these medieval marketers?  So the rich guy wants a statue of himself, but he only gets *one* made.  He doesn't put it up all over the place, he puts it in one place.  The lack of reproduction, of copy after copy after copy, is a major difference between the styles of ""marketing"".

The very word ""marketing"" is important.  The modern form of this phenomenon is directly tied to *commerce* in its very essence.  The purpose of these productions of cultural meaning is because our culture is commercially focused.  What is the product being sold in the case of european aristocracy?  In the case of the Church, you could easily say that the product being sold is Jesus, but even there that isn't the case.  Yes, they were ""selling"" Jesus, but by using the word ""sell"" without care, you start thinking that they were selling Jesus the same way they now sell car insurance or clothing.

The purpose of the older cultural work was to produce cultural work, not a cynical exploitation of the way humans create meaning in their lives in order to sell things and make money.  In the case of aristocracy, the production of the cultural work was to install themselves in the culture perhaps to be remembered, due to ego, or to commemorate something.  Not to sell.  Marcus Agrippa has his name on the Pantheon still because he wanted people 2000 years after his death to remember that Marcus Agrippa, consul for the third time, built the Pantheon, because the Pantheon is a great expression of Roman culture, the greatness of Romans, and the greatness of one Roman in particular, not to make you feel that your life is incomplete without the purchase of a particular thing.

I think what, at base, I'm trying to get at is that it is a war *today*, but in the past it was not.  In the past it was the creation of cultural meaning in order to give meaning to the world for humans.  Yes, they are both productions of cultural meaning, they are both trying to say something, to persuade you of something, to install a meme in your mind, but how and why they are doing that is very very important.  You can't say that all cultural production of all of humanity has merely been a less sophisticated version of modern commercial marketing.  Modern marketing came about when our culture started to become self-aware.

We figured out what we had been doing all along because the speed of change increased and we realized that things were not as they were because they had a reflection of Truth in them, we realized that things had stayed the same because we didn't need to change them.  Once they started changing, we realized we could control the change.  Add in some capitalism and a service for hire, and you get modern marketing, created with the precise aim of installing ideas in the culture.",0,am5437435,t1_c0avv5h,0,,True,True

I think we can agree that violent radicals of any stripe will be violent and that most societies that are not authoritarian will at times, bow to violence.

&gt;And the Chinese won't. Because they're the superpower.

I think the Chinese won't because they are an authoritarian regime, they have access to recourse that is simply not possible in the EU, US or various other parts of the world (although it is not exclusively a Chinese thing).  It should be noted of course that in this case China has cracked down on both the Muslim minority and the Han Chinese (firing upon some that wanted to take revenge today according to the BBC).


&gt;Whats with the thinly veiled insults? 

Quite seriously, I don't do thinly veiled insults, I will generally say what I think.  I don't think that expressing an opinion that I feel you or indeed anyone I am responding to may be ill, misinformed, mis-characterising facts or failing to see nuance is an insult, it is a statement based on what has been discussed.  If you have looked through my comment history I am sure you will have seen that when I do insult someone (usually in retaliation for an insult) I am not doing it in a thinly veiled manner.  So, in short, I am not trying nor intending to insult you in any way, I see no need to, we are having a perfectly sensible discussion. I am sure, indeed I hope, that if you felt that my reasoning was based on a specific flaw whether in the facts (as I pointed out where I thought you were factually incorrect, or at least omitting facts) or if I were over-generalising or over-simplifying things, you would point it out in a clear manner.

As to your specific point

&gt;Seriously, do you really think you hit a flawless and perfectly complex tone here? Or do you really think you have uncovered some secret flaw in my opinion?

I doubt that my position is flawless, although currently cannot see a flaw in it as it relates to this discussion, I also doubt that it is perfectly complex, it too is a simplification of the facts (perfection in this case is unobtainable as we would have to have certainty as to the motivation of every person involved in a violent act) but it is not even close to the level of simplification you present.

Obviously neither of those things happened. Too many west European EU members couldn't bare the thought of Polish plumbers out working and out bidding the native plumbers.

Never the less, the EU successfully steered HALF A FUCKING CONTINENT into democratic and economic reforms without firing a single shot!

Just think about that! 

Sadly the EU didn't push for enough reforms and was too fast to admit some members. And most often as soon as a country was in, it backslid on reforms.

And also sadly this was never an inspiring and transforming movement.
It was this bad bureaucratic slow crawl. With a lot of xenophobia and incompetence mixed in.

Revolution means the taking of power from one group and giving it to another. As you said, those in power will not want to give up their power, and so the only way that these changes can come will be through the taking of power; is that not the definition of revolution? The British certainly did not want to lose control over the American colonies, and they ""had power"". The French monarchy did not want to give up power, and yet they were forced to. Revolutions occur because society can no longer function in the way that it does.

I am saying that such a transformation is possible, but I am not saying that it will happen immediately. Such a transformation of society takes a long time, as we saw with the French revolution. It was a Capitalist revolution against the feudal society that it replaced. But even into the later part of the 19th century, feudalism existed (in one form or another) in France. In fact, the last truly feudal society was overthrown within the last few years in Nepal. They had a successful revolution and are now on their way to capitalism.

But to say that because the people in that society would not be able to function because they grew up in capitalism is to not give human ingenuity enough credit. Humans have but one true nature: to survive. And, in some post-capitalist society, the people in that society would probably falter and have troubles, but eventually a system would be worked out that would allow that society to exist, to thrive. I will not claim to have all the answers, because I do not spend much time thinking about how such a society will be run. I cannot imagine it, just like someone from Feudal Europe in the 1300s could not imagine life in capitalism. And so I worry more about achieving such a society, and knowing full well that I will never live to see it, I can only hope that what little I contribute to the struggle for true freedom and true control for the people over their own lives is of use to those who do live to see such a society.

Now if fictional Frobish were to include the whole truth like the fact that the Germans and many other European Union countries are the only contributors to the UNWRA to the tune of US six hundred million pesos annually  spread over all Arab countries where all  the former evicted residents of Palestine plus offspring are allowed to live apart from the odd bomb or two from Israel try to  live  and none of these funds  come from the paltry farcical nominal tiny amount in the annual general assembly fee that [Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#Funding) pays(not in the top ten notice , but far closer to the bottom ten though) . 

Now here comes the big evil rub , the bulk of what Israel purchases in imports and technology is not from the USA but from you guessed it ""Good Old Europe"" and they run a mega billion dollars trade deficit in to Europe as a whole which is partially offset by America purchasing Israeli goods and [*Intel's*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Gat) flash memory and Atom Netbook CPU's (  now you know why new AMD CPU's  is my first preference) . 

Now Israel runs a huge trade deficit well in excess of seven billion dollars annually (America buys approximately 22 billion dollars of Israeli goods versus Israel buying 10 billion dollars plus the Camp David 4 billion , and why do  people think they are a loyal ally too so Jeffke Mendelvich the retired army general and minister without a portfolio is suffering from Alzheimer's) .

So if the UNRWA is so evil the question becomes since Europe funds this dastardly evil institution , then why does Israel buy so much from the Europeans and from time to time when their State budget blows out and money runs short the Israelis often return annually back to Germany (this is the very same  country that also contributes to the UNRWA too) for more silver marks as war reparation payments .

I've spent quite a lot of time in Berlin as my parents live there, so I'll try and give you some pointers on where to go and what to see.

**Sightseeing/touristing**:

- All the places you mentioned of course. 

- Friedrichstrasse and Kurfurstendamm (on the west side) are good for shopping if you're looking for all the household brands (big fashion).

- The holocoust memorial (the big cinder blocks next to the Brandenburg gate. The museum there is very touching and emotional. Recommend it among the other Juden Museum in Kreuzberg.

- Go up to the Reichstag if you have the patience to wait in line. It's kinda worth it to go there.

- Go see the remainder of the Berlin wall at the east side gallery and also from the made-up watchtower where you can see both sides of the Wall and the dead zone in between (don't remember the street name though). 

- Hackeschermarkt. Very trendy place to go. Lots of local design shops and nicee coffee shops and bars. Recommend Pony bar on Alte Schönhauserstrasse. Very low key and probably the cheapest beer in town. 

- Museum: a) Museum Insel which is situated in Mitte. You can easily spend a whole day or more there. You can buy a special pass that gains you access to all the museums. The Pergamon museum is probably the most famous one but expect to wait in line for some time. b) Neues Museum. They have very interesting modern art exhibitions there that are among the most popular all the time. c) Helmut Newton Photo museum next to the Banhof Zoo. d) deutsche Guggenheim also has interesting exhibitions. 

- Go for a long bike ride. It really is the best way to experience the whole city. There are bike lanes throughout the city. I would recommend going to Kreuzberg (formally the Turkish community but has lately become one of the most popular places to live. Also Prenzlauerberg, lots of galleries, nice bars and coffee shops. Friedrichshain is also a place that I would check out.

**Bars**: 

- Savignyplatz has a lot of life and tons of bars and restaurants. My favourite ones are Hefner (bar lounge) and Gainsbourg (supposed to be one the best cocktail bars in Berlin, also one of the few bars where you can smoke inside). 

- Schöneberg (the gay community) also has a zimmering nightlife. Try out Green Door. Very cool 60's style bar with a great selection of cocktails and fantastic atmosphere. 

**Restaurants**: 

- Try Bochartd if you want to have the best wiener schnitzel in town.

- French restaurant Ruts is also one of the best but a bit expensive. 

- Try out the many kebab shops (in my experience the best ones are in Hackeshermarkt (Shark döner is awsome).

**Nightclubs**: 

- Panorama (Berghain) is a must go to. It's in a huge old factory and is pretty much open all night. Dress very casually and/or alternatively. 

- Weekends is also good, close to Alexanderplatz. 

- Picknick is my favorite but pretty hard to get into (guestlist). 

- Watergate (never been there but is supposed to great. 

- Club 24 also. 

- Sage club is also pretty cool.

- And if you are searching for a younger more commercial crowd and place (lots of hot girls) then go to Matrix. Not really my kind of place but can be really fun if it is packed and you're with a lot of friends.

Overall Berlin is a fantastic city with endless possibilities. With out doubt my favourite city in Europe.

 I even climbed to the top of the dome (there are stairs inside the double-wallled dome) and took photos from the observation balcony there. Look at a photo of St Peters. On the very top of the dome there is what looks to be decoration made up of small columns surmounted by a tiny dome. Those small columns are about 20 feet (6 metres) high.


I did not have to get permission from anyone to do the trip to the top. In fact there was a set of signs, including one which stated that there were 300 and something steps to the top.

CPU: applications are downloaded from the web and run locally, slower CPU would mean that your cloud applications will not be as good as your native ones or worse, they it will be slow, pick one!

Memory: same as CPU

Graphics: same as CPU

Storage: if you really need storage you'll have to have a massive broadband connection to be able to store on the cloud. Completely unrealistic for the next 10 years at least, not even in Europe. If you don't need storage then well, you won't buy storage on your laptop anyway, would you? If you are stupid to pay for 500GB HD on netbook and use 50 of them then it's not my problem.

I agree however that the idea of your data been on the cloud and always available is appealing but you don't need a browser-based OS to do that, I'm doing that already but its awfully slow despite that I have a ""good"" connection with 2 mbps upload. 

It has a long way to go before cloud computing gets to acceptable level, if it ever does. Take facebook for example and compare the facebook photo browser with your photo browser on your desktop, the responsiveness of facebook is CRAP, the features are limited and the pictures are resized.

Just like the need in advertising to trick women/men into needing and wanting diamonds. Diamonds are a commodity just like everything else that is traded in this world, gold, silver, platinum, oil..etc. But this one is more strictly enforced and controlled when it comes to a bulk of the diamond sales in the world. Lets say that 400 pound of diamonds are bought from different sites in Africa in a given year to go onto the open market legally, we`ll speak on the illegal diamond trade a little bit later. They of course buy these rocks at a MASSIVE reduction in price then what we pay for them. Then they are sent to sorting houses in several key places in Europe, The Middle East or in the US to be graded. (NYC, Antwerp, Ramat Gan)  

They are sorted by shape, color, number of carets and so on. Then one or two things happen, some of the raw uncut diamonds are sent to be cut or like most diamonds they are stuffed away into large vaults in order to artificially stabilize the amount of diamonds on the open market to be bought. If you look at the diamond index you will see that even during bad economic times the price of diamonds doesn't crash, it stabilizes and holds it position until economic times are good. They simply cannot allow a vast number of diamonds to be available or the price will tumble and people will loose billions in the process. Not to mention for a complete piece to be made, which could be more then several hundred diamonds, it takes years to piece it in order to match correctly.

After the sorting houses they are put up for sale, but in truth not really. Most diamonds are sold in a cut fashion and bundled into groups but the sales are controlled and restricted to authorized diamond brokers. They don't have a choice in what group of diamonds they are given, they simply pay the wholesale amount for them and are told to GTFO. If your unhappy with the selection of diamonds given there is nobody you can appeal too or complain against. And if you do you will find yourself closed out of any future sale and locked out of the business all together. Piss off dealers in Antwerp and you`ll be locked out at NYC exchange houses. Which would force you to meek out an existence on the secondary diamond market which is higher in price to collect the stones you need and the margins much slimmer in order to make a profit. It sucks but thats the business. The sale of illegal diamonds or what you know as ""conflict diamonds"" or ""blood diamonds, due to which the violent and slave-labor like conditions in which they are mined and the civil wars that they help fund, are still around today. Now many of these stones are smuggled out of these areas and sent to places like indo-china to be cut and then funneled through various sources to reach the great sorting tables. This makes them harder to spot because it is hard to tell the diamond origin's and how it was mined. The industry has set up a way to try and control the flow of rough/cut stones from reaching the market. 

The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was set up to try and stop this from happening anymore, which makes you wonder what went on before people gave a shit that some poor guy's arm was chopped off for not mining fast enough. Besides the Kimerley Process is nothing more then an AGREEMENT by other countries that they will follow the rules, its what is called a ""soft law"". There is no legally binding attachment to the legislation so there can be no legal consequences for a violation of the agreement. So there is still abuse, there are still blood diamonds reaching the market through smuggling or ""Officialdom of certificates and paperwork"", basically bullshit paperwork. Amnesty International has welcomed the Kimbery Process but still wishes more was to be done, so far their calls have fallen on deaf ears from the industry. They really don't care about how the diamonds are mined as long as they get to control the flow and amount on the market, blood diamonds or no. So ladies...I tell you...if you have a diamond on your finger there is a possible chance that your diamond caused pain, death and suffering. So yeah FUCK diamonds and fuck the people who want them.

It's a war on everyone who cares for kids. The way that tragic events are written about in the paper, makes parents and other caregivers think that the strict laws and policies being made, target some creep in a trenchcoat lurking waiting to abduct kids in a park. But that's not the case. The laws are against sexual interactions with children - and the policies which evolve around these laws are there to try to finger people before they commit the crime. I was visiting my sister in law recently, and I saw her little two year old did as most two year olds do - clinging to his parent's skirt, burying his face in his parents' pant legs and clothes-covered crotch. Her casual joke to me about this, was that ""he already knows where the good stuff is."" And this kind of casual interaction happens in every family. Those who have children and work with children daily are the ones who need to be worried about these laws. People on the internet who collect illicit kinds of pornography are very savvy and know how to avoid crossing the legal lines. The ones who should be concerned about these laws are the parents and caregivers who are constantly cuddling with children, and expressing affection through touch with them.

It reminds me of when the mass media first started using the word ""terrorism"" after the late 2001 events in New York City. I actually thought that people would see through that concept, because of what the word meant. The word refers to those who use violence on populations of civilians in order to achieve a political goal. Well, what is any act of war sanctioned by a government? Isn't it the same thing? But people, for years, never saw that fact clearly. They bought into the narrative of a ""terrorist"" being a boogeyman who lurks in the alleyways, ready to detonate his or her suicide vest. They thought of a crazy religious nut. The same thing has happened with the word ""pedophile"" - people buy into the narrative of this kidnapper lurking in the public park - a loner who is not like the rest of us. And they believe the laws target this person. But that's not true. The laws target an action, not a type of person. And everyone who works with small kids daily - especially siblings and parents of them - are accustomed to touch interactions with these children which do get dangerously close to the type of touch interactions which the laws are there to prosecute. 

Now, I'm not saying that we should stop caressing and cuddling with children - far from it. Children need to be touched and caressed and held. There was a study once of an eastern european orphanage where infants were not often picked up and held - and these kids were found to be actually dying without this kind of physical affection. And yet, this anti-pedophile hysteria really does a disservice to children, in that it dissuades caring adults from seeking to work with children, and to be a part of their lives. Also, the concept of ""stranger-danger"" means that kids grow up in some cities to be very antisocial. If a kid is taught that you always have to mistrust your neighbors until individuals prove themselves to you - he or she is going to grow up to be kind of an offish person who doesn't know how to make friends - or find other social opportunities for himself. The other day, I was on an intercity bus going through Boise Idaho, and there I saw two elementary school aged kids (a brother and a sister?) happily circling their bicyles in the intersection as the bus pulled up to turn - and then the kids rode away cheerfully on the sidewalk. That's the kind of city that is doing right by its kids. Cities where parents teach kids to suspect and shirk their adult neighbors - to lower their gaze, and sullenly walk on by when they are addressed casually - are not doing their kids any favors at all.",0,otterplay,t1_c0awm25,0,,True,True

First, the Israelis have no use for nuclear strike capability outside the Middle East and South Asia. (It's conceivable they might want to deter nuclear-armed Pakistan, but that's about as far as their ambitions could rationally go.)

Second, supposing they did feel a need for worldwide nuclear strike capability, they already have it via the Jericho III ballistic missile and the Dolphin-class submarine.

&gt; It is estimated that the Jericho III entered service by 2008.

&gt; The Jericho III is believed to have a three-stage solid propellant and a payload of 1,000 to 1,300 kg. It is possible for the missile to be equipped with a single 750 kg nuclear warhead or two or three low yield MIRV warheads... It is estimated that it has a range of 4,800 to 11,500 km (2,982 to 7,180 miles), and probably significantly greater with a smaller payload of 350 kg (one Israeli nuclear warhead)...

&gt; According to an official report which was submitted to the American congress in 2004 [2], it may be that with a payload of 1000 kg the Jericho 3 gives Israel nuclear strike capabilities within the entire Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia and almost all parts of North America, as well as within large parts of South America and North Oceania. The range of the Jericho 3 also provides an extremely high impact speed for nearby targets, enabling it to avoid any ballistic missile defenses that may develop in the immediate region[6].

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_missile#Jericho_III

&gt; In May 2000 Israel is reported to have secretly carried out its first test launches from two German-built Dolphin-class submarines of cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The missiles launched from vessels off Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean are said to have hit a target at a range of about **1,500 kilometers** [about 930 statute miles]. Israel is reported to possess a 200kg nuclear warhead, containing 6kg of plutonium, that could be mounted on cruise missiles.

http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/missile/popeye-t.htm

Here's an interesting tidbit vis-a-vis the Dolphin submarines. Go to Google Maps and use the distance measurement tool to calculate the distance from the northeast corner of the Mediterranean to Tehran. It's almost exactly... **1,500 km**.

In my experience anti-French sentiment is a result of the French language sounding fairly effeminate to an American ear, coupled with a perception Americans have that French are elitists, and, being ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys,"" are in no position to be.

The surrender thing conveniently fits in with those two things.  

Another issue is the French tend to assert their sovereignty and openly disagree with the US government to the annoyance of an American public used to getting their way in Europe, militarily.  Which is precisely what, ironically, the United States would do were the situation reversed.  Occasionally the French display their balls at the US and I think that annoys some Americans.  How uncharitable to buck the stereotypes.

However it is my observation that those who are most critical of France tend to know the least about them and tend to be undereducated.

I do not have this particular issue, and I know several people who have visited France and had nothing but good to say not only about the beauty of the country, but that people tended to be friendly and helpful, provided you showed due respect by at least attempting the language and not being an ass.

As an American, I personally have no issues with France.  I don't particularly care much about World War II, and see and respect them as a country enlightened enough to throw off monarchy.

Thomas Paine is an important figure in both of our histories, and he is a personal hero of mine, and he clearly saw France as a worthwhile place.

No, that wasn't my suggestion. They have the same issues there as any other Chinese person.

&gt; If you are suggesting them to go within China, that does not really help them because they'll still be second class citizens because the way they look

OK, so what's your point? Don't bother doing anything because some people are prejudiced?

Would you make the same argument about Aboriginals in Australia or Native Americans in the USA? They are all treated as second class citizens. What you say is true, but it's not a argument. 

&gt; If you think han chinese decided to move to E.Turkistan on their own, you are in error, since this was a chinese assimilation project.

If you think the Indians I mentioned did so on their own, then you would also be in error. It was a government program to repopulate after WW2. 

Offering tax incentives to relocate to a particular location happens in every single country in the world. Why do you think so many Brits did the colony thing? Only a very small number of those sent to the USA and later Oz were convicts. The whole west coast of the USA because populated by westerners for this very reason: go there, stake your claim, be successful.

Now, the question remains, is China doing this to ""assimilate"" the region? I've yet to see any proof of that that sets it apart from any other migration. Our modern ""need a visa"", ""anti-immigration"" approach is an artificial new thing in this world; previously peoples moved all the time. You are pointing at one such movement then pointing at China and making the assumption that their less-than-amicable government must be behind it. Maybe that's the production centre of China and they are all assembly line workers?

Stinnett, the author of ""Day of Deceit"", concurs.

&gt; If the US had sat on its hands for much longer, England and Russia might have fallen

The US had, in reality, already entered the war against Germany before Pearl Harbor.

We had launched a massive military buildup. We were shipping England war supplies including tons of weapons. We were escorting convoys halfway into the Atlantic and sinking German U-boats. Just before Pearl Harbor, one German U-boat fired back and sank a US destroyer.

We -- de facto -- had already entered the war before Pearl Harbor.

What FDR's plan to provoke Japan into attacking the US did was give the US population a rallying point.

In WWI, the US population was highly divided entering that European war. For example, Socialist presidential candidate Eugene Debs got 6% of the vote while sitting in jail for opposing WWI.

FDR's plan to provoke Japan into attacking ensured a more unified country would fight WWII. With FDR's deceit, WWII would not be a WWI repeat -- the population was more united.

&gt; Can we calculate the damage that's been done to us by incompetent leaders, willing to deceive us and enabled by FDR's actions?

*That* is the $50 question!

Regardless of your insightful question, the historical documents that Stinnett uncovered with Freedom of Information Act requests prove his case.

The US Congress has found it as fact that the local Hawaiian commanders -- Admiral Kimmel and General Short -- were deliberately kept out of the intelligence loop.

Stinnett's groundbreaking FOIA requests and the documents he uncovered *proves* FDR not only knew, but also actively provoked Japan to attack.

Western Europeans are terrified of two types of people: Muslims from North Africa and/or the Middle East, and Eastern Europeans.  In Germany this is particularly bad: a large Turkish population which is generally reviled (despite Turks on the whole being friendly, personable and hardworking) and, thanks to being the ""gateway to the East"", a lot of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who are also seen as generally degenerate.

None of it has any basis in reality, but then, how often does xenophobia?  Just look at the US attitude towards Mexican immigrants, for example.

I think in Europe it might actually be worse than in the US because the US for better or worse has a certain cognizance of being a ""nation of immigrants.""  When someone (usually white) says that the US should protect some distinctly anglo heritage (like forcing everyone to speak English, or not wear a veil, or not eat dog, or whatever) the general retort -- and it's a good retort -- is that that anglo heritage just happens to be the culture of one of many groups of immigrants, and should receive no special treatment.  After all, no one is seriously suggesting that we all learn Lakota or Navajo, for example, or that we all try to live like the original inhabitants of the United States did.

But in Europe the issue is a little more complex.  In my native France, people will say that Arabs are diluting or destroying French culture, and that the sound of Maghreb Arabic and the smell of cardamom in the streets is turning their cities and towns into something that is not French.  While the argument is at the core the same argument, the ""we're all immigrants"" retort that we can use so readily to silence it here in the US doesn't have anywhere near the same impact on the discussion.

So how do you address xenophobia?

My personal view is that nationalism is stupid anyway, and that ""melting pot"" countries like the US and Australia have proven that even when you have many cultures living in one place, people retain their cultural identities.  So my general feeling is, if you're French and your neighbor isn't, who cares?  On the upside, you can eat a kebab for lunch, and everyone wins.

You should also be aware that the US is really one of the only developed countries that *doesn't* have socialized medicine.  It's difficult to point out a trend.

However, note also that Singapore has one of the best health care systems in the world.  It beats the pants off Europe in terms of performance/$.  Singapore's government only pays for around 30% of health care costs (the US government pays for 40%, for comparison).  Now, I would still probably consider Singapore's health care to be socialist, but it's more of a blend between a socialist and capitalist system.

A tip for American people:

Come to any Western-European country to make a life.

* A place where nobody dies of treatable illnesses (if science allows for it, you'll always survive... even if you don't have a cent in your pocket). Full cancer treatment (not only the initial therapy but they also partially help you with the lifetime medicines you'll have to take), heart transplants, most surgeries, and whatnot. Just anything that you may suddenly need.
* A place where, generally, cops are friendly people who can be trusted if you need help or protection at any time, and who are usually there to make your life easier on a daily basis, not to mess with you.
* A place where, except in some countries (ehem... UK... ehem...), we have an excellent gastronomic culture with delicious as well as healthy food, as proven by the ridiculously lower obesity stats compared to those of the US. Eating in a Burger King will probably be one of the last things you'd want to do when you have tried the *real* food.
* A place where you won't ever go broke because of an illness. If something renders you unable to work for a very long time (or for the rest of your life), the government will pay you a monthly amount in compensation depending on your level of inability.

Seriously, I just can't find a good reason why anyone would want to live there. Maybe Obama will change this (I hope so), but I just can't understand why Americans haven't been marching in protest for the past decades while your government was laughing at you, and what's more, I just can't believe that there are actual American citizens who defend that system!!

Even the most capitalist-""rightist"" countries as you would call them, have a social health care system. It's hard to believe that the most ""powerful"" country in the world has its people living in fear, knowing that an unexpected illness could ruin their whole lives.

In reality, we were already fighting the Germans on a limited scale.

We had launched a massive military buildup. We were shipping England war supplies including tons of weapons. We had armed Navy ships escorting convoys halfway into the Atlantic and sinking German U-boats. Before Pearl Harbor, one German U-boat fired back and sank a US destroyer.

We -- de facto -- had already entered the war before Pearl Harbor. But as you said, it was without popular support.

&gt; I think it's probable that we were an expecting a Japanese attack, but we had no specific timeframe, and we had no idea where they would strike. I also think that we didn't expect an attack on Hawaii, so close to America.

In short, we *knew* *exactly* where and when Japan was going to attack. When Admiral Kimmel ordered out ~100 ships NW of Hawaii to find the Japanese fleet the War Dept. ordered his ships back to port -- FDR wanted the Japanese to commit an overt, deliberate act of war.

That act did unify the country, but ~3000 Americans paid dearly for that unification.

American ""containment"" policy would have resulted in land wars fought mostly through proxies in South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East; if anything the ME of this alternate future would be even more fucked up than the existing one.

Note that a cold war is basically a test of economies - whoever builds the shinier toys first wins. Even with Poland, France and a number of other European former-countries under its thumb, Germany would likely not have had the economic prowess to keep up with the United States indefinitely; eventually, one would possess clearly superior technology, or one would collapse after a series of poor financial decisions and payments to the military-industrial complex (this, after all, is what did in the USSR).",0,DemonWasp,t1_c0ax1ag,0,,True,False

The problem becomes excessive immigration with a low level of cultural assimilation, the creation of muslim ghettos and neigbourhoods where the culture from which they escaped becomes the sole identity they have, alienated from their new fellow countrymen. 

The islamification is gradually happening, and the lack of actual, reasonable and unprejudiced debate on issues concerning the core values of western Europe, leave natives bereft of cultural belonging and the building of confidence in just what to preserve and what to leave behind from their own culture. This leads to the over sized crazy, ignorant, malicious, racist behavior, fueled by irrational and misguided fear, and thus become manifested in the actions of this clearly lesser being, the Russian mad man.

The tragedy is the wall between islamists and secularists, is built on incidents such as this one. They break down the bridges of reconciliation, the hope for compromise that will lead to a more enlightened, better informed and diverse, secular society in which cultures matter not.

Of course things are different when you're talking about violent crimes but mostly I don't see why you need that kind of protection with every-day crimes or lawsuits like insults or divorces.
I don't see any reason why people should be checked with a metal detector when dealing with minor crimes.. after all most people are not as crazy and kill people with knifes in a court room and I'm sure in most European countries you won't find that much security like in the US.

&gt;Do you really think that going to the doctor now using insurance doesn't mean the insurance company isn't involved?

It depends on the procedure.  Most often the biggest involvement they have is writing a check.  With government funded healthcare, there is no need for anyone to be involved.  Again, you need to go do a hell of a lot of reading on how this works in countries where it exists.

&gt;They get paperwork listing exactly all the doctor knows about you, and they tell the doctor exactly what he'll be paid to do.

In a government funded system the doctors are just licensed to treat you as they see fit.  It doesn't have to go through a committee like it does through our current for-profit insurance based system.

&gt;Now imagine that on a federal scale.

See above.

&gt;Or even easier, go look at medicare and medicaid, and imagine that for everyone.

That's not universal healthcare either.

Start your education here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care#Europe

&gt;One of the most socialized systems of universal health care is the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom, which was established in the wake of World War II, in 1948. Every facet of medical care is covered entirely from tax revenues, so that patients need not pay at all, either into a general insurance fund or in direct fees to a medical provider. Medicines, meals, lodging, and services are all provided, as are incidental costs such as outpatient care and equipment. In the past the NHS was criticized for offering a fairly low quality of health care, and for extended wait times for service. Since the late 1990s the government has invested substantially more money in the NHS, modernizing it drastically and bringing it up to a par with the rest of Europe. The NHS has also begun to interact more heavily with the private sector, often outsourcing entire segments of health care to non-governmentally controlled interests.

&gt;No, but it certainly appears that you have.

Logically you make no sense, as I'm the one who made the point and you were challenging it.

I said that we don't have the same kind of problem with auto insurance.

You replied:
&gt;Not everyone needs to drive. Everyone needs to be healthy.

Everyone needing to be healthy isn't relevant to the question about whether converting to an auto-insurance type method would be better for people.

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;    Again, did you entirely miss the point. Preventing the surcharge in the first place would eliminate that problem.

&gt;No, again, that would be you missing the point entirely. 

Nope.  Again, as I'd made the point that you challenged, it means only you could be missing it unless you claim I'm missing my own point, which is logically impossible.

As you replied to my statement saying that
&gt;No it doesn't. If you read the article completely, you would see that it causes some small employers to either go bankrupt and everyone employed there is out of work, or to fire the one employee.

which completely ignores the statement that I said we should prevent the surcharge in the first place.

&gt;As long as healthcare and insurance are for-profit, these surcharges will exist. If it's not a surcharge, it will be an administrative fee. If it's not an administrative fee, it will be a filing fee. If it's not a surcharge, administrative fee, or filing fee, your rates will just be astronomical.

If we can't do it with private insurance, then we can't do it with federal management either, unless you imagine that because the feds run it, they can somehow manage to get medicine to cost less.

The basic problem with private insurance is that they can get away with corrupt tactics to drop people who cost a lot.  Eliminate that and the cost gets spread out among all who pay into the insurance, which is what insurance is supposed to do.

&gt;These are businesses. They have shareholders to answer to. Shareholders expect growth, year on year. How can you do that, as an insurance company, aside from charging people more money and getting rid of customers that cost you more than they pay in?

You're imagining I said anyone can.  However, that's not the same thing is forcing insurance companies to pay the bills of their own clients.  Someone who pays the insurance company for 10 years shouldn't get dropped suddenly just because they suddenly start costing them money.

If it means that the insurance rates go up somewhat, such is what insurance is for.

Shareholders expect growth, year after year, sure, but too bad.  Businesses don't always make huge ridiculous profits.  No one can reasonably promise shareholders that they will continue to see huge growth, especially if it comes from corrupt actions such as forcing employers to drop expensive employees.

&gt;Well, no shit. What he's pushing isn't universal healthcare.

No. He's pushing a government option, but did you even read how that option will be paid for?  An extra tax on businesses, even if already pay for insurance.  An extra tax on wealthy americans (but somehow that level of wealth is undefined.) 

&gt;The bill obama is pushing has a fine for people who don't have insurance.

&gt;And it's retarded.

Agreed.  But there have been retarded laws passed before.

&gt;&gt; Choice was going to be eliminated.

&gt;Also retarded.

And it got scarily close to passing anyway.

&gt;It seems to me you need to do a fair amount of research on how this works elsewhere.

Not relevant.  Our system can't be converted easily over to any other country's system. It's too huge and ugly.  It would be a thousand times worse than trying to convert to the metric system.

Even the democrats are afraid of universal health care.  No matter what happens, somehow there will have to be rationing but no one wants to be the bad guy who says someone is too old or not worth saving.  There was just an article on it on reddit today about it, if I could find it.

&gt;It seems to me you need to do a fair amount of research on how this works elsewhere.

Btw, just a LITTLE offensive.

&gt;It depends on the procedure. Most often the biggest involvement they have is writing a check. With government funded healthcare, there is no need for anyone to be involved. Again, you need to go do a hell of a lot of reading on how this works in countries where it exists.

Even in that blog, the insurance company had to give approval.  You really think the fed wouldn't have to give approval for something?  You really think there wouldn't be any kind of limits?

&gt;In a government funded system the doctors are just licensed to treat you as they see fit. It doesn't have to go through a committee like it does through our current for-profit insurance based system.

You mean like in britain where you request an operation and wait to get on the list?  They still have approvals there.

I think you need to do a little more research yourself there.

&gt;&gt; Or even easier, go look at medicare and medicaid, and imagine that for everyone.

Actually, if the feds provided universal health care, that's pretty much the form we'd get it in.  Your claims that medicare isn't universal health care is coming across as an attempt to just ignore the point.

&gt;Start your education here:

Again, you could have phrased that without being offensive.  Something like ""here's a link to how Europe does it"" would have been quite polite.

Regardless, how the UK does it is not that relevant to us. We're much bigger than the UK, and not everyone here would welcome or accept a socialist approach.

We pay a lot more into health care here on average, either through insurance costs or through federal taxes.  But a lot of that goes to research and development, which helps out other countries.

Somewhat correct.  Because the experimental treatment would not exist, were it not for the pharmaceutical company.  

And I'm not trying to defend Big Pharma here.  I think that a big problem is that *everyone* believes in Doing Everything Possible, even when this doesn't make sense on sensible cost-benefit grounds.  Doctors do it to make money, and out of a misguided sense of obligation.  Patients and family do it from a fear of death and a sense of duty.  The medical industry creates gold-treated, marginally better but incredibly expensive treatments to make money.

Insurance companies probably skim a 15% excess in administrative fees over a single-payer system.   And pharmaceutical sales in the USA are $266 billion in 2005, or about 1/8 of total health care costs.  So if we cut the cost of pharmaceuticals by 1/2 and get rid of the administrative excess, we will save 20% on health care.  That's nice, but won't bring us down to European levels of spending.

Anyone who thinks that all systems don't ration care is deluded.  The USA rations care by cutting off insurance.  Other countries simply don't provide certain treatments at all.  The trick is set the cutoff to a point where beneficial treatments are paid for, and dubious ones aren't.

They don't. There's a whole slew of oversensitive liberals who react at the drop of hat to the slightest hint of racism. See for instance the New York Post Obama cartoon that included ambiguous racial overtones. But this was simply beyond the pale, and I think there are far fewer people who would find it acceptable. Regrettably, that number is not as low as most of us would like.

In other words, we have standards, and Fox consistently falls beneath them.

&gt; I think the reason that they exist is because Americans, as a general rule, have never been up close to the threat of Nazism destroying their country, as the Europeans have.

I don't understand. We have a culture that values certain rights and liberties far more than Europeans, and we also have a culture that resists some forms of political correctness.

Predicting what will take off and what won't is very hard.  Additionally the economics of various things change over time (eg CPU/memory/bandwidth/power/storage/3d graphics)  are always changing and what is uneconomical today may be profitable tomorrow.

Most companies pick a few narrow things and try to succeed with those.  Sometimes they get lucky and more often they fail. Sometimes they are too early, others too late.

Google's approach is more of throw stuff out there and see what sticks.  By keeping things labelled as ""beta"" or from the labs they can keep the expectations low.  It is also more driven from the people working there bottom up rather than the top honchos working it all out.  This approach will lead to failures but the successes should outweigh the failures (eg one success out of a group of 50 failures should easily be able to have financed those failures).

The point is that every heritage, every culture, contains propositional content--values associated with it that will be either good or bad. Cutting off your daughter's genitals for any reason is just plain wrong, regardless of how old the tradition is.

The reason for this is that, because ""We Hold These Truths to be Self-Evident,"" we (democracies) have placed moral relevance with the individual rather than the community, religious, ethnic, or otherwise. *True* multiculturalism is acknowledging the weaknesses of your own culture and learning what the best other cultures have to offer might be.

&gt; **Circumcision was nearly universal well-before most Jews arrived from Eastern Europe in the late 19th, early 20th century**

That's [completely unfounded](http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/USA/); in 1932, only 31% of Americans were circumcised.

&gt; **and historically every single medical organization has either taken a favorable or neutral stance towards it.**

No, this is very false. Just peruse [these statements](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/). Even in America, medical organizations have been skeptical and officially so since 1971. In Europe (and Australia), the medical organizations are more willing to call circumcision a violation of human rights.

In Europe (and elsewhere), circumcision is a last resort for only serious problems (gentically inherited BXO).

Just consider that Sweden requires a special license for circumcision (mainly for Jews and Muslims), the Netherlands and Denmark have publicly considered laws against male circumcision, and Finland outlawed male circumcision (even in hospitals) in 2006. Here's what Finland's Central Union for Child Welfare [had to say in 2003 about male circumcision](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/finland2003/):

&gt; The Central Union for Child Welfare considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person.

&gt; Circumcision intervenes in the sexual integrity of a male child causing a permanent change in organisms and has consequences pertaining to both health and quality of life.

&gt; The circumcision of girls is rightly considered as inhuman mutilation of the genitals and is punished abuse. Also boys must be guaranteed a similar protection by law.

&gt; According to the opinion of the Central Union for Child Welfare in Finland nobody has the right, on behalf of the child, to consent to operation, violating the bodily integrity of the child, if it is not done to treat an illness. According to the Child Welfare Act the child has a right to special protection. The Child Custody and Right of Access Act bans the subduing and humiliation of a child.

Circumcision *clearly* is a violation of human rights, dignity, respect, and personal liberty.

&gt; **Not to mention that despite the bulk of world Jewry existing in Europe until WWII, and the fact that like American Jews they did and continue to be overrepresented in science, medicine, media, arts, business etc. circumcision never took root.**

Firstly, Americans took on the Victorian culture of Britain (the country of origin of circumcision in the West until WWII shocked some sense into them), and the puritanical-old-time-religion Christians of America looked to the Old Testament (Jewish tradition) in ways that the European Christians have not for a very long time (there's a reason why ""Judeo-Christian"" came out of the U.S.).

In Africa they call this ""Africa time"". Black people just can't be bothered with being on time, etc... Africans will also almost never save up money or be as likely to go into long term relationships - they ""live for the day"".

The reasons for this is probably fairly complex. Africans have a different survival strategy (called a ""r strategy"") while white people have an ""K"" strategy).

So lets skip all the business about refugees you started out with, shall we? The Finnish social system is well developed (although seemingly slowly deteriorating) to handle Finns. It isn't, however, well adapted to handling immigration. I simply don't know what you mean by ""training"" because there certainly are plenty of immigrants (largely but not exclusively Somalis) who do not welcome training or the training simply doesn't meet the required standards to accodomate them into mainstream society. Immigrants who work and get into working life quickly have the best chances of making a life for themselves - this does not happen because of some government program.

&gt; **I took issue with your absurd claim that Judaism or ""Jews"" as a monolithic entity are somehow mostly or wholly responsible for the prevalence of circumcision in the United States**

I never said any such thing. It is simply the fact that a large portion of the meaningfully pro-circumcision crowd in the U.S. history has been and is Jewish, and I provided cited information.

&gt; **There is no clear scientific consensus on what effect, if any, it has on sexual performance or sensitivity, and there are studies affirming both sides**

The foreskin provides a unique gliding (mechanical) action and tens of thousands of fine-touch receptors that *complement* the coarse-touch receptors of the glans penis (and the foreskin furthre protects the penis when not having sex). Its function and usefulness to sex is well understood by those who aren't searching desperately for confirmation that cutting off what would become [15 square inches](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/) of erogenous tissue has no effect. Ridiculous.

&gt; **- but there is a clear consensus on the potential role it can play in the decreasing the spread and contraction of venereal diseases, chiefly in the 3rd world and Africa.**

No, there is not.

Firstly, it *is* unanimous that safe sexual behavior is the only effective means of preventing the spread of STDs; circumcised males must learn safe sexual practices just the same (indeed, America has a rate of HIV infection 3.5x higher than the next advanced (non-circumcising) nation.

Secondly, **children do not have sex; they do not get sexually transmitted diseases**.

There have been serious criticisms of those U.N. studies in Africa, and medical organizations around the world have scoffed at them. Moreover, there are studies that show circumcision does not help stop the spread of STDs. [Here is one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract) (though not statistically significant, the *circumcised* males in the study were at a slightly higher rate of infection).

&gt; **Actively promoting it among gentiles would be heretical.**

Medical circumcision is explicitly treated as not being religious by Jews, so this argument is baseless. It's also baseless, because it doesn't hold with how real people behave.

&gt; **Even in their own country, Jews used to wear fake foreskins when competing in Hellenistic athletic events during the Alexandrian rule in Judea, for christ's sake.**

Yes, which is why Rabbis instituted *Brit Pariah*, the removal of all of the foreskin (including the inner foreskin), which is modern Jewish circumcision and what medicine calls ""radical circumcision"". This was done to keep Jewish men from stretching out any remnant foreskin into a 'new' foreskin (a process called ""foreskin restoration"" today).

&gt; **I'd also like to point out that the vast majority of circumcising countries all have Jewish populations hovering around zero.**

The are no vast majorities here. Outside of Islam, Judaism, America, South Korea, and backwards tribes in Africa and Australia perform circumcision. South Korea only started doing it 60 years ago when the American military showed up; today, South Koreans largely think that circumcision is universal among all men or they think that it's what good Christians do (the rest succumb to peer pressure).

It's already been stated that Jews are overrepresented in the medical field in the U.S.

Furthermore, the early American masses saw themselves as the inheritors of the Hebrew Bible such that they later took on the Victorian culture of Britain (the country and culture of origin of circumcision in the West until WWII shocked some sense into them), and the puritanical-old-time-religion Christians of America looked to the Old Testament (Jewish tradition) in ways that the European Christians have not for a very long time (there's a reason why ""Judeo-Christian"" came out of the U.S.).

The point is that the U.S. was susceptible to the small Jewish minority who had influence far beyond their numbers. Even today, I'm sure you would agree that Jews have quite an influence over the entertainment industry---there are all kinds of references to Jewish culture, circumcision in particular; unlike European television, shows in the U.S. that feature circumcision usually paint it in a positive light (as evidenced by the link I posted earlier).

And it was over 200 years ago, and 300 years ago too... The latest war wasn't over in people's minds until about ten years ago when people once again started to feel they could talk about what happened without fear of reprisal. In past wars (not the latest one, of course), Russian soldiers have followed orders to burn the land, rape and kill the population, and take the children as slaves. With a past like that, it takes a while to ""let it go"", especially if you're not even allowed to talk about it. Maybe it'll happen in a few generations, unless Putin has other plans.

No, or at least we disagree on the definition of ""hard-pressed"".

Okay, Kielder Forrest is a massive forest on the border of Scotland and England, the biggest forest in England, and one of the biggest in Europe. Covering a massive 200 square miles, it’s not a great place to get lost. However, it is a very beautiful area, and there is a reservoir, Kielder Water, there too.

So anyway, one day, I’m bored, and I phone my mate and say, “Wanna go to Kielder?” Now, Kielder is a good hour away from where I live, and that’s putting pedal to the metal. Why I decided to go there, I do not know. But, my mate agreed, we jumped into the car, and literally sped off.

So an hour later, we arrive in Kielder, and I find this forestry track, with a clear sign on it “Forestry Commission Vehicles Only”. Did I have a Forestry Commission Vehicle? No. Did I go on it? Of course.

So off I drive, on this windy, gravely track. Bear in mind, people, that this year the Pirelli International Rally had 115 miles of racing in Kielder Forest – that’s the kind of terrain we’re talking about here.

So anyway, I’m taking a leisurely drive. Parts of the track are wet and muddy, and it’s brilliant. I gain confidence, and speed up. After half an hour, I’m back where I started. And man, had I enjoyed it.

Now, the point that I started at had a cattle grid and a gate. So I said to my mate, “How about we do a timed circuit?”

So I got out my stopwatch, reset my odometer, and floored it. Naturally, there was a certain amount of wheelspinning, but then we were off, careening along this winding track like a bat out of hell. It was awesome. Down dips in fifth gear, up hills in second, round hairpin bends with the handbrake yanked fully up, fishtailing out onto straights. Everything was going well. And then disaster struck.

We had been driving for six minutes, and had covered 6.2 miles, when I was doing about 30mph down a straight stretch. There was a slight bend in the road, and I hit the brakes. Worse thing to do on gravel. The car slid to the left. I yanked the wheel to the right – too much. The car veered to the right. I panicked, and yanked the wheel left. We headed to the grass verge. Again, I panicked, and yanked the wheel to the right – far too hard. We left the track, and the car slid into an embankment, and stopped with back breaking suddenness. We were at a 45 degree angle, stuck in a V shaped ditch. I looked out of my window, and all I could see was grass compressed against the window. We sat in the car, and I turned the ignition off. I calmed down, and turned the ignition back on, confident that I could get out of this mess. I put it in reverse, and floored it. The wheels just span in the wet grass. The speedo went up to fifty, but the car didn’t budge. My mate told me there was nothing I could do. So, reluctantly, I got out of the car.

We were in the middle of nowhere, and now we didn’t have a car. It was cold, and was about three o’clock. There was no signal on my phone. We started walking. Finally, I got a signal, and called the police. I told them that I had crashed my car, and we were on a dirt track, and the nearest tourist point that I could remember. Unfortunately, I got the tourist point wrong – there was no such place. For four hours we walked, and by the time we got back to our starting point, it was dark. Yes, it had taken us four hours to walk the distance that we had driven in six minutes!

The police found us at the side of the road, and cancelled the helicopter that was about to take off searching for us.

I explained that I had got lost, and had swerved to hit a deer and that’s how the car got where it was – I was sure I was going to lose my license!

The police radioed the Forestry Commission, and we all went looking for my car.

Fortunately, I could remember where I had ‘parked’ it, and kept telling the police, “It only took us about five minutes to get there.” I wish I had kept my mouth shut, though, because it took us twenty minutes to get there in the police jeep.

The Forestry Commission managed to pull the car, with a struggle, from the ditch, and, amazingly, there was no damage bar a broken back window. Even the wing mirror was intact!

But there was a problem. In all the confusion earlier, I had left the doors unlocked when I left it. And, get this, someone had actually come along, found my car, opened the door, opened the bonnet, and stolen the car battery! So the car was still going nowhere.

The police took me to a train station, where I got the train home. The next day, I went out and bought a battery, and went back up to Kielder, fitted the battery to my car, and drove it home.

The tracking needed re-aligning, but apart from that, the car was running fine.

So, there you go. My adventures rallying, albeit not officially, in Kielder. Would I do it again? OF COURSE!!!!

You just start about 6 years of medschool (most of Europe probably works like that). Of course, however your system in Australia works, it's probably useful to do some kind of science classes before you start medschool. It's very helpful to understand basics in chemistry, biology and physics. 

The hours will differ greatly depending on where you work and countrywise, they probably are different for every hospital and every specialty. Most of the time, I work between 60 and 85 hours a week.

Right now, I am doing surgery, though I'm not sure if that's what I really want to specialize in. Here, you don't sign up for some specialty-residency-program, the first year after medschool, you just start somewhere, anywhere, and learn the basics about being a doctor. Then you still can choose your way through the different specialties towards the specialisation you want to work in. I chose surgery for my first year, because you lear so many usefull skills, and it's so satisfying to see the results of your work. Plus, afters years of studying, it's nice to do something, that does not just happen in your head.
Of course, to be honest, other specialities might be more interesting, because they are more intellectually challenging. Most people develop their preferences during medschool. If you have not even started yet, don't worry if you don't know which specialty to chose. You will get a good look at most of them during your clinical rotations.

Anyone who believes this is a fucking cretin and should go back to Africa, more specifically somewhere around the Rift Valley, from where their ur-ancestors first dragged their hairy knuckles to other continents.

&gt; ""Fitting in"" and ""learning the local ways"" are all in our heads. 

So is the concept of civilization, of social rules and norms, but these are what allow us to live in peace and prosperity and keep our countries from turning into war torn, shit smeared hellholes.  Everyone should be free to go where they please, within limits, and those limits include respecting the people who have lived their for 5, 10, 20 years or all their lives.  

I've lived in 7 countries on 4 continents, took it upon myself to learn, despite the fact that it's not very easy for me, the languages of two of them where the ones I already spoke weren't native (I fear this one's going to be kind of a bitch to pick up), obey their laws, pay their taxes, try to follow the rules even if I think they're stupid (hint:  Amsterdamers and bicycles...) and avoid places where I could never ever honestly bring myself to integrate (most of the Middle East, I imagine.)  I don't think that's too much to expect of any migrant in search of a better life, especially one who settles somewhere.

I'm not talking about completely subordinating your personality, because yes, immigration lends some healthy change to any culture (my home country is better for it), but for example, in the fairly tolerant European countries I've spent time in, there is no acceptable room for honor killings, religious hate propaganda, human trafficking, forced marriages, female circumcision, ethnic violence, denigrating women who don't wear clothing you find appropriate, clan feuds, or any number of other nasties that are unfortunately very prevalent among a lot of people from various fly-blown shitpots around the world.

For nothing is more democratic than logic; it is no respecter of persons and makes no distinction between crooked and straight noses.  (Incidentally, Europe owes the Jews no small thanks for making people think more logically and for establishing *cleanlier* intellectual habits--nobody more so than the Germans who are a lamentably *déraisonnable* race who to this day are still in need of having their ""heads washed"" first.

He got lucky. Hypertext existed before him. The internet existed before him (invented by DARPA). 

&gt; [The File Retrieval and Editing SyStem, or FRESS, was a hypertext system developed at Brown University in 1968 by Andries van Dam and his students, including Ted Nelson and Bob Wallace. FRESS was a continuation of work done on van Dam's previous hypertext system, HES, developed the previous year. FRESS ran on an IBM 360-series mainframe running VM/CMS. It implemented one of the first virtual-terminal interfaces, and could run on various terminals from dumb typewriters up to the Imlac PDS-1 graphical minicomputer. On the PDS-1, it supported multi-window WYSIWYG editing and graphics display. Notably, the PDS-1 used a lightpen rather than a mouse, and the lightpen could be ""clicked"" using a cathartic foot-pedal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRESS)

How lovely of you to say... Well that certainly sounds like textbook racism.  Where exactly do you think I'm from.
I thought it would be nice to have a debate without resorting to this kind of shit slinging, but there we go.

&gt; I've lived in 7 countries on 4 continents, took it upon myself to learn, despite the fact that it's not very easy for me, the languages of two of them where the ones I already spoke weren't native (I fear this one's going to be kind of a bitch to pick up), obey their laws, pay their taxes, try to follow the rules even if I think they're stupid (hint: Amsterdamers and bicycles...) ... I don't think that's too much to expect of any migrant in search of a better life, especially one who settles somewhere.

First of all, congratulations on your achievement of moving geographically.  An achievement and make no mistake about it.  Also, please tell me where I said ""don't learn the language, don't pay taxes, don't try and integrate into foreign cultures.""  You're attacking me (or at least it certainly feels like it) but what I was saying was that you *should* be able to do what you've done without setting foot in Amsterdam for example, and having seven shades of shit kicked out of you merely for being an 'immigrant.  Absolutely try and integrate, but some people wont care how much you integrate and will still twat the living fuck out of you anyway, because you weren't born there.  Perhaps you should aim your big-boy-swear-words at them instead?  

&gt; Everyone should be free to go where they please, within limits, and those limits include respecting the people who have lived their for 5, 10, 20 years or all their lives.

They should be respected on merit, not merely because they successfully stayed alive in one place.  Just as you should be respected on merit and not based on how long you've been at a specific location.

&gt; and avoid places where I could never ever honestly bring myself to integrate (most of the Middle East, I imagine.)

I imagine those people that were born in these places and can't bring themselves to integrate love moving to a place that suits their ideals better only to be alienated and labelled an outsider. 

&gt; in the fairly tolerant European countries I've spent time in, there is no acceptable room for honor killings, religious hate propaganda, human trafficking, forced marriages, female circumcision, ethnic violence, denigrating women who don't wear clothing you find appropriate, clan feuds, or any number of other nasties that are unfortunately very prevalent among a lot of people from various fly-blown shitpots around the world. You want that shit? Stay home.

I'm not even sure what that's supposed to mean.  Care to expound?

&gt;Nope. Again, as I'd made the point that you challenged, it means only you could be missing it unless you claim I'm missing my own point, which is logically impossible.

Actually, it isn't.  You're missing the entire point of why the current healthcare system is broken and unfixable.

&gt;If we can't do it with private insurance, then we can't do it with federal management either, unless you imagine that because the feds run it, they can somehow manage to get medicine to cost less.

Of course they can.  The only reason medicine and healthcare are as expensive as they are now is because they are driven by for-profit organizations.  They drive prices up to bring the shareholders bigger profits each year.  With a government run system, this becomes unecessary.

&gt;The basic problem with private insurance is that they can get away with corrupt tactics to drop people who cost a lot. Eliminate that and the cost gets spread out among all who pay into the insurance, which is what insurance is supposed to do.

As long as they are for-profit, they can afford a government lobby.  As long as they can afford a government lobby, this will not be changed.  Are you starting to see the problem yet?

&gt;You're imagining I said anyone can. However, that's not the same thing is forcing insurance companies to pay the bills of their own clients.

These two statements make no sense contextually.

&gt;Someone who pays the insurance company for 10 years shouldn't get dropped suddenly just because they suddenly start costing them money.

Agreed.  But it happens, and it's legal, and will continue to be as long as insurance is for profit... see above.

&gt;Shareholders expect growth, year after year, sure, but too bad. Businesses don't always make huge ridiculous profits. No one can reasonably promise shareholders that they will continue to see huge growth, especially if it comes from corrupt actions such as forcing employers to drop expensive employees.

You obviously have no grasp of business in a capitalist society what-so-ever.  As soon as shareholders stop getting the growth that they expect, realistically or not, they sell, sell, sell, and then the company goes under.  What happens when the insurance companies stop making more for their shareholders and go under due to shareholder bailout?  What happens to those insured people?

No, a for-profit company in a capitalist society *must* continue to grow profits year-on-year or it will go the way of the dodo.

&gt;No. He's pushing a government option, but did you even read how that option will be paid for? An extra tax on businesses, even if already pay for insurance. An extra tax on wealthy americans (but somehow that level of wealth is undefined.)

This really doesn't have anything to do with the conversation at hand.  Obama's plan sucks.  We both agree.  However, that's not what we were discussing.  You're just using this as an excuse to go on some idiotic partisan rant.  Partisan politics are stupid, and so is anyone who engages in them.

&gt;Agreed. But there have been retarded laws passed before.

This isn't going to pass.  For-profit insurance and healthcare companies will not allow it.  Business runs the government.

&gt;And it got scarily close to passing anyway.

WTF?  It got squashed before it ever emerged from behind closed doors.

&gt;Not relevant. Our system can't be converted easily over to any other country's system. It's too huge and ugly. It would be a thousand times worse than trying to convert to the metric system.

It's completely relevant.  Anything can be done, given the willpower of the people.  If this is the best argument you have against universal healthcare, and it seems that it is, then you might as well just throw in the towel because this is no argument.

Converting to the metric system would be incredibly easy, btw.  Everyone is just too fucking lazy and/or greedy.

&gt;Even the democrats are afraid of universal health care. No matter what happens, somehow there will have to be rationing but no one wants to be the bad guy who says someone is too old or not worth saving. There was just an article on it on reddit today about it, if I could find it.

Even the Democrats... there you go with that idiotic partisan politic bullshit again.

The Democrats are scared of it because they want to get re-elected and there are too many morons in the United States who can't see the immense benefit of universal healthcare because of the bullshit being slung by corporate healthcare and insurance lobbyists over the years, and  both major political parties have done their part to help push this agenda because it helps keep their pockets lined.

&gt;Btw, just a LITTLE offensive.

Yes, your lack of understand of how universal healthcare works and how it could relatively painlessly happen here is most definitely ""...just a LITTLE offensive.""

&gt;Even in that blog, the insurance company had to give approval. 

From shareholders, yes.

&gt;You really think the fed wouldn't have to give approval for something? You really think there wouldn't be any kind of limits?

Again, you need to go do some research on how this works elsewhere.  You very, very clearly do not understand universal healthcare in its current state in other parts of the world.

So, in a nutshell:  No.  There would need not be any more approval than the doctor's approval.

&gt;You mean like in britain where you request an operation and wait to get on the list? They still have approvals there.

&gt;I think you need to do a little more research yourself there.

This was specifically addressed in one of the links I posted.  In short:  waits barely exist any longer, and it's not because of ""approvals"".  It's because, you know, there are people ahead of you in line, as it were.

&gt;Actually, if the feds provided universal health care, that's pretty much the form we'd get it in.

Completely unfounded.  If we model universal healthcare on existing programs then Medicaid/Medicare will be nothing but a black spot on the past.  You know this and I know this - you just won't admit it.

&gt;Your claims that medicare isn't universal health care is coming across as an attempt to just ignore the point.

Impossible.  It's not a valid point.  See above.

&gt;Again, you could have phrased that without being offensive. Something like ""here's a link to how Europe does it"" would have been quite polite.

And again, your lack of knowledge about something that you appear to be passionate about is *extremely* offensive.  Haven't you ever heard the saying that you shouldn't speak unless you know what you're talking about?  That's how I was raised, and I'm glad for it.  It keeps people from sounding like idiots and being, well, offensive.

&gt;Regardless, how the UK does it is not that relevant to us. We're much bigger than the UK, and not everyone here would welcome or accept a socialist approach.

It's completely relevant.  It's how modern universal healthcare... wait for it... *works*.  It's a model to base other systems off of.  Do you think everyone in the UK welcomes or accepts such a ""socialist approach""?  Besides, that whole socialist bit is a bullshit argument.  Until people are railing against police, fire departments, state and county managed roads, etc etc etc, then they don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to ""anti-socialist"" arguments.  It's a load of shit.

&gt;We pay a lot more into health care here on average, either through insurance costs or through federal taxes. But a lot of that goes to research and development, which helps out other countries.

And this somehow justifies everyone in the country not having basic, affordable healthcare?  I think not.

&gt;I don't mind a federal option for people who can't afford it, but not if it's going to be another huge tax on everyone. Adding another huge tax on the already stressed economy isn't really a good idea.

Weak argument.  All government programs come from tax money.  We're already in a huge deficit, thanks to good ole Dubya and then Obama's stimulus bullshit.  That deficit will not shrink without a tax increase - end of story.  Why the hell aren't people here in the US willing to pay a little more in taxes to help out their neighbor in need?  This makes no sense to me.  Also, there are plenty of states here in the US whose residents end up paying more in taxes annually than the average Canadian, and guess what?  The folks in the US have to shell out additional money for healthcare and the Canadians don't.

&gt;Moreover, DNA tests have demonstrated substantially less inter-marriage in most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations.[40] The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars.[40][41] Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations — in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim — it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.[42]

&gt;Why must characters in a story about racism outright denounce racism to disqualify the author as a racist?

Your question complicates the issue.  A better question would be, ""If a writer creates a character that mirrors his own life, and if that character is obviously racist, why would the author be interpreted as anything other than racist?""  

""The horror, the horror"", in my opinion, is pointed more towards colonialism than racism.  The book doesn't deal with racism at all, in fact; Conrad reflects the attitudes of his country and his upbringing, which still doesn't excuse him, still doesn't get him off the hook.

The final nail in the coffin would have to be the claim that African writers like Achebe say that Conrad is racist.

After WW2 there were some resettlings, but mostly to Vojvodina (which is in Serbia) and to much smaller scale eastern Croatia. What happened was that large number of ""Folksdojčer"" (Germans) were either expelled or they left when German Army retreated. Since Vojvodina and eastern Croatia are best farm land in former-Yu, communist moved people from some regions there.

There are many ethnic Croats whose parents moved to eastern Croatia during that time from croatian parts of Bosnia.

But it wasn't anything like what was going in China ..... there was no large province (republic) that was populated by another ethnic group ... specially **NOT** Kosovo, where Serbs whine about being forced out by Albanians who have much higher birth rate. 

There was lots of stupid things in former-Yu and there were many ethnic problems that surfaced in 1990's, but there was nothing like massive settlement in order to occupy territory. 

Big difference. 

If you want to blame someone for ethnic mix in former-Yu, you can blame Catholic Church and Great Schism

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-West_Schism

(hint, Croats went with Rome, Serbs went Orthodox), the border between parts of Roman Empire

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Western-Roman-Empire-AD395.png

(map of Western Roman Empire) .. notice that border is river Drina, between Bosnia and Serbia.


Second party to blame are Turks ... who brought Islam to these parts ... Turkish conquest of Europe was stopped here, in Croatia (which is why our country looks funny on the map, those were actual borders of Ottoman Empire)

So you get Great Schism that divided south slavs into Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs along river Drina some 1000 years ago and then you have Turks who invaded and brought Islam to these parts. Bosnians were actually three nations during Yugoslavia - Croats, Serbs and Muslims .. yes, Muslims with ""M"" .. there was a nation called ""Muslims"" and during the war in Bosnia they took name Bosnians.

- we have a fucking high broadband internet penetration rate, which is also extremele cheap (20 euro for 20mbs, uncapped, unfiltered) because of strong regulation of the [OPTA](http://opta.nl/nl/)

- We love debating, trolling and arguing. So, sites like Reddit and Digg are relatively more popular here.

- We are verbally quite direct, perhaps even offensive and in-your-face unsophisticated. Talking in a foreign language isn't something we consider to be scary. In general we don't think before we speak. People that want to choose their words carefully find talking in a foreign language more frustrating. We don't choose our words carefully. We just speak our mind, in whatever language it takes for you to hear that we think your "" .. ."" is a fucking "" ... "". (ok, i'm exaggerating a little bit here, but the you get the gist). This also explains the weird combination of child like spelling errors and university vocabulary.

- The English grammar is like a simpler and more compact version of the dutch grammar. But should also be true for German-language oriented countries. But it should be noted that the english language is just a lot closer to the german family of languages.

- We are a small country, so a lot of media we consume, isn't being produced here. It is not cost-efficient to 'voice-over' those movies and tv-series either, or to translate all those books. Unlike most European countries our fall-back culture isn't German, French or Spanish. It's English. This happened after WWII. At that point the loyalty, love and inspiration to most countries in Europe was the anglo-saxion culture (canada, us, uk, australia, new zealand). However, Holland was the only country in Europe where 40% of the population was teenager at that point. This is called the baby-boom. The war is over, it's safe to have children. This is also the reason we became so progressive: during the hippie-age the youth outnumbered and outvoted the other generations). This is why the transition to english-speaking-global-culture happened earlier here, but it's well underway in the rest of Europe. 

- We are cheapskates. It really is true. We are downloading series, movies, music. But when we download a movie or a series, we don't get the subtitles. 

**So, it's not better education, it's just that the majority of TV we watch, music we listen to, books we read, websites we visit,  are produced in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zeeland, etc.**

And there is a very simple tell. Whenever you hear a dutch person speak English. Ask yourself: what book, movie or tv show is that line from? 

This also explains why the dutch seem to switch between different levels of formality and tone, when talking in English. It's because we are combining expressions and phonetics from all over the English speaking world.

FTA:  
""Binjie was interviewed in a major study of honour-based crime published by the Centre for Social Cohesion last week, and argued that Islamic leaders are reluctant to grant divorces to women who have children.....Her colleague Tanisha Jnagel said that the Islamic Sharia Council hears both sides but relies on religious texts to decide whether a divorce should be granted: ""In our experience, this isn't going to result in a solution which is fair for the woman."" According to the study, Crimes of the Community: Honour-Based Violence in the UK by James Brandon and Salam Hafez, women are being forced to stay in violent marriages as a result. ""Many women from the Muslim and Sikh communities report that they have difficulties gaining religious divorces from their respective religious leaders,"" they say.  This will come as no surprise to Britain's agunot, or ""chained women"", who have been denied a religious divorce in Orthodox Jewish courts; even if they obtain a civil divorce, they are still married under Jewish law and any children they have with new partners will be mamzer, or illegitimate. Last week an Islamic Council in Leyton, east London, revealed that it had handled more than 7,000 divorces, but did not say what proportion was refused.

As soon as you look at the actual operation of religious law in this country, the picture looks less rosy. Even if the Archbishop didn't have in mind barbaric punishments such as stoning women to death for adultery, there is plenty of evidence that sharia courts are a means of consolidating patriarchal power in societies where Muslim women have begun to demand the same rights as men. The Department for Work and Pensions recently made an astonishing decision to pay state benefits to Muslim men for each of their wives, as long as the marriages were contracted legally abroad. Bigamy is illegal in Britain and the spectacle of the Government colluding in the practice of polygyny – not polygamy, for Muslim women cannot have four husbands – is a signal that ministers are losing their moral compass on the subject of women's rights.

We are only just beginning to realise the extent of violence against women from ethnic minorities. Last week, Commander Steve Allen, who leads for the Association of Chief Police Officers on honour-based violence, gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee. Responding to a question about whether forced marriage and ""honour"" crimes are under-reported in this country, Allen responded with a single word: ""Massively"". He believes the real level of violence might be 35 times higher than the number of cases (around 500) reported each year to the police and the Foreign Office forced marriage unit.

If a woman is running away from her parents or a violent husband, mosques and sharia courts are not the obvious place for her to turn to get justice. The Centre for Social Cohesion study contains a startling insight into attitudes in one British mosque, reported by Mohamed Baleela, a team leader at the Domestic Violence Intervention Project in Hammersmith, west London. ""Last time I talked about marital rape in a mosque,"" he said, ""I nearly got beaten up. Because we said that the law makes it illegal to rape your wife, someone got up and hit me because he was ignorant of the law.

There is an argument, and it is a compelling one, that we should all be subject to the same laws. People who look favourably on a parallel system of religious courts for civil matters claim they do no harm if all parties consent to their use. This, of course, is the crux of the matter: how can we know that women from traditional and religious families have given consent when they are under huge pressure from relatives? They may be threatened into accepting the authority of a religious court, just as hundreds of young women (and some young men) are coerced into getting married against their will.

The few cases that hit the headlines are unbearably tragic: 17-year-old Shafilea Ahmed from Warrington, Cheshire, drank bleach when she was confronted with an unwanted suitor in Pakistan, and later disappeared from her parents' home. Her body was found five months later in a river in Cumbria and a coroner ruled last month that the student had been the victim of a ""very vile murder"".
  
Another young woman, 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod from south London, was raped and murdered by Kurdish hit men hired by her father and uncle when she left an unhappy, arranged marriage and fell in love with another man. The notion that young women like Shafilea Ahmed and Banaz Mahmod would be helped by an expansion of Islamic law in this country is laughable; indeed the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2003 that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy and European values. Secular law protects people's right to practise their religion, but it also protects them from aspects of their faith which are unjust and oppressive.

Only someone as out of touch with modern Britain as the Archbishop of Canterbury could possibly think otherwise, or line up so willingly with the forces of reaction. Just because someone looks like an Old Testament prophet, he doesn't have to think and speak like one as well.
  
TLDR?: Apparently even Jewish women are actively oppressed as well.  
Commander Steve Allen called crimes and violence against women ""MASSIVELY"" under reported, the real figures being perhaps almost 35 times higher that what is being reported.

No, you implied that ""the Jews"" were responsible for the spread of circumcision. Entirely baseless. You know your antisemitic canard is far-fetched when you've never even heard white supremacists take up the mantle. 

&gt;There have been serious criticisms of those U.N. studies in Africa

They weren't UN studies. The WHO examined the evidence from a number of peer-reviewed independent studies establishing a positive correlation between circumcision and a reduced contraction rate of HIV and other venereal diseases and ruled that they should be implemented as a means to slow contraction rates. Here's [one](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2807%2960312-2/fulltext#article_upsell)

Thank you for missing my point. I meant that the vast majority of circumcising nations are found in the Muslim world, with no Jewish population to speak of, except in Iran. 

&gt;Secondly, Jews are not overrepresented in those fields in Europe.

A categorically false statement. Certainly not to the extent as before the holocaust and WWII, but Jews in England and the continent continue to to overrepresented in the fields of medicine, science, entertainment and others from which they could easily ""control"" the circumcision habits of a nation from their evil Jew towers. I'd direct you to any anti-semitic hate site for a near conclusive list of any Jew (or suspected Jew) in any position of power across the globe. 

You still are unable to explain why in every single nation where Jews have conprised a significant and influential minority throughout history, from Greece to Canada, only the United States and the Muslim world for irrelevant reasons has adopted circumcision. 

Because of this, your claim is to be seen as no less outrageous as it appeared to any right minded person to be from first glance.

Point being _you don't need to_.

Gnome and KDE are, in fact, mimicing this behavior. 

On Ubuntu (and on any other Linux I've tried), in case an app follows the Mac-trend of not telling you where the it went - you can expect it to be in your path and have the same name as advertised in the packet manager which means you can simply type it into a console. If this is not the case - you can get a full report on the installation in the packet manager which will tell you the likely executable candidate. I admit that these extra options are not beautiful but they're effective once you've learned them.

**The 1999 EPO B samples**: There was no urine test for EPO in 1999, but the archived samples were tested after one was developed. They tested positive, but as the A sample were no longer available (already being used), it was not enough to result in sanction.

It was the comment you rebutted, with *""there are many, many, many, many places where you can critique religion and have unwarranted consequences. Work, school, social settings, family gatherings, etc""*. 

&gt;Sure, and many African slaves got good treatment in American plantations, too. Here in America though, Atheists are even more despised than Muslims.

Indeed, although not everywhere and I am sure that in some places it is considerably worse than in others.  Indeed I find the whole fact that people in some places feel the need to 'come out' both fascinating and terrifying.

&gt;Also, I noticed you didn't say 'most places', because in most places, the consequences for atheistic speech range from social disapproval to loss of employment to actual imprisonment or death.

I would disagree, If you look at Europe, Canada, Russia, China and other large tracts of Asia you would find that there would neither be consequences for being an atheist, nor consequences for being of a different religion.  Of course in some places, notably the Middle east, the remainder of Asia and the US there are severe consequences for not being a member of whatever dominant religion holds sway or indeed for being an Atheist.

&gt;Don't atheists who bear the brunt of religious nonsense have a right to react to the personal difficulties they have suffered that you have been lucky to avoid?

Indeed they do, my point was that there is a discussion to be had, American redditors (or at least primarily American, and excuse the generalisation) generally seem to espouse a confrontation approach, directly attacking religion and religious influences, others often suggest allowing religion to simply become irrelevant, a cultural and traditional thing like it is in much of Europe and elsewhere.  That discussion is difficult because it reacted to almost as if the person suggesting it had suggested appeasement.  

My point is simply that I would prefer to be able to discuss why I think I have been as lucky as I have and note that it is not because people have fought religion, but indeed that they have relegated it to utter irrelevancy, almost by accident.  

&gt;I find that most atheists are eager, hungry even, for coherent discussion. Of course, typically all we find are the same tired logical fallacies and concern trolling that compel us to lash out in frustration.

I agree with the latter, although I would suggest that on a regular basis discussion is mistaken for trolling.

Therefore, Occam's Razor suggests that if other countries have a better cost/quality ratio than the United States, one of the following is likely to be true:

1. Cost/quality in other countries isn't actually as good as people claim it is.

2. There is another reason why healthcare in the United States is more expensive than some of these other countries. A few possibilities off the top of my head: HMO legislation; malpractice rules; Americans being sue-happy; extremely unhealthy diets (I seem to recall reading that America has a far worse obesity/diabetes/exercise rate than Britain and many European countries); the fact that the American pharmaceutical industry, which dominates the global drug marketplace, sells drugs to other countries like Canada and many European countries for a fraction of the price it sells those drugs in America...

I could go on with that list but I think I've made my point. Assuming that government healthcare is the way to bring costs down is not especially logical, and is not made much more compelling by noting the correlation between lower costs among countries that have implemented it.

And of course, UNIVERSAL healthcare may be a ""socially responsible"" thing to do but it sure as HELL is not going to bring down healthcare costs, it will cause them to skyrocket if anything, since there's all sorts of causal relationships between people that don't have healthcare and the reasons they don't have it...

It's not the easiest thing in the World to admit, but Borat, as a foreigner, was treated kindly in his scenes (generally) and with a very haughty, sadistic kind of pity for his ""odd one out who needs our civilized help"" ways. He was endearing, in that way, and so he had an opportunity to get far deeper into his scenes and with the people themselves.

Bruno was excellent, but his scenes were cut much shorter, felt choppier, ran around a lot. He didn't get to spend much time with any one of the people (disregarding the hilariously, awfully awkward campfire sequence). Instead of taking pity on a perverted Eastern European schlub, the people -- faced with an overtly homosexual Austrian man -- became... disgusted. To the point that they were throwing chairs, beating up the camera-men, storming out of the sets before much could be explored.

I say it's a sad thing to admit because -- and, let it be known, listening to a kooky guy with a 'stache talk about his brother Bilo raping townsgirls is easier to tolerate with your ""This Will Someday Be A Hilarious Bar Story"" hat on than a man who is attempting very seriously to have sex with you/molesting you, homosexual or not -- I just found it hard to stomach, watching it all. All of the rage and the anger and the hatred and the venom-spitting because he rubbed the guy's knee and said something about a ""shtinker"" (I feel like the Swinger scene was inserted to demonstrate more of a dichotomy between the homosexually erotic scenes reaction you immediately have vs the heterosexual).

I mean, Borat asked what weapons were better to kill Jews with. It's something to think about.

&gt; # Correlation does not equal causation. Just because the industrial revolution took place during the last 100 years and carbon emissions have increased does not necessarily mean that carbon is the cause of the rise in temperature.

Indeed. But we know (and have known for Some Time) that CO2 is very good at stopping infra-red (i.e. heat): http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227081.500-the-man-who-discovered-greenhouse-gases.html ""To the eye, the gas within the tube might be as invisible as the air itself, while to the radiant heat it behaved like a cloud which it was almost impossible to penetrate"". Knowing that, we would *predict* global temperature rises as a result of increases CO2, so that fits well with the measurements.

&gt; # If we assume that humans are to blame for global warming, is there any proof that we can physically reduce the carbon content of the atmosphere to the optimum temperature?

Not sure what you mean here. Various processes add and remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g. growing plants pull CO2 out and turn it into, well, plants). These processes can't keep up with the rate we're adding CO2. If we reduce the rate we'll (a) have more time before things change too badly (b) may be able to stay in a stable state

&gt; # What is the optimum temperature? Who is say that we aren't finally reaching the global homeostasis? Are we concerned about beach property or global health?

It's not as simple as temperature going up uniformly. Heat drives the flow of air and water around the world (hot air rises, hot water rises etc). Climate change is just that, the climate in different places will change. This might mean a nice 2 degrees rise in temperate regions or it might mean the Gulf Stream current shutting down (Northern Europe becomes unable to support it's population), hurricanes, tornados, drought or flood in areas which are currently not prone or used to them. Let's not forget sea level rises either.

&gt; # Let's assume that we can indeed change the outcome of global temperature. China and India as recently as yesterday have come out and given a big middle finger to the rest of the world and said they will have no part in 'carbon caps.'

This is the position the world has been in with the US prior to the recent change of administration. It's not a binary thing, it's an issue of severity. The big CO2 emitters need to emit less. Yes, that includes everyone. More pressure will apply over time. The world needs to sort out it's energy supply in a way which doesn't increase atmospheric CO2 too much. As the tech for that becomes better/cheaper and more political pressure is applied other countries will come into line.

**OP's Article text below:**

-----------------------------------
Irish atheists are horrified by new legislation making blasphemy illegal, and punishable by a 25,000-Euro fine. Christians of all stripes should be, too.

As part of a revision to defamation legislation, the Dail (Irish Parliament) passed legislation creating a new crime of blasphemy. This attack on free speech, debated for several months in Europe, has gone largely unnoticed in the American press.

The text of the legislation is provided at the end of this post.

How does this impact free speech? Just don’t be rude.

- Atheists can be prosecuted for saying that God is imaginary. That causes outrage.
- Pagans can be prosecuted for saying they left Christianity because God is violent and bloodthirsty, promotes genocide, and permits slavery.
- Christians can be prosecuted for saying that Allah is a moon god, or for drawing a picture of Mohammed, or for saying that Islam is a violent religion which breeds terrorists.
- Jews can be prosecuted for saying Jesus isn’t the Messiah.

Is it really THAT big a deal?

Ireland’s Blasphemy Bill not only criminalizes free speech, it also gives the police the authority to confiscate anything deemed “blasphemous”. They may enter and search any premises, with force if needed, upon “reasonable suspicion” that such materials are present.

-The local Freethinkers society, with its copies of Hitchens’ God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.
-The video store, with copies of The God Who Wasn’t There.
-The history teacher, who uses The Dark Side of Christian History to teach her class.
-The library, with its collection of books deemed blasphemous.
-Even the homeowner who lets the wrong person know he has a copy of Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses could find his door broken in by the Thought Police, his bookshelves ransacked, and his books burning in the front yard!

Satirizing religion in any way, shape, or form, if it “causes outrage”, is now a prosecutable offense in Ireland. Saying anything negative about a religion, if it “causes outrage”, can now be prosecuted as a crime. Just like in Muslim countries.

Witness the return of the Dark Ages.

**The text of the legislation:**

36. Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter.

(1) A person who publishes or utters blasphemous matter shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €100,000. [Amended to €25,000]

(2) For the purposes of this section, a person publishes or utters blasphemous matter if (a) he or she publishes or utters matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion, and (b) he or she intends, by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage.

(3) It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.

37. Seizure of copies of blasphemous statements.

(1) Where a person is convicted of an offence under section 36, the court may issue a warrant (a) authorising any member of the Garda Siochana to enter (if necessary by the use of reasonable force) at all reasonable times any premises (including a dwelling) at which he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that copies of the statement to which the offence related are to be found, and to search those premises and seize and remove all copies of the statement found therein, (b) directing the seizure and removal by any member of the Garda Siochana of all copies of the statement to which the offence related that are in the possession of any person, © specifying the manner in which copies so seized and removed shall be detained and stored by the Garda Siochana.

(2) A member of the Garda Siochana may (a) enter and search any premises, (b) seize, remove and detain any copy of a statement to which an offence under section 36 relates found therein or in the possession of any person, in accordance with a warrant under subsection (1).

(3) Upon final judgment being given in proceedings for an offence under section 36, anything seized and removed under subsection (2) shall be disposed of in accordance with such directions as the court may give upon an application by a member of the Garda Siochana in that behalf.

I treat health insurance as simply part of the payroll expense. Even in a nationalized system, you will still be paying for it, but it will be folded into the payroll taxes, where you have no option to switch providers, no leverage to demand drill-down accounting of additional charges, and no budgetary control to trade expense for coverage terms. That's a recipe for Management Accounting 101 Fail.

If I was forced to pay for health care insurance through a nationalized system, I could not have opted for catastrophic coverage during the crucial initial years of starting my company. I'm now in a position to purchase ""gold-plated"" insurance like Blue Cross, but only after many years of building my client base and revenue channels, during which time I was perfectly comfortable with high-deductible catastrophic insurance backed by my company standing behind the deductible in a reserves account as part of an employee benefit program.

If I was an insecure capitalist afraid to compete with new entrants in my field, I'd back nationalized healthcare. It would be a *great* way to raise the barriers to entry to all businesses by individuals. The complexity level of establishing a small business serving a multi-state (not to speak of globalized) client base is already absurdly high. Most people who don't own a business have no idea that doing business with a nation-wide client base in the US is actually an exercise in complying with 50 different sets of business (mostly tax) regulations. So far, most small businesses under about $0.5-1M p.a. revenue in a state are ignored by the agencies with jurisdiction. Without this *de facto* flying under the radar, the regulatory compliance costs are overwhelming. Guess how much it costs to hire a tax attorney and CPA to navigate the thicket of new changes in tax laws each year in all 50 states for just a mail order outfit? And if you have any heart at all, you'd take care of the personal tax filing maze for your employees that travel if your employees do work in multiple states. That costs big bucks. And every year at least one state agency gets a bug up its ass and dickers with you on your and/or your employees' filings. More time and cash out the door complying. Oh, and some localities have additional tax regimes to the state they are in. And people wonder why businesses that can are moving out of the US...the overhead costs of staying legit in the US are about par with doing business in the EU, so if you have the option to go offshore and treat both the US and EU with roughly the same compliance costs, if all other considerations were equal, you'd be nuts to not head for a tax-neutral domicile.

Each state is going to add its own special sauce to a national healthcare system, and if I want to compete unfairly with new, younger entrepreneurs I would cackle with glee at the prospect of them having to comply with 50 different sets of state-sponsored health care. They wouldn't have any choice to fly under the radar with health care like with the insane state and local tax systems, and the regulatory compliance costs would sink most small businesses that seek a client base throughout the US instead of a single locality, before they can even get off the ground.

I have read the work of all of those authors. George R.R. Martin is great writer but his writing in NO way evokes anything about American history, Medieval European history, biblical history, AND with an ancient past which is like taking a ride on the ""Time Machine"" all peppered and intertwined with brilliant bits of just about every mythology and interesting legend on the planet (that's Jordan). 
  
Tolkien's works were amazing, but most of his tale merely encompasses a huge WW2 analogy with your basic Nordic/Gaelic mythological fare. Plus, he is rather drab and boring more so than not. 
  
Dune? Not bad. But nowhere NEAR the epic time-line and foreshadowing employed by Jordan. 12 books is too much you say? Jordan STILL manages to foreshadow from his writing in his first book and elaborate in BRILLIANT detail in his last books all while making an unreal historical connection with our world, re-imagining it within his immensely huge history, and making it incredibly meaningful to the plot to the point where it seamlessly falls into place. 
  
It seems almost impossible that he could have planned it all from the beginning, because as you say, in 12 books (each 600-1200 pages if I remember) almost everything that can be written is written? Not at all. I've lived in the Middle East for over a year (Oman, Saudi, Dubai), Ive lived in Spain, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Japan.   Every where I have lived I see evidence of their culture and dress and history folded into Jordan's universe in a completely different yet complementary way to our own universe. 
  
Martin writes intriguing political dialogue with very compelling characters, but he's all suspense and not enough action. Jordan IS the definitive Sci-fi fantasy history/religion buff author. You, sir, need to read or travel more. I'm sorry his epic detail was lost on you.  Truly, truly sorry.

My god you really are serious? Alluding to history, if that is indeed what he was doing, isn't actually a property of good writing. Jordan was hack, and a second-rate pulp fantasy author who made it big.  I'm more of the opinion that the historical bits you seem to be seeing in his writing are blatant signs of his unoriginality. He could think of nothing better than to steal plot ideas and details from the pages of history, and then of course dress them up as his own. 

&gt;...he is rather drab and boring more so than not.

If you have the attention span of a twelve year old, yes I suppose this is true. 

&gt;But nowhere NEAR the epic time-line and foreshadowing employed by Jordan.

I nearly threw up in my mouth. The man didn't know what was going to happen more than a book or two in advance the whole series. It is quite obvious to anyone reading the books that this is so. His plot is haphazard, and full of patch work details, quick fixes, and holes. 


&gt;Jordan STILL manages to foreshadow from his writing in his first book and elaborate in BRILLIANT detail in his last books all while making an unreal historical connection with our world, re-imagining it within his immensely huge history, and making it incredibly meaningful to the plot to the point where it seamlessly falls into place.

Oh my god. You have to be trolling. Virtually none of you've just said is any where near true. I don't think you have any kind of critical reading ability what so ever. You should really get out and read some more stuff.

&gt;Not at all. I've lived in the Middle East for over a year (Oman, Saudi, Dubai), Ive lived in Spain, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Japan. Every where I have lived I see evidence of their culture and dress and history folded into Jordan's universe in a completely different yet complementary way to our own universe.

Stealing ideas from the pages of history actually doesn't make you a good writer. I know that is hard for you to believe, but it's true.

&gt;Jordan IS the definitive Sci-fi fantasy history/religion buff author. 

Hahaha, hahaha, ahahhaha... What is wrong with you? How old are you? 15? Jordan's degree was in physics. He was interested in history yes, but that is far cry from what you attribute to him. You do realize there are sci-fi and fantasy authors with Phd's in History and Religious Studies right? You have serious case of blind fan devotions apparently.

&gt;Also, admittedly his characters are cliche, and I'm in it for the obscure religious mysticism, overwhelmingly descriptive scenery, and a never-ending struggle between good and evil. Massive saga is crack to an escapist.

Yes but none of this makes him a good author, or his writing even passable. All this means is that you're tastes in books is pretty fucking low brow even for fantasy. Every author does what you attribute to Jordan, not always on the same scale, but usually they do with a bit of grace. It's nothing special.

Cuando hablo de competencia desigual me refiero justo a eso, si el concepto hace ruido le podemos nombrar de otra manera.

No es ningún secreto que EU ha, hipócritamente, difundido el desarrollo neoliberal de la economía mientras que sigue funcionando como un estado proteccionista en muchos aspectos.

México no está en desventaja con respecto a todas los productos, la guayaba, el aguacate, el brócoli (aunque erosiona la tierra a un nivel impresionante) son producidos exitosamente en México y muchas veces encuentran barreras ""legales"" para entrar a competir a los mercados de EU y Canadá (lo digo entre comillas porque se esconden bajo banderas sanitarias la mayor parte del tiempo).  

El TLC tiene sus raíces en la reestructuración de la deuda externa durante la primera mitad de los 80. Cuando se llegó a la conclusión de que México no podía pagar en su totalidad la deuda externa, el FMI le hizo el favor a México de reestructurarla con algunas condiciones de por medio, la mayoría de ellas neo-liberales que favorecerían a los dueños del circo. Por esta razón se le aplaudió tanto a Salinas por su TLC que eventualmente eliminó el apoyo a la tortilla y al maíz, etc y nos ha dejado en una dependencia alimentaria (vaya, países como UK o Israel tiene una razón para esto pero México tiene muchos recursos). 

Me extraña que pienses en el TLC como algo que es perfecto y por ende inmutable. La verdad es que pocas cosas son perfectas (si no es que nada). El TLC fue planeado a principios de los 90 y ahora es bastante claro, después de la crisis, que la reestructuración,  por lo menos de tipo keynesiana es necesaria. México incluso fue el experimento mundial y no es secreto que los indígenas de Centroamérica se resistieron tanto a un TLC para ellos, después de ver los estragos en el campo mexicano.

&gt; Well it was the opinion of those people who wrote that the law that it is the job of the Supreme Court to interpret the constitution how they saw fit.

True. But if you believe that they intended for the law to be changed simply because of mans opinion of it changing at whichever time in the future for whatever reason they wish, you must have a very limited knowledge of American history.

&gt;...and you have not proved this intent on the part of the founding fathers

""And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms....The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants"" (Thomas Jefferson in a letter to William S. Smith in 1787.)

""The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" -- (Thomas Jefferson)

 ""[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens."" -- The Federalist, No. 29
Alexander Hamilton 

 ""Another source of power in government is a military force. But this, to be efficient, must be superior to any force that exists among the people, or which they can command; for otherwise this force would be annihilated, on the first exercise of acts of oppression. Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.""
Noah Webster An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, Philadelphia, 1787 

This is a very small sample and I would not say that to ""proves"" it alone. But, i'm not about to read all the historical documents to you. I believe you are capable of reading them yourself. 

&gt;The right to life is considering paramount over the right to own firearms.

It's unfortunate that you believe that the right to life somehow is contradictory to the right to arms. When in fact the right to arms is a mechanism in which the right to life is preserved, not diminished.

You'd be shocked at how just barely under the surface this issue is buried, and how it doesn't take long to surface whenever the driving age issue is raised. The states know damn well that 16 year olds operating heavy machinery unsupervised is a bad idea, but its a political loser.

Maybe my perspective isn't represenative of the big picture, but it seems like the people whose ancestors came over pre Civil War (voluntarily and involuntarily) are more wrapped up in all of this and understandably so. Meanwhile those whose ancestors came over post Civil War are more wtf about it. 

A guess for why the 'post war' immigrant descendants don't have the ethnic supriority/inferiority issues of the 'pre war' immigrant descendants, is that the cultural parts of the separateness have been much reduced if not resolved. The ethnic slurs targetted at post-war immigrant groups have died out and aren't being worn by their descendants like a badge of honor (polack, wop, kraut, etc) which has the effect of keeping the slur and the attitudes attached to it alive. The other part is that the post-war immigrant groups aren't trying to maintain themselves as something separate from the rest of the American fabric. 

This stuff can't be cleared up overnight, but at some point I hope the counterproductive inflaming approach is dropped in favor of what works.

My parents moved to Canada when in 1996 when I was about 8 years old and I haven't been back to Turkey since 2003. I was raised speaking the language at home and I feel an immense connection to my history and culture.


With regards to the EU and Turkey's accession I don't really have a solid opinion. I think the EU would certainly benefit from having Turkey on their side, both militarily and from having a stronger influence in the middle east. The Turks play a role similar to Egypt or Israel as America's ""friends"" in the Middle East, and I think the EU has a chance to lessen the US influence on Turkey while increasing their own. 


The main arguments against accession are nationalistic on the Turkish side and economic and borderline discriminatory on the EU side with issues such as the largely Muslim population of Turkey being a major roadblock. 


Personally, I think I'd like to see a more independent Turkey, although that might not be possible with the current political climate. And it might do more harm than good with the gradual erosion of secularism that's been taking place in the government. I wish all Turks believed in the ideals of Ataturk, in that case we'd have one of the most secular and progressive countries in the world. Ataturk always put an emphasis on science and a rejection of superstition, even the states could use a man like him today, he's definitely one of my personal heroes.

""Hao-le"" (how-luh) can mean ""enough already,"" almost like ""knock it off."" It can also mean ""OK, I give up. All right already."" 

Your term ""fair enough"" is an English idiomatic expression, so a literal translation wouldn't be appropriate, though there might be another translation closer to its meaning than the ones I gave.

These are all based on 20 year old recollections of my imperfect grasp of the language.

In French as spoken in France ""d'accord"" (da-cor) has the sense of ""OK,"" or ""I am in agreement,"" or ""I am in accordance."" There are other idiomatic expressions that would indicate a feeling of fairness about a situation, but if I were conducting business or making other types of agreements I'd probably use ""d'accord.""

Does your use of ""fair enough"" carry any other connotations beside agreement or acceptance? Is it a literal acknowledgment of fairness or justice?

Look, executive political positions are inherently non-democratic. 

And if you cannot recall a politician, that is non-democratic.

If you really want to be able to smoke weed freely, then you have to live in a democracy.

YOu do NOT live IN a democracy.

If you want to MAKE a democracy, then you first have to know what democracy is.

Here is what democracy IS:

if you elect by direct vote a politician across multiple political districts, THAT is non-democratic.

A governor voted in across an entire state is nondemocratic. Similarly, a president and a senator is nondemocratic.

Political districts that are themselves comprised of smaller political districts are non-democratic because they have too many factions in them. Too many factions means that it is hard for the people to ""unite and discover their common interest.""

If the people cannot easily  ""unite and discover their common interest,"" then you have less democracy.

The more factions, the less able the people are to unite, and thus the less democratic.

The smaller the district, the less the factions, and the more able to unite and the more democratic.

that governor was elected across many different factions and so therefore the people of that district (which is the entire state of NH) cannot easily unite and hold the governor accountable.

This is the founding principal of the USA and its presidential, checks and balances federalism.

This is how the rich founding fathers were able to control democracy, control the people, keeping them from taxing the rich, keep them from smoking marijuana, etc.

True democracies put their power in parliaments. THe power is vested in the hands of the members of the parliament, and these members are elected from small districts that are NOT comprised of smaller districts.

This is the basis of democracy.

This is what the founding fathers killed off when they illegally installed our federal constitution. 


THIS is what makes Western Europe much more democratic than America--parliamentary democracy.

Also, democracy requires that politicians be subject to recall elections.

In both texts the word ""yoghurt"" is mentioned in different sections and its use by nomadic Turks is described. The first account of a European encounter with yoghurt occurs in French clinical history: Francis I suffered from a severe diarrhea which no French doctor could cure. His ally Suleiman the Magnificent sent a doctor, who allegedly cured the patient with yoghurt. Being grateful, the French king spread around the information about the food which had cured him.

Well, it didn't, and now you have plenty of 2d generation immigrants that were born in Europe, yet can't consider their country of birth as their own country for they feel alienated by it in every way. They do miserably in school, are barely able to get jobs, and make the perfect fodder for Muslim Brotherhood types always willing to build Mosques and provide social services they wouldn't otherwise get.

Shockingly, the answer to your situation is not to kill them all, nor to hide behind your windows and hope it goes away.

This argument is just a stupid and a way to pressure their way into the EU. The fact is: The EU is not a humanitarian organization. It's purpose is mainly to strengthen the current members and not to accept every country that would benefit from the subsidies.
Even right now lot's of people from the netto-payer-countries wonder if they actually benefit from the EU... one could argue that for example France actually creates it's own competition by helping other members economies to develop. Polen even has a very EU-critical president right now although they greatly benefited from the subsidies. So Germany, France, England start to wonder what they are getting out of paying them. (of course there are members where the population rightfully realizes that they benifit from the EU)

I think Turkey would not be good for the Union right now. The poorer parts of the east would needs years and years of substantial help. Turkey is a very nationalistic country (only a few years ago there still was a law that forbid insulting the Turkish culture) and because of their islamic background it is likely that they will often times have a different opinion that the rest of the EU. Decision making would become quite a bit harder since turkey would have quite a big vote because of it's large population (I think they had the same voting power as france or germany).

It's obvious that the EU already has big troubles to pass any substantial laws right now.. getting in Turkey would just worsen it.

(1) When you have a global fiat currency that can be created and distributed in arbitrary ways to benefit powerful insiders.

(2) When on the gold standard, local currencies were pegged to gold at different exchange rates based on the nation's productivity. If every country has the same value of money, it will be impossible for poor countries to compete.  Poor countries must continually devalue their currency to remain competitive. There's a reason the Italian currency couldn't compete with the German currency in the years before the Euro, and now you find Italians (and Spaniards and others) complaining the Euro is too strong because they aren't as efficient as the Germans (it costs them more Euros to produce the same output, making Germany more profitable and everyone else less profitable). In places like Canada where the same thing happens between Alberta/Ontario and the Maritimes, there are transfer payments to level the playing field (income redistribution). Such transfer payments are inevitable in Europe to prevent a breakup of the currency.

I've debated them at work and you can find them here on reddit.  They are sure that under the European system it takes 10 years to get any surgery done and all you get after it is a bottle of apsirin for the pain and your choice of PowerPuff Girl band-aids to cover the scar.  That's why everyone in the world tries to get surgery done in the US, you see.  It's a fact that the life expectancy in Europe is lower than in the US, you see.

That's probably his rationale.  It's the same rationale as those who say that the Earth is 6,000 years old.  It's just what they believe.",0,[deleted],t1_c0azxg1,0,,True,False

I think that it might take thousands of years before we get there, but it's inevitable, we are already moving in that direction anyway, we started out as small families/tribes, moved on to larger state-like organizations, then there were countries and now you have unions of countries like the EU.",0,randomb0y,t1_c0azxg5,0,,True,False

I know the situation in Europe best, and when Christianity appeared around 300 c.e. it served to *unifiy* Europe. In the beginning it was a less violent method than what the Roman Empire did. Later, as you probably know, the Church started to use the belief for its own gains, and became very power-hungry.

Christianity was also a more *scientific* religion compared to the alternatives at the time, as it doesn't require spending resources on pyramids, large temples, offerings to keep the deity happy etc. One can debate whether it hindered or promoted scientific progress later, but in the beginning it was an improvement.

But now, where science and philosophy have progressed, the explanations for why things are how they are in the Bible are not needed any longer and Christianity is basically obsolete. The remaining question is how to get the word out.",0,roug,t1_c0azxqk,0,,True,False
