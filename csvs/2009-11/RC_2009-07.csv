 Soldatul Ionescu avea o misiune importanta: belea ochii la avioane.

 La Otopeni erau numai gropi si avioanele le ocoleau si tunarii

 Danila Prepeleac era tovaras de copilarie cu Ion Creanga si cu el
pleca iarna la sanius.

 Eminescu a publicat frumoasa poezie ""Pe lînga plopii Slavitesti"".

 La începutul fiecarei poezii eminesciene sta plantat cîte un tei mai
gros sau mai subtire în functie de cîte strofe are poezia.

 Si eroul, ca sa nu fie gasit, se ascunse într-o pititoare.

 Cînd eroul muri împuscat de nemti pe cîmp, simti miros de marar si de
patrunjel.

 El mergea pe bicicleta cu picioarele goale, bagate în portbagaj.

 Ioana îi zise eroului sa-i bage aparatul în priza.

 Cînd veni fata, baiatul îi mîngîie pisoiul.

 Soldatii îi urmareau pe nemti si, cum îi vedeau ca se urca în
avioane, sareau calare pe tunuri si îi urmareau pe tot aeroportul.

 Patima s-a pus pe capul oamenilor ca curca pe curcan.

 Personajele principale din povestirea ""O ora din august"" sînt:
ofiterul Rosu si avioanele nemtesti.

 Pe aeroportul Otopeni se luptau nemtii cu americanii, iar românii
trageau, cu succes, cînd în unii, cînd în altii.

mai conteaza, pentru ca tot îl manînca vulturii.

cal, mai-mai sa pice!

 Orheianu sta drept pe cal, de parca avea un bat înfipt undeva.

 Magda îl iubea pe Tudor Soimaru fara sa stie ca acesta nu stia limbi straine.

 În ""Amintiri"" apare copilaria fericita a puiului de taran Crenguta Ionel.

 Privind atent plugul vede ca e de fier si privind si mai atent
taranul, Arghezi, ca un poet bun ce este, vede ca e de bronz.

 Liviu Rebreanu are placerea de a ne aduce la cunostinta, în operele
sale, iubirea de pamînt a taranului.

 Semnele de punctuatie explica ca limba româna de aceea a aparut, ca

 Tu nu stii sa înoti, pentru ca nu ai vrut sa înveti carte.

 Creanga a scris povesti ca: ""Cocosul babei"", ""Gaina lenesa"", ""Punguta
cu bani marunti"", ""Lupul si capra"".

 Vlaicu-Voda era un functionar model care avea un randament deosebit ca domn.

 Sinonimul cuvîntului ""pace"" este ""hai la razboi""!

 În drama ""Apus de soare"" Stefan cel Mare era asa de batrîn, încît
picioarele nu-l mai tineau, dar el mergea înainte cu inima.

 Ceahlaul este situat sus pe munte.

Firing people like these is never enough, you gotta put them somewhere they cannot work their evil magic.

The CIA apparently employs people in other branches of gov, say for example the army, where officers have two chains of command, one their army boss, and the second their CIA chain. Major problem of ethics and discipline there.

It would be a 'night of the long knives' for the US, you would have to use the FBI, Army, Federal marshals and state troopers to round up and arrest detain the CIA types. And they would not go peacfully into the night without trouble, and the MSM is infested with CIA assets, they would defend their bosses.

Effectively a civil war between gov depts, America would be paralyzed.

Or as in the Valkyrie movie, where the Reserve Defense force rounds up the SS in Berlin. We just need 5000 or so US Army types on active duty in the US and a 'Civil Assistance Plan'...

¨LEFTIST COUP BY HONDURAN PRESIDENT THWARTED!

-PRESIDENT NOW EX-PRESIDENT SENDS LETTER OF RESIGNATION TO HONDURAN CONGRESS-

( Ray Auxillou , Belize Falconview News, June, 2009 )

It is strange to hear that the unilateral Coup d’etat in Honduras being created by ex-President Zelaya was thwarted by the judicial branch and the military, which acts as the Federal Police Force in that country.  According to the stories on the news and interviews.   President Zalaya was attempting a constitutional coup in Honduras , by circumventing the Congress, Executive and Legislative branches in regards to an on going program, allegedly devised and formented by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela .

A judge of the judicial branch was being interviewed on Honduras television and confirmed that President Zelaya was arrested and deported by the military, according to an arrest order issued by the Supreme Court,  judicial branch.  President Zelaya was deported by military aircraft to Costa Rica , which has accepted his entry into exile.

Zelaya was attempting a similar take over coup of the Honduras government, similar to what Chavez has done in Venezuela .  The current step that roused the fury of the legislative and judicial branch in Honduras was that he unilaterally was holding a referendum to change the constitution of Honduras without approval of Congress.  The referendum was thwarted by the military, on orders of the judiciary.  The straw that broke the camels back, so to speak was that President Zalaya appointed a Coordinator Popular, or a popular coordinator in the middle of Friday night, after midnight, to circumvent the prerogatives of elected government, as in a democracy.  This is in line with the current leftist Presidents in the Americas, forming totalitarian states, using the elected party political process to get into office and then subverting the government by steady political incremental changes in a slow coup  d’etat to become lifetime TYRANTS.

There was no military coup d’etat said the Judge or female spokesperson this Sunday morning in a television interview, but only the rest of the pillars of government protecting Congress and the Constitution.  President Zelaya wanted to change the Constitution so that he could run for more than one term of office.  The Supreme  Court acted to arrest Zelaya, since he committed the crimes of violating the Honduras Constitution in his ambition to become TYRANT( President for life ) of Honduras .

Zelaya led Honduras into strong ties with the leftist IRON CURTAIN of newly minted seven, PRESIDENTS FOR LIFE descending over Latin American , TYRANTS club, for totalitarian states in the Americas .  The  so called ALBA BLOCK of countries.  Zelaya was attempting to consolidate rapidly his hold on the organs of government and the Judge of the judicial branch, or Vice President of Congress, Maria Villedi said; there were contingents of Nicaraguan, Venezuelan and Cuban agent provocateurs inside Honduras , trying to destabilize the democratic functioning of the government of Honduras .

The female Vice President of the Honduras Congress said:  that the world should know, that in Honduras there was no Military Coup d’etat and even as we speak, the Honduras Congress has been recalled into session on this Sunday. Democracy is well in hand.  She also said that the President of the Senate also becomes now the President of Honduras, by constitutional law.  Zelaya had submitted a letter of resignation to the Congress signed in front of the media as witnesses.   Congress and Zelaya had been at odds for a month in dialogues refusing him permission to take the unilateral actions he wanted to take, which his Honduras Congress told him were in violation of the Honduras Constitution.  He refused to obey Congress  and committed illegal acts.  When the media interviewed his wife, Mrs. Zelaya  admitted her husband wanted to be PRESIDENT FOR LIFE, or a TYRANT on the model of Fidel Castro, or Hugo Chavez.

This was a legal arrest and deportation and the military acted on the arrest order of the judicial branch ( Supreme Court ) of the Honduran government.  Ex-President Zalaya was guilty of circumventing the lawful rights of the elected representatives in Congress, in his own ongoing coup attempt.  In the REPUBLICAN system of governing, a sitting President has a lot of power, but in this case, the military and the legislative branch refused to obey his constitutionally  illegal actions.  They would not agree as a Congress in what he wanted to do, to change the Constitution of Honduras permitting him to be President for Life.

In Belize here, we do not have the Constitutional  law that one political Prime Minister of one party, cannot be re-elected to continuous terms.  This can prove disastrous as many African countries have shown, that once belonged to the British Commonwealth .  Perhaps we should have it, that a political party cannot go more than one term in office in Belize , and that term reduced to three years and campaigning for office not be allowed for more than three months, instead of the full year currently in practice in Belize ?  There is too much wastage in our own Belize political system.¨ –End of Post–Thank you Ray!

And this is a copy of an email from a woman living in Rotan, Honduras:

¨Just wanted you to know that things are quite and peaceful here, regardless of what you see on the TV. The government asked people to stay at home today, and so did the Peace Corps, so I – along with most of Honduras -, have stayed at home. We expect the banks to be open tomorrow, and business as usual.
Around noon the electricity came back on and just now, my internet came back. I’ve been watching CNN en Espanol and working on a quilt square.
The airport is expected to remain open, there have really been no demonstrations in this part of the country. I’m told the ones you saw on TV were paid demonstrators. Mel Zelaya has not been a popular president; the country does not like his leftist leanings, the congress asked him to step down yesterday and he refused, so….
People around here are delighted that he has been deposed and Micheletti has been voted in – and the congressional vote was UNANIMOUS. Both parties voted to dump him.
So that’s all the news here. We’re just waiting for international recognition.¨ -End of email-

My Comments: Now these people are both closer to what is going on and are not the biased press that exists in the USA, Europe, Canada and Venzuela.   So now we know what is really going on!

False,0,1425992657,Health,"Here's what I remember reading that I believe debunks your point:

""It should be noted here that Seventh Day Adventists are often studied in population analyses to prove that a vegetarian diet is healthier and is associated with a lower risk for cancer (but see a later paragraph in this section). While it is true that most members of this Christian denomination do not eat meat, they also do not smoke or drink alcohol, coffee or tea, all of which are likely factors in promoting cancer (44).

The Mormons are a religious group often overlooked in vegetarian studies. Although their Church urges moderation, Mormons do not abstain from meat. As with the Adventists, Mormons also avoid tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine. Despite being meat eaters, a study of Utah Mormons showed they had a 22% lower rate for cancer in general and a 34% lower mortality for colon cancer than the US average (45). A study of Puerto Ricans, who eat large amounts of fatty pork, nevertheless revealed very low rates of colon and breast cancer (46). Similar results can be adduced to demonstrate that meat and animal fat consumption do not correlate with cancer (47). Obviously, other factors are at work.

It is usually claimed that vegetarians have lower cancer rates than meat-eaters, but a 1994 study of vegetarian California Seventh Day Adventists showed that, while they did have lower rates for some cancers (e.g., breast and lung), they had higher rates for several others (Hodgkin's disease, malignant melanoma, brain, skin, uterine, prostate, endometrial, cervical and ovarian), some quite significantly. In that study the authors actually admitted that:

    Meat consumption, however, was not associated with a higher [cancer] risk.

And that,

    No significant association between breast cancer and a high consumption of animal fats or animal products in general was noted. (48)

Further, it is usually claimed that a diet rich in plant foods like whole grains and legumes will reduce one's risks for cancer, but research going back to the last century demonstrates that carbohydrate-based diets are the prime dietary instigators of cancer, not diets based on minimally processed animal foods (49).

The mainstream health and vegetarian media have done such an effective job of ""beef bashing,"" that most people think there is nothing healthful about meat, especially red meat. In reality, however, animal flesh foods like beef and lamb are excellent sources of a variety of nutrients as any food/nutrient table will show. Nutrients like vitamins A, D, several of the B-complex, essential fatty acids (in small amounts), magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, potassium, iron, taurine, and selenium are abundant in beef, lamb, pork, fish and shellfish, and poultry. Nutritional factors like coenzyme Q10, carnitine, and alpha-lipoic acid are also present. Some of these nutrients are only found in animal foods--plants do not supply them.""

If you are developing an operating system, programming language, or data base manager to exploit a processor with 80 cores, as promised soon by Intel, then you are trying to plow new ground and at times some advanced work in computer science and mathematics might be crucial.

But let's assume, instead, that mostly you are trying to program applications for immediate use by end users.  That is, you are trying to be an 'applications programmer'.

There are some results in computer science useful in applications programming.  Heavily an applications programmer ends up using such results mostly by using code developed by others, e.g., an operating system, compiler, or data base manager, but some of the computer science results can at times be useful more directly.

The main goal of high end academic 'computer science' is 'research' on the 'principles' of computing, maybe hopefully for some good benefit in the future, maybe even the far future, and helping people who want to learn to be good applications programmers now is not the main goal.  In two crude analogies, the research is (1) trying to find a cure for cancer, not train family doctors, (2) trying to find a battery that weighs less than 50 pounds, costs less than $200, is efficient, safe, reliable, and long lasting, can store the energy in 40 gallons of gasoline, and can deliver 500 HP until its energy is exhausted, not train auto mechanics.

That computer science research can find important principles of computing is a guess and a hope but so far not much of an accomplishment.  Instead, what is useful in computer science remains fairly simple.

So, for being an applications programmer, don't feel inadequate because you didn't spend $100,000 on tuition and several years of your life listening to computer scientists teach courses in programming.

So far the connection between mathematics and either computer science or applications programming is not very strong.  For what might be important for applications programming, math through, say, first high school algebra, should be enough.

You have learned several programming languages:  Good.  That's a significant fraction of what is needed to be a good applications programmer and shows that you likely have plenty of ability for the rest.

You have learned to use If-Then-Else and For-Next:  Fine.  Those are the main 'control constructs' of 'structured programming' (as in E. Dijkstra) 'in the small'.

Below I outline most of the rest of what you are supposed to know.  Fill in the outline on your own and save the years in classes and $100,000.  Likely good details on all of these topics are readily available for free on the Internet:

1.0 Data Representation

It is most convenient for the electrical engineers to build digital electronics where a circuit is either ON or OFF.  So, regard one of ON or OFF as a 0 and the other one as a 1. Regard 0 and 1 as 'bits'.  Then can use digital electronics to represent, store, communicate, and manipulate bits.  That's the main idea of electronic digital computing.

A 'byte' is 8 bits.  How many different bytes are there?  Well if we number the bits from 1 to 8, then we see that for bit 1 there are two patterns, 0 and 1. Then with the first two bits there are 4 patterns, 00, 01, 10, 11.  In general for an integer n &gt;= 1, with n bits there are 2^n patterns so that with n = 8 there are 256 patterns.

So, with 256 patterns, we have enough patterns to represent all the upper and lower case letters of the Roman alphabet along with the more common accented letters common in Europe along with digits 0-9 and a lot of punctuation and special symbols.  Mostly that is what bits and bytes are used for.

But we can also use bits and bytes for numbers, sounds, pictures, computer programs, and more.

2.0 Computer Hardware

You should understand the basics of computer hardware.  So there is a processor that executes instructions.  There is main memory with data at memory locations.  Each such location has its own address.  Mostly the instructions use the addresses to read and write data in the locations.  There are means for input and output, either to/from the processor or to/from main memory.

There are privileged instructions and user instructions.

There is cache memory, and there may be more than one processor (or processor core).

Now nearly always there are address spaces in virtual memory.  You should understand the broad idea of locality of reference.  There may also be virtual machines.

Read a few pages that cover these terms and you will be fine.

3.0 Programming Languages

Here is an overview of the traditional work in programming languages:

We say that a 'string' is a sequence of printable characters.  So if a string has, say, 10 characters, then there is a character for each 1, 2, ..., 10.  These characters need not be distinct.

A 'programming language' is a set of strings regarded as 'legal' in the language.

To specify what the legal strings are, the usual approach is just some set notation written in a slightly different way called Backus-Naur form (BNF).  That is, we use BNF notation to specify the set of all strings that are legal in the language.

To 'parse' a language, we take a string and a definition of the language in BNF and see if the string is in the language or, if not, where is the first character of the string that shows that the string is not in the language.

Given the BNF, we can use a 'parser generator' to write the code, automatically, to parse the language.  The details of how to do this in an organized way were considered a good step forward in computer science.

For more details, see a book on compiler construction and, maybe, look at DeRemer's work on LALR parsing.

As you read you will see the roles of lexical scan, syntax, semantics, and symbol tables.  Then to run the program, you can use an interpreter or just do compilation to machine language, that is, on Windows, an EXE or DLL file.  For compilation you can learn about intermediate code, code optimization, code generation, and link editing.  The result, then, say, on Windows, is an EXE or DLL file.  There is nothing fundamentally difficult here.

If you take enough courses in computer science, you may learn how to write a compiler, but it is unlikely that an applications programmer (or now anyone) can get paid for writing a compiler.

The 250 mill. urban Chinese live and work in very different conditions and have very different attitudes and aspirations from the rural Chinese. I guess the first world has an overwhelmingly large urban population and therefore more homogeneous.

The Indian urban society is pretty large in percentage terms numerically (about a third) as well as economically, much larger than many first-world countries. It's a mistake, therefore, to treat India as a homogeneous lump - there is a large, distinct, economically active subgroup which is much less caste sensitive.

Again, this is nothing unexpected; similar economic movements led by the Industrial revolution were responsible for dissolving a lot of birth-based stratification of European societies.

I've seen this with some of my American friends, who've got this idea that caste is the bogeyman which keeps India back. While it is a factor, it's not the biggest one - not even close. There's lots of other things - endemic corruption, regulatory hurdles to entrepreneurship, sharp religious/communal divides. To a Muslim, all Hindus are the same, and vice versa.

Hell no. Even if they were aware of their actions they might feel it entirely justified. That's exactly the way in which it is *systematic*.

I know the plural of anecdote is not data, but an uncle of mine runs a furniture factory; he's not overtly racist, but after a string of bad black employees he now judges them systematically. He's much more likely to hire someone who is white or asian than he is to hire someone who is black.

I've quizzed him extensively on the subject, and he doesn't feel that he's being particularly unfair or racist - he's just hired three black dudes in a row who all turned out to be lazy or drunks. 

This works in a myriad of cultural ways. I grew up in a very ethnically homogeneous area in rural Europe and I have all sorts of irrational hang ups that I occasionally have to consciously address - and I'm probably unusually introspective.

So you're correct in that being poor is the greatest disadvantage, but also consider that if you're black you're also statistically much more likely to be poor.

In their study on mice, a team of scientists in Europe has found that an imbalance of brain-signaling chemical known as serotonin, which regulates mood, can kill infant animals; in fact, they have identified a possible genetic cause of this imbalance. if the genetic link is confirmed, the research could lead to ways of identifying babies at risk, the times reported.

The paper also includes the EU data to compare to their own, but that has little to do with the point of their research anyways.  It is only included to show the degree to which decriminalization has worked (or not) as opposed to their previous methods still in use by the rest of the EU.


I agree the article linked at SA.com overstates the positives (or what they claim to be positive) of decriminalization.  But that is the author's problem and not the Cato Study, which stands on it's own.  Ad hominem attacks can be appropriate, especially in this case where much of the data is anecdotal in nature, as they are in this paper.  But that doesn't mean that one *automatically* dismisses the conclusions on that basis alone.  The paper looks solid to me.  I don't like how it being exaggerated and twisted by the decriminalization crowd, but that is why you read the original in the first place and investigate the source of its funding, authors, etc.  


You must see more into this, a conspiracy perhaps, but you are free to make your own conclusions.  I'll also one more thing - that I don't believe most people here understand Portugal is experimenting with decriminalization and *not* legalization which is far different.

False,0,1425993428,canada,"I'm not sure if PR would alleviate the problem of party entrenchment. Depending on the system, it can actually encourage it. For instance, if you take a look at EU parliament elections, the parties create a list of candidates and they get to seat X number of them based on their vote totals. That puts ALL the power in the hands of the party leadership.

What I think we really need is a system like the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system where you prioritize the candidates but you are still voting for a local candidate. Of course they are still chosen by the party apparatus, but at least it is the LOCAL party apparatus as opposed to the national or provincial one (though it's further complicated because  the national/provincial party still has levers of control, primarily through access to funding).

Of course, all of that still doesn't matter too much, because even if you do bust your hump to influence things locally, get some one acceptable on the ballet, and then get them elected, there's no guarantee they'll be in government rather than the opposition benches. And if they ARE in government, why, it's entirely up to the leader of the governing party, chosen by the national party apparatus (of course), to decide if that person gets to be in the minority of government MPs who actually have any ability to do anything (in other words, a Cabinet Minister) or if they'll just be a warm body who is basically only there to increment the government vote count by one. Unless of course you're Stephen Harper, in which case you just have a Cabinet full of puppets.

True,0,1425993481,Economics,"I have housemates living on 400€/month, but they still get student health insurance and don't save for retirement yet. If you're on your own, you can live quite comfortable for 1.500€/month, 1.000 if you have to.

I'd say living expenses depend on about four factors, some of which are up to you:

 * Retirement saving. You just need to take that into account, if you're self employed.

 * Health insurance. You *must* have health insurance in Germany, and that depends on age and income. If you're young, private health insurance with a co-payment can be less than 70€/month, but it gets expensive when you get older. You can voluntarily go into public health insurance even if you're self employed, and pay between about 300 and 600€, depending on income. If you're employed, it can be less (15% of income, split between your employer and yourself).

 * Rent: Depends on location. The good (inner city, well renovated) apartments are ~5€/m^2, if you don't mind being further from the center it can be half of that, possibly even less. Plus heating, electricity, Internet... Rooms in shared apartments are ~150-300€/month, usually including everything.

 * Food etc. Pizza delivery of a normal pizza is 5-8€ depending on what and where, you can get kebap for 1€, but I recommend going somewhere where it costs 2-3€. Very cheap pubs start at about 1.50€/pint, but you can easily pay twice as much (or even more, depending on where you go).

You really don't need a car. There's public transport, obviously, but I prefer walking (center, train station, super markets, park, bars and clubs are all in walking range from where I live, take-away or restaurant food -- various East-Asian, Indian, Pizza, Kebab, one Mexican, even Afghan and Iraqi -- are all within ""cigarette-distance"", but BK and McD are only in the center. There is a Subways, if you like that).
If you need to go somewhere, you can take the train, or the international airport outside the city. Berlin is 80 minutes by train.

So, there are cheaper places in the world, but I don't think they had retirement saving and health insurance in that $500 figure. For a proper city, in Europe, Leipzig is as cheap as it gets. This is mostly because there are so many empty apartments, so rent is cheap. Cheap rent means the waitress works for cheap while she studies, and that in turn makes your beer cheap, too.

Edit: Oh, *zero* German... Well, you could *get by*, but unless you move exclusively within a circle of ex-pats, you'll need German for a proper social life. Most speak some English, many well enough for a normal conversation and they'll jump at the opportunity, but when you're within a group of Germans there will be at least one who doesn't speak English well enough for the conversation to remain in English. Everybody has to learn English in school (but this is East Germany, so those over 35 have learned Russian), you need to have learned at least two foreign languages to go to uni, but it's still only school English (typically about 7 years). Once you're out of school, it quickly deteriorates if you don't use it regularly. That's just how it is.

Ever since the Diaspora, it had been a central tenant of Judaism that a return to the Holy Land was necessary. Throughout history, small groups of Jews returned to the area, but it didn't really start en masse until the late 1800's.

The First Aliyah was in 1881, and was prompted by pogroms in Eastern Europe. Shortly after, ""Der Judenstaat"" was published, bringing the movement of Zionism cohesion. Among Jewish communities, Zionism was very controversial, because many Jews felt that they needed some sign from God to return, which they did not have.

Around 1910 the Second Aliyah brought some 40,000 more Jews into Israel. They came from Russia (now Moldova) after anti-Jewish riots that had not been stopped or punished by the authorities. A lot of these people were socialists, and they are responsible for the kibbutz movement.

During WW1, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, which said that Britain had a favorable outlook on Jews settling in Palestine. Groups of Zionists helped Britain conquer Palestine, and the Third and Fourth Aliyahs brought maybe 100,000 more Jews to Palestine. 

The Fifth Aliyah, which coincided with the rise of Nazism, brought about 250,000 Jews from Germany, despite British immigration quotas. Many of these people were educated, wealthy individuals who went to Israel not because they particularly wanted to live there, but because they wanted to feel safe. Many other countries at this point were no longer accepting Jewish immigrants. This brought the Jewish population up to maybe 40% of Israel.

Of course, during this whole time the Arab Palestinians were not very happy. Britain found that not only could it not settle any kind of peace between the groups, but that the Jewish settlers were becoming increasingly violent. Thus, they withdrew, and by 1948, the UN decided to split Palestine in two. ",0,[deleted],t1_c0asam5,0,,True,,t5_2qh1i,1246649739,,13,t3_8y09s,False,13,t3_8y09s,c0asam5

True,0,1425993601,worldnews,"I think that coming from North America or Europe, one gets a false sense of just how bad an airline's reputation can be. In those areas, a bad airline is one where the planes are old, or where the service is bad.

On one occasion, we flew an airline in the Amazon with a bad reputation (our reasons were complex and involved threats from the US Treasury), not believing that an airline in a reasonably civilized country could be *that* unsafe, for only two flights.

We were wrong... we had a stop midway through at an airport with *no* instrumentation. This would have been fine in a small plane, but we were in a 737. And there was a low, thick cloud layer obscuring visibility - in the US, no one would be allowed to land in this situation. The plane was flown by an ex-fighter pilot who apparently didn't realize he wasn't in a fighter any more: the g-forces experienced when he aborted the landing after breaking through the clouds and realizing he was in the wrong place were the highest I've ever experienced in a plane. Then again, that may have just been him panicking.

After landing, we got to wait in the plane while it refuelled. This wouldn't be that bad, except that the captain was apparently sociable, and decided to tell those of us in front about how he was afraid of running into some mountains nearby, because the weather conditions there made them almost impossible to see much of the time, and he wanted to wait to see if the weather would get better. It didn't. Fortunately, he avoided the mountains this time, and had managed by chance to find the runway when landing after two tries.

**One year** later, in the same plane, and on the same flight, the crew didn't come out of the clouds in the right place, forgot to abort the landing, and crashed, killing everyone. In an airline with a fleet of four planes, it would be their second major crash in **three** years.

EDIT: Sorry, I had my numbers mixed up here. We flew in 2004, and the crashes were in 2003 and 2005, which would make for three years of operation, not five; however, if I recall correctly, their licence was suspended for some time after the 2003 crash, so that would make for significantly less than three years of operation...",0,[deleted],t1_c0asda6,0,,True,,t5_2qh13,1246655532,,1,t3_8xsij,False,1,t1_c0arz1d,c0asda6

True,0,1425993621,reddit.com,"&gt;It would be interesting, though, to hear a thorough explanation...

Fair enough. There are a few issues I want to address, so this may be lengthy, the tl;dr is that I think the author is probably a terrible teacher and somewhat racist.

First, it feels like this author is completely unaware of his own cultural experiences and what has become naturalized to him, and when he encounters different cultures acting out the same routines his lack of self-awareness causes him to perceive them as crass, uncivil, and other undesirable things. In short, he applies a double standard. Examples: his remarks about the ""crudest terms imaginable"" used in sexist rap, as the students groan ""she suck dat aaahhh."" This is portrayed as some sort of black phenomenon. Yet it was a band full of white people that wrote ""Givin' The Dog A Bone"" and gee, if that's not a crude male-dominant sexual metaphor on par with anything he describes, I don't know what is. It's not as though sex is absent from modern music either.

People - particularly teenagers - *like* the idea of lots of easy sex, of being important, of being wealthy easily. Black, white, hispanic, whatever students express these desires in different ways, but it is often the same essential desires. Now, these are admittedly not what I think kid's highest priorities should be, but they were probably mine when I was younger, and hey, they're still really attractive to me. Some people want to be a rock star living in a hilltop house and drivin' fifteen cars, other people want to be a rap star. Whatever. The assertion that this behavior is particularly endemic or unique to black students is absurd. 

It's the same with a lot of his other examples - gee, your students aren't super interested in researching Marcus Garvey, even though they're black? Guess how many white kids I've had not be particularly enthused about researching some dead old white person they've never heard of before? Sometimes, adolescents aren't real into history. Even I wasn't at times in my youth (and I think it's awesome now). 

Again, I'm not saying this is *good* or *desirable* - part of the teacher's role is to help kids overcome their distaste of these subjects, make them exciting and accessible, and get them to like it. But instead, this dude decides that they don't like it because they're black (because all white students are just the most engaged, studious little devils ever, eh?). 

A lot of his stories are interesting and relevant to some extend, but the way he frames them in racial absolutes - 'this is how black people are, this is how they act in groups, this is how lazy they are' - completely miss the reality that this has a lot to do with the way poorly educated students everywhere are. 

Second major point - a general critique that thinking in categorical black and white terms, particularly around identity issues, is often a sign of simplistic and biased thinking. He opens by saying ""Most whites simply do not know what
black people are like in large numbers,
and the first encounter can be a shock."". 

What the fuck?

No more need be said about that. 

Third, the issue of violence. There's some confusion between correlation and causation in his essay (as a teacher, he should know better) - he teaches in a majority black school, sees a lot of blacks fighting, declares ""hey, those black people are violent."" In reality, extremely poor school settings, particularly ones with poor teacher quality (I do not think this fellow is very good at his job), are prone to violence by all races. 

More on his bias in teaching - I think his anecdote about the history of philosophy day is particularly telling. On the one hand, he has a point - people like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau (or Hume - I forget exactly who he was talking about) - are both important to learn about, and white. But, there are also black people who have had political thoughts, and when the students ask why they aren't represented, ""they aren't European"" is not a very good answer (unless you're teaching a *class* on European History/Philosophy - which I gather he was not, since he describes covering other course material at other points in the class). His answer is essentially ""I arbitrarily decided we're talking only about European theorists, and they all happen to be white, so coincidentally it's all white people today."" I am *not* saying he shouldn't talk about those people, and maybe it is a little bit of pragmatism-induced-racialist-attitude-acceptance on my part, but if black students want to learn about black theoreticians, why on earth would you not accommodate that request? 

In fact, for me that might be a golden opportunity - his kids were very close to *asking* to hear about some particular philosophers. In a poor, urban school setting, few things scream ""learning opportunity"" like that. His tactic of shutting them down probably doesn't contribute to their overall academic engagement (which, of course, he later blames on them being black. Gee....)

""Black people"" aren't some crazy monolithic category of lazy incompetents. There are lazy black kids, just like there are lazy white kids who want to smoke pot and listen to rock and roll all day. There are promiscuous black people, and there are promiscuous white people too. Black kids were disruptive and dancing during his classes? Shit, when I was going to a rich, majority white private school growing up, some white kid opened the window when the teacher's back was turned and helped six people climb out of class. That probably qualifies as disruption too. 

I've had black students in my classes who have come to realize that they can care and learn about history, about philosophical abstractions, about politics, and so on and so forth. This gentleman appears to have decided in advance that it is not possible, and reacts to his students accordingly. Teacher-fail. 

*Edit* I just wanted to acknowledge I feel there are complexities I glossed over and points I didn't make, but even a request for a ""thorough"" explanation has its limits, and looking at the length of this, I think I hit ""thorough"" about four paragraphs back.

Now, one of the Europeans (little dude, funny mustache) was kind of crazy, hated quite a lot of people, he loved blonde hair, blue-eyed types, pretty much hated everyone else. Anyway he had a real hard-on for these jews, made them wear funny yellow stars n shit so they could be easly identified. Anyway while everyone was involved in this gigantic pissing match, little german dude was killing all the Jews he could lay his hands on. Anyway little german dude ended up getting his ass handed to him by the rest of the world an so he shoots himself. Game over. Well actually then things get interesting, as per your submitted question.

So after this war all the winners find these death camps, where german dude was killing he Jews, he killed loads of others too but the Jews were able to make quite a fuss about the whole thing. Anyway the winners felt terrible and promised to do something to help. Britain pretty much owned the globe at that stage so they said they would take care of it. They had to get rid of some countries after the war anyway (because they were skint and could not afford the upkeep). So they gave them a bit of desert which, coincidentally, the jewish people said was where they were originally from. So they started living there, however the Palestinians who used to live there were not too happy about the arrangement, they thought they had got rid of the Brits, only to end up with the Jews.

So then, between the 2 groups, there was a bit of tension. They both retired to their Holy Books to see what they should do to sort this issue out and they both came to the same, simple, stunningly-obvious conclusion. That was that they should just kill the other group, in keeping with their religions stated positon as one of peace and love.

Lots of other countries have tried to get involved and try to play peacemaker, but both sides start telling eachother to STFU n' stuff and it all falls to pieces, they build more walls, launch moe rockets and there are more dead people.

You're right - but Zelaya hasn't been imprisoned and he isn't facing any charges. He was removed from power as president. If he comes back to Honduras, *then* he will face arrest, criminal prosecution, and will have to go to court.

&gt; Impeachment doesn't mean kidnapping and throwing on a plane. No defense, no due process = illegal.

No, but defiantly resisting impeachment is against the law, and he was not kidnapped. He was temporarily arrested for staying the president's palace even though he was impeached, and then was flown off to Costa Rica to receive political asylum there. That was of his choosing. How many more times do we have to go through this before it begins to sink in?

&gt; Anything that serves the interests of the poor majority, but does not serve the interests of the corporate, political class - since right now, the political class controls the constitution, and the political process - as was the case in Venezuela before Chavez.

There's five things in the Constitution of Honduras that cannot be changed - none of these have to do with the interests of the poor. Everything else can be changed by Congress with 2/3 majority. Again: which of these unchangeable tenets in the constitution is it that Zelayas wanted to change on behalf of the poor?

There is none. He wanted to scrap the constitution because of the unchangeable law about presidential term limits. Get a clue already.

You were meant to read ""[Palestinian] Arab"" from context.  The Palestinians only get one Palestinian state, since after all there's only one Palestinian nationality.

&gt;Sorry, but what can you possibly see as wrong in that? They can't have a truce with Israel unless they recognise Israel. Basic logic.

In diplomacy and international relations recognizing someone means not merely recognizing their *de facto* existence but their *de jure* existence and their right to exist.  Recognition means making peace with someone, not just saying to your foes in a war that you'll now call them by their proper name.

&gt;Are you suggesting that Israel shouldn't withdraw from the illegally occupied West Bank? Or end the illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip? Or establish a Palestinian State? Or grant the right to East Jerusalem?

Israel *should* withdraw from the West Bank and should maintain their security around Gaza Strip (the blockade is perfectly legal in a state of declared war, especially given that it's the Hamas government which declared the war).  Establishing a Palestinian state is up to the Palestinians, but Israel should withdraw from aforementioned West Bank so that they have territory to establish one in.

Such an intervention may cause the patient to believe the treatment will change his/her condition; and this belief does indeed sometimes cause the patient's condition to improve. This phenomenon is known as the placebo effect.

Mexico was unable to protect the population there from attacks by native Americans. Mexicans didn't want to live in Texas, so the government of Mexico encouraged and incentivized Americans, Europeans and others to immigrate there in the hopes that more people would do what they were unable to do: Protect the tiny number of Spanish Mexicans in the territory. 

During all this time, almost none of the inhabitants of Texas wanted to be part of Mexico -- not the Spanish-speakers, not the immigrants -- nobody. Some wanted independence and some wanted American annexation. 

After the Mexican-American War, every body in Texas STAYED in Texas to enjoy full American citizenship.

I have worked in several African countries (DRC, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, etc…). Invariably that is what I found – it is an inconvenient truth. Maybe it is not that way in West Africa, but I highly doubt it.

There is a reason why the AIDS prevalence in Africa is so high. It is not because of closely bonded monogamous relationships (like in the west).

Now for a bit closer to home:

You are either a white person living in that country (some who are with their heads in the clouds) or you are one of the black elites. I don’t think very highly of the black elites. Like DRC pricks who only speak French because they think they are better than the rest of the population and the others that send their kids to the best private schools in Europe or South Africa.

There really is no need for the EU to impose what people will do willingly. So yeah I'd like to see some EU wide response to issues like energy security, not hardwired into the core of the EU but agreed upon as a one time issue with no granted powers outside that needed to pursue the specific aims. This has been done several times in the past both with the development of the Eurofighter and nuclear power.

That for me is the major issue. The US didn't start off as it is today. The slow accretion of 'the issue of today' led to what was meant to be a set of interacting states turning into one large super power. Once given powers are rarely returned.

Ideally I'd like to see much of what has already been transferred to the EU (such as CAP) be redesigned not as a far reaching and eternal power but as something agreed by the nations on a finite and specific basis.

This would allow the EU to focus in on the issues it really needs to deal with like keeping trade open between the states and ensuring we don't allow American corporations to break our patent laws.

I personally think this is why Euroskepticism has blown up. Most of us would prefer to keep the EU core small but recognise a larger and dynamic European picture.

If there weren't private ambulances in here I would have died last October. As for those, it's true competition - the equivalent of 100 $ for anywhere to anywhere in a 2 million city.

- Our great Government, having financial difficulties a few years ago (too many tax exempts to their corporate friends) *took all the funds from the insurers* (even if that was illegal) and let the people die in hospitals from lack of funds for their treatment. 

- The state buys all the shit. The employees being corrupt they buy at outrageous prices from private firms (that also happens in USA) the result is that the patients have to buy their own treatment from the private market and bring it in the state run hospital. Or die if they don't have the money. 

- People in serious condition are refused while people who can be treated at home (but have money for bribes or know somebody in the system) are accepted.

- If you rely on that important matter on the state then you are dependent on the Govt. More power to the State to control you.

- You have dealt all your life with moronic state employees who don't give a shit or are happy to harass you. Do you really want to trust *them* with your life? 

IMO a private system *but with real free market and competition* (not like in the USA) is the best. BTW, the free competition in the USA was destroyed by the *State* through regulation in order to serve their Corporate donors.

""Anti-competitive practice"" constitutes illegal use of a monopoly to push another product.

Whether or not that push is successful is irrelevant. Also, laws are applied _after_ the fact. Trying to kill someone and then have that somebody survive does not make you innocent.

Point at the living body in the hospitol saying 'see, he isn't dead, so I did not attempt to commit murder'... makes about as much as sense as this defense.

I do not agree with the actual resolutions of the EU in this matter though. I don't think they make sense at all. I think the debate should be: is one company allowed to be active in so many different markets? The answer should be: NO. The IE team should split out of Microsoft and so should the XBox team and the Office team.

In a more theoretical economic sense, a big corporation the size of Microsoft is very much like communism at the inside. The strong supporting the weak and the market mechanisms not correct distributing the resources. In the end the consumer is treated by such companies much like inhabitants of a communistic state: no freedom of choice. And yes, this applies to many many many more companies.

It was not just the collapse, the USSR under Gorbachev became more and more open and less willing to fund foreign experiments. Most white people in South Africa feared two related things – the first one was the “Rooi gevaar” (Red danger) – i.e. the threat of communism. This was a pretty real threat and the ANC/SACP got funded by the Soviet Union. Another was the “total onslaught”.

You should maybe understand South Africa’s economy. The biggest shock for South Africa was the oil sanctions from Iran after the Shah was deposed (in the 70ies or something). That started the creation of SASOL (that makes fuel from coal). South Africa’s economy under Voster had a large part of import substitution. 

Our major exports were commodities (like gold, iron, chromium) and the imports were low (due to not being so dependable on oil and having import substitution). Most commodities are simply exported through an intermediate country (i.e. sanction busting). As for imports, Israel and other countries did a fair share of sanction busting.

Just to show how ineffective sanctions was – S. Africa had a much higher GDP per capita than all other African countries – which did not have divestment campaigns or sanctions going.

The sanctions were also not blanket sanctions. Here is a quite from WP:

&gt; Between 1985 and 1987, U.S. imports from South Africa declined 35%, although the trend reverses in 1988 when imports increased by 15%. Between 1985 and 1998, U.S. exports to South Africa increased by 40%.

&gt; or the combined economic might of 99% of the Human Race?

Uhm… The USA only had limited sanctions (it is the largest economy in the world). And yes, you only need one unsanctioned country to bust sanctions.

Actually Lincoln used slavery as a reason to enforce a to that point unseen federal power over the states. This was the first of many big tipping points toward federal control of power. Not that ending slavery was a bad thing, but in actuality it was more of a byproduct of what he was really working toward. Alot of why he gave the emancipation proclamation wasn't to free the slaves but rather to assuage European powers from supporting the South. Lincoln himself was actually a pretty staunch racist.

""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races – that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything.” - Abraham Lincoln

That figure didn't include all the unoccupied/For Lease commercial properties that *had* been occupied, but were then vacant. I moved to San Jose in '74 and *fled* in '93; apparently things only got worse, even though they FINALLY(!) fixed the fraking roads! The cost of living, the traffic and the outsourcing of jobs and industry were killing the area back then; I drove 13 miles to/from work in the mid eighties and it took 2:40 to 3 hours to get to work in the AM and 1:45 to 2.5 hours to get home in the PM. The only happy workers I knew were *hourly* swing shift and graveyard shift workers in waferfab!

I went into the Sunnyvale *TGI Friday's* on a Saturday night in 1987 to meet some people for dinner. I arrived early and went to the bar and took the only available chair, next to a moderately attractive young woman in formal evening attire (waaay overdressed for *Friday's*). There were over thirty men at the bar and a male bartender who were all watching me, but I couldn't order a drink. When I turned to the woman to ask if she was having any problems being served, she said ""Don't even talk to me unless you're a doctor or a lawyer!"" while avoiding eye contact. I was somewhat taken aback by such rudeness, but I'd seen this before. I was wearing designer jeans, an open collar shirt and a leather jacket, but I didn't wear jewelry because I worked with electronics systems and I wasn't wearing my old Swiss watch, just a Seiko diver's that had seen the bottom of Monterey Bay many times, so I wasn't *dressed to impress* by any means. I noticed the bartender and the guys at the other end of the bar were watching, pointing and having an animated discussion, so I twigged to why this was the only empty seat and everyone at my end had scooted their chairs away, leaving the overdressed sociopath slightly apart from everyone else. Thinking quickly, I said in my best 'parade ground' voice, ""I'm a Venture Capitalist and I wouldn't speak to you if you were the last *cunt* on the planet!"" and got up and went to stand at the other end of the bar. At least twenty guys all shouted ""YES!"" and started high-fiving each other and most of them started slapping me on the back, congratulating me like I had made a 3-pointer from half-court with one second on the clock and a dozen guys tried to buy me a beer, but the bartender who wouldn't wait on me gave me one and said ""It's on the house."" The red-faced woman was so humiliated by the outcry she left.

False,0,1425994514,politics,"This is one of those moments where you have to recognize that the world is not made up of 1) evil overlord white people and 2) perfect angels who are kept down by The White Man. Categorical oppression has been a multi-directional thing throughout history and it continues to be so. Anyone with some historical education in this should not be too surprised. 

The truth is that America is one of the few countries in the world to ever address its racism formally, as a problem. In many parts of the world, racism isn't even considered racism, it's just *the way things are* It's ironic that America seems so plagued by racism. In reality it is largely more tolerant than many places, but it's also more mixed than many places, and its history of slavery is a legacy not easily set aside. But at the same time, other countries operate fully formed caste systems to this day, while the US has had a constitutional amendment franchising all races for over 120 years. 

Gay rights are far down the totem pole in terms of whose oppression gets addressed first. The historic order of things has been 1) racial issues 2) gender issues 3) what else do you want? reverse racism, blah blah quack quack. 

The fact that there is a national debate about gay issues is fantastic. I know it's been several decades since Stonewall, and people are right to demand full equality for gays and to demand it now. But the fact that it's being discussed at all is a sign that we're deep into #3, and that's a good thing for the US. I'm not settling for crumbs here, I'm just noting that the arc of history is long, and it continues to move in a good direction for gays.

Racism is prevalent in many places around the world, but homophobia is so ubiquitous it's hard to even describe it as ""institutionalized."" Something that's never talked about, is taken for granted, and is just THERE can hardly be called institutionalized, except perhaps in an unconscious way. Fucking think about it: what is it like to be gay in China, India, Morocco, Chile, Kenya, Saudi Arabia? I'm not trying to pick on these places. I really mean it: think about gay rights around the world. Europe is pretty liberal. Thailand is uniquely so. I am sure some spots in South America are better than others. But show me the list of these countries who recognize gay marriages on the federal level. It's short. 

The freedoms that gays enjoy already in the US are quite liberal by standards held around the world. My father is from the middle east and thought for most of his life that homosexuality was a mental disorder. He told me about the scant few homosexuals he ever knew of growing up in Damascus, and they were all 1) drug addicts 2) fuckups or outright criminals 3) genuinely mentally ill from the sound of the stories. 

I realized that gays in that part of the world must be so far underground that only the unstable ones ever let it slip. Everyone is engaged in an elaborate societal lie, and only those already unhinged from society in some way are reckless enough to show their colors. Naturally, if only the only gay people you ever knew were criminals or druggies, you'd think it was a fucked up way to be too. And this is the self-reinforcing cycle of the closet. Only the looney ones tell. However, I also eventually realized that this is only half the story.

The other half is a story many of us know. There's someone in your life who you think is gay, but you aren't sure and they don't tell you they are. You might like some of these people a whole lot. They might be your boss, your neighbor. They could be some of the nicest, coolest people you know. There's just something a little bit off about them, which you only sometimes notice. You hope it's nothing. You speculate about it with your friends or your spouse. ""I bet he's gay,"" but you don't actually know. 

This happens in the unfriendly parts of the world, too, even though the smart gays there remain thoroughly, completely closeted. They may even be sexually active, but they have hetero marriages, and never ever let on. Their lives may well depend on that. 

Their sexual identity is been compressed into a small box labeled ""what I like in the bedroom,"" which, after all, is quite private for most of us. So why not private for them, too? Is it so bad to be closeted, they'd ask? Watch Milk. You'll find even he was asking that same question well into his 40s. 

Those who supported Prop 8 simply wanted this historic ""don't ask, don't tell"" arrangement to continue. And, in some twisted defense of them, I will point out that ""don't ask/tell"" has been the norm for a long time.They don't really want to eliminate homosexuality; they know it's always been there. They just want it out of sight. For untold generations, gays have supported this arrangement too, because it was all they had or could imagine. 

Prop 8 supporters already feel like they are compromising by allowing gays to exist. I believe their thought process - AT BEST - goes something like this:

""Hmm. You live across the street from me. I have that funny feeling about you, I think you're gay, because of the way you dress and the way you keep your yard. And yet I would like to point out that, to my credit, I haven't firebombed your house or taught my children to hate you. But now you want me to get up, get out of my house, and vote in favor of your bald and naked right to be recognized by the federal government?? I beg your pardon, but that's too much. I'm already tolerating you. I'm in fact a lot more liberal with you than my parents' generation. Now learn your place. You're going too far.""

Of course, this is a two-front battle. Obviously, closeted gays are in a completely deluded and self-defeating position. Far from ""what I like in the bedroom,"" one's sexual identity is who you are, who you love, how you live. There is no valid way to put this under wraps and carry on as if you're the same as everyone else. To do so is to surrender one's individuality to society to an extreme degree. You might as well be living in North Korea and worshiping Great Leader while you live on grubs you dug up from under the peat. I don't give a shit if you moved to San Francisco and have a nice apartment. You're still a second class citizen. And from what I've seen, a lot of folks are all too willing to live with that. 

I really don't know what excuse blacks and hispanics have for failing to support the civil rights of gay people. My angry side would like to say that they clearly don't deserve their own hard-won rights if they're willing to deny them to others. But it takes me back to the priority order. 

Remember? It's 1) race 2) gender 3) maybe other stuff. Women know damn well what it feels like to see a civil rights movement succeed, but then be left out of the warm afterglow. Black men got the vote in America 50 years before women. That's right! Look it up. 15th and 19th amendments, folks. It seems bizarre, but it's true. Ex-slaves could vote in America before white women from good families. 50 fucking years before. Goddamn 1870. It was 1920 before women got the vote!

It's worth noting that gays can vote. And barring a few draconian municipal statutes in various hellholes around the country, it's not actually illegal to be gay. The frontiers of gay issues these days are military service and marriage, not mere survival, not human rights but civic rights - and only certain ones at that. I don't mean to diminish the marriage cause - I support it completely. I'm just guessing at why some of my gay friends don't really seem to care much about it. 

My own wedding was two weeks ago, in California, and I was sure to address the guests and ask everyone to support marriage equality. We specially chose a church that was friendly to GLBT folks. My lovely bride, whom everyone loves happens to be a different race than myself, and interracial marriage was illegal in some states until 1967, for fuck's sake. My brother was born that year! I knew I had some folks in the crowd who were not that comfy with gays, but given that we had 1/2 the room full of chinese people looking over at the other 1/2 full of syrians, I thought it was the right comparison to make.

True,0,1425994695,environment,"&gt;&gt; You can have a five-year old car which already done it 30 times, or the brand-new model

&gt; False dichotomy.

I think not, see below

&gt; You're wrong about the plants not being tested, countries other than the US have built newer plants.

Much less during the last 20 years than in the decade before. Moreover thinking that practical (applied) experience gained in other countries will benefit to the US may be difficult to prove... In theory the nuclear industry tries so, but in practice secrecy, lazyness and commercial competition often have the last non-word.

&gt; Generation IV plants are far better in terms of maintenance, design, efficiency

Before the Three Mile Island accident, nearly every expert professed that there will be absolutely no problem, that the design was ultra-secure, that nothing could go wrong (TMI was not a major disaster only by sheer luck, nothing went as planned). In Soviet's newspapers the nuclear powerplants were, prior to the Chernobyl disaster, presented as secure to the point of being potentially installable on the Red Square floor.

&gt; A closer analogy might be: ""would you rather drive across the desert with the best car from the 1980s, or the best car available today?""

Well, I may not have clearly stated that I was thinking of plants DESIGNS, not buildings (instances)! I mean: a proven design is often more secure than a new one. When it comes to critical material most experts prefer it.

Moreover the new nuclearplants designs (gen 3+ and 4) are barely revolutions, in my opinion showing that the guys behind the drawing board also know that a too innovative design may have some hidden major quirk waiting to hit.

Even this approach is not perfect, for example the very first [EPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Pressurized_Reactor), generation 3+, was already sold to Finland when experts commissioned by the customer discovered a major design problem (see Nucleonics Week ; march 11, 2004): some ""sump strainer clogging"" may prevent the ""core catcher"", a thingie designed to protect the reactor during a steam explosion, to work properly. In fact the design error could transform the protective device into a booster for a steam explosion threatening the reactor.

All that being said, the single fastest growing group is non-belief, even in the US.  In Europe and Canada, that group is skyrocketing.  With no church at all reinforcing ANY sort of belief up here, we'll be hard pressed to show any religious behaviour whatsoever except in the very insular groups, ie.

True,0,1425994901,Economics,"&gt;Overpopulation occurs when the ecosystem can no longer sustain an inhabitant species

I think we are only disagreeing on semantics. The point I was trying to make was that an ecosystem can always sustain an inhabitant species because that species is dependent on that ecosystem. One can't have overpopulation because the environment will always limit a population.

Your point that it is overpopulation when the population reaches a size that the environment can not support is equally valid. From the perspective of the given species, population crashes caused by the environment can be traumatic. So, population sizes that may cause a crash could be considered overpopulation if the goal is to avoid the crash.

If I understand you, this leads to our disagreement. I would much rather have the environment manage the size of the human population than human governments. When I think of humans trying to manage their own populations I look at what we do to dogs in trying to manage their populations. In that case we have a bunch of breeds loaded with genetic defects who are in most respects inferior to their wild ancestors. China's attempt at population control and the inbred European aristocrats are two known attempts at managing population and genetics both of which give me little confidence human leadership is up to the task of managing human population.

I agree that all solutions should be considered including the effects of population but I think our economic system and the world banking system's attempt at empire are more responsible for world hunger then the size of the human population.",0,johnptg,t1_c0av00c,0,,True,,t5_2qh1s,1246926912,,1,t3_8yl5g,False,1,t1_c0auob2,c0av00c

The Irish-owned airline Ryanair
announced the possibility of domestic
flights between Porto and
Faro, following an agreement with
ANA, the company in charge of
the nation’s airports, to open a
new base in Porto and its decision
to increase operations in Faro.
Communications director for Ryanair
Europe, Daniel de Carvalho,
said last week that the company is
also keen to operate low-cost domestic
flights between Porto and
Lisbon. During a press conference
last week in Porto, Ryanair’s
Michael Cawley said that the airline
will open its 33rd base in Porto
during September this year and
will be investing about €100 million
in two new aircraft that will
be based at Porto’s Sá Carneiro
airport, creating around 16 new
routes with 50 daily departures
and sustaining more than 1.500
jobs in the city.
Celebrating the new base in
Porto, Ryanair offered more than
a million tickets at a single €5
cost and a further million tickets
at only €9 each, although the offer
closed last Sunday. Several new
routes into Porto are being created:
Basel, Eindhoven, St Etienne
and Tours. Ryanair estimates that
the new Porto base, along with
increased operations at Faro airport,
will bring up to 1,5 million
passengers annually, 50 per
cent more than 2008 figures. According
to Cawley, Ryanair is also
doubling the number of flights
from Porto to Paris Beauvais airport
probably harnessing a large
number of the Portuguese emigrant
market. He also said that Ryanair
is “doing more to join Portugal
to Europe” than the proposed
TGV high-speed rail link will ever
do, “if it ever will.”
The Minister of Public Works,
Transport and Communications,
Marío Lino, said that Ryanair’s
plans “carried out in a particularly
adverse economic climate, shows
a quiet confidence from both
ANA and Ryanair.”
Cawley also reiterated the goal
of Ryanair to reach 100 million
passengers across Europe in 2012,
setting the goal for this year at 67
million passengers. “We’re still
comfortable about the targets,” he
said, noting that “while prices are
low, people will travel”. Ryanair,
the first foreign company to set
up airline operations in Portugal,
plans to reduce prices by 15 to 20
per cent this year.
Whilst Ryanair has seen a record
98 per cent increase in passengers
flying to Portugal, other low-cost
airlines, including easyjet, Monarch,
Air Berlin, Hapag-Lloyd Express
and Thomsonfly have seen
losses. According to ANA, overall
passenger traffic fell by 11,3
per cent from January to May this
year, with the biggest losses coming
from the UK market. The only
other exception to the rule is
British Airways, with an increase
of 96,7 per cent, although last year
BA’s traffic into Faro was almost
zero.",0,sempre_conectado,t1_c0av9s6,0,,True,,t5_2r1sn,1246949931,,1,t3_8yv6p,False,1,t3_8yv6p,c0av9s6

False,0,1425995049,politics,"&gt;Leftists are inclined to be aggressive activists, promoting their utopian convictions publicly with evangelical zeal. Through their fervor, in the heat of the moment, they often unveil the ugly side of their character by inadvertently blurting out their eager anticipation of the time when they will administer, with relish, the coercive measures upon their perceived enemies. For the Leftist politician the desire is to enact legislation for grandiose collectivistic and economically leveling undertakings. For the Leftist academician and intellectual the desire is, to put it simply, to force everyone to think and act in a manner that would conform with a model of human behavior in an ideal egalitarian society conceptualized by Leftist philosophy. For the blue-collar Leftist street fighter the underlying motivation can be as simple as hatred for the boss. 

&gt;The principle that the end justifies the means is in individualist ethics regarded as the denial of all morals. In collectivist ethics it becomes necessarily the supreme rule: there is literally nothing which the consistent collectivist must not be prepared to do if it serves ""the good of the whole,"" because the ""good of the whole"" is to him the only criterion of what ought to be done.'

&gt;George Watson, a historian of the modern era who is presently engaged in writing a comprehensive history of socialism, puts it well in an article in the Dec.31, 1995 issue of the National Review, titled ""Never blame the left"". He writes: ""The Left is perceived as kind and caring, despite its extensive history of promoting genocide.""; and further: "".. in modern Europe, genocide has been exclusively a socialist idea, ever since Engels proclaimed it in Marx's journal the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in January-February 1849. Ever since then everyone who has advocated genocide has called himself a socialist, without exception."" He concludes the article with: ""What we need now is a serious and unblinking study of socialism, of what it said and what it did: one that does not fudge the evidence: one that is brave enough to tell it as it was.""

&gt;The above theory sounds preposterous, to say the least. How can it be claimed that the millions of compassionate, well-intentioned Leftists who populate the Western democracies all harbor within them such malevolence? The answer is that here we are dealing with the deep recesses of human nature, where a predisposition for evil can lie dormant for an entire lifetime and never surface, unless the ambient social conditions invite its development. For example, we recognize envy, which is in all of us to some degree, as a powerful motivator for evil actions. And without a doubt, intense envy hides beneath the patina of righteous egalitarianism of the Leftist.

Most western countries have decriminalized adultery. Adultery is not a crime in most countries of the European Union, including Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland or Sweden.

In the United States, laws vary from state to state. In those states where adultery is still on the statute book (although rarely prosecuted), penalties vary from life sentence (Michigan)[30], to a fine of $10 (Maryland), to a Class I felony (Wisconsin) [31]. In the U.S. Military, adultery is a potential court-martial offense.[10] The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States has been / is being questioned following Supreme Court decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults, in cases such as Lawrence v. Texas.

I just think that there is something better, too. 

There is a natural role for the government of a Republic in some, but not all, aspects of health care, I say.

For example, from the richest scion to the poorest slob, nobody wants a waiter with Typhus. Never. Nor any communicable disease. If we agree this is the case, then the government should be involved in health care for all communicable diseases. I'd say STDs, too, since I think they are all potentially communicable without sexual contact. Although I think the rich think they are fine as long as the blood supply is rigorously monitored, I think it probably should be covered.

On the other hand is my step-brother, who has, if I remember correctly, broken bones on 11 separate occasions doing motocross.

I want him to live a long, prosperous and happy life, but I don't see how it is any of your or my business to pay for all his hospital bills.

False,0,1425995102,psychology,"My best explanation for the general objections to people like Pinker involves two dichotomies. The first relates to the mind/body problem. There seems to be a particular aversion to making claims that indicate that certain cognitive traits are quite limited by our genes. If you were to tell the average person that they do not have the genes that would allow them to be a professional basketball player, it is unlikely they will get offended. Sure, there are people who are of average height or shorter who play professionally (e.g. Nate Robinson, who is 5'7'' or 5'9''), but they are genetic freaks. The average person just doesn't seem to react to physical limitations that are likely due to genes the same way they react to cognitive limitations that are likely due to genes.

Tell some parent that since their kid has an IQ of around 90 that they will likely not be a doctor or lawyer and the parents generally react in horror as though you're passing judgment of their child's worth. They will then spout off illogical arguments about how trying hard matters (with the implication that traits like conscientiousness aren't as heritable as traits like intelligence and the implication that the person they are speaking to does not realize that achievement involves both raw intelligence and other psychological traits) or about how IQ doesn't measure everything (but the correlation between intelligence alone and income ranges from 0.4 upward, so 1/6 of the variance is explained; pretty powerful for a test that doesn't measure anything).

I haven't quite developed an explanation for why this is, so I cannot provide a full explanation. I sense it has something to do with the fact that we all value intelligence and as such do not want to admit that we may have the short end of the stick in that regard.

The other dichotomy that seems to be involved is free will/determinism. People just do not want to admit that macro-level behaviors may be influenced by something that they cannot control. Sure, they will admit that on the micro-level there are things that we cannot control and seem wholly unaware that we cannot. For example, the fMRI studies that have found that you can artificially stimulate various brain regions to get people to undertake actions, like looking behind them, and the people will confabulate reasons for why they are doing so, like 'I wanted to check to see if my purse was still there'; I cannot for the life of me remember the guy's name who did these studies, some Norwegian neuroscientist. Or that we seem to make decisions fractions of a second before we are aware that we have made a decision. It's not to say that these studies do not have alternative explanations that keep our egocentric notions of free will in tact, but that the revulsion that people have to these studies pales in comparison to the outrage that they will express when you study something like rape. It's as though the neuroscience studies are about a ""micro"" lack of free will. The ""macro"" lack of free will that evopsyc (and related fields) touches upon are disproportionately offensive compared to the ""macro"".

Why the Left in particular seems revolted? Partially because the Left has traditionally aligned itself with ideas that implied that human nature can be malleable. According to them, all the offensive -isms (racism, sexism, etc) can be eliminated if we just set up the proper societal influences. So anything that tells them to stop being so naive can be offensive, especially when they use the guise of science to make their pronouncements.

Some parts of the Left have been overly infected with post-modernist ideas, so the fact that white European males are parroting so called biological truths does not impress them in the least (this partial explanation is better for the radical feminists who got butthurt when Pinker tried to bring reason to the Larry Summers situation).

Other parts are just irrational. They think that people who voice sociobiological ideas must have hidden agendas, even when you provide evidence that plenty of these people (e.g. EO Wilson and Richard Dawkins) have leftist sympathies.

True,0,1425995103,politics,"Made no sense cause you don't know anything about economics. To begin with, free market means a system in which the government does not step into private business making decisions for it. The government has no involvement and lets companies do their own decisions without intervening. I honestly don't know where to start answering your novel of a comment, since all of it shows is you have no idea of how the market works.

&gt; Big corporate using their muscle to control public policy is not a free market.

I suppose here you are referring to companies lobbying for extra rights. Yeah, that's a problem in the government side, which over the years has taken on a lot more responsibilities than a government should. Cut the governments power and you won't need lobbying anymore. I agree at the moment even in the states it is not a free market. Government still steps into the market to make the changes they thing need to be made.

&gt; It is a place of winners and losers where the losers and their families rot.

Drama Llama. Nobody is going to rot, give me a break. You're just dramatizing. Also, that's life...it's full of winners and losers. You can't save everybody even if you try, but a free market does not mean people being worse of. To give you an example, Ireland has recently relaxed its market laws (less taxation, less gov control etc.) and guess what, people are doing better than they have ever done. Their GDP has risen over the last years, being one of the highest in Europe. In fact, in every country where the economy is left to do as they please without intervention, they are doing better. Do some research. So much for your theory.

&gt; In the current capitalist system, the wealthy pay far less for goods and services that the non wealthy. This destroys you free market concept entirely.

Where do you get these ideas? How the fuck do the wealthy pay less for goods and services? If they want to see a doctor, they pay the same amount, same for food, gas, electricity and telephone. And don't forget, most likely they are the ones that made all these things possible in the first place. Entreprenours that made supermarkets and phone companies and so on so that you can benefit from those services. That's free market that got you those things.

&gt; The more money your have the easier it is to make money. This destroys your free market utopia.

Depends what your plan is. Google started in a garage and now it's a multi-billion dollar company. Why does this destroy my free market ""utopia""? By the way, I never said it is an utopia. I just say it's a better system.

&gt; It has nothing to do with being a good manager or service or quality.

Bullshit. That's the basis of the market system. That really shows you have zero clue about what you are talking.

&gt; You seem to have decided that 'good managers' are deserving of more than people who are not good managers.

Yes, and that applies in all areas in life, not only business. If a person can manage their shit correctly, then they are more deserving of rewards and safety and whatever in contrast with people that don't manage their stuff correctly, e.g. people that take credit for shit they don't need, can't pay it back, banks that make wrong investments and so on. And usually people that can manage their money, plans and future correctly get more from life than people that are disinterested and wasteful. This is really just a fact of life, no longer economics.

&gt; You seem to support the goals of the greedy above the goals of the humble.

There's nothing wrong with greed. Everybody is greedy to one extent or the other. Because somebody was greedy and wanted some money, they invented an operating system and now you can benefit from that product because someone was greedy at some point in their life. Greed and vileness are not synonyms and people tend to forget that. Again, fact of life: people that strive more usually get more.

&gt; You have to decide if you are for free market capitalism or if you are for the equal opportunity values of the United States. The two philosophies oppose one another.

Why do they oppose each other? I actually think they are one and the same thing.

Honestly, while you don't see as many Caucasian/Indian relationships as some others, I've almost never known an Indian guy who was attracted to Caucasian women and who wasn't able to date them.  The problem might require some work on your own part, but none of the problems are insurmountable.

It's relatively clear that the various Asian peoples have significantly less muscle tone, on average, than those of European or African descent.  While East Asian cuisine tends to keep them thin, Indian cuisine is hearty and creamy (surprise, as it was heavily influenced by the British), and therefore Indian people who don't work out tend to be naturally 'rounder'.  Maybe it's a coincidence, but the Indian guys I've known that had success with Caucasian women are either gym rats or professionally quite successful (or both).  Plus, mentioning cuisine means mentioning the fact that spicy Indian cuisine, while absolutely delicious, tends to result in spice running through the pores, through the clothes, and through one's furniture.

Second is the Asian cultural work ethic.  While us Caucasian nerds/geeks know from a very early age that we are naturally nerdy, and can learn to compensate if we so desire, the combination of the expected stereotype, and the educational focus of your parents combine to make many Asian-Americans oblivious to their own nerd-dom.

Now, of course, none of these may apply to you, or some might apply, and some might not... but the one thing that is obvious is: *no confidence*.  I'm sure you could go up to a Caucasian slumpbuster at a party and become a couple, but if you want to date *attractive* women (of any race), you need confidence in yourself, which you obviously lack.

At least remember that if you do succeed, find a nice Caucasian girl to date, end up getting married, and have a daughter... she'll probably be quite hot.

I agree. I generally consider myself a progressive, but the Right is onto something in their disgust of the rise of the victim mentality. America is eating itself alive with preventable illnesses related to smoking, over eating, alcohol, sexual promiscuity without protection, and lack of exercise. 

Bad choices are not ""diseases"". The term ""disease"" is useful only for describing the cumulative social effect of these bad choices. We all pay for peoples' stupid choices, it is time to start telling them they are stupid and putting in place the regulation frameworks to mitigate the social costs associated with their bad choices.

Here is my take on how to correct some of these issues:

1. Incentivize good choices with tax law. This includes preventative medical treatment, good diets, exercise, etc.

2. Regulate the hell out of tobacco products. NO ADDITIVES ALLOWED. Only 100% natural (preferably organic) tobacco. Native Americans were not smoking 3 packs of Peace Pipes per day. Tobacco isn't nearly as harmful as cigarettes.

3. Improve our dismal food system. Do away with ag subsidies that favor large scale corn production. Increase consumer visibility into food production with better labeling laws (origin and ingredients). Incentivize sustainable healthful food production. Crack down on food additives. The Europeans do a much better job with this than the United States.

4. Improve and expand sex education. Sorry, Evangelicals, you can't be against abortion and for abstinence only education. Start dealing with the way things are, not the way you think Jesus wants them to be.

5. Decriminalize illicit drugs. We don't need to go over this again, suffice it to say that it will lead to less drug use, less crime, and curb the spread of infectious disease (see Portugal). Use cannabis to treat alcohol and hard drug addiction.

6. Supplement all of the above with educational programs that reveal the true cost (both at the personal and societal level) of bad choices. Our education system needs to better prepare people for choices related to diet, exercise, drugs (including alcohol, smoking, and caffeine), finance (credit!), and sex.",0,useless_idiot,t1_c0avihv,0,,True,,t5_2qh33,1246977856,,1,t3_8yvpg,False,1,t1_c0avhc0,c0avihv

Slavery was just the excuse. The reason has always been money. The Republicans was a northern regional party. It thus had an incentive to use taxation as a means to support its constituency. 

It is funny that the USA never attacked other countries for slavery. While slavery is morally wrong, is it right to kill one person for every three slaves? Is killing somehow less wrong than slavery? There were other measures that the North could have implemented without resorting to violence.

The Civil War was nothing more than a Federal and Republican power grab.

I played competitive ut2k4, the scene didn't last as long as q3 did, but it was quite healthy in its prime and was played in CPL and other events for a while. Within the competitive community, pretty much everyone had the map memorization and power-up timing as close to perfect as you could get - and yet you'd still see players consistently beat other players 30 to -1, and those players themselves get consistently beat 30 to -1 by better players, and so on up the skill ladder until you reached the guys who represented the US in international events, and they would still usually get pummeled pretty hard by european pros.

And compared to UT, Q3, has simpler/less random weapons, making it more likely that skill will determine a fight rather than luck or strategy, as well as a more skillful movement system.

my point is simply that while map memorization and powerup timing are necessary to compete, between players at a high level skill is still the deciding factor, and you see huge skill gaps even between players who have the memorization/strats down perfectly.

Network upgrades are constantly going on.  Every provider constantly is working on its network.  You remember Verizon, right, the company that brings you **fiber to the curb,** *at a loss* , so that you can have 40+mbps service?  Your other telcos aren't working on that last mile.  What collusion. 

Finally, Start your own telco in the states.  If what you claim is true, that we are vastly overpaying for services, then you have an immediate niche for a startup.  Just provide cheaper service.  Or if that sounds unrealistic, surely some MBA from Harvard is working on this potential?  Maybe they can offer a phone for $8.99/month nationally over millions of square miles.

Why wouldn't Sprint or the TMob do this?  They are churning customers, surely they could lower their rates in an effort to stand out against the competition?

Oh, what's that?  **Sprint offers a plan for ten fucking bucks a month?**  that is 1/5 the cost of my analog phone bill when I had an analog line.  There you go, go get your wireless and fight the MAN!

False,0,1425995217,technology,"Canada, as with the united states, has effective monopolies in the telecom sectors courtesy of US companies.

And I was not implying that the US is a police state.

Regarding europe, the EU just passed regulations creating uniform cellular roaming. Crossing national boundaries is hardly comparable to traveling in the US. Each telco operates under different regulations in a different market in every country. Though so long as you have a 4 band gsm phone  you can roam anywhere. And if its really an issue, you can by a local pay as go sim card and pop it in your phone. Wait, what's that, not in the US where every phone is locked to the service provider.

Verizon wireless is owned and operated independently of the rest of Verizon. So null on that argument.

The cellular infrastructure in the US is almost entirely controlled by four companies. If you want to start your own service one either has to purchase service from on of the telcos (priced so you can't undercut their consumer services).  The initial outlay for infrastructure is huge, so unless you've built your infrastructure up over decades initial rates will be quite high, but prices should drop off as infrastructure is payed for.

Both Spring and T-mobile appear to have made the calculation that they can make greater profits by losing customers but keeping their margins high on the customers they retain.

Where is this sprint plan for $10 a month, I can find neither hide nor hair of it on their website.

I would have a great deal fewer issues with american telcos if they just let me use my own phone. But I can't, and if I buy a phone I have to either unlock it, or if its cdma toss it in the bin if I switch services.  I just want to be able to go to a retail outlet of the telco, sign up for a plan pop a new sim in my phone and have it work.

The problem becomes excessive immigration with a low level of cultural assimilation, the creation of muslim ghettos and neigbourhoods where the culture from which they escaped becomes the sole identity they have, alienated from their new fellow countrymen. 

The islamification is gradually happening, and the lack of actual, reasonable and unprejudiced debate on issues concerning the core values of western Europe, leave natives bereft of cultural belonging and the building of confidence in just what to preserve and what to leave behind from their own culture. This leads to the over sized crazy, ignorant, malicious, racist behavior, fueled by irrational and misguided fear, and thus become manifested in the actions of this clearly lesser being, the Russian mad man.

The tragedy is the wall between islamists and secularists, is built on incidents such as this one. They break down the bridges of reconciliation, the hope for compromise that will lead to a more enlightened, better informed and diverse, secular society in which cultures matter not.

The foreskin provides a unique gliding (mechanical) action and tens of thousands of fine-touch receptors that *complement* the coarse-touch receptors of the glans penis (and the foreskin furthre protects the penis when not having sex). Its function and usefulness to sex is well understood by those who aren't searching desperately for confirmation that cutting off what would become [15 square inches](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/) of erogenous tissue has no effect. Ridiculous.

&gt; **- but there is a clear consensus on the potential role it can play in the decreasing the spread and contraction of venereal diseases, chiefly in the 3rd world and Africa.**

No, there is not.

Firstly, it *is* unanimous that safe sexual behavior is the only effective means of preventing the spread of STDs; circumcised males must learn safe sexual practices just the same (indeed, America has a rate of HIV infection 3.5x higher than the next advanced (non-circumcising) nation.

Secondly, **children do not have sex; they do not get sexually transmitted diseases**.

There have been serious criticisms of those U.N. studies in Africa, and medical organizations around the world have scoffed at them. Moreover, there are studies that show circumcision does not help stop the spread of STDs. [Here is one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract) (though not statistically significant, the *circumcised* males in the study were at a slightly higher rate of infection).

&gt; **Actively promoting it among gentiles would be heretical.**

Medical circumcision is explicitly treated as not being religious by Jews, so this argument is baseless. It's also baseless, because it doesn't hold with how real people behave.

&gt; **Even in their own country, Jews used to wear fake foreskins when competing in Hellenistic athletic events during the Alexandrian rule in Judea, for christ's sake.**

Yes, which is why Rabbis instituted *Brit Pariah*, the removal of all of the foreskin (including the inner foreskin), which is modern Jewish circumcision and what medicine calls ""radical circumcision"". This was done to keep Jewish men from stretching out any remnant foreskin into a 'new' foreskin (a process called ""foreskin restoration"" today).

&gt; **I'd also like to point out that the vast majority of circumcising countries all have Jewish populations hovering around zero.**

The are no vast majorities here. Outside of Islam, Judaism, America, South Korea, and backwards tribes in Africa and Australia perform circumcision. South Korea only started doing it 60 years ago when the American military showed up; today, South Koreans largely think that circumcision is universal among all men or they think that it's what good Christians do (the rest succumb to peer pressure).

It's already been stated that Jews are overrepresented in the medical field in the U.S.

Furthermore, the early American masses saw themselves as the inheritors of the Hebrew Bible such that they later took on the Victorian culture of Britain (the country and culture of origin of circumcision in the West until WWII shocked some sense into them), and the puritanical-old-time-religion Christians of America looked to the Old Testament (Jewish tradition) in ways that the European Christians have not for a very long time (there's a reason why ""Judeo-Christian"" came out of the U.S.).

The point is that the U.S. was susceptible to the small Jewish minority who had influence far beyond their numbers. Even today, I'm sure you would agree that Jews have quite an influence over the entertainment industry---there are all kinds of references to Jewish culture, circumcision in particular; unlike European television, shows in the U.S. that feature circumcision usually paint it in a positive light (as evidenced by the link I posted earlier).

Secondly, Jews are not overrepresented in those fields in Europe.",0,LordVoldemort,t1_c0axm88,0,,True,,t5_2qh2p,1247136466,,0,t3_8zhhn,False,0,t1_c0axlt6,c0axm88

No one is saying the effort isn't there, but the popular opinion is that it's not as effective as it could be. And if you've been paying attention at all lately, you'd see that there's been a growing public resentment towards immigrants (the ""autetaan somaliystävämme takaisin kotiin"" facebook group which got huge, the seemingly neverending argumentation revolving around certain Perussuomalaiset politicians, etc.)

&gt;Also rich russians are now buying alot of land in finland to vacation in, and if you ask anyone who finished high-school (i.e. not you) that's a good thing.

You know, in quite a few countries foreigners are not even allowed to own land. Maybe they have high-school kids in their governments? And back to the original point, in most reports I've read on the subject, the locals' have been reserved at best. Sure, tourists will be good for local businesses, but the fear is that foreigners will not know how to behave in the woods, and will disturb the wa. Also, you yourself later said how resenting Russians is a ""shameful quality most Finns share"". Why are you trying to claim the opposite here?

&gt; The war was over 50 years ago man

And it was over 200 years ago, and 300 years ago too... The latest war wasn't over in people's minds until about ten years ago when people once again started to feel they could talk about what happened without fear of reprisal. In past wars (not the latest one, of course), Russian soldiers have followed orders to burn the land, rape and kill the population, and take the children as slaves. With a past like that, it takes a while to ""let it go"", especially if you're not even allowed to talk about it. Maybe it'll happen in a few generations, unless Putin has other plans.

&gt;You just like arguing don't you? We agree on this point.

No, or at least we disagree on the definition of ""hard-pressed"".

&gt; By most people I know. Who else could I possibly speak for? No one hates them (vocally) and when minorities are around, civilized Finns tend to tiptoe around the whole race thing.

Sorry, but the kind of person who would hate on the immigrants vocally isn't the kind of person who would become your friend in the first place. Your friends, by definition, don't represent a very wide range of opinions on the matter.

&gt;Universally resented? Fuck you. I pay your taxes, speak your language and I serve in your military, and still I get told to go back to Russia. This I find is the most shameful quality most Finns share.

So you agree that what I said is the truth, but insult me just for reminding you of it?

Now, regarding your insults towards me: I've been active helping exchange students at my university and have friends from Russia to Uganda. I  currently work alongside a few middle-eastern immigrants. I have lived outside Europe. But I know that what I think is not necessarily the majority opinion, so I don't try to present it as such.

Yes, the Indian Wars (more like slaughter) were awful, but the conquest of historic ""homelands"" is nothing unique to America.

How lovely of you to say... Well that certainly sounds like textbook racism.  Where exactly do you think I'm from.
I thought it would be nice to have a debate without resorting to this kind of shit slinging, but there we go.

&gt; I've lived in 7 countries on 4 continents, took it upon myself to learn, despite the fact that it's not very easy for me, the languages of two of them where the ones I already spoke weren't native (I fear this one's going to be kind of a bitch to pick up), obey their laws, pay their taxes, try to follow the rules even if I think they're stupid (hint: Amsterdamers and bicycles...) ... I don't think that's too much to expect of any migrant in search of a better life, especially one who settles somewhere.

First of all, congratulations on your achievement of moving geographically.  An achievement and make no mistake about it.  Also, please tell me where I said ""don't learn the language, don't pay taxes, don't try and integrate into foreign cultures.""  You're attacking me (or at least it certainly feels like it) but what I was saying was that you *should* be able to do what you've done without setting foot in Amsterdam for example, and having seven shades of shit kicked out of you merely for being an 'immigrant.  Absolutely try and integrate, but some people wont care how much you integrate and will still twat the living fuck out of you anyway, because you weren't born there.  Perhaps you should aim your big-boy-swear-words at them instead?  

&gt; Everyone should be free to go where they please, within limits, and those limits include respecting the people who have lived their for 5, 10, 20 years or all their lives.

They should be respected on merit, not merely because they successfully stayed alive in one place.  Just as you should be respected on merit and not based on how long you've been at a specific location.

&gt; and avoid places where I could never ever honestly bring myself to integrate (most of the Middle East, I imagine.)

I imagine those people that were born in these places and can't bring themselves to integrate love moving to a place that suits their ideals better only to be alienated and labelled an outsider.

Therefore, Occam's Razor suggests that if other countries have a better cost/quality ratio than the United States, one of the following is likely to be true:

1. Cost/quality in other countries isn't actually as good as people claim it is.

2. There is another reason why healthcare in the United States is more expensive than some of these other countries. A few possibilities off the top of my head: HMO legislation; malpractice rules; Americans being sue-happy; extremely unhealthy diets (I seem to recall reading that America has a far worse obesity/diabetes/exercise rate than Britain and many European countries); the fact that the American pharmaceutical industry, which dominates the global drug marketplace, sells drugs to other countries like Canada and many European countries for a fraction of the price it sells those drugs in America...

I could go on with that list but I think I've made my point. Assuming that government healthcare is the way to bring costs down is not especially logical, and is not made much more compelling by noting the correlation between lower costs among countries that have implemented it.

And of course, UNIVERSAL healthcare may be a ""socially responsible"" thing to do but it sure as HELL is not going to bring down healthcare costs, it will cause them to skyrocket if anything, since there's all sorts of causal relationships between people that don't have healthcare and the reasons they don't have it...

It's not the easiest thing in the World to admit, but Borat, as a foreigner, was treated kindly in his scenes (generally) and with a very haughty, sadistic kind of pity for his ""odd one out who needs our civilized help"" ways. He was endearing, in that way, and so he had an opportunity to get far deeper into his scenes and with the people themselves.

Bruno was excellent, but his scenes were cut much shorter, felt choppier, ran around a lot. He didn't get to spend much time with any one of the people (disregarding the hilariously, awfully awkward campfire sequence). Instead of taking pity on a perverted Eastern European schlub, the people -- faced with an overtly homosexual Austrian man -- became... disgusted. To the point that they were throwing chairs, beating up the camera-men, storming out of the sets before much could be explored.

I say it's a sad thing to admit because -- and, let it be known, listening to a kooky guy with a 'stache talk about his brother Bilo raping townsgirls is easier to tolerate with your ""This Will Someday Be A Hilarious Bar Story"" hat on than a man who is attempting very seriously to have sex with you/molesting you, homosexual or not -- I just found it hard to stomach, watching it all. All of the rage and the anger and the hatred and the venom-spitting because he rubbed the guy's knee and said something about a ""shtinker"" (I feel like the Swinger scene was inserted to demonstrate more of a dichotomy between the homosexually erotic scenes reaction you immediately have vs the heterosexual).

&gt; # Correlation does not equal causation. Just because the industrial revolution took place during the last 100 years and carbon emissions have increased does not necessarily mean that carbon is the cause of the rise in temperature.

Indeed. But we know (and have known for Some Time) that CO2 is very good at stopping infra-red (i.e. heat): http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227081.500-the-man-who-discovered-greenhouse-gases.html ""To the eye, the gas within the tube might be as invisible as the air itself, while to the radiant heat it behaved like a cloud which it was almost impossible to penetrate"". Knowing that, we would *predict* global temperature rises as a result of increases CO2, so that fits well with the measurements.

&gt; # If we assume that humans are to blame for global warming, is there any proof that we can physically reduce the carbon content of the atmosphere to the optimum temperature?

Not sure what you mean here. Various processes add and remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g. growing plants pull CO2 out and turn it into, well, plants). These processes can't keep up with the rate we're adding CO2. If we reduce the rate we'll (a) have more time before things change too badly (b) may be able to stay in a stable state

&gt; # What is the optimum temperature? Who is say that we aren't finally reaching the global homeostasis? Are we concerned about beach property or global health?

It's not as simple as temperature going up uniformly. Heat drives the flow of air and water around the world (hot air rises, hot water rises etc). Climate change is just that, the climate in different places will change. This might mean a nice 2 degrees rise in temperate regions or it might mean the Gulf Stream current shutting down (Northern Europe becomes unable to support it's population), hurricanes, tornados, drought or flood in areas which are currently not prone or used to them. Let's not forget sea level rises either.

&gt; # Let's assume that we can indeed change the outcome of global temperature. China and India as recently as yesterday have come out and given a big middle finger to the rest of the world and said they will have no part in 'carbon caps.'

This is the position the world has been in with the US prior to the recent change of administration. It's not a binary thing, it's an issue of severity. The big CO2 emitters need to emit less. Yes, that includes everyone. More pressure will apply over time. The world needs to sort out it's energy supply in a way which doesn't increase atmospheric CO2 too much. As the tech for that becomes better/cheaper and more political pressure is applied other countries will come into line.

**OP's Article text below:**

-----------------------------------
Irish atheists are horrified by new legislation making blasphemy illegal, and punishable by a 25,000-Euro fine. Christians of all stripes should be, too.

As part of a revision to defamation legislation, the Dail (Irish Parliament) passed legislation creating a new crime of blasphemy. This attack on free speech, debated for several months in Europe, has gone largely unnoticed in the American press.

The text of the legislation is provided at the end of this post.

How does this impact free speech? Just don’t be rude.

- Atheists can be prosecuted for saying that God is imaginary. That causes outrage.
- Pagans can be prosecuted for saying they left Christianity because God is violent and bloodthirsty, promotes genocide, and permits slavery.
- Christians can be prosecuted for saying that Allah is a moon god, or for drawing a picture of Mohammed, or for saying that Islam is a violent religion which breeds terrorists.
- Jews can be prosecuted for saying Jesus isn’t the Messiah.

Is it really THAT big a deal?

Ireland’s Blasphemy Bill not only criminalizes free speech, it also gives the police the authority to confiscate anything deemed “blasphemous”. They may enter and search any premises, with force if needed, upon “reasonable suspicion” that such materials are present.

-The local Freethinkers society, with its copies of Hitchens’ God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.
-The video store, with copies of The God Who Wasn’t There.
-The history teacher, who uses The Dark Side of Christian History to teach her class.
-The library, with its collection of books deemed blasphemous.
-Even the homeowner who lets the wrong person know he has a copy of Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses could find his door broken in by the Thought Police, his bookshelves ransacked, and his books burning in the front yard!

Satirizing religion in any way, shape, or form, if it “causes outrage”, is now a prosecutable offense in Ireland. Saying anything negative about a religion, if it “causes outrage”, can now be prosecuted as a crime. Just like in Muslim countries.

Witness the return of the Dark Ages.

**The text of the legislation:**

36. Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter.

(1) A person who publishes or utters blasphemous matter shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €100,000. [Amended to €25,000]

(2) For the purposes of this section, a person publishes or utters blasphemous matter if (a) he or she publishes or utters matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion, and (b) he or she intends, by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage.

(3) It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.

37. Seizure of copies of blasphemous statements.

(1) Where a person is convicted of an offence under section 36, the court may issue a warrant (a) authorising any member of the Garda Siochana to enter (if necessary by the use of reasonable force) at all reasonable times any premises (including a dwelling) at which he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that copies of the statement to which the offence related are to be found, and to search those premises and seize and remove all copies of the statement found therein, (b) directing the seizure and removal by any member of the Garda Siochana of all copies of the statement to which the offence related that are in the possession of any person, © specifying the manner in which copies so seized and removed shall be detained and stored by the Garda Siochana.

(2) A member of the Garda Siochana may (a) enter and search any premises, (b) seize, remove and detain any copy of a statement to which an offence under section 36 relates found therein or in the possession of any person, in accordance with a warrant under subsection (1).

(3) Upon final judgment being given in proceedings for an offence under section 36, anything seized and removed under subsection (2) shall be disposed of in accordance with such directions as the court may give upon an application by a member of the Garda Siochana in that behalf.

I treat health insurance as simply part of the payroll expense. Even in a nationalized system, you will still be paying for it, but it will be folded into the payroll taxes, where you have no option to switch providers, no leverage to demand drill-down accounting of additional charges, and no budgetary control to trade expense for coverage terms. That's a recipe for Management Accounting 101 Fail.

If I was forced to pay for health care insurance through a nationalized system, I could not have opted for catastrophic coverage during the crucial initial years of starting my company. I'm now in a position to purchase ""gold-plated"" insurance like Blue Cross, but only after many years of building my client base and revenue channels, during which time I was perfectly comfortable with high-deductible catastrophic insurance backed by my company standing behind the deductible in a reserves account as part of an employee benefit program.

If I was an insecure capitalist afraid to compete with new entrants in my field, I'd back nationalized healthcare. It would be a *great* way to raise the barriers to entry to all businesses by individuals. The complexity level of establishing a small business serving a multi-state (not to speak of globalized) client base is already absurdly high. Most people who don't own a business have no idea that doing business with a nation-wide client base in the US is actually an exercise in complying with 50 different sets of business (mostly tax) regulations. So far, most small businesses under about $0.5-1M p.a. revenue in a state are ignored by the agencies with jurisdiction. Without this *de facto* flying under the radar, the regulatory compliance costs are overwhelming. Guess how much it costs to hire a tax attorney and CPA to navigate the thicket of new changes in tax laws each year in all 50 states for just a mail order outfit? And if you have any heart at all, you'd take care of the personal tax filing maze for your employees that travel if your employees do work in multiple states. That costs big bucks. And every year at least one state agency gets a bug up its ass and dickers with you on your and/or your employees' filings. More time and cash out the door complying. Oh, and some localities have additional tax regimes to the state they are in. And people wonder why businesses that can are moving out of the US...the overhead costs of staying legit in the US are about par with doing business in the EU, so if you have the option to go offshore and treat both the US and EU with roughly the same compliance costs, if all other considerations were equal, you'd be nuts to not head for a tax-neutral domicile.

Each state is going to add its own special sauce to a national healthcare system, and if I want to compete unfairly with new, younger entrepreneurs I would cackle with glee at the prospect of them having to comply with 50 different sets of state-sponsored health care. They wouldn't have any choice to fly under the radar with health care like with the insane state and local tax systems, and the regulatory compliance costs would sink most small businesses that seek a client base throughout the US instead of a single locality, before they can even get off the ground.

No es ningún secreto que EU ha, hipócritamente, difundido el desarrollo neoliberal de la economía mientras que sigue funcionando como un estado proteccionista en muchos aspectos.

México no está en desventaja con respecto a todas los productos, la guayaba, el aguacate, el brócoli (aunque erosiona la tierra a un nivel impresionante) son producidos exitosamente en México y muchas veces encuentran barreras ""legales"" para entrar a competir a los mercados de EU y Canadá (lo digo entre comillas porque se esconden bajo banderas sanitarias la mayor parte del tiempo).  

El TLC tiene sus raíces en la reestructuración de la deuda externa durante la primera mitad de los 80. Cuando se llegó a la conclusión de que México no podía pagar en su totalidad la deuda externa, el FMI le hizo el favor a México de reestructurarla con algunas condiciones de por medio, la mayoría de ellas neo-liberales que favorecerían a los dueños del circo. Por esta razón se le aplaudió tanto a Salinas por su TLC que eventualmente eliminó el apoyo a la tortilla y al maíz, etc y nos ha dejado en una dependencia alimentaria (vaya, países como UK o Israel tiene una razón para esto pero México tiene muchos recursos).

 ""[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens."" -- The Federalist, No. 29
Alexander Hamilton 

 ""Another source of power in government is a military force. But this, to be efficient, must be superior to any force that exists among the people, or which they can command; for otherwise this force would be annihilated, on the first exercise of acts of oppression. Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.""
Noah Webster An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, Philadelphia, 1787 

This is a very small sample and I would not say that to ""proves"" it alone. But, i'm not about to read all the historical documents to you. I believe you are capable of reading them yourself. 

&gt;The right to life is considering paramount over the right to own firearms.

It's unfortunate that you believe that the right to life somehow is contradictory to the right to arms. When in fact the right to arms is a mechanism in which the right to life is preserved, not diminished.

My parents moved to Canada when in 1996 when I was about 8 years old and I haven't been back to Turkey since 2003. I was raised speaking the language at home and I feel an immense connection to my history and culture.


With regards to the EU and Turkey's accession I don't really have a solid opinion. I think the EU would certainly benefit from having Turkey on their side, both militarily and from having a stronger influence in the middle east. The Turks play a role similar to Egypt or Israel as America's ""friends"" in the Middle East, and I think the EU has a chance to lessen the US influence on Turkey while increasing their own. 


The main arguments against accession are nationalistic on the Turkish side and economic and borderline discriminatory on the EU side with issues such as the largely Muslim population of Turkey being a major roadblock. 


Personally, I think I'd like to see a more independent Turkey, although that might not be possible with the current political climate. And it might do more harm than good with the gradual erosion of secularism that's been taking place in the government. I wish all Turks believed in the ideals of Ataturk, in that case we'd have one of the most secular and progressive countries in the world. Ataturk always put an emphasis on science and a rejection of superstition, even the states could use a man like him today, he's definitely one of my personal heroes.

Like ""How are you?"" ""Good enough."" (""Could be worse."")

""Hao-le"" (how-luh) can mean ""enough already,"" almost like ""knock it off."" It can also mean ""OK, I give up. All right already."" 

Your term ""fair enough"" is an English idiomatic expression, so a literal translation wouldn't be appropriate, though there might be another translation closer to its meaning than the ones I gave.

These are all based on 20 year old recollections of my imperfect grasp of the language.

In French as spoken in France ""d'accord"" (da-cor) has the sense of ""OK,"" or ""I am in agreement,"" or ""I am in accordance."" There are other idiomatic expressions that would indicate a feeling of fairness about a situation, but if I were conducting business or making other types of agreements I'd probably use ""d'accord.""

Does your use of ""fair enough"" carry any other connotations beside agreement or acceptance? Is it a literal acknowledgment of fairness or justice?

True,0,1425997331,politics,"So let's start a discussion. I don't do links, I do books. To first get a complete understanding of politics we need to start in the late medieval period. Before conservatism and liberalism came about there was absolutism. Basically there were kings and subjects. In eastern Europe, the majority of these subjects were serfs who belonged to the king or other lords. I believe it was roughly 80% if I remember correctly. The further west you went in Europe the fewer serfs there were. I think in France it was closer to 75%.

Anyway, trade began fairly earnestly and tea and coffee was being bought from the indies and the middle east. England began to trade much more heavily, and to increase exports they reorganized the lands and did away with common lands, turning them into more fields. This is called the ""enclosure"" and led to many people moving to the cities. This also spread through the rest of Europe. 

Because of the increase in urban population (i.e. cheaper labor), industry began to spring up. The middle class began to grow and challenge the power of the aristocracy. In Britain, the king was forced to give up more and more power to the nobles in parliament (then a body that basically controlled taxes and little else). The middle class began to become more rich and challenged the authority of the noble class.

In the cities, coffee houses began to spring up. urban peoples would go here to drink the (very) stimulating coffee and talk about the news of the day. Newspapers and magazines were free to read here, and hard to come by in other places. Soon enough, coffee houses became meeting places for intellectuals and common men alike. 

Writings about liberalism would begin to circulate and gain traction in the discussions in these coffee houses in Europe. This is when the first feelings or thoughts of equality among men began.

Would you like me to continue the discussion or do you have questions?

Note: I forgot to discuss constitutionalism, but that's basically when the king and nobility are also subject to the laws of the land. England was a constitutional monarchy, The Dutch Republic was a constitutional government, France and the majority of Europe was still ruled by absolutist monarchs.

Second Note: This is a *very* compact reader's digest explanation. It's even more complicated than I'm writing out here, but this, hopefully will help show how complicated this can be.

Third Note: Religion also plays a role in all of this (Protestant vs. Catholicism = individualism vs authoritarianism) but I didn't add that in because I don't have all day :P",0,genuinepolitician,t1_c0b04zk,0,,True,,t5_2cneq,1247341733,,21,t3_90ad1,False,21,t1_c0b04qi,c0b04zk

So conservatism basically became the moderate stance at that time. Basically it goes 

liberalism - republicanism - conservatism - absolutism

if you want to use the left-right scale (which I hate). The two forms on the left are democratically based (and I use that term loosely, basically I mean without a monarch) and the two on the right generally promoted monarchies. Republicanism was the moderate form of liberalism and conservatism was the moderate form of monarchies.

A backlash against the French came, but by that time Napoleon had taken the helm and was warring with the rest of Europe. liberalism was still a major idea throughout Europe, but only France, at this time, had tried it out. The idea was still appealing, but no one else wanted to try it. During the 1800s another industrial revolution occurred. During this second industrial revolution materialism and consumerism became prominent among the peoples of Europe.

As a reaction to this, Marx and his intellectual colleagues thought that the working class was the only ""pure"" class left. Everyone else was basically corrupted by greed and becoming materially wealthy while the lower working class was keeping the world running. As a solution, Marx thought that the only way people could truly be equal was to be economically equal. Marx, like Europe at that time, viewed money as the source of power. After all, in recent history, the middle class used it to challenge the aristocracy, so to him, and many Europeans, it made sense.

Funnily enough, even a large majority of the worker class didn't support socialism because they wanted to keep what they had worked so hard to earn. The promise of an equal share of everything just didn't sound plausible to them. However, there was a large enough group of people to for socialist movements in France, Germany, and Russia (for the most part, there were smaller groups elsewhere, but not as much influence).

By this time (sorry, kind of skipped this part) most of the nations of Europe had some sort of democratic government in place. Mostly parliamentary systems in conjunction with kings (constitutionalism). The parliaments, at this time, however, held most of the power in these states.

Because these socialist parties had become large enough to threaten a take over of these coalition parliaments, a reaction was formed (seeing a pattern in European political history?) and fascism was born. According to socialists, everyone should be equal economically and politically and their positions in society would thus be stationary. This was unlike liberalism which promoted free movement within classes in society. However, fascism was like socialism, in that peoples positions should be stationary, but unlike socialism, fascism promoted a hierarchical society. In order to maintain this hierarchy, people would have to feel patriotic about their position. If a worker works at a clothing factory, then they should be proud to work there because the nation needs clothes and by making them you are doing your part for the national good. Nationalism, then, was an important aspect of fascism. Socialism, however, thought that a worker in Russia would have more in common with a worker in France than they would with their own countrymen. It turns out that neither was exactly wanted by the liberals, conservatives, and republicans (republicans as in republicanism, not the US political party). In a sense, at this point, the left-right political spectrum looked a little like this:

socialism - liberalism - republicanism - conservatism - fascism

During this time there were wars, and because of the nationalism, WWI was fought, and then an even greater rise in socialism and fascism took place and WWII was the culmination of that. Because conservative (Britain) liberal (France) republican (US) and socialist (Russia) states joined to fight against fascist (Italy and Germany) states Europe again reacted and moved to the left, toward socialism, where it remains today (in between liberalism and socialism).

The US actually remained fairly moderate (politically) throughout this whole situation but since WWII we have been adopting European political movements. The republicans are becoming more fascist and the democrats are becoming more socialist. Neither of them have obviously gone all the way in those directions yet, but it's a possibility. 

But now I'm just getting into the realm of modern politics which is where this discussion started, but I thought it important to cover the history first even if it was done very briefly.

My guess then, is that you're more likely upset with the amount of influence that corporations have on our government, not that you think the corporations *are* our government. 

I think the influence comes primarily from our politicians wanting our nation to prosper. Since the french revolution, economics has become the primary component of political debate and influences politics far more than we'd like. The french revolution, in essence, was class warfare with a political ideology to give it credence. This same type of thought was then carried out through Europe and spawned the socialist and then fascist movements. Each political movement in Europe was basically the result of economic downturns.

It's different in the US though. We started as a republic and basically remained one for quit a long time, even through industrial revolution and depressions. We did change moderately with policies, but we never adopted a new ruling ideology other than republicanism (until after WWII).

As stated in other parts of my posts and even this one as well, the US adopted European political ideas after WWII and economics became a much bigger focus. Given the opposition to communism, capitalism became an ideology in the US as a reaction (like how many of the European political ideologies were formed, by reaction). This meant the government focused on promoting American goods, trade, etc and thus large corporations were born, partly because Europe was in shambles and couldn't compete.

The communists called the US imperialists because of our economic expansion. This was a relatively new idea as imperialism had never been thought of in economic terms before.

In other words, I don't think it's a corporatocracy, I just think our focus has shifted in a direction that it shouldn't have. We started as a politically motivated country and should have remained as such instead of delving in to economics as our primary focus.",0,genuinepolitician,t1_c0b07lm,0,,True,,t5_2cneq,1247348416,,4,t3_90ad1,False,4,t1_c0b075d,c0b07lm

False,0,1425997402,religiousdebate,"Heh.  I would say that the polite consensus is that of American ""tolerance"", but that the French model is making a come-back in certain quadrants.  There's certainly an element of Enlightenment-style ambivalence to religion in the work of the ""New Atheists"", for example.

But I think it helps to clarify the terms here.  As I understand it, when the authors talk about ""tolerance"", they're not talking about attitudes towards any particular religion or practice.  Rather, they're talking about the idea that, if we allow people to work out their own relationships to religion, and foster plurality, then the free market of religions will work out a kind of balance of power that discourages any attempts at hegemony.

Right now, I wouldn't say that the French Revolution model of secularism is the main competitor to that quasi-Laissez Faire model of tolerance.  On a global scale, the big competitor seems to be theocratic models, like those in Saudi Arabia and Iran, and in various would-be revolutionaries.  That may be all that the authors mean by their argument -- that attempts at a strict secularism pretty much died out in the 20th century with Albania and Communist atheism.  The only country that I know of that even borders on that attitude is, again, France, particularly in its opposition to expressions of Muslim identity --- which is, really, more often culturally based rather than rooted in Islam doctrine itself.

Which side am I on?  It may just be American upbringing, but I lean towards something of a three-quarters approach: secular government with a tolerance approach to religious institutions and identities.  The caveat I'd make is that with less secularized party systems -- like those European countries that have Catholic parties -- you at least know where you stand when you're dealing with a platform, whereas American politics is plagued by a willingness to blur the lines.  The result is that it's sometimes hard to tell when a politician or party is working from genuinely religious motives or just paying lip service, which also makes it difficult to discern where exactly the line falls with something like the Establishment Clause.",0,blackstar9000,t1_c0b0ahz,0,,True,,t5_2qq6l,1247356184,,1,t3_904br,False,1,t1_c0azk0d,c0b0ahz

The American Academy of Pediatrics and every other organization in the U.S. offically states that the *possible* medical benefits of circumcision are not enough to warrant circumcision on medical grounds, and that it should basically be left up to the parents on cultural grounds.

These organizations would have a hard time plainly stating that circumcision should be discouraged, because that would put the doctors they represent at risk for lawsuits and it would outrage political constituents (namely Jews) on religious grounds.

However, international organizations have less trouble saying these things, especially in Europe, where Finland outlawed male circumcision as a violation of rights in 2006, Sweden requires a special license (mainly for the Jews and Muslims), Denmark and the Netherlands publicly debated outlawing circumcision, and where it is treated with great skepticism in Britain, Australia, Canada, South America, Russia, etc.

Funny. In the last six months alone US citizens have legally purchased enough guns to arm all the armies in Europe and Asia combined... How in the hell would guns ever become hard to get?!?!?!?
Not to mention that even with our relaxed laws, most guns coming into Mexico which has a ban on guns are NOT coming from USA...

""won't exactly rob people walking down the street at gunpoint to get money for drugs""

They get money for guns by selling drugs. Because drugs are illegal there is a huge black market for them. Similar to the one that would be created if guns were also banned... so there would be more armed criminals if guns were banned...

The Jewish Problem
The Jewish problem has always been around. When Jews lived in their homeland, Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Crusaders, and then Arabs again, swept through Israel with the sword and the torch. Over and over again, the Jewish population of Israel was murdered and enslaved, the land was emptied and renamed, new populations were imported to take their place. Then the subjugating empire would fall, the Jews would return, reclaim their holy places, build new homes, plant vineyards and cultivate fields. And the cycle would begin again.

In exile, the Jewish problem did not go away. Islamic Arab rulers barred the Jews from even approaching the site of the Temple. Medieval Europe penned Jews into Ghettos. Czarist Russia had the Pale of Settlement. The liberals of the French Revolution proclaimed that the Jews were to assimilate and cease to be a separate people. As the counterrevolution, Nazi Germany began with plans to expel the Jews and ended with wholesale genocide. Jews fleeing the Nazis found the gates to Western nations barred on the ground that they all had enough Jews already, and to Israel, on the grounds that the British authorities did not want to upset the Arabs, who were already sympathetic to Nazism.

The year now is 5769 or 2009. And the Jewish problem still persists today, because for those who see the existence of Jews as the problem there will always be a Jewish problem.

Barely was the modern State of Israel rebuilt, that the world decided that the Jewish refugees of Nazism were the oppressors, and the Palestinian Arabs under Mufti Mohammad Amin al-Husayni who worked with Hitler on the Holocaust, were their victims.

This would become the conventional narrative of the latest phase of the ""Jewish Problem"". The Jewish problem being of course that there are Jews. The greatest threat to peace in the Middle East today, the world declares, is that there are Jews living in towns in Judea and Samaria. These towns are called ""settlements"" and they ""prejudice the outcome"" of the peace process, in a way that apparently all the Arabs towns and villages in parts of Israel do not.

If an Arab builds a house, his rights to do so are defended. If a Jew builds a house, he's a threat to peace. Never mind that there is no peace and no peace process, for the simple reason that the Hamas and Fatah terrorists that the world wants to hand a state too, keep trying to kill Jews.

To a diplomat however that only demonstrates that this is a Jewish problem. After all the terrorists are trying to kill Jews. Clearly the Jews are the problem.

The Obama Administration's two big overseas agendas are to keep Jews from living where he doesn't want them to in their own country, and to keep Israel from defending itself against Iranian nuclear attack. As usual it is not the Islamic Arab terrorists trying to kill Jews nor Iran's nuclear weapons program that is the problem-- it is the attempts by Jews to not be killed by them that is the threat to peace.

And of course there are always Court Jews who rush to their aid, not the aid of the Jews, but the aid of those who keep plugging away at the Jewish problem. Alan Dershowitz repurposed a suggestion from Yousef Munayyer, of the pro-Hamas American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee that Jews in settlements be forced to build only vertically, up instead of out. ""Let them vertically"" or piled one on top of the other, in a truly postmodern architectural vision of a ghetto as skyscraper.

100 story glass and steel ghettos are not likely to solve the Jewish problem. They only make for a better target. The problem is not the settlements, because it is not a settlement problem, but a Jewish problem.

Hitler's problem was not that there were Jews living in Germany, but that there were Jews living, period. When the Jews left Germany, Hitler's armies followed them to the West and to the East. Even to the Middle East, as Hitler vowed to the Mufti of Jerusalem, that his goal in the region would be to wipe out the Jews in Israel. Islam's problem is not that there are Jews living in parts of Judea and Samaria. Neither Hamas nor Fatah are prepared to recognize the rights of Jews living in any part of Israel, or the right of Israel to exist. Not even with the settlements gone.

The Jewish problem cannot be solved by moving Jews to ghettos, vertical or horizontal. Because it is not a problem caused by where Jews live, but by living Jews. Fatah and Hamas, and their ancestor the Mufti, have worked hard to solve the problem of living Jews. Obama is helping them solve that problem by once again viewing it as a ""Jewish problem"", rather than the problem of those who hate Jews too much to live and let live.

Diplomacy has tried to replace ""the cycle of violence"", with ""the cycle of appeasement"", but one naturally enough feeds the other. Israel has spent a generation since the Yom Kippur War trying to appease its enemies, only to learn that not even turning over land several times its own size, is appeasement enough. Jews in the West have worked hard to appease every minority with a grudge against them, and have still failed to learn that no amount of appeasement is ever enough.

A century of rhetoric, philosophy, debate and angst boils down to one simple fact. There is no way to solve a problem if you fail to define it. The Jewish problem is a problem not of Jews, but of those who want to kill Jews. There is no solution to the problem except to prevent them from accomplishing that task.

While some plan skyscraper ghettos and are convinced that the solution is some tough love from Obama to stop Jews from being such a problem-- the simple answer is that there is no answer, but that we go on living. Life is not such a complex equation, it can be understood in simple enough terms. When people consider you a problem, preventing them from doing whatever they can to ""solve that problem"" is your solution.

Four generations later, that number was less than 2%.  The transition required specialists in retail sales because it happened quickly.   At one point in time, nobody had a vacuum cleaner, washer/dryer, gas stove.  We needed a great deal of help to get to the point where now we all have them and understand them.

True,0,1425997695,atheism,"I think you have to be very careful with simply saying Christianity has been ""historically linked"" to right-wing politics.  The historical link is simply that they both compete for the same thing, and have sometimes formed alliances to avoid mutually destructive competition.  However, right-wing politics are not dependent upon the church, in fact, the church tends to be more of an inconvenient impediment than anything else.  In Europe, the Catholic church was in many ways at odds with National Socialism.  At a fundamental level, the Church preached the value of the individual as national socialism tried to diminish the importance of the individual.  However, the Catholic Church had no problem recognizing secular governments (and had done so for centuries) so it was somewhat easy for them to form treaties with governments in German and Italy.  A fundamental aspect of Fascist and National Socialist politics is that religion must be either secondary to the state, or non-existent.  Often these governments maintained close ties to religions more to make them irrelevant than anything else.  If you can position yourself on the side of the Church, but still maintain secular governance, then you essentially can have your cake and eat it too.

Some have argued that Nazis in particular [had the ultimate goal of dismantling religious institutions in Germany.](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/weekinreview/word-for-word-case-against-nazis-hitler-s-forces-planned-destroy-german.html?pagewanted=1)

I think in Germany, you had a very interesting situation where the church was generally receptive to and in agreement with certain political sentiments held by the Nazis, but the Church and National Socialist movement would always necessarily be fundamentally at odds, as they both competed for control over the same thing . . . the hearts and minds of the people.

I would find it a fair assumption to say that the flavor of Christianity in Germany prior to the rise of Nazism was receptive to many of the aims of the Nazis, but the ""historical link"" isn't a consistent one.  The National Socialists killed and imprisoned thousands of Catholic and Protestant leaders.  The two certainly weren't buddy-buddy.

In Italy, you have a similar situation which turned out very differently.  Mussolini was an atheist until 1927, and he always maintained a certain contempt for religion.  Early on, his Fascist movement was very hostile towards religion, but later found it necessary to have the Church on their side (and pressured the Church to accept terms agreeable to the Fascists).  In Italy, right-wing politics were a matter of guarded alliance with Catholicism and outright persecution of Protestantism.  In Italy, the Fascists failed to fully reel in the power of the Church and, at the very least, the broad term of ""Christianity"" is a poor one, as the various flavors of Christianity were dealt with as polar opposites.",0,nixonrichard,t1_c0b0vnf,0,,True,,t5_2qh2p,1247426458,,18,t3_90hp0,False,18,t1_c0b0q6j,c0b0vnf

True,0,1425997711,politics,"First, if you would actually follow my first recommendation and watch the damn film, you would see that he does provide statistics in the film, and sources all factual claims made in the movie on his website. *He does exactly what you recommend.* The film has an agenda and uses facts to back up its claims. That's not bias. That's argument itself. It just so happens that the facts don't make the American system look just as good as the European system. That's not bias. That's reality. Here's the link to sources:

http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/checkup/

But yes, much of the movie is devoted to showing individual cases of the trend that the system isn't working. He understands that making an academic argument is not what is going to convince most people. That doesn't mean that his argument is wrong or that the claims he does make wouldn't stand its ground under academic scrutiny -- it just means that it's not the focus of the film, and the film is better for it. For him, and for anyone who actually knows anything about the health care system and isn't brainwashed by free market shibboleths, there isn't really a convincing counterargument to be made.

I am aware of what makes a convincing argument and what forms of evidence are truly more persuasive than others. But that only goes so far. It's easy to massage statistics so that they are not truly false, but that they are misleading (for example, using means instead of medians to describe the average wealth of a country which has high income disparity). The fact is, people almost always respond more to stories than to strong arguments, because it is easy to make both sides of any argument *sound* strong to an initially uniformed observer.

Moore wasn't trying to make a film that gave a simple description of the American health care industry and alternatives. That is part of what he was trying to do, of course, and in my opinion that part of his argument is made quite soundly. He has [responded to all criticisms of the film](http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/checkup/setting-the-record-straight/), most of which were based on misunderstandings or misinterpretations of what the film was attempting to say. *But he was also trying to put a human face onto an issue which all too often descends into quibbling and furtive econometrics.* The film reminds viewers that whatever the politicians might say about the feasibility of universal health care, real people in America are suffering and people in other countries are getting by fairly well with a different system. The other system isn't perfect, but the fact that there are no serious support in those countries for replacement of universal health care with our private health system says a lot.

It can't be stressed too often that the issue of universal health care is not just a political ball, and you should root for your ""team"" whatever the consequences. Universal health care in the European style is morally and economically superior to the American system, and expression of that moral and economic superiority aren't ""bias"" any more than opposition to letting a person drown in a frozen lake when you easily have the means to save him/her. People are unnecessarily suffering and dying under the American system when all other countries that are even close to our wealth and industrialization see such unnecessary suffering and death as an abomination. Expressing this fact and putting a human face to it are noble goals. It doesn't instantly become ""not a documentary"" because it doesn't make an academically detached and watertight argument. Even if Moore were as deceptive as his opponents like to say (which he is not by any means), as long as the film had the ring of truth it would be worthwhile. These are real people, with real problems, that are commonplace in America. Qualifying their problems makes their situations lose their moral force, and is unnecessary in any case because there are plenty of resources to access (even provided by the film itself!) that show that they are not isolated examples. Moore is describing a problem that unquestionably exists, and proposing a solution that is unquestionably superior once it is properly described. Whether he meets the criteria for a watertight argument doesn't matter, because that argument has been made by many other people on many other occasions. Again, he is showing the human side to this issue which is treated as a political football.",0,goodbetterbestbested,t1_c0b0wtz,0,,True,,t5_2cneq,1247429480,,0,t3_90al1,False,0,t1_c0b0vvm,c0b0wtz

Do fathers and sons stand around comparing their genitals? The foreskin does not generally separate from the glans until adolescence, so NO care is necessary during childhood.  When it does finally separate, the boy should wash the glans when he showers/bathes.  Why on Earth do people think this is some sort of elaborate, difficult ritual?  It's basic hygiene.  

Looking at it from a different perspective, the evidence for circumcision's health benefits is sketchy at best.  One of the reasons it became common in England and the USA was because MASTURBATION was thought to be harmful, and circumcision was supposed to reduce masturbation.  Thus circumcision reduced the health problems related to masturbation--which are nonexistent.  To say nothing of the fact that circumcision does not actually reduce masturbation.  

Another way to look at it:  circumcision is elective genital surgery performed on patients who are far too young to consent.  It is also irreversible.  If he decides to have it done as an adult, he can choose to do so, but he can't get his foreskin back if it is removed. 

In my opinion, you cannot make an informed decision without seeing one done.  An overview:
1.  Infant is strapped to a board.
2.  Foreskin is *torn* (yes, torn, because it is physically attached to the glans) from head of the penis.
3.  A clamp is used to crush the nerves and arteries on top of the foreskin.
4.  A metal cylinder is slid underneath the foreskin.
5.  The foreskin is cut away with a scalpel.
When you watch, you will find that the baby is NOT happy about this turn of events.  

Finally, try to remember that circumcision is practiced primarily in the USA, South Korea, and the Middle East (Muslims circumcise).  To put it another way, men live happily with their foreskins in Europe, South America, and most of Asia.   ",0,[deleted],t1_c0b0xof,0,,True,,t5_6,1247431522,,11,t3_90iv5,False,11,t3_90iv5,c0b0xof

30. What is the end result of a belief in evolution (lifestyle, society, attitude about others, eternal destiny, etc.)?

That depends on the person.  Belief in selective pressure and genetic variation does not make someone a bad person.  Just like belief in God does not make someone a good person, as is evident in the Catholic Church pedophilia scandal.  There a probably hundreds of millions of Christians that happily believe in Darwin's evolution and find no conflict with their faith.

31. Do people accept evolution because of the following factors?

* It is all they have been taught.

No.  I'm a Catholic.  I was taught the Bible, Evolution, and the creation stories of a number of religions.

* They like the freedom from God (no moral absolutes, etc.).

Belief in evolution has nothing to do with Atheism.

* They are bound to support the theory for fear of losing their job or status or grade point average.

You should read up on how tenure works.  Really...

* They are too proud to admit they are wrong.

I really doubt it.  That's reserved for politicians.

* Evolution is the only philosophy that can be used to justify their political agenda.

Totally wrong.  The Bible could be thought of the same way.

32. Should we continue to use outdated, disproved, questionable, or inconclusive evidences to support the theory of evolution because we don’t have a suitable substitute (Piltdown man, recapitulation, archaeopteryx, Lucy, Java man, Neanderthal man, horse evolution, vestigial organs, etc.)?

Nobody teaches things like Piltdown Man or the Brontosaurus anymore.  Those were the work of some arrogant people trying to make a name for themselves.

Archaeopteryx is wonderful transitional species that really existed.

Java man is simply a population of Home Erectus.

Neanderthal Man was a species of humans that lived in Europe.

What's your issue with Vestigial organs and horse evolution?

Lucy was a branch of human evolution that went extinct.  But that species really existed also.

33. Should parents be allowed to require that evolution not be taught as fact in their school system unless equal time is given to other theories of origins (like divine creation)?

If you want divine creation to be taught in school you'd better teach EVERY divine creation story out there.  I want the Abrahamic one taught along side with evolution, and the theory of every other religion out there, whether still practiced or extinct.  And if you're going to teach the Bible's version of creation, I expect a Jewish Rabbi to do the teaching, since the Jews wrote that book.  Nothing else will make me happy.  We Christians merely inherited it.

34. What are you risking if you are wrong? As one of my debate opponents said, ""Either there is a God or there is not. Both possibilities are frightening.""

If I am wrong, who cares.  Evolution does not impact my belief in God.

35. Why are many evolutionists afraid of the idea of creationism being presented in public schools? If we are not supposed to teach religion in schools, then why not get evolution out of the textbooks? It is just a religious worldview.

If you want to teach religion in schools, that's fine.  How about we teach Buddhism, or maybe Hindu?  Would that be acceptable to you?  Evolution is not a religious worldview.  Again it is: It simply talks about inheritance of genetic characteristics from an parents that give it a survival advantage when selective pressure is placed on a group of organisms.

Besides which creation theory would you have taught?  I am sure there are hundreds of them from various religions and sources.  Just because YOU believe that Abrahamic version of creation does not make it the right one to teach to people.

36. Aren’t you tired of faith in a system that cannot be true? Wouldn’t it be great to know the God who made you, and to accept His love and forgiveness?

I accept God's love and forgiveness every day.  What does have to with evolution?

37. Would you be interested, if I showed you from the Bible, how to have your sins forgiven and how to know for sure that you are going to Heaven? If so, call me.

I read the Bible all the time.  Go to church every Sunday.  I don't need your help to try and convince me that Genesis Chapter 1 is somehow accurate.  If you could please explain whether Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 is the proper account I would appreciate it.  Did God make Man and Woman together?  Or did he make Eve from Adam's rib?

This is sort of the ""states as laboratories"" idea, or ""voting with your feet."" Ok, makes sense. However, the Constitution, quite separately from the Articles of Confederation envisioned a much stronger centralized government, because with separate governments, the states work almost as independent countries. Following this path turns the US into the EU (aside from language issues). Perhaps this is indeed what we want, since immigration with the EU is protected and the economic realities are what tie it together, but it's not what was intended by the Constitution, and I don't see a particularly good argument for it or against it on more than an issue by issue basis.  

On the ""what works"" thing, I'm mostly thinking about regs vs. free market, rather than explicitly federalist issues, so maybe that's a slightly different discussion. But the point I'm making there is that market maximize profit, and if greed breaks a system, or we (the voters) want to provide something antithetical to profit (like healthcare), gov't should get involved.  

Generally, I agree with your point that local laws are good for the voting with your feet reason. But I guess my point is that people debate this in the wrong order. First, people often say that government shouldn't get involved, and go from there to decry a plan as evil. I'm thinking basically, that the debate should *start* with the overall goal, think whether it's something that needs to be put up at a federal level for whatever reason, most usually uniformity and anti-protectionism between states, and then reasoned about.  

I guess I'm just really tired of people spouting ""too big"" government as gospel w/o ever reasoning about why, issue by issue, government should or should not get involved. I'm actually ok with starting with ""no"" by default, but it should be a question people ask and should not be an opposition to policy in and of itself if the reasons supporting that principle are not in play.  

Oh, and you can't really leave economics out of it, because that's a huge part of why the administrative state has gotten so big.

But yes, he would probably agree that a rational democratic society, with nice things like freedom of speech and a respect of science is superior to one that is based on medieval superstitious texts. Why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't anybody?

If you base your definition of a 'Neo-Con' on people like Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins (!!) - why the hell wouldn't you want to call yourself a 'Neo-Con'

One mistake Americans commonly make is to assume that laws tell you what you can do - if there isn't anything to say you can do something, then you can't. We assume the opposite - if there's no law to say you can't do something then you can. This is why we don't tend to care about 'enshrined' rights to various things.

See, I thought this whole gov't thing was supposed to be of the people, by the people, for the people.  Not, ""we are the people that are going to decide for you how to spend your money"". 

&gt;To some extent, they are. You are a member of society. You have responsibilities as a member of that society. Don't like it? Go fucking live in Somalia. No society to speak of there, no taxes. Or, if can fool enough poor people to vote against their interests, you can change the system.

Oh, I have no problem contributing to a functional society.  I dont know why you keep missing that point.  I dont even have a problem with taxes, *if they are effectively used.*  You see, I do think gov't and taxes do have a role, *but forcing people to be charitable is not one of them*.  

&gt;Right, and how many welfare receivers have you known that sit around sucking on the tit of the government? I haven't met almost any, and I've met a lot. Letting them die off isn't the civilized thing to do.

Here you go being naive again.  Living in a poor neighborhood, it is something I see *every day*.  Perhaps the fear of failure would be a good motivation for some people to suck it up and do something about it. 

&gt;I'm not arguing you aren't an empathetic person. What I am arguing is that, *all things being equal*, a person who believes what you do is less empathic than a person who believes what I do.

That's the assumption that is wrong.  *All things are not equal* as I would defer empathy somewhere else. 

&gt;Nor are charities. They aren't big enough, and not enough people will voluntarily give up enough money to fund big enough charities. The reality of the situation is that welfare programs are here to stay. That is the way the rest of the modern world is going. The reason the government first stepped in to doing this sort of thing is because NO ONE ELSE WAS. THERE ARE REASON WHY THESE PROGRAMS CAME INTO EXISTENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

It's entirely possible. Through the 20th century humanity saw the rise and fall of various belief and philosophical systems that seemed like they might never go away. Specifically, I'm thinking of Nazism, communism, and fascism to a degree. 

I am encouraged by signs everywhere that the youth of today are moving steadily away from the antiquidated religions of the past. Even though the mega church movement continues to grow (mostly in the South), the modern Christian church is light years away from its radical forbears of the 1800s and earlier.  I'd argue that were it not for secular additions like ""Christian"" rock music, and the overall general hipness of some of these new pastors, these modern churches wouldn't have much of a chance with the youth. 

So, overall, I see the trend among youth, and society in general, as pulling away from religion. I see that despite its efforts, Americans have largely rejected the platform of the so-called Moral Majority. Gay marriage continues to rise among states, the teaching of evolution continues to increase overall despite the best efforts of creationist whack jobs, and life in the urban centers is largely secular.

I don't think religion will ever fully go away. But judging by the growth of fundamentalist Islam in Europe, and fundie Christianity in the South and backwoods areas, I'd say that in 50 years religion will largely be considered an unfortunate by-product of the poor education and limited opportunity of the underclass.

Unfortunately, the medical associations, the surgeon general, and for sure the food manufacturers who are selling you low-fat processed fare are not going to admit it. In the famous longitudinal, prospective Framingham heart study, people who ate more fat did not have higher rates of death from CVD. There are bunches more studies, including the also well-known Nurses Health Study and even some randomized, clinical trials of diets with different amounts of fat that also do not demonstrate a connection between fat and CVD. Nor between fat and other so-called diseases of civilization, like high blood pressure and cancer. 

Also, dietary fat may raise your cholesterol, but it depends greatly on what sorts of dietary fat you're eating and what sorts of cholesterol is affected. Sure, animal fats increase LDL, but they also increase HDL at the same time. Further, the link between serum cholesterol and CVD is still somewhat tenuous, despite what you've been told.  Although we're all told that high LDL will kill us, there are a lot of people in these long-term studies with high LDL and no signs of CVD. In fact, low HDL (which, you'll recall is increased by the consumption of animal fats) is a far more potent predictor of who dies of CVD.

The idea that fat is going to kill us was first posed by Ancel Keys, who noticed that well-fed Americans were dropping of heart attacks at far higher rates than, say, post-WWII Europeans subsisting in near-famine conditions. Keys guessed that dietary fat was the cause, then he cherry picked data from all over the globe (see ""Seven Countries Study"") to support his hypothesis, without actually testing it. Further, rigorous scientific study hasn't supported his idea. 

There's increasingly compelling research that the western diet of processed carbs is responsible for what ails us. Easily digested sugars = high glucose = high insulin response = physiological and metabolic havoc. But it's just a hypothesis. Epidemiology is *hard*!

You are being incredibly defensive about this, which is a reasonable response when insulted, but whereas others would ignore, walk off, say something terrible about my mother, or downmod all my comments, you're confronting me about it. You're analyzing it, you're pairing it down, you're looking for weaknesses in your castle walls. You're challenging me to ""prove it"", it's very important to you, and not because you're afraid others will think you're racist, but because it deep down it touches on some issues you may have.

And no, I honest don't think you're racist, nor would I care if you were racist or not, it's not an issue for me, I'm sorry if that's how it came out, but I feel you're using the issue of race as a distraction to avoid your issues with your stepdad, which, while you've bled e-ink defending your non-racist creds, have not given a word about how you feel about your stepdad. 

&gt;Seems like if my step dad was a from a western nation, or europe, you wouldnt have a problem here.

It's nice to see you can infer all sorts of things from ""My my my. Defensive much?"", ""Then you have issues with your Swedish step dad, I suggest you work them out with him instead of random anonymous people on the internet."" ""I'm just reading what you wrote. It's not my fault if you wrote more than you intended."" but in this case, it seems sufficient to say, it sounds more like **you'd** be the one without the problem here if your stepdad was a from a western nation, or europe.

I might be wrong, you might have a wonderful relationship with your stepdad and be the most un-racist person in the world. Still doesn't change the fact you wasted the better part of an hour arguing with a guy you called you out with what amounts to nothing more than linguistic phrenology. If it bugs you that much, you need to take a step back, and figure out why, if it turns out to be nothing important, why reply back in the first place? Let it go. 

**Anyways, getting back to the food in /r/food/...**

Honestly, taking everything away, it just sounds like you ate food that was too spicy. In fact the only reason I started my diatribic defense of MSG was because you already [discounted that here](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/912o4/real_sichuan_food_is_a_culinary_drug_trip/c0b2yy0). Thrice I might add. If you really think it was MSG stay off the MSG, I think the MSG cartel will live another day with tears unshed, but really, if you really ""hallucinated"" instead of exaggerated the story because you didn't like your stepdad, my advice is still sound. You should stay away from exciting spicy foods. People have died. Actually, supposedly in Thailand, there are 3 levels of spicy: mild, hot, and ""only for thai"" as the third one actually causes severe discomfort and delirium in westerners who are adventurous enough to try it.

Alternatively, since it's already set that your stepdad has no qualms about braving new frontiers, maybe he improvised the recipe? Nutmeg is known for it's hallucinogenic properties, as well as other foods.

Didn't I just give you reported rapes in malaysia vs new york city? Is the number of reported rapes in malaysia ZERO? No, it's not. [Here](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_percap-crime-rapes-per-capita) is a list - I can't speak for its accuracy, but you can see Malaysia at #38, Tunisia at #48, Qatar at #57, etc. Doesn't that mean there are rapes happening in these countries? If they aren't illegal, how could there possibly be police statistics? Also, if you knew anything about Islamic law, you would know that the fornication is punished very harshly, how could you consider rape to be acceptable? Please acknowledge that your ideas on Islam are based largely on your own ignorance about the subject of study. The fact that you thought rape was legal speaks volumes about your lack of accurate knowledge on Islam.

Second of all, I did a bit of googling on your accusation that rape in sweden is because of immigrants. I found a some blogs that were more than happy to blame the immigrants for hurting the ""white native blonde girls,"" but I did find a [reference](http://www.thelocal.se/19102/20090427/) to an actual [sutdy](http://www.juridicum.su.se/jurweb/sweden_rape.pdf) which concluded:

&gt;The high incidence of rape in Sweden has a strong connection to nightlife and partying, specifically after-club parties in private homes.
Early sexual debuts, high alcohol consumption, ""free sexuality"" and the ""right to say no"" quite simply results in more rapes, the study concludes. The Daphne II fund ran from 2004-2008 and was set up by the European Parliament as a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk

please also note almost half the reported rapes included alcohol and also, women are much more likely to be raped in a home by a previous acquaintance or intimate setting than anywhere else.

&gt;In 2007, 48 percent of reported rapes took place in the victim's or aggressor's home, usually with previous acquaintance or intimacy between them, according to Swedish police statistics. ""Attack rapes"" between strangers accounted for 17 percent. Statistics indicate, however, that men may be more likely to be attacked outdoors than women. [source](http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/3855)

so as I would expect, you're blaming Islam for what actually are the problems of a sexually open society. I was debating your value system and you just turn and blame people who, if they are involved in raping people, are clearly not following a value system that directly prohibits that kind of consumption of alcohol and promiscuity.  If someone from a Muslim country raped a girl, then he is a criminal and should be punished. That does not mean he was following Islamic law, clearly he was NOT, but what he was most likely doing is living it up in a sexually open society which does tend to produce higher incidents of violence against women. 

As an aside, regarding the minority of rapes perpetuated by north african immigrants, take some advice from an American. If you don't want your immigrants to behave like animals, don't treat them like animals. These guys in malmo aren't following islamic law, they are behaving like how they are treated. I'm not sure what can be done about people living in ghettos, but it's a recipe for disaster. In America, we don't actually talk about diversity and embracing other cultures, we actually do it.

&gt;Again, I know many sexually liberated woman who have had many sexual partners and experimented with the opposite sex. This is completely healthy and natural. This is how the whole world should act. You ideas are stoneage.

I'll see your anecdote and raise you what I hear from women on reddit, that it's neither [emotionally](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/90lp1/in_my_teens_i_was_an_easy_girl_ama/c0b1col) or [physically](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/90lp1/in_my_teens_i_was_an_easy_girl_ama/c0b1p3w) healthy. Try reading the other comments in there too - straight from the mouth of a girl that society encourage to be loose and she later regretted it. 

Also, you're completely naive if you think all these magazine covers, beer commercials, pornographers, and open access to women's bodies etc. are the result of women's choosing. Do you think women choose to wear high heels that hurt like hell and give them back problems later in life? No, their choice is superficial at best, they are manipulated by a male-dominated society into conforming into a male-dictated image of beauty. They end up seeking confidence from their sexiness, the direct result of men's approval of their appearance. This kind of oversexualization of public space is exactly what Islam seeks to prevent. Without proper social protection, women are exploited by men. It's called unequal bargaining power and it's as old as time.

&gt;If deployed properly, out navy could survive fairly easily (baring waves upon waves of missiles).

How do you think they could deal with a single wave of missiles? Keep in mind that most such missiles are super-sonic, sea-skimming, and capable of evasive end maneuvers. And the Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles (not ICBM's like I said before) have a range of 2,000km and can target individual ships. There's no way to ""properly"" deploy a fleet if it can be destroyed by such means. I haven't even factored into the equation what a navy specifically designed to destroy our surface fleet could do. Hell, Iran's *speedboat* navy pretty much wiped out the 5th fleet in our own war game simulation *all by themselves!* Face it: surface fleets are dinosaurs and will not last in a modern conflict.

&gt;Tank for tank, our equipment is superior

Maybe to Russian/Chinese stuff, and then only slightly. We've never used our modern tanks against their modern tanks, each with all the bells and whistles. The problem in Iraq in 1991 was the the Iraqi tank crews were severely under-trained *and* equipped with 20+ year old basic tanks. If we were fighting the Russians with their latest tanks with all the gadgets, they would definitely put up a much better fight. While our base armor is better, ceramics and reactive armor are now fairly common and quite necessary, if only to improve the survivability of the crew. So, if it was just tank vs. tank, our Abrams could probably deal with Russian/Chinese MBT's, but the newer European designs are probably better than ours for that kind of fighting. I think the best solution to the problem has come from the French (who would have thought!?). They are focusing on lighter, wheeled chasis that are highly mobile and easier to make and maintain... and they're slapping on their tank cannons to *that*. It's kinda like our LAV, which can support such a variant. That speed is a critical asset these days, especially when it doesn't much matter what you get hit by, since it's probably going to kill you. I think after (or during) the next big war we'll see a shift towards light, fast, and lightly armored vehicles which will mainly support a heavier, more heavily armed/armored infantry.

&gt;On the other hand, we have these missiles too, and in much greater numbers.

We have them. But I'm not sure on the numbers. I'm guessing other nations have similar, if not greater numbers as they would probably rely on them more, whereas we rely on air power to do most of our tank killing.

&gt;It does seem like our infantry is under-trained

Based on the training I received, I would. The Army's infantry basic training was quite pathetic. I was set to receive Special Forces training, but then I got some lovely knee injuries and that was all she wrote. But Some of our guys get not much more than this basic infantry training. What did we do there? We basically just went through the motions. Shot some targets, just enough to get decent at shooting those targets. We got to pull the trigger on a few other, heavier weapons. We camped out in the woods. But most of the time we just sat around and waited... and ate MRE's. Our barracks was a series of trailers (I shit thee not). Our drill sgt's, most of whom were Rangers and SF guys, barely knew what they were talking about. Pretty much all we actually *did* do was PT in a giant sandbox and ruckmarch around; oh, and we got punished all the time for no reason other than our DS's were bored or thought they were being cool or funny (really, they were *that* petty! That speaks more about the ""training"" they received in order to become DS's, but that's neither here nor there).

So pretty much I wouldn't say our soldiers are some superb fighting force, just better than the rest by default, since we can't really test ourselves against other modern militaries.

&gt;On the air force side, we would definitely take losses, but I think we're used to fighting guerrilla wars, where any death is shocking, especially the destruction of a plane.

Yeah, that's going to be a big wake-up call for everyone.

&gt;I really don't see any air force matching the US'. Assuming we're not fighting an EU country, there is no country with better fighters. And I know for a fact that we do not skimp when training pilots.

China and Russia have pretty well-equipped air forces. They are both currently working on 5th Gen aircraft which will probably be some sort of match for the F-22. Their other aircraft are also pretty good. They too have very well-trained pilots, though it's pretty hard to tell how they'd match up against ours. Bottom line, the US Air Force is only a bit ahead of other big countries. They will soon be at our same technological level, but that's where funding and numbers comes in, so that's another factor which is difficult to include. 

&gt;And of course, we haven't even touched on nuclear weapons. I really have no idea how a future war will play out.

I'm pretty much ruling the use of nukes as a foul. I'm going to assume that they won't be used, but in the event they are, whoever uses them first is going to catch a whirlwind of flak for it, possibly devastating. That being said, the US is growing more and more likely to us nukes on a ""tactical"" level. Nowadays we have in our arsenal ""useable nukes"", which, apparently, local commanders on the ground have permission to use if they feel it necessary. Of course, we're only going to use them against a nation that can't properly defend itself or retaliate with nukes of its own. We wouldn't risk nuking Russia or China as that would prove *very* costly to our own side, as well as our allies (which I'm sure would be fleeting if we initiated nuclear warfare). 

&gt;Maybe we have seen the last of real warfare between developed countries.

A definite possibility.

False,0,1425999431,science,"I suggest you to read a little more about the historical and archaeological registers of the first Greenlanders.  I would recommend, for instance, the following document from The Hague International Court of Justice, Public sitting held on Tuesday 12 January 1993, at 10 a.m., at the Peace Palace, President Sir Robert Jennings presiding in the case concerning Maritime Delimitation in the Area between Greenland and Jan Mayen (Denmark v. Norway): http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/78/5787.pdf
It mentions the different climate Erik The Red found when arrived to the Green Land: “He [Eric the Red ] and his people settled in the southwestern fiord system of Greenland in the year 985-986, in this vast virgin territory, and it was Eric the Red who decided to call this country Greenland so that the name might attract more settlers, as it is said in one Icelandic saga recorded in the so-called Islendingabók of approximately 1128. This use of the name Greenland, though, was not just a matter of public relations. The fact of the matter is that around 1000 AD, the climate was milder than now, and many green hills and lush valleys must have met Eric's eyes when, in his viking ship, he first sailed up the fiord which is now called the Tunulliarfik, in the district of Qaqortoq, southwestern Greenland. The Norse period is by all accounts better documented than any other population wave into Greenland. The Icelandic and Norwegian farmers and cattle ranchers who sunk their roots in the sparse and treeless soil of Greenland during the five centuries following the expedition of Eric the Red were literate people with an acute sense of history. They made sure that posterity would know about them. They were a hardy people, who pushed Nordic agriculture to its absolute climatic limits. (…) When, in the latter part of the 15th century, the last Greenlandic Norsemen mysteriously vanished, it was not as the result of conflicts with the Inuit. It was rather because of a change of climate which eliminated the last possibilities of a sustainable agriculture, coupled with failure of supplies from overseas where nation after nation had been hit by the plague in Europe.”
In fact, we could not expect that settlers were attracted by the “fake” name Green, staying during 500 years! The climate change is well documented by the early Vikings in the region…
GREAT DOCUMENTARY!

True,0,1425999451,atheism,"&gt;Saudi Arabia doesn't represent the ""Muslims World"" (sic)? You should tell them that, I think they would tend to disagree with you

I am telling them that right now and most Muslims feel the same way. ""They"" (the Saudi government) may disagree but that would be an example of delusional thinking.

&gt;Of course, you don't mention the other countries... at all. And I could list a longer account of human rights abuses by scores of Islamic nations, if you so desire.

I do not not pretend that human rights abuses don't exist in Muslim countries. On the contrary I acknowledge and criticise them severely. The problem is that many if not most of the governments responsible for such abuses are propped up by America and the West. They do not represent the people. The West, especially the US, is to blame for a lot of it.

&gt;And at a time when Islamic Fundamentalist terrorism threatens the rest of the entire world, the fact that you don't see how all of this promotes extremism tells me you are blind to the facts and current events.

""Islamic Fundamentalist terrorism threatens the rest of the entire world""?? Really!? Do you *seriously* think that? You must be severely brainwashed/deluded if you do . Islamic fundamentalist terrorists are a *tiny and powerless* bunch that don't pose any serious risk to the world. The most they can do is commit oppurtunistic acts of terror - hardly an existential risk to any nation. Frankly, they are irrelevant. The real threat to the entire world is America and its religious right. The religious right, a large and influential force in American politics, is actively and desperately trying to instigate a global war of cataclysmic proportions to usher in the end of days to fulfil their religious eschatological beliefs. And since America is a superpower with a huge nuclear arsenal these fanatics could seriously end up destroying life on Earth as we know it. And this is not a far-fetched possibility by any means.

&gt;Your argument that the citizens are responsible for their government, and not the other way around, makes you sound like a terrorist

Are you familiar with the [association fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy)?  The fact remains that in a democracy the governments exists to represent and fulfil the aims and wishes of the citizenry. In a democracy the government receives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed. Thus, in a democracy, the citizenry is ultimately responsible for the actions of the governments it elects to represent them. Islam, by the way, forbids the targetting of civilians in war so UBL and the like don't have a leg to stand on. 

&gt;You keep talking about ""modern history"" as proof of Muslim societies being more civilized than Western European ones... but I see no evidence from you.

Sure. For example look at the numerous modern examples of heinous Western imperialism, colonialism, slavery, genocide and war that have literally scarred the entire World to this day. Heck, just consider the number of people murdered by Western ""Civilization"" in the last few centuries. It completely eclipses the Muslims World. So in that respect  I am completely justified in claiming that the Muslim World is far more civilized than the West.

Regardless of whether or not the bread and wine gains some spiritual property (the ""being Body, Blood, etc""), your explanation invalidates the common transubstantiation as evidence of the supernatural.

Now, then, onto your second claim about the blood types: if this were true, I'd convert in a second. However, it's not. The Shroud of Turin has  been allowed barely any scrutiny by science, and the only ""definitive"" blood type analysis, performed by Dr. Alan Adler and a few of his colleagues, consisted of them looking at the stains and concluding that it was AB type blood based on the color. Hardly definitive. However, a small sample of the stain was allowed to be taken and sent back to the states for analysis. However, the blood was so old that it was impossible to tell the blood type, and the DNA was so fragmented as to be impossible to match to any others.

If the AB blood type could be confirmed, and multiple other instances of actual transubstantiation into real blood confirmed, I'd be one step closer to converting. There is one major problem with that theory, though: AB type blood did not exist prior to 700 AD. It was created when the Mongols decided to rape Europe and Asia Minor.

The particular symbol or ideology is far less personnal, at least in my case, than the fact that some beliefs are so strongly associated with people who have cared and who we love.  Families, friends, teachers and home.   The religious divides and intolerance are on the rise particularly in Europe.  In France, there is alot of discussion to disallow muslim children to wear the hijab to school.  It is a shame because it is probably the case that the children associate wearing that symbol with their parents, teachers, people they love.   Instead, religious symbols are being increasingly viewed as showing an aggressive stance for a particular religion.     Airline personnel in Britain were told not to wear a small discrete cross on a necklace least that it annoys someone.     We throw around the words 'religious tolerance' but that seems a bit of an odd thing to imply that it is a matter of having to tolerate someone else's religion.   It implies that it is a burden to have to accept that some people believe in ideas/concepts different to our own.

Prague was stunning - it's a beautiful, clean city with amazing food and even better beer. The local beer, Pilsner Urquelle, is brewed in the town of Pilsner about half an hour away, so it's cheap and fresh (~AUD$2 for a small stein). Food is great; lots of smoked meats (pork is very popular) with great relishes and pickled vegetables to boot. 

The city is quite small, and it's an easy walk through the different districts. If you can, see a ""UV Theater Show"", and drop by the Museum of Communism in New Town. Prague is full of European history - head on over to the tourism offices as soon as you can. Some of the sights are incredibly moving.

Amsterdam is a little different. It's not as pretty as Prague, and certainly not as clean, but it's definitely worth seeing.

The Zionists started the conflict and they are primarily culpable for maintaining it. The Palestinians have always been ready for an equitable peace - Israel on the other hand can only exist in its current form by oppressing and subjugating the Palestinian people. 

&gt;and they have continuously been living in ""Palestine"" for over 2,000 years before Islam existed. (King David made Jerusalem the capital of the Hebrew kingdom in 1312 B.C.E.)

There is no evidence to think that is really true. And the Arabs weren't living on ""their land"". The ancient Jewish Kingdoms only existed for a very  short time two thousand years ago until they proceeded to have their asses kicked by all the regional powers.

ISrael started the war.

The surrounding states intervened to uphold international law and also to solve the humanitarian problem caused by the huge numbers of expelled Palestinian refugees flooding into their borders.

Actually I have been entering on my non-US passport for several years now.  Nobody's ever raised an eyebrow.  I think it's because I'd lost my US passport inside the country on a domestic flight, had lost my non-US passport a few weeks earlier (yeah yeah I know), and had to get a so-called ""laissez-passer"" (a consular letter of transit) because the local passport office was closed that day and I would have missed my flight, so I just said fuckit.

I actually had an INS guy suggest I apply for a green card once when I entered for the second time in one year to give a training at a European client's US facility, which I thought was kind of amusing.

&gt; I agree- it does seem rather 'dictatorial', doesn't it?

I don't know if I'd use that word -- I've visited some absolutely egregious shitholes, and the US is still an incredibly free country with loads of opportunity, especially compared to a lot of the world, and given the kind of hassle people have to go through to immigrate to other Western countries.  It's just that the nosiness and hassle and government intrusiveness...bother me.  I mean, they really get to me more than they should.

That, and as you point out, the global taxation thing -- I think it's actually the only country in the world that does this on a lifelong basis.  Which is moronic; I'll pay any taxes on income I earn in the US or property I own in the US or when I sneeze in the US, whatever, but if I do these abroad and pay taxes there...heh.

True,0,1425999930,Economics,"&gt;Hint - Throughout history, companies in particular industries, through various degrees of collusion, to provide terrible services but still continue to reap profits.

Evidently they're good enough to meet people's standard then, because they keep doing business with them. Just because you hate Wal-Mart doesn't mean everyone else does too. The only way a company that people don't want to do business with can survive is if the government backs them, and it is precisely this corrupting element that you hope will save us from these supposedly horrid companies. 

&gt;Hint 2 - So why are there Western European systems with less competition, but greater efficiency and equal or better outcomes? 

The United States has the most advanced medicine in the world, provided you can pay for it. There is a reason the wealthy of the world come here for their health care needs. The European systems work decently because they ration health care on the basis of governmental decree. That means that more people get health care, but everyone gets a smaller portion of it. Note that these systems have huge issues, such as low doctor pay which drives their best physicians out of the country, and massive overhead costs which make up a huge portion of their yearly budgets. I would also like you to note that the average profit margin of US insurance companies is 5%, and the average profit margin of hospitals in the US is 2-3%. If you hope to save money, it will be by cutting services to those who can afford them (which is the issue you had with the current system in the first place). You can't squeeze blood from a stone.

Doctors leave Germany: http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,399537,00.html (take a look at the average doctor pay by country in that graph. If you were a top of the line doctor, where would you go?)

&gt;Sorry to copy your hint spiel, but the fact is that you shouldn't act like such a smug condescending asshole.

Same for you. You started with a diatribe about how corporations (quite a large swath of groups and people here in the U.S.) don't care, CEOs don't care, and a rather popular politician is flat wrong, yet you say that I'm the pretentious asshole? Just who are you to make such broad based claims? What expertise do you have? 

&gt;EDIT: I know I shouldn't bother - this topic has ""RON PAUL"" in the header, and going into such a topic to argue for health care reform is like going into the water to fight a shark, to borrow from Churchill. Downvote away.

I disdain Ron Paul. I started a youtube account lambasting him. I drew up sarcastic fliers to counter the Paulites at my college. I am no fan of Ron Paul, but he has a point here.

You're misinterpreting my take on corporations, then.  If I had made such a fundamentally ridiculous extrapolation of your argument, you'd object as well.  In fact, it is likely that you feel that you have already done so.

&gt;It is currently unheard of to shop for health insurance as one shops for a car loan. That should be fixed, even if it requires governmental incentives.

There are no other examples of this working to reduce costs in the rest of the developed world; all the available information indicates the opposite - why are you so certain that this is the solution?

&gt;My family works their asses off, and the least they deserve is the best medical care that money can buy, not just a middling level of coverage that also ensures coverage to the lazy.

You believe that the amount of work has a strong correlation to compensation or wealth?  Boy, are you in for some surprises.  There is certainly a correlation, but it is definitely weak - it is rather childish, then, to call the people of the middle-classes or lower ""lazy"".  Please tell me that you are not some spoiled kid whose daddy is paying for his tuition, because the unseemliness of your comment would then be nauseating.

&gt;but people like you still make up a significant portion of the voting public, as evinced by the current success of Democratic politicians, and the current favoring of a single payer system.

Really?  Then how come the proposed system before the Congress is a bloated, watered-down, please everybody piece of shit that is a billion miles from single-payer?  

Let's get back to the starting point - you seem to think that in the US, you are surrounded by a bunch of greedy whiny people with their hands out.  Again, I say, try Europe.  You have no idea how little we want compared to how much they get.  

&gt;It's wrong of you to presume that your hard headedness and vigor also applies to me simply because I am in college. 

I felt that same way too, once.  I was certain of it, and offended by older people telling me otherwise.  I'll concede, not everyone softens their views with nuance as they get older.  Some people harden them.  I like to think that the ones who soften them are the smart ones, and the ones who harden them are dumb assholes, but it's even possible that I am wrong about that; who knows?  In any case, don't get so angry - just consider it a compliment that I'm not marking you as a dumb asshole.

&gt;Further, it doesn't seem as if you've lost any of your pompous attitude or vigor in favor of your particular brand of politics.

Actually, no, unlike what I would have believed 15 years ago, I believe more socialization will likely lead to many bad effects - innovation at the cutting edge will be hampered, some number of increased of deaths due to longer waiting times and rationed care, and higher taxes will be unavoidable in order to bear the costs.  And yes, ten or twenty million lazy people will leech of the rest of us, getting care, while putting out zero effort for it.

I feel that this is acceptable, if the benefit is better mean overall care, and lower spending on health for the majority of the people (with resultant benefits for the overall economy).  

Maybe I'm wrong, and the negatives outweigh the benefits, but my take on the alternative systems out there make me feel as though this is unlikely.  However, it seems, from your earlier statement, that you don't really care if the overall good is maximized - for you, your beliefs have more to do with the principle of self-responsibility.  If so, I recommend you argue from that standpoint, and toss the weak economic arguments out the window.

They exported a lot of it in the first half as well -- the Middle East was a theater of war in both World Wars; Asia was a major theater of war in the second.

But I'd also like to see exactly where Pinker's statistic on that comes from.  It's not totally clear that it comes from Keeley's study, and if not, then how can we be sure that both studies were using the same criteria?  If it does come from the Keeley study, is it a result of Keeley's own research, or is he comparing his data about hunter-gatherer tribes to figures from another study, and if the latter, how did *that* study arrive at those numbers?

My point isn't that anyone has fudged the data, but rather that *our* assessment of those facts is prone to some serious fallacies unless we have a sufficiently round idea of how they were produced.

Going back to Keeley's figure about hunter-gatherer tribes -- there's at least one plausible rationale for maintaining a skeptical view that modern hunter-gatherers can tell us anything about ancient hunter-gatherers.  An illustration from history can help see why.  After the collapse of Rome, a horde of barbarian (ie. non-Romanized tribes) fell across the former Empire like a curtain, mostly retreating from famine.  It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that those late, militaristic barbarians were indicative of pre-Roman culture in their point of origin.  The reason is that Rome expanded aggressively, and the barbarian cultures that weren't assimilated tended to be those that were most capable of holding back the expanding Roman border.  In other words, the Roman Empire essentially created the breeding ground for a hyper-militarized border cultures, and assimilated any barbarians that weren't sufficiently militarized to resist.

Some analogy might well be at play in modern hunter-gatherer survivals.  Historically, agrarian-urban culture expanded through conquest, in the first place, and later through economic dominance.  The hunter-gatherer cultures most likely to survive in that context were those best fitted to resist or to adopt features that would allow them to resist.  One such feature could be a greater propensity for aggression and higher rates of violence.  As such, Keeley's observed results could be interpreted as an indirect result of the very culture to which he compares those modern hunter-gatherers.",0,blackstar9000,t1_c0b58dv,0,,True,,t5_2qh2p,1247780892,,2,t3_91vcb,False,2,t1_c0b573q,c0b58dv

Their patent is registered in China and Europe and pending in USA/globally. The specified ultrasonic technology to heat the liquid which is more efficient but it enabled copycat factories in china to design an e-cig that looked like Ruyan's but use a basic wire heater instead. 

Ruyan paid a company called Sottera to help bring their product into America and market them. Sottera aggreed looked at the legal implications and learned a lot from Ruyan but then turned tail and decided to import the cheaper clones instead branding them Njoy. Ruyan were pissed. Njoy were making deals with casinos and Ruyan were trying to too. Njoy heard that Ruyan had told one casino that njoy were cheap knock offs of their product when they learned that Njoy were also trying to close a deal with them. 

They brought Ruyan to court for defamation and won, even though yes, they were cheaper knock offs of the original ruyan product. Njoy then went about trying to get a patent for this knock-off in america. They were not successful and never will be. This is why you will see hundreds of companies rebranding variations of this simpler e-cig and about a dozen chinese factories making variations of the product. It cannot be patented.

Nobody sold nothing to greensmoke or inlife. Greensmoke (also known as smoke51) buy their product from a chinese company called loongtotem.
