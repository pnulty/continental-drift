Just like in the United States, actual citizens have right of way when it comes to picking a candidate for a job. The reasons for that are obvious: where foreigners need to adapt to cultural differences, locals are already ""ready to go"". In addition to that, foreigners often have higher salary requirements and hiring them means that the company will have to fill a ton of paperwork.

In my opinion, your best shot at finding a job here is to get transferred from an US branch of a company to a French subsidiary/succursal. This indeed means that you would be working for a large company, which is not necessarily easy especially considering that US companies tend to find Ireland a lot more attractive for branchs. France's high tax rate on companies make it a somewhat undesirable place to do business as a foreign company.
And of course, there is the fact that no matter how hard you study and practice, your knowledge of French will always be weaker than that of a French-born worker.

The few Americans working here in Lyon (or in other places) transferred here from management positions in the United States or Canada. A few years ago, my dad and his associates sold their company to a very large US firm (medical field) and some of the firm's execs started working here in Lyon as liaison agents or simply local execs.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm still a student but I was interning at an US company in France last summer and I found myself in a company that was shifting over from French workplace management to US-like workplace management (you guessed it... My dad's company) and I must say, the latter is a lot more rigid and nonsensical than the former.

Overall, I believe that working in an European environment as an American would do you much good and be a very enriching experience. Not to mention how much it would add to your work experience when you go back to the United States.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help but I'm still a student. As for life in France, I would be extremely glad to tell you whatever you want to know over emails or private Reddit messages. Seriously. Contact me."

The origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in Vatican-Argentine relations before and during World War II.[2] As early as 1942, Monsignor Luigi Maglione contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the ""willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European Catholic immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country"".[3] Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to Portugal, continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration.[3] According to historian Michael Phayer, ""this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline"".[3]

Spain, not Rome, was the ""first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists"", although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican.[4] Charles Lescat, a French Catholic member of Action Française (an organization suppressed by Pius XI and rehabilitated by Pius XII), and Pierre Daye, a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government, were among the primary organizers.[5] Lescat and Daye were the first able to flee Europe, with the help of French cardinal Eugene Tisserant and Argentine cardinal Antonio Caggiano.[5]

By 1946, there were probably hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists.[6] According to US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Vatican cooperation in turning over asylum-seekers was ""negligible"".[6] According to Phayer, Pius XII ""preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in POW camps in zonal Germany"".[7] Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy, centered on Vatican City, the ratlines of Spain, although ""fostered by the Vatican"" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.[8]

Here’s what WHO has to say about it:

&gt;*Definition and principle sources*

&gt;PM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The particles are identified according to their aerodynamic diameter, as either PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 µm) or PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm). The latter are more dangerous since, when inhaled, they may reach the peripheral regions of the bronchioles, and interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs.

&gt;*Health effects*

&gt;The effects of PM on health occur at levels of exposure currently being experienced by most urban and rural populations in both developed and developing countries. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer. In developing countries, exposure to pollutants from indoor combustion of solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections and associated mortality among young children; indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is also a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer among adults. The mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15–20%. Even in the EU, average life expectancy is 8.6 months lower due to exposure to PM2.5 produced by human activities.

On the basis of ""Harris morality"", I would argue that it certainly is immoral to have religiously mandated laws: The set of moral decisions you make based on the ""well-being"" standard differs from those made on the basis of religion; and if ""well-being"" is your standard then the shit that comes from the Bible, wherever it differs, is immoral; and where it agrees, is redundant.

Harris argues, for a whole chapter, that well-being is the *only* standard for morality that is relevant and makes any sense. This appealed strongly to me and I'm convinced. If you don't agree, I think you're still the victim of some muddled thinking. Of course, not having read the book also puts you at a bit of a disadvantage. I don't remember enough of his arguments to lay them out for you and -I'm sorry- I'm too lazy to quote mass quantities for you from the text.

The USA holds some positively medieval views on morality. I get the impression parts of USA are closer to the Middle Ages than modernity. 90% is hugely overstated, I say. I would put European countries at 80-90% and the US at maybe 50-60%. Huge swaths of public opinion in the USA hold that all legislation and morals should be Bible-based; they f-ing haven't even *heard* about any revolution!

The Best Led Zeppelin Bootlegs - A Guide for New Collectors

Here are some categorized recommendations for those who don't know where to go next in collecting Led Zeppelin bootlegs. The list focuses on shows that stand out as particularly worth having in one's collection. These are the shows that invite regular listening. In compiling this list, priority goes to shows with complete, or nearly complete, recordings readily available to ordinary collectors, are reasonably good quality recordings, are of exceptional performances, or have some notable historical significance either as classic bootlegs or as preserving historically significant performances. 

Earlier versions of this list identified particular bootlegs to get for these shows. In this revision I've removed most of these recommendations since they regularly go out of date as new sources or new versions of available sources emerge. For information about which sources to procure for these shows, I recommend perusing the thread for the shows you want here in the What Place To Rest The Search forum. If a show has no such thread, post a request in this thread and surely someone familiar with the show and its available sources will fill you in on the relevant details.

Must-Haves
These bootlegs offer a sampling of what I think are the best sounding and highest quality complete or nearly complete performances from all their different eras. The emphasis here is on shows that have for a long time been regarded as key moments in Led Zeppelin's performing career, though some newly circulating shows merit inclusion.

1969.01.05 Los Angeles, Whisky A Go-Go - The second earliest recording to appear. The recording probably was made in-house, from the stage. An energetic performance overall. Includes the Yardbirds tune For Your Love.

1969.04.27 San Francisco, Fillmore West - Available in a great quality SBD recording, as well as an AUD recording that together offer a complete recording of one of their best ever shows. See the Classic Bootlegs section below.

1969.08.31 Lewisville, TX (Dallas) - A short performance at the Texas Pop Festival. A nearly complete SBD recording and an AUD recording offer together a complete version of this great performance. Some video footage exists from a documentary about the festival.

1970.03.07 Montreux, Switzerland - The SBD recording is inferior to the very good AUD recording, but using the SBD to fill the gaps in the AUD, the complete show is available.

1970.09.04 Inglewood, LA Forum - The show which yielded probably the most famous Led Zeppelin bootleg of them all: ""Live on Blueberry Hill,"" named on account of the final encore of this classic show. The second Led Zeppelin show ever to be bootlegged, and even then, back in late 

1970, two different recordings circulated. By now, numerous AUD recordings of this show circulate, and various combinations of them allow for the complete show. See the Classic Bootlegs list. See also the rare performances of LZ songs list.

1971.04.01 London BBC - The official release is heavily edited. A Pre-FM Master recording includes the entire performance, including a longer Heartbreaker solo, more elements of the Whole Lotta Love medley, and a false start to What Is and What Should Never Be. See the Classic Bootlegs list below.

1971.09.29 Osaka, Japan - Numerous sources for this great show circulate, and in various combinations offer the complete show. See the Classic Bootlegs list below. See also the rare performances of LZ songs list (this show is the source of the only known concert performance of Friends). See also the Japanese Tours list for more gems from the 1971 Japanese Tour. 

1972.06.25 Inglewood, LA Forum - Some of this show is on ""How the West Was Won,"" but out of proper order and mixed with tracks from (the also great) Long Beach show two nights later. On the bootleg you hear the complete show including quite a bit of interaction with the lively crowd. The encores are fantastic.

1972.10.02 Tokyo, Japan - Another great performance. The Whole Lotta Love medley includes Killing Floor, I Can't Quit You Baby and You Shook Me. See the Japanese tours lists below. On the Historically Significant Shows list since it includes the first ever performances of The Song Remains the Same and The Rain Song.

1973.01.22 Southampton, England - A recording taken from the multi-track tapes of a professional recording by the band, so the sound quality is outstanding. A sometimes rough, but generally energetic performance (especially by Bonzo), with interesting use of the Mellotron by Jones.

1973.03.24 Offenburg, Germany - Considered by many to be among the best of the Spring 1973 European Tour. See the section below on the Spring 1973 European tour, and the Classic Bootlegs list.

1973.07.21 Providence - One of the best shows from the 1973 US Tour. Generally good performance, and a very energetic crowd. The AUD recording is nearly complete.

1975.02.14 Uniondale - The most recent of the steady flow of 1975 soundboards is a great one. Filling the gaps in the SBD with bits from the AUD recording offers a complete version of perhaps the best of the early 1975 shows. The introductory jam to Heartbreaker is unique.

1975.05.25 London, Earl's Court - The closing night of the five night stand at Earl's Court. See the Earl's Court and video sections below.

1977.04.27 Cleveland - Not the best show from 1977, but not the worst either. The quality of the nearly complete SBD is very good, though. This show was bootlegged shortly after the performance, and so is quite familiar to older collectors. See the Classic Bootlegs list.

1977.06.21 Inglewood, LA Forum - A great performance with a great quality AUD recording. With the tape flips patched by material from a lower-quality recording of the same show, the entire show is available. The show opener, The Song Remains the Same is available in one of the menus for the official Led Zeppelin DVD. Plant's introduction of Bonzo before the Over the Top solo is particularly amusing. See the Classic Bootlegs and Mike ""the Mike"" Millard sections below.

1979.08.04 Stevenage, Knebworth Festival - Their last truly great performance (though of course this show has its detractors), very well documented in a swarm of AUD recordings and a SBD recording drawn from the virtually complete professionally shot video of the show, all of which circulate widely. See the video and classic bootleg sections below.

1980.06.29 Zurich, Switzerland - The complete show is available in SBD and AUD recordings. Some rough spots, but overall a good performance. See the Classic Bootlegs section below.

As for the gap, there are probably 2 or 3 main causes. 
1. If you're about to die, and you want to end up as a fossil skeleton the vast majority of resting places will not result in you being fossilized. Conditions really have to be perfect, which is why you hear so much about cave sites having early modern human fossils. Exposure to elements is low, and there's a possibility of being quickly covered by sediments that wont just dissolve bone. So if you're being buried out on a nice pasture on top of a hill that will probably erode in a couple thousand years expecting to enjoy your fossil-afterlife, good luck. 
Aside from that, even if you end up in a cave, there's always the possibility that you're going to get chewed up by some scavenger and scattered all over the place. 

2 and 3 really boil down to a sound research plan and luck. You can't just excavate every cave in the middle east. And even if you do, you sure as hell will not be able to excavate every square foot of that cave.  Time and money are very limiting factors in archaeology. 

As for religious folks in Archaeology. There are plenty. I know quite a few Muslims and Christians who dig. I don't know all their views on evolution, but I've never met an Anthropologist/Archaeologist who professed belief in creationism. "

There is a good reason the Bundesbank was established in 49 and was very independent of the government. Within 20 years the Mark was one of the most stable currencies in the world. Part of that surely came from the independence and from the fact that the Bundesbank (like the new european central bank) was only looking out for price stability not for economic growth.

Look at this report... http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2006/0901.pdf central bank independence (and therefore the independence of the money supply from government influence) is the best recipe for price stability and long term economic success (the last part is not in the report but I believe it is true non the less)."

I do understand that the US military has lost of lot of integrity, especially in Europe, especially in light of some of the scandals in the last few years.

It was a small town, and not only was I the new guy at a small school, but I was the new guy from one of those ""godless"" European countries. 
There were girls I thought looked good or were funny, but they all tried to ""save"" me. I was always like the oddball, me and the other foreign kid. The girls never liked us because we didn't go to church, they only wnated boyfriends who would go to church with their families...needless to say I didn't have a girlfriend throughout high school although I did go on dates. But since this was my first exposure to American girls, I figured most American girls would be like that.

When I got to college, I met a girl on the first day. A Catholic girl. We dated and eventually got into a relationship, but it didn't last long. As I was in school I noticed that most girls were completely opposite from the experience I had in high school. Not only that, but my girlfriend became pushy about her religion and going to church, blah blah blah. At this point, I wanted out because I saw how cool the other girls were and because she too was trying to ""save"" me from my ""hedonistic"" ways. Thing is, religious people are very good about using guilt to manipulate others. She made all sorts of promises about not bothering me about religion, as long as I don't brake up with her. I liked her, aside form the religious thing, so I gave her a shot. Her promise lasted a week, I pointed it out to her, she ignored it. We'd have talks about how I want my beliefs to be my own and that I didn't want everyday to be a failed conversion for her. She started acting all weird after that, incited her friends against me, tried to trick me into religious activities (e.g. one night she told me her friend was having a party and we could go together, I agreed...it was a Bible party...). I had given her a second and a third chance to accept me for who I was, after all she wanted to stay together more than I did, but she never seemed to listen.

 I told her one day that I was through, no more chances and she was crying her eyes out citing Bible verses that she apparently took as relationship advice. She said she had been reading the Bible trying to figure out how to save our relationship, I told her, if she had just put the Bible down she would have saved the relationship. Then she started cursing me, calling me the devil for tempting her and misleading her, etc. I kinda pushed her out into the hall and closed my door. That day, her and her friends decided to vandalize my dorm. They waited until I had left, but forgot to take into consideration that my roommate was still there. My roommate was there when they tried to break in through the window. He said, he could hear someone trying to unlock the big window through the small window, both of which were behind drawn shades. My roommate, thinking somebody was coming to steal his shit grabbed a text book and started beating the fuck out of the hand coming through the window. He said, it seemed the person panicked and couldn't get their hand back out the window, so he just kept pummeling the shit out of it. We figured, if it was a student, they'd have a pretty gnarly looking hand. Two days later, I see my ex, her hand is all sorts of fucked up. I asked her what happened and she admitted the whole thing to me, she said she wanted me to believe that god was punishing me for breaking up with her. She asked if I forgave her. I told her I did, but the next time she thinks its a good idea to deliver god's messages to me the police might not be so forgiving. 

Since that time I have only been with agnostic or atheist girls...well one Buddhist girl, but her beliefs were never pushed on me. All I gotta say is that I don't think I could ever date a religious girl. Nope. Not at all. If you think the world is 6,000 years old, its just gonna be impossible. I can deal with agnostic girls, but anybody who bases their life on a collection of fairy tales...I can't do it.

As for cheering up, You missed the point. There are 3 possibilities, as far as I can see, being practical here: you find a job. I assume this becomes more likely as you are less negative and depressed. So it's practical, and more pleasant for you if you try to do something to cheer yourself up. Next, there's the possibility you fail to find something, don't kill yourself and get deported. Did you want to spend the last time here miserable? I mean, you can apply in other countries too, if you find a job later, good, move. Whether it's to EU, back here, whatever. Or, you absolutely can't find anther way out and kill yourself, in which case, again, do you want to spend your last time miserable? I don't like that last one, but since you are considering it, may as well accept at least the possibility.

Another thought though: Have you considered foreign charity work? You remain under the protection of an american group, can keep applying while you do your charity work, and it's more useful than killing yourself. They can't deport you from a country you aren't in, and no other country will likely deport someone sent by an american charity. It buys you time, which sounds like something you could use more of.

Apply for asylum. Once again, it's all about stalling, and buying time to find a job. Might buy another couple weeks, maybe?"

For several hundred years Europeans had fairly ""normal"" relations with Africans (normal as in, they at least recognized them as human beings). It was only after Native Americans started dying off and European-Americans started building up disease immunity that it became financially worth it to purchase African slaves.

In other words, African slavery was more about financial motivation, which then led to the brutally violent and racist actions slaveholders perpetrated.

Given the observation that right now Spain hasn't collapsed, it's strange to base the assertion that Spain is in trouble on the figures as they are now, rather than on estimates of where they're going. If you look at those numbers, the picture for Spain looks infinitely better: the austerity measures both Ireland and Greece would only implement after a EU bail-out have already been put into effect and while the current numbers of Spain look bleak in and of themselves, they've been relatively stable throughout the crisis, compared to the rest of Europe. As such, the risk of a sudden event that would make Spanish debt soar (like the bail-out of banks in Ireland) or the cost of Spanish debt soar (like the correction of older, highly misleading, economic data in Greece) is lower. Secondly, he mistakes the political unwillingness to commit a priori to carrying the cost of a bail-out of Spain with an inability to actually carry the cost of a bail-out were it required. It's going to take a bit of a fight over who pays what if Spain were to ask for a bail-out, but I think it's unreasonable to fear that there would be no outcome of that fight. Thirdly, he suggests a narrative of a cascade with the inevitable collapse of the Euro, but even without a bail-out of Spain, the consequences would most likely be either a controlled devaluation of the Euro from Brussels (not a collapse) and Spain having to take on more loans than they expected, provoking harsher austerity measures, but probably not an actual defaulting on debt."

That was the other guy putting words in my mouth. Thanks for the response. I can totally understand being tired of discussing the same thing over and over and just wanting to basically tell someone I disagree with to shut up rather than write something I've already written a dozen times earlier in the day. One thing I sometimes dislike about Reddit is when someone makes an unpopular statement, instead of people responding to the statement based on its content so discussion can follow, they often just give the person downvotes and perhaps a snarky insult. I stand by my assertion that an answer of ""no"" added nothing to the discussion but in light of your explanation and your excellent follow up post, I hereby retract any previous statement(s) I made that gave anyone the impression I was calling you a karma whore.  

I think your synopsis of the situation is accurate (except for the part about me being misinformed haha) You're right that they would push for the no labeling laws. But I think that is a separate argument from the general argument as to whether GMOs should be allowed on the shelves of EU stores. If the EU held firm and said, we'll allow GMOs but they must be labeled as such otherwise they won't be sold here, the US would have little choice but to accept.

Like I said, I think the EU has every right to hold firm. I think if GMOs are sold in Europe they should absolutely be labeled because consumers have the right to know what they are buying. And if they aren't sold in the EU, I'm fine with that because I think the officials representing these nations have the right to make that decision on behalf of the electorate. Heck, I wouldn't want GMOs in the marketplace if I was a citizen of a EU member nation. I'm just taking issue with those who are spinning this into something it's not by claiming that the US pressure on the EU to accept GMOs is some sort of unprecedented, vile and as someone else put it ""criminal"" behavior when similar posturing is common throughout the international community. The US government and the EU are both acting rationally. The US is just representing the interests of a major constituency, just as the EU is working on behalf of its members - that's just how government works. 

I could be mistaken, but I think we might be pretty much in agreement on this.

""The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: many studies did not attempt to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis""

From the wiki.

Also from the wiki :

""Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation.[3] For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped.""

And another:

""There is anecdotal but not scientific evidence that fluoride allows more time for dental treatment by slowing the progression of tooth decay, and that it simplifies treatment by causing most cavities to occur in pits and fissures of teeth.""

Anecdotal evidence is meaningless.

I'm sorry for being so hostile, but this is an issue that I argue with Americans on a regular basis. Here in Canada, our government has accepted the recent science done that more or less proves water fluoridation being good for your teeth as false :

http://www.nofluoride.com/reports/Science%26Ethics-Canadian_Dental_Assoc.pdf

The PDF is legitimate, in case you wondered about the source. 

In fact, the *only* country to produce *studies* about the benefits of water fluoridation seem to be the United states. Almost every other western nation has accepted it as bunk.


http://www.health-science.com/fluoride_toxicity.html

Speaking honestly, the issue is still up for debate. But the good science rests with the debunkers, while the studies done on the benefits of water fluoridation are flawed and generally bad science. 


Another good study:

http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7265/855.full

Another:

http://www.fluoride-journal.com/97-30-2/302-110.htm


A generally acknowledged problem is there there isn't enough study done to allow for the mass fluoridation of water supplies. In reality, it could have any number of negative (or positive) effects on the human body - But this is clearly a grossly incomplete understanding to enact procedures on. "

They neglect to mention some pretty important items (emphasis in bold by me):

In lengthy e-mail exchanges with FoxNews.com, Smith alternatively defended her online postings, denied being anti-American, called the Sept. 11 attacks an inside job, the U.S. a terrorist organization and **praised the American-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al Awlaki -- architect, trainer and inspiration for many of the recent terrorist attacks attempted or committed against the U.S.** President Obama last April approved Awlaki's inclusion on the CIA's targeted killing list.

In one e-mail to FoxNews.com, Smith wrote:

“If your neighbor was being attacked by a perpetrator, would you just stand there and say, 'Oh I will let someone come who has a gun to help them'? No, you would rush to their defense. And use any type of ""weapon"" to help that person... this is what I am doing. I am defending the defenseless. I am defending my home and family and their right to safety. No matter who it is at my door. These are the rights the Constitution gives me. The very right this Communistic government is trying to take away from me and the rest of the Americans.”

In the nearly six-minute video under investigation, Smith and her husband, known online as Salahudin Ibn Ja'far, 28, appear posing and hugging and holding weapons interspersed with photos of known and suspected terrorists and assorted jihadist propaganda, like an Awlaki sermon album cover.

There also are photos of German Taliban Mujahideen -- German nationals who have formed their own splinter group within the Taliban -- and mug shots of members of the Saarland cell of Islamic Jihad Union charged with plotting failed terror attacks against U.S. targets in Germany, including a 2007 plot to bomb the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein.

Smith said of the Ramstein plotters featured in her video:

“The so-called 'jihadists' you have mentioned are actually personal friends of my husband from childhood. In the video he was expressing his love and gratitude to his friends, who have died fighting for freedom. Just like any other American or European citizen who displays pictures of soldiers who have died on their videos. There is no difference in gratitude and love. It is just that your government has deemed these noble men as 'terrorists' because they are not on the same side. Least us not forget the Mujahideen who fought the Russians for the U.S. They were deemed 'heroes' and lead by Osama Bin Laden at that time, and now because the government says so... they are ""terrorists.””

In addition to being close childhood friends of convicted terrorists, Salahudin has posted content from the German Taliban’s media outfit and the Islamic Jihad Union on forums and social networking sites. **He's also written in support of his “noble leaders” -- bin Laden, Awlaki, the Sept. 11 hijackers and other terrorist leaders.**

Salahudin appeared to maintain forums devoted to hosting Awlaki’s sermons. **Earlier this month he uploaded videos to his since-deleted YouTube account that included German muhajideen training at jihadist camps in Pakistan, and another featuring the widow of a German Taliban jihadist directing the wives of jihadists to fulfill their obligations while their husbands are off fighting.**

In other English-language posts, **he suggests he himself has trained in these same jihadist camps.**

On Facebook, he is ""friends"" with the notorious Al Qaeda English-language online magazine Inspire, thought to be principally authored by American-turned-Muslim radical Samir Khan. Salahudin also has used his online posts to call for the deaths of U.S. citizens, military and government leaders, and recently joined in on another user’s thinly veiled threats against Condoleezza Rice, according to postings discovered by FoxNews.com and screen shots provided by the Jawa Report, a watchdog blog that has been following the online activities of Smith and her husband.
...

On her MySpace page, currently available for viewing via Google cache, Smith wrote: “As salamu alaikum akhi.. it is time for Jihad and it is now Fard ayn for ALL Muslims whether their in the United Snakes or else where...Insha'Allah!!!!”

Smith has lauded Awlaki, celebrated the deaths of U.S. soldiers -- who she called “terrorists” -- at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan, **and applauded another user’s posting of a rendering of the two planes hitting the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001**.


TL;DR version: Whether they've actually been involved in terrorist activity or not, this couple really, really loves jihadists. I sure as hell hope they are on the no-fly list."

&gt;What level of technological achievment did these people attain? What was their belief system? Did they speak of the past? Of the zygobots? Maybe there was... and with the brief break in in my algorithms, caused by the human emotions welling inside of me, I did not notice the gleaming spear, sailing through the air, piercing a gap in between the plates of my heavy armor, and embedding itself deep in my left pectoral region, exactly where a heart would have been if I had one. If the spear had been any heavier, it may have punctured deeper into my central cortex and into the remainging human tissue I had. 

&gt;It was indeed painful in a digital sort of way, but not very life threatening. A phenomenal shot, from another worthy foe. I was in awe of this new race of man. A hunter with this skill, must come from a powerful tribe, or perhaps a kingdom. Algorithms settling on the idea of letting myself be captured won favor of those wanting to escape for later inspection. The curiosity was too much for me. The birds themselves seemed capable of extreme damage if tangled with, but the bio-metrics were telling me they weighed less than half of my hulking mass. I stood, there for awhile, as they circled overhead, spinning above in a hypnotic dance, and then I toppled over.

&gt;The hunters slowly circled down, landing close by, and alarmed shouting between the leader and his two wingmen indicated that they were very nervous and apprehensive. Voice modulator simulators indicated a guttural tongue, with a European flavor, but overwhelmingly unfamiliar overall. It was incomprehensible, but with time, I believe my decoders would do the trick. They approached cautiously, and as I lay, still and motionless, I caught the eye of the leader. The yellowed eyes of this man, with a hard outer glaze, concealing a viscious and deadly stare showed me the attitude needed by the hunters of this age to survive. I would gladly make this man a hero by letting him take me to his leader."

The MTV Europe hosts were actually interesting people, whereas the TMF hosts were bimbo's and idiots that couldn't say one single interesting sentence if their life dependend on it. They were just so dumb and so lacking any talent, culture and flair. 

Then MTV bought TMF. And I know really know what happened. We stopped getting MTV Europe. We got MTV Netherlands, which the same talentless zombies as hosts. 

As for the music, which they did play back at the time. It stopped being as diverse as it once was. I think MTV Europe was all R&amp;B and Rap, mixed with the occasional pop song. Crappy enough for at least me, to not turn it on ever. And TMF was a bit similar, with some dance music, but also a lot of the most extreme commercial crap ever. I mean: songs that nobody really liked, but that were just very very pushed. The few people that liked the song, really don't know any music, and wouldn't care if they played anything else anyway. It were songs that pandered to teenagers in the most pathetic way possible ""Sex on the beach"" or crap like that.

There was also ""The box"", where you could send a text-message to make them play a song. They were still very diverse, and people tend not to want to pay for shit music, so the commercialised-pushed bullshit songs, they weren't played that much. That was still watchable. 

But from that point on, I don't think I've even turned on MTV, TMF or the Box. The only nice thing Viacom has ever given us in that regard is Comedy Central. That's the only channel, here in Holland, people were very happy to get. Not because the shows are great, but they are an actual improvement about white noise and/or static.

But it was little too late. I don't think the youth watches less TV, because of the Internet. I think there is like this 5% to 20% percentage of youth today, that just doesn't want TV anymore, at all. And the others are tasteless smucks that really don't care what they are watching. 

To me. MTV is dead. TMF was never alive. And there are just too many talentless hacks, bimbo's and idiots on my black list to ever take the change of turning the thing on. I mean at this point, on television there are too many people i just hate. That completely digust me. 

Enough to not risk turning it on and ruining my day by being confronted by the fact that these people exists. If you want to make a TV channel and get somebody like me to watch, you advertise in news papers with a list of talentless fucks that you promise will never _ever_ be on there.

Oh and you put the stream online. Because honestly, I don't know anybody my age, that would pay for a cable subscribtion themselves. So as soon as they leave the house, live on their own. They don't have cable. They don't care enough to go through the hassle. It's not even a money thing. It's just not important enough.

Nope.  I'd love it if everyone could have healthcare.  That'd be phenomenal.  What I don't think  is that it's morally acceptable to steal from everyone in the country to pay for it.  And that's assuming the country was in good economic standing, which it isn't.  Right now, we can't pay for shit.  We're fourteen trillion dollars in debt.  _Trillion_.  We can't pay for more stuff.  Shit, we can't even pay for less stuff.  If the government were to tax 100% of everyone's income for a year and spend nothing, we'd just barely break even.  We are in deep shit, and embarking on ambitious new spending programs reeks of the guy with a maxed out credit card who signs up for a new one so he can feed the homeless.

I'm all for helping people get medical care, either through charity or by helping to bring the cost down.  Incidentally, the cost of medical care is grossly inflated, both due to the costs of the sheer bulk of ridiculous lawsuits that the legal system isn't equipped the handle, and the cost of regulation on the medical profession as a whole.  Off the top of my head, my brother got contacts the other day.  Do you realize how insane it is that you need a prescription from the doctor to get a piece of curved plastic to put on your eyeball?  That could have cost two dollars and been done by a high school student with two machines and a poster board if those laws weren't in place.  Expertise is not involved.  Don't even get me started on the cost-benefit of legalizing drugs.  

&gt;as if there is no choice to eat but dine at restaurants.

Homeless people starve to death every day, dude.  Charity is their only option, for those who can't care for themselves.  Anybody that doesn't feed them, by your logic, is a murderer.  

&gt;They will still find a way to retool and make money if the insurance companies (and poor folk) aren't giving them their regular handout.

Sure they will.  I'm sure they'll make loads of cash, and all those investors and companies will be just itching to risk billions of their own dollars to invent new drugs and therapies to keep your sorry ass alive now that you won't be paying.  That sounds good.  

Hey, how about you, what's your job?  You sell something?  Provide a service?  Right, how would your company retool if your clients were no longer legally obligated to pay you?  You think you'd keep your job?

During the time of Noah, when God told him to make the ark, all of the continents were bound together (ala Pangea) but that all of the continents rested on a layer of water sandwiched between the continents and the ground below that. So during the great deluge, in addition to all that rain, water sprung up from the ground. The theory was that the continents squeezed the water up through cracks until the layer was about 50 ft thick, where it acted as a lubricant. The continents separated at about 40 miles per hour and slammed into each other, creating the mountain ridges in India, Europe, and North America. I did some quick googling and found [this](http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/HydroplateOverview2.html) which looks like something similar to the presentation I saw - Hydroplate Theory. "

Western Europe is [running into obscene debt even faster than we are.](http://www.visualeconomics.com/gdp-vs-national-debt-by-country/).  Keep in mind, that's with a higher tax rate than us, no vast tracts of land to cover with infrastructure, and no horrifying military abomination to support.  That's all social services right there, and they are going to crash and burn.

&gt;We are, and that is due to the top 10% of the people owning 90% of our nation's assets. Due to wealth distribution which is a systematic flaw in our economy, which is what this healthcare debate is making quite obvious.

Boo hoo, the successful are rich.  Wealth isn't a zero sum game.  Their success doesn't hurt you in the slightest.  You might want it, but that's not the same thing.  Wealth tends to snowball.  It might not seem fair, but it's true.  I dunno about you, but I don't plan to languish in the lower middle class any longer than I have to.  Which is why I'm working my hide off getting an education from a prestigious school.

&gt;aw, I can't afford this Lexus. At least I can drive around anywhere and can't see the homeless due to the tinted windows.

Way to dodge the point.  We can't spend money on health care, because we just don't have any to spend.  You can't spend money you don't have.  Well, actually, you can, but then you're the entitled American middle class (badum-tish).  We cannot run our country's economy like a moron with his first credit card.  We just can't.  It destroys people, and it'll destroy nations too.

&gt;My point.

My point being, you're asking government to save you from a problem that government played a major role in creating.  

&gt;Exactly the reverse of my point. Health care, basic food, yes, a right in my opinion. Restaurant food no... America is so fucked right now that they think McDonald's is a god-given right. Can't wait for McPalin McMooserib.

There are no rights like that.  Clean water isn't a right.  Food isn't a right.  Healthcare isn't a right.  Rights are ways of defining what the government isn't allowed to do to you.  They aren't allowed to take away your life, your liberty, or your pursuit of happiness.  They aren't allowed to infringe upon your speech, or prevent you from owning firearms, or quarter troops in your house, or do anything to you outside of rigorously documented legal contexts, or any number of other things.  Rights don't say a damn thing about what the government gives you, only what they don't take away. You're expected to figure the rest out for yourself.  

&gt;Who are these people who are no longer obligated to pay? Patients? Right now, sunny boy, they go bankrupt.

Well, not all of them.  Actually, I'd say not even a majority.  I've had a fair ammount of modern medical care in my life, and I'm in decent financial condition.  You can rail against insurance companies all you want, but they've saved my ass more than once.    

The reason these costs are so high is because this shit is expensive.  All corruption and profiteering aside, it is inherently costly.  We can make it cheaper by carefully deregulating some aspects and charitably funding things, but that's about it.  If you don't expect people to pay for their own care, where do you expect to get this money from?  Who do you propose will give us the money to pay for this?

I feel very strongly that now that we have the internet, violence is no longer necessary.  We can now reach out, and organize MILLIONS of people from all over the world.  We can sympathize and connect with people of all different ages, genders, cultures, languages, there is no barrier now that cannot be crossed.

We need to bring the machine to a stop.  Look at those recent riots in Europe.  What if, instead of rioting, those people just didn't go to work for a week.  What if in stead of 20,000,000 unemployed we had 100,000,000 people who just stopped showing up to work because we're not going to help this machine along unless the people in power start listening.  What if instead of going to work for a paycheck we had a huge pot-luck to feed the hungry family down the street?

I mean in the past couple of months I've been on Reddit, I've seen all kinds of amazing things happen.  I've seen search parties formed for people presumed missing, I've seen money collected for perfect strangers, I've seen gaming consoles donated for people trying to keep their sister from realizing that she made a mistake.  Right here we have a huge community of people who want to do something, we just need to figure out what and move forward.

And I think that's the thing too, we don't need to do just anything.  I think the first step is to get more clear about *what* exactly it is we want.  An end to war?  Hunger?  AIDS?  I personally feel that with the technologies we have, the threats we face as a species, and the current political climate what we need and possibly in order functionality is 1) An end to hunger, because so long as there are people whose children die of starvation/malnutrition/inadequate drinking water there will be people willing to fight/steal/kill and people willing to take advantage of them; 2) A complete disarmament of the entire planet, I don't mean individuals getting rid of guns or even an end to say the police force, but I mean an end to war being a viable means of resolving disputes; 3) Save the environment.  Even if you don't believe that global warming is real, i don't think anyone can say that eventually the amount of plastic in the ocean, the lack of clean air in certain places (LA and SLC spring to mind), the extinction of certain species (bees anyone?) don't pose a potential problem for our survival as a species.  Also, no one seems to be dealing with the fact that eventually this planet will become uninhabitable and our only hopes of long-term (as ridiculous as it sounds, I know we're talking about millions/billions of years here) survival is to get off of this planet/out of this solar system/into deep space.

I mean really, if the ""end game"" of this planet is destruction, shouldn't our collective goal as a species be to combat that?  The further I get into this rant the more I feel like our main goal(s) should be to make life on earth as sustainable as possible so that we can live long enough to make or at least find out if deep-space travel is even possible.  

(Side note: Dude, what if we were able to develop a sort of ""noah's ark"" where you had a space ship that was pointed at what we thought was the closest thing to an Earth-like planet, and on this craft were a bunch of incubators that would create genetic clones of humans once it reached its destination.  Then also on board would be a bunch of robots/cyborgs that would be charged with caring for and raising the clones until they were mature enough to leave the ship and go out on this new planet.  That would be crazy)

Holy shit this went from ""Hey I wanna do something too!"" to ""Hey I'm fucking crazy, listen to my rant that I scream while I stand in the middle of a crowded subway and smell like old pickles!"" a lot faster than I had anticipated.

Here's a simple question: if a jewish parents have a child, that child is jewish right? What if that child rejects the religion? They still do consider themselves to part of the 'jewish' people. Obviously they are using the term as an etnicity, and not as a religion.

The nazi's didn't spare jewish people that renounced their fate or something. It wasn't about religion. They killed people that had some jewish grand-parent or relative. Because of their ethnicity, not because of their culture.

The difference between opt-in labels and born-in labels may seem minimal, but is actually very crucial. 

But that's just on the PC playing field. Let's look at reality. People are asked what their 'etnicity' is, they answer with 'black', 'white', 'hispanic' and 'asian'. I'm pretty sure, if they were asked what culture they were part of, the answers would be quite different. It seems the people filling out your census thought it was about race. Nobody filled in 'American' or 'Canadian', right?

You may be right, that because of the separation, culture really was divided over race lines. But I wonder what a new immigrant from Senegal would fill in. That person isn't part of the american ""black"" culture, is he? 

As to Europe. The term ethnicity is only used by racists. Ever. And when I look at the states, it seems to be case there as well. Perhaps you just didn't notice.

And your argument, really is the argument used by the NRA to explain why there is ""more violence In america"". ""Because of the ethnic diversity""

I'm sorry for wall of downvotes you were getting. I don't like PC-ness either. But ethnicity is the PC term for being a racist. It's the diplomatic double-speak for judging people based on their race and/or heritage.

And let's be honest, between the black and white americans, moral values tend to be the exact same. It's not like the debate about abortion, gay rights or foreign policy is split over these categories. It's not. 

That little cultural diversity that you have, shouldn't be causing more problems than any other country. The simple fact you can talk to 99,999% of all americans, including illegals by just speaking two languages. If I drive for 60 minutes, I can't understand half the people around me anymore. 

If white/black were really about culture, and not about race, does this mean that a liberal hippy from San Francisco, is claiming to be part of the same culture as a Redneck from Texas, but not of the same culture as Tiger Woods or Will Smith? You've got to be kidding me.

This isn't about culture, moral values or traditions. It's about race. At least your census is, and the common interpretation of the term 'ethnicity': something you are born with. A branding of your strain of DNA. "

**1. Accept that you are in the minority**

With acceptance comes a level of inner peace.  Being on the Internet, at college, and (especially) on Reddit likely skews your thinking into believing you are in the majority and (more importantly) that you are right in everything you believe.  You may very well be, but the majority of Americans who vote (and those you choose not to shouldn't) have spoken in multiple elections over the last 3-4 decades and consistently delivered Republican power in some form.  Stop railing and just lay back and accept the rogering.

**2. GTFO**

Related to point one, really.  Once you ACCEPT that you ARE in the minority, you may not like it and you probably won't enjoy keeping quiet about it.  You're full of righteous indignation and being the smug know it all at work or in your family probably won't adequately dissipate all that rage.  So...leave.  Pack your shit and head to Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia (though we don't like Yanks that much to be truthful), anywhere really.


**3. Can't beat them?  Join them!**

Do you like money?  Do you like happy-happy joy-joy singing on Sundays?  Do you like guns?  Do you like bow-ties and rainbow colored signs?  No?  Hmm...well you can always learn to love these things, especially if you didn't like my advice in point 2.


**4. Armed, guerilla-style resistance and acts of violence.**

Also known as *terrorism*, this technique has been popularized in rent times by Al Qaeda.  But let's not let them have a lock on this.  After all, at some point in their lives, Yasser Arafat, Osama Bin Laden, and Timothy McVeigh asked themselves *exactly* the same question you just did (substituting ""itself"" with ""my country/my people/my religion"" instead).

**5. Accept that *you* might be wrong.**

**Americans also need to know who runs Israel and the Untied States of America** *not that i actually care if they dont, but here is a few basics on how it works*

Zionism is a movement started by a number of European Jews in the 1890's who claimed Palestine as their homeland due to so called historical biblical ties. 

Out of a population of 1,000,000 people in Palestine in 1897 only 5% or 50,000 were Jewish.

Those few Jews in Palestine reacted negatively to Zionism. They neither saw the need for a Jewish state in Palestine, not did they want to exacerbate relations with the Palestinian Arabs. At this time in the Holy Land, religions lived together in relative harmony, a harmony only disrupted when the Zionists began to claim that Palestine was the rightful possession of the Jewish people to the exclusion of its Muslim and Christian inhabitants.

In 1914 the Zionists had 127,000 dues paying members world-wide and had been trying to push the Jewish people to Palestine since 1890

The didn't want to go, In world war 1 the Jews were told to go to Palestine and only 25,000 actually went.

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews and later Austrian and Czech Jews stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe.

In 1935 as a result 60,000 Jews moved into Palestine. This was not enough as the Zionists wanted millions to move there, but of course just like WW1 no one wanted to leave the green pastures of Europe to go to the desert, a final solution was created, either go to Israel as the Zionists wanted or be persecuted and exterminated by the Nazis who were funded by the Zionists Rothschild's league of bankers.

The Jews had a choice, move to Israel or get persecuted

History as written always goes to the winner and the globalists back then and the operation mockingbird MSM haven't actually told the truth about Hitler's roll in WW2 on behalf of the globalists.

We hear a lot about the Jewish holocaust but not much on the fact the Zionists funded and controlled/owned Hitler and his agenda.

http://www.savethemales.ca/hitler_was_a_godsend_for_israe.html

&gt; As soon as the Nazis assumed power in 1933, the Zionists gained a visibly protected political status. After the Reich-stag fire, the Nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. But not the Zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. Zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the Third Reich."" The Zionist uniform was the only non-Nazi uniform allowed in Germany. Same with their flag. Hebrew was mandated in Jewish schools. Still German Jews wanted to stay in Germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" But the Zionists scorned the German Jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate.

Then came the Zionist funded holocaust

The older generations can vouch for it in Germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth

After WW2 the Nazis/Zionists scientific operations were moved from Germany to the United States under operation paper-clip forming organisations like the CIA and NASA etc and America became the new foreign military corporation for the Rothschild league of bankers and the Zionists new dog.

Moving the ideology of the people since 1915.

U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947

Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States"".

Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers"".

In the Late 40'/50s after WW2 and the Nazi migration to the United States the CIA was created and under one of their most successful operations they took over the media

[Operation MOCKINGBIRD](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=operation+mockingbird&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;num=100&amp;lr=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;ft=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_rights=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;cr=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;safe=images)

&gt; The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.

The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 (guess who owns them) companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.

Whatever they say is still taken to the water cooler and made gospel globally by the many people who just don't get it.

**The Zionist Money System** Federal Reserve Systems/Commonwealth Reserve (neither federal/commonwealth or a reserve)

In the 19th century an European Royalty/Vatican/House of Rothschild pact was made pooling their resources to form a global financial system controlled by private interests

Some extremely credible resources to learn the true history of the how, who and when this came to be by Professor Carroll Quigley who was asked to act as historian for this secret group.

From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was ""the most influential course in their undergraduate careers"" and he revealed all in his books.

""I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.""

Professor Carroll Quigley

""The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole... Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world's money""

**The Two Party Punch and Judy Puppet Show Fools Democracy**

When it comes to Prime ministers or Presidents you only get to choose between two people both selected behind closed doors loyal to the agenda, anyone else who dares to stand is taken out by the Zionist controlled media while the two selected puppets get funded by the Zionist controlled financial systems and corporations

http://imgur.com/YMmZJ guess who troll guy is?, the same for all two party systems, why risk losing control of the agenda when you can own both puppets and ensure long term agendas go the way you want.

**And finally The Old Zionist Trick**

When ever any criticism is directed towards the Zionists who own the media and financial systems globally they turn any criticism of them into criticism of the good Jewish people and then hide in amongst the Jewish communities yelling out anti Semitic anti Semitic. People need to stop using the word Jews when talking about Zionists otherwise they will make you look anti-Semitic every time.

A lot of this mistrust is due to the failed german immigration policies. Take a look at Berlin, which has a big turkish populace. The predominantly turkish quarters are indeed criminal hotspots and the people there are not integrated (not to a great deal) into the larger society and instead formed a parallel society of their own.
That - wrongfully - ""marks off"" onto the larger turkish (and thus the muslim) community in Germany. Those folks are probably the minority, but are the louder part (tragically, you rather remember the turkish boy insulting you in the sub than that guy that simply passes you by in the street).

Furthermore, a real debate - about this issue - has only recently started to emerge.

Hah. The fall-back position of the right on the Israel-Palestine question. Don't worry, I've heard this all before. Any criticism of Israel is anti-semitic, therefore Israel must always be supported no matter if it is a terrorist state.

No. I don't accept your argument. Don't think you can just twist words with me. Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Jews, not criticism of Israel. They are not the same, nor will they ever be the same. As long as Israel continues to use terrorism against the peoples of Palestine, as long as it continues to seize their land and kill their children it shall be criticised: and it doesn't matter if you are Jewish, Christian, or Arab; if you support that kind of disgusting behaviour you'll be criticised along with it.

And I'm sure you'll say ""well the Palestinians are terrorists!"" or that I support Hamas or something equally silly. Peoples have a right to self-defence and a modern military versus a bunch of guys who struggle to find a few old guns is not a fair fight and I'll always come down on the side of the oppressed and weak. Israel could stop bulldozing their houses, but it won't. And if I say it should, according to you, I'm anti-semitic!

 &gt;the Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland.

Of course private negotiations works, becuase that's the only way negotiations are ever conducted. If you try a strategy 100 times it is bound to work a few times no matter how flawed it is. That doesn't mean public negotiations with the full input of the people actually affected on the ground wouldn't have worked. Besides, the Good Friday agreement isn't a complete success: The situation in NI continues to be unstable. You're just acting as an apologist for imperialism: Go to a country (without asking anyone), fuck up a country (without asking anyone), pretend in a half-assed manner to have left the country (without asking anyone) - secrecy works!

&gt;The most impressive thing about them wrt the Arab world is how much they were willing to support US policy.

Exactly, becuase they were allowed to operate in secret free from the scrutiny of their peoples - such is the hallmark of dictatorial and terroristic regimes. If someone bothered to ask the actual people being affected - Both Israeli, Palestinian and Arab - we might make some headway. As long as these regimes are allowed to be secretive, to hide from their own peoples, you get international power politics where imperialist behaviour is the norm. As long as people like you justify and act as apologists for these things then these things will continue. Leaders will always act in the interests of their ruling class, from the US to Iran, and as long as they are allowed to do this free from scrutiny, free from openness, and therefore free from democracy, the ordinary person will always lose out: Jewish, European, American or Arab.

I don't usually downvote people simply for presenting an argument, but if you're fucking stupid, ridiculous and insulting enough to call someone anti-semitic for a criticism of Israel you deserve every downvote you get. That is an absolutely disgusting thing to say and it detracts from the real anti-semitism that takes place to this day in many places."

This is especially rue of dancing, with regular classes and social dances in almost every style you can imagine.

I think the most important piece of advice I can give you about picking a style of dance is to be sure to chose one that is danced to music that makes you want to dance - but don't necessarily dismiss a style just because you aren't yet that familiar with the music.

That said, though, for me, it has to be Swing: Lindy Hop and Balboa in particular.  Although I was indifferent to the music at first (I'd mostly listened to classical music up to the time I started dancing), I now find it impossible to sit still if a swing song comes on.  Here are a few other reasons I love swing (and why you might, too):

- There's a lot going on in London.  Check out [Swing Out London](http://www.swingoutlondon.co.uk/) or [Swing Dancers of London](http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/) for a fairly complete listing of what's going on.  For classes there are many, many choices but at the moment my advice for beginners would be to see what [classes Swing Patrol might be running near you](http://swingpatrol.co.uk/class-timetable.php).

- The dances have a good combination of structure and improvisation, so there are rules and patterns you can learn to start out while there is also a huge amount of freedom just to play, too.

- Connection: it's hard to explain this to non-dancers, but a huge part of most kinds of partner dancing is the dynamic physical connection you have with the person you're dancing with.  It takes a  while to learn how to really make the connection feel great, but when it happens it's the best thing in the world.  One of the most surprising things that has happened to me while learning to dance is realising that how well I connect with someone on the dance floor can have a huge influence on how I feel about them.  There are absolutely gorgeous women that i've got along great with - only to lose all interest in after a single, underwhelming dance - and women I might never have noticed until something magic happened on the dance floor and I was left feeling like I now knew this complete stranger more deeply than I have ever known any of my non-dancing friends.

- Speaking of women: I have always had a few close female friends, but I now know quite literally hundreds of wonderful, clever, beautiful and talented women from all over the world - thanks to dancing.  Almost everyone I've dated in the past five years has been someone I've met on the dance floor - and there have been a lot more than I would ever have imagined before I started dancing.  Plus, with women generally outnumbering men at most events, being even a moderately competent dancer will make you very popular.

- The travel opportunities: the Lindy scene is global, and there are weekend dance camps and exchanges going on somewhere in Europe almost every weekend, plus amazing things like the [Herräng Dance Camp](http://www.herrang.com/), which runs for four or five weeks every summer.  I'm currently in Stockholm yet again, having spent the last week at [The Snowball](http://www.thesnowball.se/) dancing with friends I've met at previous events and making new ones.  In the last year I've also been dancing in New York, Gothenburg, Vilnius and Budapest, not to mention Newcastle, Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol.  In most of these places (and many more) I have stayed with friends I've met through dancing.  I have outstanding invitations to visit Copenhagen, Moscow, Ljubljana and Prague, amongst others.  In return, I've hosted dancers from Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Slovenia when they've come dancing in London.  It's like couch-surfing, only much better.


I'm guessing that most other social dance scenes have awesome stuff like this too, though, so even if Swing doesn't do it for you you can probably find a dance which does.  And, in the interests of full disclosure, there are a few disadvantages to Lindy in in comparison to other dances:

- It's not really easy to learn for beginners.  Not as hard as Tango, to be sure, but it's not as easy as Modern Jive or Salsa, for example.

- Although it is hugely popular (and growing), Lindy Hop is still a fairly niche dance compared to, say, ballroom, latin or tango.  This means that you can't necessarily count on finding a great dance scene in every city you might visit.

- If you do get into it, you'll find it insanely addictive - to the point that if you ever decide to leave London you'll find yourself picking amongst other places to live based on which ones have the best dancing...

- There are some weird demographic anomalies in the Lindy Hop community.  A huge proportion of the men tend to be from backgrounds in IT or engineering, while amongst the women there are a lot of teachers and nurses.  This is much less the case in London than in some other cities (Dublin, notoriously, where the first thing I was asked when I went dancing there was, ""So, do you work in IT too, then?""), but it's fair to say that the Swing scene is not very representative of the general population.  Of course, this might mean you have quite a lot in common with the people you will meet - and for me at least there's much to be said for taking dance classes from someone who thinks the same way you do.  (Also, somewhat embarrassingly for a dance that was originally created by by a predominantly black community in Harlem in the '30s, there are surprisingly few non-caucasians who dance Lindy today.)"

Divided or united, the fact remains that India was relatively prosperous.

The simple answer is yes.  It is true, India, like China, was an autarky.  For that matter, Europe was also more-or-less an autarky; however, for whatever reason Europeans had created an artificial demand for, by their very definition, unnecessary luxury products that was not nearly reciprocated to the same degree in India or China.  Why Europeans had this thirst for spices, resins, silks, and other such foreign products, while Orientals were much more complacent with their, relatively speaking, lower standards of living is anyone's guess.  It's not that Europeans didn't have products to offer—for instance, Indian Armies' modern firearms were provided by Europeans, and in a reversal of the roles of today, Britain also supplied large quantities of finished clothing to India—and in most all regards they were scientifically and technologically more advanced—the Catholic priests won their respected position in the Chinese Emperor's court due in no small part thanks to their mechanical gifts and demonstrations of more accurate astronomical models than those domestically possessed.  My personal theories are that this imbalance can be traced to differing political, social, and economic structures, and maybe even genetic predisposition.

Before briefly elaborate on these possible and theoretical explanations, let me start off by saying that I'm painting a picture with very broad strokes.  These are generalizations and stereotypes, and therefore these are far from hard and concrete rules and there are innumerable exceptions; however, I think that they contain more than a grain of truth to them and are apt given the long-term and encompassing picture I'm trying to portray.  Anyways, Orientals are often seen as being more communal in contrast to their Western neighbors' individuality; subservient in contrast to independent; despotic in contrast to democratic; et cetera.  Now, as I warned above, these are stereotypes and they often do not accurately describe the differences between West and the East, let alone at all times throughout history.  But I believe that these contrasting traits of Westerners and Easterners, no matter how imperfect descriptors they are, do have an uncanny and coincidental tendency to manifest themselves in the different norms for political, social, and economic structures.  Orientals political institutions usually concrete power more completely into the hands of one ruler, social structures are often more rigid, and economically the vast majority of the poor peasants are dependent on agriculture; all of these characteristics stunt trade because the classes become extremely stratified and any productivity beyond subsistence is often confiscated or taxed away by a ruling elite.  Obviously these supposedly unique traits of the Oriental are, historically speaking, hardly any more foreign to the West; however, a major difference is that Europe was slowly and surely undergoing a revolution that was transforming its political, social, and economic structures in line with what they are today, while on the contrary the Orientals were retrenching into their antiquated and ossified structures of yore.

Finally, genetic predisposition may not be as farfetched as it initially seems.  For example, genes coding for increased testosterone levels—which do, of course, exist—would lead to a more adventurous streak amongst its carriers.  If these genes were found in higher frequencies among Europeans, that might contribute to explaining why it was the Europeans who explored the world looking for wealth and establishing distant colonies instead of the equally viable Chinese.  This is merely hypothetical speculation and even if true would only be one of many factors that explain these tendencies, but I don't think that possible genetic influences in behavior should be  excluded in favor of only environmental influences.

&gt;religiously (and mostly culturally too, depending on how culture is defined), India was to a large extent united.

My understanding is that Hinduism is no more a uniting influence than Greco-Roman polytheism, Chinese folk religions, or the steppe nomad's shamanistic Tengrism.  By their very nature these are all examples of tolerant and fluid religions, and those traits nullify many of their potential for creating a homogeneous society.  Now that's not to say that there isn't intolerance in Indian culture and religion, most notably the caste system and all of its intricacies; however, I tend to view it as mostly a traditional social structure that was only grafted onto the current iteration of the religion of Hinduism.  In other words, its not a fundamental aspect of Hinduism, just as the niqab isn't one of Islam but instead a culturally tradition anteceding Islamism that has over time become closely associated with it.  

Another problem for Hinduism is its very esoteric, metaphoric, and interpretive nature.  This means that outside of Brahmin and other dedicated spiritualists, the vast majority of Hinduism finesse is lost on the equally vast majority of lay Indians.  And what rudiments of Hinduism they do follow correctly are often supplemented and intertwined with traditional folk beliefs.

These are at least why I tend to think of Hinduism being a poor adhesive for binding Indian's together under a common set of values and beliefs.  But given your background and superior knowledge in the subject, it seems I may need to reevaluate these opinions."

Who knows how many will get killed in the initial bombardment. They will certainly all get killed when they get overrun by infantry in tanks.

&gt;They will know that it is coming and they will bunker down. 

How do you know that? Sneak attacks are notoriously difficult to see coming. North Korea doesn't have to move anything around, which would be the only way to spot an attack coming, in order to make a full-fledge attack.

&gt; Ironic that you then say that the UN would likely not do anything, since the foundation of the UN was predicated on collective security

Not really, considering they screw up that whole angle on a regular basis. They'd get blocked by China and maybe Russia anyway. China would likely argue that South Korea instigated it. Regardless, many nations would send help without UN approval.

&gt;As for the North Korean government...

I highly doubt Kim Jong-Un is going to go soft on South Korea, especially since the events of the last year. If he doesn't maintain the same level of animosity, then he will only increase it. He can't afford to look weak by placating the South. That's why experts expect more attacks from the North in the near future.

Gun porn is talking about military hardware for the sake of talking about military hardware, because it's super cool and all that. It's *not* talking about the practical application of said hardware in a real world scenario for the purpose of determining the outcome of a war.

&gt; I'm not sure what super weapon you think that North Korea will be deploying to ""put giant holes in the runways of all of the air bases.""

Uhhhh.... cruise and ballistic missiles, of course. Also, it's possible their special forces infiltrators will be equipped to disable airports, or something. Cruise missiles and short ranged ballistic missiles are plenty capable of hitting something the size of an air field. They don't need the anti-runway bomblets either. They just need to put big holes in it. It won't take them down for more than a few weeks, but those will be some crucial weeks. Osan could easily be overrun in the time it takes to repair the runways. Or at the very least the North could take Seoul and position its artillery within range of Osan AFB.

&gt; maybe they've got an Air Force chock full of Iron Eagle motherfuckers

Doubt it, but it's possible they could make some suicidal, low-level bombing runs if their missiles don't work. Certainly their pilots have enough skill for *that*. 

&gt; And I seriously doubt that Japan has any actual concerns of being invaded by North Korea in the middle of a full frontal push into South Korea.

Yeah, but they'd certainly be worried about North Korean missiles with WMD on them. That would make the war mighty unpopular for the Japanese.

&gt;60 years of preparation is so far beyond ridiculous that I can't even fathom how layered the defenses on both sides truly are.

The problem is that artillery is mighty handy with dealing with static defenses. The DMZ is the only really heavily fortified area. There are so many people living in the Seoul area and to the south of it that solid defenses are impossible and impractical for daily life. The problem then is that if the North can break through that first line, they could have plenty of momentum to just keep pushing, blitzkrieg style. Just ask the Nazis how their ""fortress Europe"" plan turned out.

&gt; Somehow I'm thinking that North Koreans won't be getting the same courtesy.

The only guns in the country are controlled by the government. From what my Korean friend said, many government buildings have caches of weapons that would be handed out, I guess to those reporting for mobilization. That would certainly make things more difficult, but at the same time they're an *army* with tanks and armored vehicles. Civilians with guns will only be so effective. Also, the North Koreans will probably be shooting at anything that moves, so I don't think they'll be worried about their welcoming.

&gt;An army marches on its stomach

Well, estimates say they have enough food, ammo, and fuel stockpiled in their forward bases to last 4 months of solid fighting. They will also certainly be able to pillage food and fuel. They may even be able to use captured weapons and ammo. As for hitting their logistics, I think their offensive forces would be the more pressing matter. Most air power would be running support sorties. Any planes, except for the stealths, would come under considerable fire if they go near or north of the DMZ to make attacks.

&gt;even easier when the folks who have the most facts still end up having to make shit up

That is certainly the crux of the problem. 

&gt; Anyhow, I'll have to leave any further points in the ""agree to disagree"" column, but it's been a fun thought experiment.

Indeed, indeed. I'm obviously a pessimist when it comes the US military power. I've seen a bit of the Army from the inside and I know the kind of people who join the military very well and I'm not terribly impressed. Most seem to be nothing more than socio-economic conscripts, so in a big war I wouldn't want to have to rely on them. As for me, I'll likely be fighting if war breaks out in the next couple years. I live in Korea and will certainly not be evacuating with all of the other teachers.

&gt; Over the past decade, Ireland’s corporate taxation system has been a source of controversy with some of Ireland’s fellow-member states in the European Union. The French government has over the past decade, most particularly during the premiership of Lionel Jospin, consistently condemned and criticised the Irish corporation tax system. This criticism is based on the belief that the low corporation tax rates enabled Ireland to compete unfairly in attracting international investment. However, despite the French critique of the Irish corporate tax system, the Irish example has won many followers, with many ‘emerging’ and Eastern European economies following the Irish example.

I really hope Villas-Boas gets the job. He has excellent credentials and is currently unbeaten as a top-level manager (exceeding Mourinho's record at Porto). He is a young new-generation style of manager - not a former player but an educated and well-taught manager. He learnt under the best - Bobby Robson and as Mourinho's assistant for 4 years. I like his style and I like bringing in somebody young who can work with the new style of football management.

It isn't worth firing Hodgson unless we get somebody of his calibre - and we shouldn't let Hodgson go until we are assured that we can get somebody like that in the summer. 

He will be our Mourinho, and along with 4-5 signings (young European players) and a return to a good flowing, passing style of attacking football, Liverpool will be setup for the next 5-6 years.

We need that type of long-term thinking - not more short-term fixes in the hope of moving up a few places.

In the article Robert Kushen says that the situation of Roma should not be considered as an issue of the EU, but as that of the countries where Gypsies primarily live. This is wrong on two sides. The western states are responsible for the geographical distribution of the Gypsy ethnicity. That is, in the middle ages, Gypsies were driven (beaten to death if they didn't) out of western countries, and their allowed stay in eastern Europe was a kind of a compromise between eastern and western states. So to say something like Kushen said, that ""this country should be responsible for the situation of the Gypsy ethnicity, but not the EU as a whole"", forgets the historical responsibility of the west. 

The second one is that of recent history. Socialism (or communism as was called) which ended 20 years ago was a very wasteful system (corrupt too, but thats another matter), but it did provide for the poorest social classes, and provided some employment to the Gypsies. The industry in east Europe was taken over (relatively cheaply) by western multinational companies, which were not obliged to employ (the uneducated) Gypsies, they only needed educated, but still cheap labor force. The non-employment of the Gypsy population is showing its price now, which must be paid by someone.

The title of the post is somewhat misleading. The ""Right Wing"" party is the Jobbik, which is an opposition party, not the governing party. The EU presidency is held by Hungary under the Fidesz government, which a center-right party, with more leftist voters than the Hungarian Socialists.

tl;dr: Its not just sane to help the situation of Gypsies in eastern Europe by the west, but it is its historical responsibility too."

I actually know someone who used to work for the European Union in the Ivory Coast, and as a matter of fact she's still in Abidjan right now. 
I'd say the West got a little too involved, i.e. they forced the Government to hold democratic elections, knowing full well that were the Opposition to win them there wouldn't be any way whatsoever to impose the winner against the existing regime (which is in fact what's happening this very moment). I chuckled a little when this friend of ours was telling my wife over Skype this December about how a colleague of hers from the European Union delegation, who had helped organizing and imposing this election, started crying during election day when she saw people voting. She was that naive, never daring to think what will happen in either of the 2 possible scenarios at that time. 

This whole story of ""let's impose democracy to people all around the world"" reminds me of one of Marx's funny stories, about a mid-1850s English capitalist who thought that in order to establish Capitalism in Australia it would be enough to import fixed capital (tools, machines etc.) and labor-force, and to try to re-establish in Australia the same labor relations as those present in England of that time. Of course that once the imported workers first set foot in Australia, and when they saw that they could have all the land they wanted for little or no cost, they ditched the Capitalist with all his tools and they started having an independent life once again, as they ancestors back in England used to. Anyway, I'm not that good of a narrator, but the morale of the story is that you can not force history's hand.

I'm after that.  As far as these projects - they're defined as Projects by the company and the champion and the sponsor (they're not called those things here but that is pretty standard terminology so I'll use it)    There is a quality team, a release team, a validation team, a testing team, a regression team, a compliance team, etc etc.    all of those teams interact with the main project team and all of those interactions are evaluated by the release team and the validation team.

one of the things that happens is we sometimes will see a project that is NOT in fact, ""really"" a project -- so we have to change the track it is on from a financial and workflow perspective and change it into a Full Cycle Change Control (as example) or something that denotes that this is, in fact, not really a project - i.e. it doesn't alter current functionality of the platform in any way.

and yes, projects vary wildly in size.  interestingly enough however - where I am projects are confined in scope on the basis of when they intend to go-live.   i.e. ""go live"" dates are set in stone at least 1 year in advance (I'm working on the 2012 schedule right now in fact).   This forces projects in the Oracle and Siebel realms to limit their scope on the basis of their go-live.  Their scope is defined in essentially 8 week increments.

This means that when I say ""no"" to something (and I better be able to back it up!) it's not uncommon for a CIO to leave their office and try to persuade me to say ""yes"", because I may have just cost him growth, dollars, time - you name it.   Honestly, haveing sign off authority means I'm clicking little check boxes quite often for requests made - i'm checking other people's work, and i'm always trying to make sure that someone didn't attempt to ""game"" the system in some way.

The end result of what I do seeks two outcomes.  1) protect the system that already works - making sure that nothing that is introduced to said system damages production (example: If a project ""goes live"" and that introduction of the new code or module causes European Operations to go down for 1 day - that would be my fault.)   2)  insure the overall quality of the project deliverable       "

I met a girl on myspace some 5 years ago in a most random way.  I was in the States - she was a university student in Western Europe, though originally from and a citizen of our sworn ""enemy"" Iran.  Dum dum dummmm.

I was really attracted to her style and her pictures and she kinda commented on my blog every now and then - but it wasn't a big deal. Then one day we chatted on messenger and I felt something inside of me that we were meant for each other.  SO CRAZY.

One day I gave her my phone number and within minutes we were long distance chatting.  It lasted maybe 7 hours.  The next day - another 7 hour phone call.  

We started chatting on the phone for HOURS each day.  I was really feeling it for this chick.  

I can't tell you how many times I would meet a girl online only to meet in person and nothing clicked - either on her end, my end or both.  I was so scared the link between us was an online/phone thing only.  I didn't want to shell out the many hundreds of dollars to go to Europe to have it all blow up in my face.  It wasn't like she could come to the US since she had an Iranian passport.  

But I was motivated at this point in my life to say ""yes"" more to opportunity.  I booked a flight and went over to Europe to meet her.  We had a blast together and traveled together and experienced new cities and new things.  

But when I came home, it seemed clear that she wasn't feeling the relationship as much as I had hoped she would.  I guess she was scared.  I too was doubting whether something SO crazy could work, given all that was going against us that was beyond our control.  She wrote me a letter telling me, essentially, this isn't working, can't work, won't work.  It hurt but I decided to move on - hit the local dating scene and enjoy my singleness.

That lasted two weeks.  I looked at my life and saw that this girl was the best chance I had at happiness.  I asked her to be with me, long distance, to just try it for a week or something.  She agreed on a VERY limited basis.  But before too long we had been together for six months, long distance.  And I booked another flight to Europe to see her again.  I wanted to know that our relationship could work in person.

It worked.  We had a great time together.  I came back home and announced to her that I would be moving to Europe to be with her.  I told my parents about the relationship, that I was with an Iranian and that I would be moving to Europe.  Wow that didn't go over so well - let me tell ya!

But I moved to Europe and we moved in together.  It was bumpy at first at times but it ended up being a warm, wonderful relationship.  A year or so later I asked her to marry me.  A year after that we married.  And now we are together in America having an extremely happy, warm, wonderful marriage.  It's almost been two years or marriage and 4 years of living together.  

I can't believe the circumstances that led to us being together.  We were never supposed to meet.  Common sense would tell you not to drop everything and go halfway around the world to meet some internet chick.  But I was open to trying, and it led to the greatest thing in my life.  

I don't know what will happen to you pixel, or any of the others writing amazing stories in the comments.  I just wanted to say that the modern way of meeting people is quite different than any other point in history.  In my mind, it's extremely exciting that you have more chance at love than ever before.  People these days don't have to shack up with the person down the street due to lack of options.  

When you find the person, no matter where on earth they may be, I say pursue it to the fullest because love is the most important thing.  It's more important than money, and risk, and the familiarities of home.   

Good luck to all of you!"

Finally, polar warming will affect things like ocean and air currents.  While the poles are getting warmer, they are still cold relative to mid-latitudes.  As weather patterns change, it is possible that (relatively) cold arctic weather may spread further south causing local weather anomolies.

&gt;PNE chairman Maurice Lindsay has also told media United ""have suggested they would like Matty James back as well"". James, however, is at Deepdale on a season-long loan and, for now, remains at Preston.

So this suggests that the other two were always due back. This is standard practice, I think it's unfortunate timing and makes it look like we brought them back out of spite. Fergie is not in full charge of Utds youth and reserve, I doubt he had much involvement at all here. King and De Laet have both played in our first team, De Laet played in Europe for us last season, it's likely the loans expired at this time because we may need them for backup, otherwise why not put them on the same season-long loan like James? Or to look at it another way, if normal procedure was to have a half season loan then extend it, why was James not on the same half-season loan? I honestly believe it has absolutely nothing to do with Darren Ferguson being sacked. Neither of them were playing that much anyway. King had made 6 appearances, De Laet had made 5.

You can hardly compare managers to drugs cartels. They're humans with emotions, they've just seen a friend, and a fellow football coach, sacked by new owners after hardly being given a chance. It's horrible, and must be quite worrying for those in the profession as their jobs become ever more precarious and pressure filled. If I was a manager, I would speak out as well. They're not doing it because they're a ""cartel"" they're doing it because they sympathise with their peers, and with their friends. It's a natural human reaction. As for Allardyce, no, I don't agree with it, because Blackburn were playing exactly at their level and he was doing a reasonable job. In fact, midtable is perhaps even higher than they should be. By no measure should he have lost his job based on the performance of Blackburn.

And did Ferguson and Holloway ""go out of their way"" to talk about Allardyce, or were they asked?"

Which means that EU citizens can send money to each other, whatever EU country they're in, at no extra cost. And a bunch of standards and processes were introduced, so now, whatever the domestic bank account and sorting code numbering schemes of the different countries are, any EU bank account also has an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Bank Identifier Code (BIC=SWIFT). Knowing these, you can do a SEPA transaction from anywhere to anywhere in the EU with no extra fees. And if your domestic money transfers are free, then so is a SEPA transaction.

Not everybody knows about this yet, but you can cut out the middle men and do EU-wide international money transfers without credit cards or paypal or Western Union, or any other shenanigans.

Another because she's my BF. The thing with them is that they both will insist on paying me. That I do appreciate.

Everyone else pays. If they b*tch about it I tell them to call best buy or the local computer place. I bill for everything. When they pay they get value. I will give advice for free if it comes via an email and it's too time consuming (most of the time they can google for the answer).

This summer my neighbors called with a pc problem. Laptop died. I looked at it, HD went south. They asked me how long to fix.  I said a couple of hours to do the reinstall, run updates, etc. ""Does that include recovery?"" No, I said - that could take anywhere from minutes to hours depending on if the HD was totally dead or just corrupt. They said ""ok, go for it.' I said ""it's 40/hr"". That shut them up - they thought because we were neighbors it was free and said such. ""But we thought you liked doing this stuff"". I do - when I can charge for it. They left, haven't talked to me since. The other half asked me about it, she said they were offended. ""Maybe you can barter, they're low on money"".

It sells a Hollywood version of American culture that never actually existed. It runs along the following lines:

We're a rugged people who came from Europe with little more than our Christian ideals and a dream. We rely on ourselves. If we need to hunt for food or defend ourselves, we reach for our guns. 

We believe in god and traditional families.

We distrust government, particularly when it wants to take our money so that it can provide for others things they should be able to get for themselves. 

We distrust outsiders and prefer not to interfere in their affairs. However, when they threaten us, our right to defend ourselves supersedes other obligations. Our only obligation is to ourselves!

We believe that when others come to our country, they should speak our language and try to become more like us. If they do not, we are at risk of losing the traditional American culture this nation was built on. Our ancestors came here legally, learned the language and adapted. People who come here illegally should be punished and sent back.

We are plainspoken and prefer common sense to scientific mumbo-jumbo.

We believe the government should limit its size and function, and run its financial affairs the way a responsible person runs a household budget: paying as you go, avoiding lavish spending and never relying on credit.

This is an image perpetuated by the GOP and certain moneyed interests of society. The GOP relies on the appeal of certain elements of this image -- God, family and guns, for example -- to cloud the fact that it is woefully inept at delivering on other parts of the bargain: notably the fiscal conservatism and interference in international affairs."

Other healthier products are forced to use sugar just to compete. People will consistently buy the sugared product, even if they don't think they can taste the sugar (or know it's in there), because it ""Just seems to taste a little better"" than the non-sugared product. 

I get really tired of sugar sometimes, but it's impossible to avoid entirely.  
 See the history of corn flakes to get a general idea. I really like non-American dishes though. For an American, I actually have quite a mild pallet, probably closer to something a European would have. This is mostly due to the fact that I didn't have really any sugar until I was about 6 years old. My parents were on that ""Fit For Life"" thing that banned most sugars.

Harding is at the top of the list of presidents who have been categorized as black. This line of thought goes back to the obsession that many 19th and early 20th century Americans had with ""blood lines"" during what is a time when the ""one drop rule"" was used to define race. Segregationists and Social Darwinists found it important to be able to define race and so argued that any person with a black ancestor was black. In today's world, overt racism is frowned upon in the public sphere, people can self-select from a range of ethnicities and races on the census, and intellectuals discuss race as a social construction. Current discussions of ""post-racialism"" are a near inversion of the understanding of race that prevailed a century ago. Obama's responses to racially charged issues have been measured and stand in a clear contrast to the role that race played in Harding's campaign for the presidency in 1920.

The issue of race was injected into the 1920 presidential campaign as part of an effort to sink the campaign of Harding, the Republican nominee. William Estabrook Chancellor, a professor at the College of Wooster, attempted to destroy Harding's candidacy by charging that he was a ""hybrid,"" an ""octoroon"" descended from ""Negro"" ancestors. Chancellor was a devoted scientific racist. He was also an avid Democrat who worshipped outgoing president Woodrow Wilson. In short, Chancellor argued that Harding's supposed mixed racial ancestry disqualified him for the presidency. He believed that the American public would agree with him, warning Americans that electing Harding could endanger white supremacy.

What did Chancellor offer as evidence of Harding's ancestry? Chancellor found people in central and northern Ohio who were willing to testify that members of the Harding family were black. They offered a variety of stories with little consistency and no hard evidence; indeed, Chancellor and many of those he interviewed dealt in the worst stereotypes of black promiscuity or vague descriptions of physical appearance. Perhaps the only thing more confusing and inconclusive than Chancellor's evidence was the genealogy that the Republicans created to counter Chancellor's charges in an attempt to document Harding's ""blue-eyed stock."" Rather famously, Harding refused to comment on the ""scandal,"" privately noting that for all he knew one of his ancestors might have ""jumped the fence."""

Finally, the Haitians were able to elect their own president. But when the US saw that this new Haitian president was interested in empowering the Haitian poor and was not subservient to rich Haitians and American corporations, the US engineered a coup d'etat and overthrew him.

But he was so popular Haiti couldn't be effectively ruled, so the US under Clinton agreed to allow him to run for president and win another election, thus letting him back into power but with many strings attached. But even then, that wasn't enough; under Bush the US forced the democratically-elected president out of Haiti under gunpoint and flew him out on a US Air Force jet.

E.g. it was purposefully non-enforceable propaganda meant far more as a puff piece to justify the war for the North than anything else.
At the time, the United States had suffered defeat after defeat and, at one point, if Robert E. Lee had pressed his army just a few more miles into Washington, D.C., we wouldn't even have a United States any more.

On his deathbed, he had seen how things turned out and how Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had
eviscerated the Constitution

1. turned the United States away from the Public Trust it had been (with the Preamble of the Constitution serving as the Trustee Agreement) into a monolithic for-profit corporation,
2. how they had forceably unified under the tyranny of gun- and bayonet-point thirty-three sovereign countries with as much or more rights than Germany, France, and other EU countries today into one monolithic federal apparatus, at the cost of millions of lives
3. after they had subjected all 10 states of the former Confederated States of America to fourteen years of harsh military martial rule over every aspect of society from voting, to who was in office, to basic economic decisions and even the sacking of entire state governments on the Whim of the Executive and military
4. after only ending the military juntas once each state was forced to declare fealty to their oppressors and agree to state constitutions written by their Northern aggressors meant to make illegal their sovereign right to dissolve from supposedly voluntary union as well as disadvantage them economically.

After all of that, he said that not sacking DC was the greatest regret of his life. He said that he didn't want any more blood on his hands and that he honestly thought that by getting so close the North would be broken at heart and that peace could be had.

He said the empty Emancipation Proclamation had galvanized the idiotic, uninformed and blindly patriotic of the North, while Lincoln and Johnson simultaneously sacked entire governments (like the entire state government of Maryland, the entire city government of New York City (when they both tried to secede -- NYC wanted to become the first non-tax, non-tariff city in the entire world... think of what would have happened if they did! How much progress!), and shut down literally hundreds, if not thousands, of newspapers and churches (usually sending the speakers/writers to PRISON) for daring to point out the truth of the Proclamation or the War Crimes of the Northern Aggression.

What you learn in school is not the truth. What you need to do is research it yourself and -- even better -- go to some ex-CSA state and actually listen with open ears to the old people who still remember the true histories passed down by mouth, since for literally decades writing it down would get you imprisoned, at best.

I honestly think this post needs to be submitted to reddit itself. People really should know this stuff, especially Europeans!!

CAN""T YOU SEE THE EU IS REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKES WE, IN AMERICA, WERE **FORCED AT GUNPOINT AnD THE DEATHS OF MILLIONS** TO ACCEPT?! STOP IT NOW! DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!

By the way. The Confederate States of America had the best generals of the era on their side, esp. the famous French ones. Combined with the fact that the vast majority of the war involved the U.S. wantonly invading the CSA territories and the CSA's home-field advantage along with guerilla tactics, the only way the war was resolved in the U.S.' favor was by General Grant obeying Lincoln's express wishes.

The wishes of Lincoln were so egregious that the top U.S. general at the time refused to cooperate and was summarily sacked by Lincoln and replaced by Grant. Grant and Sheridan enthusiastically executed Lincoln's express and in writing desire to ""utterly destroy the South"" and proceeded to be the first generals in the pre-modern era to initiate the doctrine called Total War:

They would burn everything, kill male over the age of 13, rape the women, even young girls, while taking all able-bodied young males (under the age of 14) as slaves, while systematically burning and destroying everything. They would go into homes, destroy all property, evertyhing. They would go into the Black Ghettos, burn down the huts, rape the women, and generally totally screw them over. They showed no mercy on any one. Entire cities were lost. Vast portions of the south during Sheridan's so-called ""March to the Sea"" were utterly desolate to the point that grass would not grow for several years, and millions of people were made refugees, with virtually all of the men dead, with a nearly complete genocide of men aged 60 and above.

Just 8 years later, these same fucking generals waged another war. The American Indian War. And we should all know how that turned out!! Only that time, instead of just raping the women and young girls, they killed them afterwards!

* If you want to know why America invades so many countries.
* If you want to know when we started falling so far from the principles of the founders.
* If you want to know why we have such a collective bloodlust.

Look no further than the Lincoln and Johnson administrations.

It's not even about having a bullshit degree. I have a B.Sc from the #26 university in the WORLD and am native in english and spanish. Certifications in highly specialized enterprise software that pays very highly everywhere else. I'm half spanish and after a stint in Canada as a Project Manager I decided to switch careers. Got a job in Madrid and took it simply because of how difficult it is to get the first job in my type of consulting (think, Oracle, SAP, etc). I had to take more than a 25% paycut to move to Spain. Never got a raise, had to live with my parents, could not afford a car or rent. Tried renting once but it was about half my take home pay (about 1300 euros). This is considered good pay in Spain sadly.

After 2 years, the projects started to dry up and the work experience was not relevant to my career anymore. Many of my coworkers were laid off. I interviewed for other jobs with the big 4 consulting firms and when I asked for 30k euros I often was laughed at. Told that a 27 year old would not make that for at least another 10 years and that the sun in Spain was somehow worth the pay. (That's about $35000 USD).  I saw the contracts and knew exactly how much was being made from my labor (approximately 110K euros a year).

I routinely see jobs in my area advertised with salaries of 18-24k euros a year. My line of work in the US typically gets you about $120k for a noob and over 200K for an expert consultant.

Needless to say, this past summer I quit my job, returned to America and multiplied my income by about 700%. I've even started to get more job calls from Spain because English is in demand from multinationals. Unfortunately, the rates they keep offering are a joke.

Imagine then, if you're only qualified for a regular job that typically pays 40-80K in the States, Canada, or the UK, in Spain you'll be lucky to get half.

As for moving around Europe, I've seen many friend attempt to go to the UK and elsewhere. Unfortunately, Spain's population is not like Portugal or Holland where most people have learned to speak English as well as an American (sometimes they sound more american than I do!). I've seen them go to London and back within just weeks after realizing that they only thing they can do is clean hotels or work at restaurants. 

This isn't just a problem of jobs not paying enough and living costs being too high. This is a problem with huge socio-economic ramifications. Unlike in the states, almost no one in Spain can afford to have a baby, sometimes in their life (decrease of population), unable to afford to buy a house or even rent (home buying is one of the biggest economic drivers, you're talking about 10K per room when a family buys a home and furnishes it, trickle down economics  motherfucka). This all leads to a decrease in tax revenue, an increase for southern american immigration, further driving down wages, and a recipe for disaster.

The EU doesn't help matters either. Now in Spain home prices are still averaging 200K-300K euros. Mostly driven by speculation but aided greatly by an incredible influx of wealthier Brits and Germans buying up summer homes. The average spanish wage is 21K, while in Germany it is 40K!.

One of my favorites quotes is from Warren Buffet. “I’ve worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of others on a battlefield with a medal, rewards a great teacher with thank-you notes from parents, but rewards those who can detect the mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions. In short, fate’s distribution of long straws is wildly capricious.”  Finance feels so fake to me, I just push numbers arround and when I am done pushing, the numbers usually end up larger than what I started with.  I don't make anything, I don't discover anything, I just push numbers arround.  Yet so many people I work with get such a large feeling of accomplishment from their work, they love the market, they live for the market, I just fell into it and really just want out.  I have a five year plan, my firm will pay for my school, they prefer it be something work related but there isn't much oversight.  After I am fully vested and have a nice retirment saved away I hope to go teach highschool or college, thats the plan anyway, I really hope this job doesnt suck the life out of me over the next five years.

You built that straw man out of my list of past accomplishments of the labor movement. I stated labor laws would be eroded, plan and simple. And they will.

So you do think that Congress will repeal laws that mandate a 40 hour work week, prevent child labor, require children to go to school, provide maternity leave, require certain levels of safety in the workplace, or any of the other laws in place to regulate workplace conditions if unions were gone tomorrow, or do you think things would remain the same?

&gt; My turn. Yah sure. You are an island. Labor laws affecting those working for others have no effect on you, directly or indirectly. Or a current or future spouse. Or current or future children. Or family and friends. Fuck them - I got mine. How truly American.

Insults don't make a successful argument.  If every employer in the US is only offering labor conditions that I don't consider suitable, I won't work for any of them.  I wouldn't expect anyone else to work in those conditions either.

&gt; Can you read a graph? Just grabbed the top 3. Meanwhile Iowa or New Hampshire beg to differ - drastically. On top of that, correlation does not mean causation.

So does unionization have a positive impact on employment rates, or does it not?  Based on the information I provided, at best it doesn't help.  You picked the two states out of the 10 with the lowest unemployment rate that have higher than average unionization, but they are just above the average, and all of the others are quite a bit lower.  You're welcome to provide any evidence that unionization improves employment rates.

&gt;I never claimed they were identical, but if you have some insight into how any differences actually affect this discussion - feel free. I was stressing the importance of organized labor influence on progressive labor laws.

If American unions were more like European ones, I'd be much more interested in joining one.  I am not against all forms of organization.

&gt;In the middle of an economic crisis they are prime example of extreme stability and modest growth - look at the middle of the graph. Look at the drop in the US. Even then, I never claimed labor hurt or helped the economy - you did. But undoubtedly the Germans are doing something right economically, whether it originated with labor or not.

If labor didn't hurt or help the economy, why did you bring it up as an example of the success of labor organizations and mention their strong economy?  Also, look at how much better the American economy was doing before and after the recession.

&gt;Completely wrong. That sight crashed FF, but 20 percent is ridiculous. The just the DGB sports 25 percent of the population. There is a long list of other unions.

I found it using FF, so I don't know why it would have crashed your browser.  It is an abstract from a study from 2006 and states that only 20% of German workers belong to a union.  Here is the text of the abstract:

This paper traces the profound decline in German unionism over the course of the last three decades. Today just one in five workers is a union member, and it is now moot whether this degree of penetration is consistent with a corporatist model built on encompassing unions. The decline in union membership and density is attributable to external forces that have confronted unions in many countries (such as globalization and compositional changes in the workforce) and to some specifically German considerations (such as the transition process in post-communist Eastern Germany) and sustained intervals of classic insider behavior on the part of German unions. The 'correctives' have included mergers between unions, decentralization, and wages that are more responsive to unemployment. At issue is the success of these innovations. For instance, the trend toward decentralization in collective bargaining hinges in part on the health of that other pillar of the dual system of industrial relations, the works council. But works council coverage has also declined, leading some observers to equate decentralization with deregulation. While this conclusion is likely too radical, German unions are at the cross roads. It is argued here that if they fail to define what they stand for, are unable to increase their presence at the workplace, and continue to lack convincing strategies to deal with contemporary economic and political trends working against them, then their decline may become a rout.

It was one example of how no religion is immune to fanaticism.  I don't know if bringing up the crusades actually helps your point.  If anything it shows via history that Christianity is pretty susceptible to fundamentalism just as Islam or any religion for that matter is.

This is my quick guide of creating a private server. I don't think I works directly over the Internet, it's more like a ""virtual LAN over the Internet"" one.  
Install the free app [Hamachi](https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi2/) and tell your friends to install it too. Create a network in Hamachi and tell your friends to join it.

Now, depending on your OS you have to make a change in the Windows control panel, in order to make the Minecraft server use the Hamachi IP for accepting connections. This may be an important step, no matter how you are trying to create the server.

WinXP: Network Connections -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; In the ""Connections"" area move entry called ""Hamachi"" to the top position.

Win7 (from memory): Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Manage Network Connections -&gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Settings. Under the Adapters and Bindings tab, move Hamachi to the top of the list.

Now that that's done, download [MCAdmin](http://www.mcadmin.eu/Main_Page#Download_Latest_Version_of_MCAdmin) and use that to manage your server. It does almost everything I need from a MC server. 

The IP your friends need to enter in order to join your server is the IP that Hamachi gives to the network you created.

That is great, and in fact many advanced meditators, practicioners of Vipassana and Zen, and other living ""spiritual"" teachers who have ""realized"" what self is; would agree.

The problem though is the vocabulary that is used and what definitions we attach to these words. The author seems to equate ""self"" with ""consciousness"", but in many spiritual practices whose goal is to attain ""self realization"", consiousness is actually not of the mind. What is it in a spiritual seeker, that ""realizes"" the nature of self? If there is no separate consciousness than what does it mean for self to realize self? What is left after the experience?

In my experience/research, ""Self"" is a construct of the mind (this agrees with the article above, more or less): it's all our past experiences, emotional attachments, and belief systems. To realize that all we identify with is the place where we were born, the culture we grew in, the name we were given, the things that our parents implanted in our brains at a young age, etc. That we are not ""American"" or ""European"", ""religious"" or ""atheist"", ""Apple"" or ""PC""...

If Europe manages to get through its current economic troubles relatively unscathed, further European integration within the next few decades is fairly likely. Moreover, further expansion of Europe isn't exactly unlikely either, with negotiations between Europe and Turkey still going on, Morocco having repeatedly stated its desire to join the EU, and a majority of Israeli citizens wishing to join the EU.

If China were to assert itself more strongly on the world stage, this could prove to supply Europe with a strong motivation to pursue both greater integration and further enlargement.

The current economic problems are directly traceable to fractional reserve banking and the issuance of too much shill debt (that is debt that will never be paid back).

How much of that debt was created by illegal immigrants living in the US?  who knows... nobody seems willing or able to do those numbers.  The reality of no-doc loans was that even dead people were issued debt, so, without a doubt, illegal immigrants are a component of fLyingNINJNA shill debt issue.

Here's the funny thing about fractional reserve banking:  while it creates money at the rate of +9 to 1, when debt becomes shill, it also destroys money at the rate of 9 to 1... and it doesn't take much shill debt to completely negate a decade's worth of wealth creation (the current crisis was precipitated by sub-prime loan failures rising from 3%-5% to 10%-15%).  Were 15% of no-doc loans made to illegal immigrants?  Nobody is willing to answer this question.  What percentage of the sub-prime loan failures are directly attributable to illegal immigrants?  Again, nobody wants to look under that rock.

Just to let you know what illegal immigrants actually think of America, let me relate a little story.  I had a friend who lived in the USA illegally (over stayed his student visa by about 10 years).  His peer group consisted primarily of other illegal immigrants.  He indicated that they spent a fair amount of time figuring out ways around the system.  One of the more favourite short circuits involves assuming identities, running up large student loans and then taking the sheepskin back to their country of origin.  Some of his peer group now reside in Europe with an Euro Zone passports/jobs and American degrees and zero student loan debt (and fair number non-hacking high school diplomaed American idiots now have to explain how they couldn't even get into the college they supposedly graduated from).... so, this phenomenon isn't just limited to housing and it's certainly not exclusive to illegal immigrants from South/Central America.

That $40k-$60k worth of debt they made probably ended up creating at least another $250k worth of money... wealth that will need to be destoryed over the next couple of decades.  American wealth... your future.  How many people studied at your school were from abroad?  A certain significant percentage of that population was and is busy creating shill debt."

If you're going to do this shit, why stop at caning? Why stop at the electric chair? Stoning, burning alive, eye gouging, amputation, and even genocide should be considered valid tools if you think corporal or capital punishment is acceptable.

Can I ask what you mean by this?  I'm of the opinion that the EU is going exactly where it needs to go - that the current economic power of the EU is the result of decades of work ironing out the bureaucratic kinks and procedural steps that are necessary to standardize an area for trade while leaving most other things alone.

This may seem stupid, but last month the health and safety guy at the company i work for called a meeting.  At the meeting, he showed us some stickers that go on some of the products that the company produces - standard ""hazardous"" stickers that let people know not to dispose of something in a fire or to dump it in a lake.  He then outlined the new stickers that we would be using in 2015, and how these would be phased in across the EU over the next 5 years.

While he was saying this, I was thinking of how thousands of other health and safety guys were probably giving the same speech sometime that month in the Netherlands, and how across the EU there would literally be millions of people at hundreds of thousands of companies involved in making this little change in the appearance of hazard stickers.

The end result of this change will be that a supplier in Romania can sell raw material X to a manufacturer in Denmark, and everyone in that Danish factory will immediately know that the raw material conforms to safety standards Y and Z.  Whatever language barrier might exist is rendered obsolete by standard labeling practices across the entire EU.  Might seem small, but this is going to save both lives and untold hours of wasted time over the years.

There's been an insane amount of work and money poured into standardizing EU infrastructure over the last 40 years, from making sure railway cars and tracks are all the same gauge to stuff like standardizing stickers and labels.  This lowers barriers to commerce, encourages trade, encourages peace.

Where does the EU need to go?  Why should power be any more concentrated than it currently is?"

I think its how much of that populace of the race you find attractive which is the real question. Like whether the majority of Asian girls are found to be more attractive by people not of their race than lets say the majority of black girls. There are certainly some very homely looking Asian girls out there, I certainly think so, not all Asians are beautiful and that goes for all races as well. 

As a white bisexual 20 year old male I find a variety of races to be attractive, some more than others and individuals within those races to be more attractive than the rest of their entire race. When it comes to gay relations i almost exclusively only find white males attractive but when it comes to hetero relations I find that certain Asian girls achieve a higher level of attractiveness than most white girls but that I find a larger majority of white girls at any do-able level of attractiveness than that I find attractive in the entire Asian populace. Also I think Asians age more gracefully so when I came to these conclusions I was only counting people of my own age FYI.

I'm sorry my answer is so long and poorly written, its just that the question you asked could be much in depth than just ""are you attracted to this race? Why?"" 

Also you seem to think Asians have an open mind when it comes to being with a person of another race, I have always had the opposite idea of that, perhaps you were only speaking of people of Asian Descent who were raised in America or Europe where the answer to you're question is that they were raised with a racial concept of beauty that most Asian men have trouble naturally filling out to. Its no secret that Asian men are depicted as being more effeminate than men of other races in western culture, its a sad fact and an image that men of the Asian race will have quite the difficult time breaking.

You misunderstand science and academia.  Most of these people would still be employed, studying climate, or physics, or atmospheric processes, or ocean processes, regardless of whether or not AGW existed.  Most scientists have relatively little to gain from AGW.  There is always something else to study and learn about and AGW is not the magic conspiracy generator that you think it is.

On the other hand, there is a very small group of people making huge amounts of profits from the status quo in the energy industry, and they have a very clear vested interest in avoiding carbon reduction measures.  The conspiracy theories cut both ways.

But back to actual science and facts.

&gt; If C02 is causing the earth to warm, and the explosive growth in China and India has certainly released more an more C02 in to the atmosphere over the last two decades, should not the rise in temperature be linear and consistent? And the solar minimums do not explain the last ten years of temperature data.

Even considering asian growth, the human CO2 contribution is on a steady increase.  You underestimate how much CO2 western countries have been emitting for the last 100 years.  Yes, China and India are changing the fastest, but they are just now catching up to the output of Europe and the US.

The solar cycle does not explain the entirety of global temperature averages.  Climate is forced by many things, with interactions between them.  Solar cycles, volcanic activity, ocean cycles, orbital changes.  All these things are factored in by the various climate models.  However, the extreme solar minimum of the last 10 years has undoubtably had an effect.

Over long time scales the models work and only by factoring in the additional driving force of CO2 is the actual, measured data accurately matched.

&gt; Further that big heat sink we call Oceans should be warming as it is much more difficult to cool, but again, no evidence at all.

Are you sure there is [no](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7198/full/nature07080.html) [evidence](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/pdf/nature09043.pdf) [at](http://www.springerlink.com/content/3384683251573275/) [all](http://icoads.noaa.gov/climar3/c3oral-pdfs/S5O2-Levitus.pdf)?

&gt; I repeat, and you did not address this: None of the existing climate models has allowed for the last two winters. The models thus do not work.

And I'll repeat my point: there are no models that explain the last 40 years *better* than those than include CO2 forcing.  If somebody could produce a *better* model of the last 40 years that did not require the CO2 forcing, the whole climate science world would sit up and take notice, but as of yet, nobody has.

Ergo, the existing models *are the best models we have*.  And they unambiguously tell us the planet is warming, CO2 is a major driving force, and human activity is adding just enough to the natural CO2 cycle to cause the influense of CO2 on climate to increase."

Doesn't anger me, but annoys me.  I'm American, have lived here my whole life in three very different parts of the country, and have traveled widely here, as well as in Canada, Japan, and a few places in northwest Europe.

It goes without saying that I am my own person, but at the same time, who I am was vastly influenced by where I grew up - the cultural, social, and political norms of this country.  I absolutely do not agree with everything the government does.  I consider myself a socialist, in fact.  There are very few wars that I support, and even in justifiable wars (of which Afghanistan is probably the only one that comes close since Korea), one has to be extremely vigilant in preventing abuse (as we've seen in Afghanistan, which is really not justifiable given the way it's been conducted).

But a nation is not defined by its borders.  It's defined by its people.  I don't have to support the way this country treated Native Americans, or the way we stole most of the southwest from Mexico, to love the people of this nation.  And I do love the people of this nation.  I don't love the government - sometimes I support elements of it, sometimes I don't, and I certainly never totally trust it.  The fact that I love my own people does not mean that I hate other people.  I think that every nation and every people (however defined) has a right to self-determination; I would argue that the U.S. government sometimes has facilitated that goal and sometimes contradicted it.  But again, a nation is not the government.

I think if you looked at the premise of your post, you'd realize that you're guilty of the same thing you're accusing others of - setting up ""American"" as something unique and special.  The idea that Americans are the only ones who act irresponsibly is frankly just ridiculous.  If you've traveled widely, I'm sure you know this.  If you've studied history, you definitely should know this.  The way that the world political order is set up right now, that is to say, with the U.S. far and away the most powerful country (for a wide variety of reasons), any action the U.S. takes has a disproportionate affect on international affairs, both in actuality and in the imagination.  But wars are started all over the world for all kinds of ridiculous reasons.  That has always been true.  Chances are, that will be true for a while.  That is, in fact, a human thing.  If you have a problem with war, I think you ought to reassess exactly how proud you are to be a human being.  Humans are the subject of suffering, obviously, but they are almost always the source as well.

I mean, look at it this way.  If you have this much of a problem with this many individuals confined to an area that is about 6.5% of the world's total landmass and 5% of the world's total population, do you seriously think that you are going to be lovey-dovey with everyone outside that area?  There are douchebags no matter where you go.

TBD is team base defence where you protect your base against bomb attacks.  I've played all three, enjoyed all three, but I generally did at different times.

Lvl 60+
- I'd recommend trying the ball servers (Ball normal, Ball bouncy) and chilling there, or football (but this is fun without helping you climb up the skill ceiling that much).  Most new players enjoy ball so thats why I recommend starting there.
- If Ball is not your cup of tea, try TBD (Official #3 Official #1, TBD Bouncy).  Your lives are ore valuable, its more strategic in terms of positioning, and a lot of ball players eventually branch out and come to enjoy TBD.  It's harder at the start because TBD players kill a lot better then ball players so it may be a bit frustrating.

Advoid: Ball Dojo, Ladder, APL - These are the servers with competitive matches and higher skilled players (except Dojo, which is just higher skilled in a more relaxed setting).  Go there after you start winning a lot in regular games and want tougher competition and/or competitive play.  Usually, people from these servers will be around in the other servers form time to time and will talk to you if they think you can come in and play at a reasonable level.  Though if you are dominating regular public games feel free to give it a try

Warning:  Competitive players can be a bit rough on new players.  However, if you are articulate/actually type they will be willing to Shepard you and help you out.  I wouldn't recommend playing in competitive servers until you start dominating the pubbies, read a guide or two (there is a how to ladder guide) and watching a game or two of competitive play (it plays different a decent amount of the time).  Except for Dojo, dojo is more relaxed as it's not ranked (or captains/picked games).

Having said all that, I still enjoy the game at 1500 hours, and am a far way from actually being at the skill ceiling for the planes I play.  There is an active American and European Community (and a few asians), so something for everyone.

TL:DR Sucked 1500 hours out of my life, good fun

&gt; But I have always been of the opinion that when a text states something, unless it's quite obviously metaphor, then it should be interpreted literally. I'm a dick like that when it comes to holy text, because for hundreds of years people have used some of the crap in those books to justify their bigotry etc.

You're entitled to interpret however you want. Muslims (Sunnis at least) tend to follow the interpretation of Muhammad and his closest companions (who became the first four Caliphs). 

The Qur'an was also revealed over a period of 23 years. So they have as their interpretation, the historical context, Muhammad's sayings, his behavior, and how he enacted every verse into practice. It's almost like a living book (one of Muhammad's wives described him as a walking Qur'an).

It's also been touted from the very beginning to have layers of meanings. If you read through the commentaries, you'll see that. They explain everything they can, from the apparent, to the esoteric and everything inbetween. 

The tradition of preserving this massive amount of knowledge that was literally a way of life is what spurred on the Muslims' development of ""the sciences""... the first of which was the legal and political sciences (fiqh). As the first two generations of Muslims started dying off, the sciences of hadith developed (basically, the science of history). They took their oral tradition of narrating from Muhammad and the first Muslims and compiled it into books with famous scholars devoting entire lifetimes to collecting narrations and sifting through them and classifying them by their veracity. Along side this were economic developments and also military (technological) developments.

There were several principles that were necessary to achieve this.

Honesty. They really believed in their religion, the ones leading the charge in the fields of knowledge anyhow. 

The need to know the truth. They also realized they had to be uncompromising if they were to preserve the essence of their way of life, it was an existential issue.

Meanwhile, the Arabs had been catching up on the works of the Greeks. Theology was coming into its own through fiery debate.

All of this eventually coalesced... the universities, the degrees from the legal sciences, the process of peer review and criticism from the hadith sciences, the needs of governing an expanding state, health/economic/social/military, and of course the injunctions of the religion itself which implored man to seek knowledge wherever they could find it (Muhammad said to seek knowledge even if they had to travel as far as China, they went to Greece instead, although they had plenty of contact with the Chinese and Indians and it was invaluable), as well as the religion's moral imperative to be absolutely honest in the search for truth and accepting the will of God. Richard Feynman delivered [a lecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science) about the need for integrity and utter honesty... an ingredient without which science isn't possible. In this environment the first instances of modern scientific methodology developed among Muslim scientists.

Inspired by their faith, the Muslim world [exploded with geniuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_been_called_%22polymaths%22).

The state of the region (or of the world, even) before Islam and after Islam is clear and a matter of historical record. You can look at it or pretend not to.

If you cut out the way the Muslims interpret the Qur'an, then you kick out the foundation for all of this that later developed. You might be able to see now why Muslims treasure and preserve their religion so much, it's what started *everything*.

Knowledge in Islam was treated almost as sacred (or at least the pursuit and preservation thereof).

You know who else preferred literalist interpretations of the Qur'an? Terrorists. This phenomena developed during the European colonial period. In an effort to undermine the ability of their most hardened political opposition (Islamic scholars/clerics) and make them incapable of fomenting resistance, they spread their ideology of the un-sacredness of knowledge to the Muslim world. As the new ruling elite, they encouraged people to question the knowledgeable Muslims on everything, because now real knowledge rested with the Europeans. The philosophy boils down to this... ""books? what's the big deal about books. anyone can write a book, here... we'll show you and you can write plenty of your own books too!"" nevermind that the books would be filled with utter crap (when was the last time you stepped into a Barnes &amp; Nobles, or Borders, or Chapters to be greeted with a stand displaying Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity's latest book... garbage, utter garbage). The West didn't believe in *knowledge*, they believed in *information*. And with that comes *mis*information and an overload of information (plenty of it useless). This started hundreds of years ago and continues today.

So self-made scholars who didn't know jack shit about *anything* of the Islamic sciences (fiqh, hadith, tafsir, even the art/science of spirituality) started popping up everywhere. An [ex-freemason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abduh) actually founded the Salafi movement, by convincing people they needed to interpret the Qur'an and Hadith literally for themselves in order to emulate the very first Muslims and ignore *everything* that came inbetween. Virtually all Islamic terrorists are from this sect today, which comprises probably 1% or less of the world's Muslims (over 90% still ascribe to Sunni theology, although are straying from it with regards to Islamic law and Islamic politics).

Btw, Abduh's Wikipedia article has been heavily edited by modern day Salafis seeking to cut all ties with their dubious founder. He was actually a sorry excuse for a mason. Last people heard, he had been booted from his lodge because he didn't even believe in a Supreme Creator. /facepalm

He coined the term ""Salafi"" from the Arabic word ""salaf"". And I should mention again, the heavy editing of Wikipedia is absolutely remarkable. The reason that Salafis today wound up being so different from their founders?

Another person popped up in Arabia. Infected by the Western message of ""anyone who can write a book *should* write a book... if you want to be a scholar, you're a scholar!"", Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab from Arabia tried to cleanse the peninsula and Islam itself of what he saw as harmful outside influences (from other Eastern faiths). He was actually nowhere near as extreme as Wahhabis are today, it just developed from the fact such interpretations of Islam are not anchored to anything and can become wildly unpredictable depending on the political climate.

Nowadays, Wahhabism is considered a sect of Salafism. That's what happened. The two movements shared a foundation (the logic that they could ignore the tradition and precedent of over 1200 years of Sunni scholarship and academic work and make up religion as they see fit by interpreting only the superficial layer of meaning literally from the Qur'an and some Hadith).

I mentioned universities and degrees a while earlier. Here's the entire issue of the last 200 years of Islamic history boiled down into one word. [Ijazah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijazah). This article has been a hotbed of debate and editing wars. Offended Westerners heavily edited the original rendition trying to sever any ties between European institutions of learning and the original models.

Want some proof?

Look at this article,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation

Look at the first one in the list.

Then, look at this,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Al-Karaouine (Established: 859 AD)

&gt; The Al Karaouine institution is considered by the Guinness book the oldest continuously operating academic degree-granting university in the world.[2]

Also, the last line of the Ijazah article is crap. The basic status of alim (which goes back to the first generations of Muslims... the plural of alim is 'ulema... scholars) is equivalent to a Bachelor's. In fact, the modern course to become one is... 4 years. Then there's the graduate program, another 4 years (what a coincidence... though it used to take longer especially when outside of a dedicated institution). Then there's the postgraduate... in order to become a *Mufti*, meaning... authorized to issue legal opinions (fatwas)... another 2 years (another coincidence). To become a Mufti requires work on what is essentially a thesis (one of my aunts is doing it... she calls it a thesis... she studies from a traditional madrassah... her 'thesis' fatwa is about the legality of abortion with various congenital disorders... overlapping with her career as a medical doctor). This system goes straight back to the first Muslim scholars of fiqh (law) from the 8th and 9th centuries.

An Ayatollah is a Shi'ite version of a Mufti.

The entire system is dependent on the system of ijazah or authorization. You have to be authorized by a teacher/master of your field before you can authorize anyone else. Ijazahs, all of them, have unbroken chains going back to the first generation of Muslims, Muhammad's companions. The whole ""master and apprentice"" thing.

You wouldn't go to a doctor who didn't have a degree or a license (the ijazah to issue fatawa would be like a license), would you?

So why would you go learn Islam from someone who similarly isn't qualified? Because you've been indoctrinated with the idea that religion is separate from civilization, politics, law, etc. Europe's attempt to defang Islam by secularizing it, so Muslims wouldn't rebel against Western hegemony. After all, it took them over a thousand years of warring to finally bring down the Islamic Caliphate (the Ottoman Empire). Which would not have been possible if they hadn't enlisted the aid of the Wahhabis from Arabia."

Eugenics were never a big part of nazism. It so happened that it was a convenient scientific explanation. Neo-nazis rarely talk about eugenics these days, it's all about the M17 genetic marker and things like that. They are using a fairly modern understanding of genetics now.

The problem is the violent and outrageous backlash against scientific understand which occurred in the years immediately following this early enlightenment.

What backlash are you talking about?  

&gt;As their political power grew, both the Catholic Church and the Islamic Caliphate sought to conquer the entire Mediterranean area, culminating in the First Crusade (1095 B.C.E.). 

This statement is wrong on many levels, the Crusades were not intended to conquer the entire Mediterranean area, and I don't see how the struggle between Western Christendom and the various Muslim powers could be, in any meaningful sense, said to culminate in the First Crusade.

&gt;This political wrestling match, which would eventually spread throughout Europe and Asia, is directly responsible for the true ""Dark Ages"" which stretched though most of the High Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance.

What?  The 12th Century was a time of great intellectual development and creativity, as populations grew by leaps and bounds thanks to new farming methods and greater stability and the political situation in Europe became more settled in the wake of the end of external threats like the Vikings.  The birth of the university also occurred during this period.  In fact, the 12th century is almost universally referred to by historians as a renaissance of its own.   

&gt;For nearly 500 years, all knowledge that could not be controlled by the ruling religious/political organizations (one in the same) was considered blasphemous. Any scientific leadership showed by those early religious organizations was utterly destroyed by the time we entered the modern era.

Completely and totally untrue.  I mean, just utterly wrong on basically every level.  Where are you getting your information from?"

The Swedish central bank, Riksbanken, can influence the finance market in several ways. The most important one is by regulating the interest that other banks have to pay the central bank when they borrow money from the central bank. When the banks in turn borrow money to consumers, the interest rate will usually be the same as the central bank interest rate plus an additional margin based on the perceived risk of the loan plus a profit margin. In effect, the central bank controls the interest rates of most loans made in Sweden. This means they can cool down the economy when it is overheating by increasing the interest rate, and they can stimulate a slow economy by decreasing the interest rate. This is a rather crude instrument to regulate the economy, but still an effective one. 

Other countries have more or less the same system in place. The Euro zone share a single central bank. This means that in situations such as what we have today, where some countries are having a crisis while others are doing ok, the desired interest rates in the different countries of the Euro zone varies, something that the European central bank is simply unable to do."

But you just said it would be suboptimal. Are you retracting that claim?

&gt;In all fairness, though, you started out by saying [etc] So the original assertion comes from you, not me.

I never said anything about the _goodness_ or _badness_ of a global government. I never said anything about a global government at all. I simply said that the main point of the EU is to converge policy amongst member states. That is the entire reason it exists, and has been since day one. If it is going to allow member states to make their own divergent policies, then it is a pointless entity.

&gt;As for my reasons for strongly believing that a single unified world government is bad; Monopolies are bad.

Well a representative government is not really the same as a monopoly corporation. Your analysis seems simplistic, and has not really addressed any of the issues regarding the 'fairness' that would arise from having some global congruence in certain areas of the law, particularly labour and tax law.

&gt;They breed corruption, inefficiency and waste.

This is just an emotional statement. We can find examples of corruption, inefficiency and waste in monopolies and populated markets; we can find them in government and we can find them in private enterprise. There is no evidence to suggest that these phenomena are guaranteed to be more pervasive in a monopoly or a competitive organisation; a government department or a multinational corporation.

It would be safer to say this: _lack of accountability_ creates opportunities for corruption, inefficiency and waste. We simply need to ensure that any global government is accountable to each member state, and each member state is in turn accountable to its citizens.

&gt;If there is only one government, there is no competition and the market stagnates.

There would not be one government. There would be one _global_ government, which would sit atop many _regional_ governments, and so forth. The structure could be quite devolved, and I suspect that is the form which states and their citizens would prefer. Sub-global governments would definitely be able to compete for citizens by providing better quality of life subject to some global minimum standards regarding medical care, pension provision, labour regulation and so forth.

&gt;In what way to you feel that saying that a free market thrives on choice is vague?

What is a free market, for starters? I hear the term thrown about a lot on reddit, but I don't think such a thing has ever existed in reality. It is as mythical as a unicorn as far as I am concerned.

Furthermore: as I pointed out, there would still be plenty of scope for regions to compete for citizens. There would just be a new global tax code and labour law, among other things.

&gt;Can you show common, relevant situations where limiting freedom and choice makes the market thrive?

I have asked you to justify your statements and your response has been to ask me to disprove them. How is that going to convince anyone of the veracity of your argument?

&gt;If some countries are rich and some are poor, and if people are completely free to move from one country to another, then people will tend to move and find jobs in richer countries, and thereby improve their standard of living.

So you are suggesting that subsistence farmers in Ethiopia should simply relocate to the United States and then everything will be fine? I'm sure you can see the problems with this idea. There are costs involved with relocation which most of the world's population simply cannot bear, given that they live on a dollar or two a day. This is before we even consider immigration restrictions.

&gt;Lastly, why are you certain that a single government can figure out by itself what the best way to spend tax money on e.g. medical care?

I never made that claim. I think the functions should stay devolved, just like they are in the EU. The global government would simply provide standards and norms, and it would be the responsibility of sub-global governments to implement the functions. The lower the level of the government doing the implementation, the more likely it is to meet the specific needs of that region.

&gt;Doesn't it sound more likely that if different countries try out different strategies, that a conclusion can be drawn significantly quicker?

You are assuming that this would not be possible under a global government. Bear in mind that states would still be able to pass their own laws.

1: they have exam dates, annually, which anyone registered can attend and pass.  (Just like in Einstein's day.)  And 2: Many do not require you to attend lectures.  Afterall, punishing someone for not needing help is **absurd.**



For most of the famous scientists, we don't know how self-taught / tutor-taught they are, but in general, there's a lot less tutoring help in Europe.  Einstein was different, because he spoke of skipping classes.  (google it.)

In other words, great scientists come from many backgrounds.  Some are more self-taught, &amp; some are more tutored.

But the US system is corrupt for many reasons: they break up the exams into many small tests, grade you by attendance, etc.  This forces people into their **expensive** bureaucracy, while the European system is cheaper &amp; superior.  

Because the US system is so corrupt, many people skip it: look at a list of billionaires.  Our **lives of research** shouldn't be ignored because we didn't want to be ranked by social connections, graded on attendance, etc.

The second outcome is highly unlikely and one way or the other still nothing more than a hypothetical risk, not a real cost right now. If bail-outs do not happen, either the countries needing them default (costing a large group of investors, a lot of which are pension funds, a lot of money), or they de-valuate the currency, (costing any foreign investors large amounts of money).

Even the founding fathers did things like build roads, build bridges and created banks in the first 10 congresses of US history.

Moreover, the US, like many Western nations, began creating a welfare state in the 20th century. While the constitutionality of such actions in a US context is debatable (""general welfare"" is in the constitution) the founding fathers did not create ""small government"" in opposition to European welfare states, but European dictatorships. ""Limited government"" in the 18th century was not government without a welfare state, but government that did not abuse its power and harm its own citizens.

Minarchism is thus a *radical new ideology*, while a welfare state has *been around for over century*.

So when conservatives begin to espouse minarchism and thus oppose any form of government program not related to law enforcement, military and legal system, they are promoting a system of government that not even Ronald Reagan believed in.

So from my pov, minarchists are radical. Centre-right conservatives (of which there are none) should provide an alternative form of conservatism that still sees room for important government programs.

As for the left, the most leftist a person can get is to espouse revolutionary communism. That is certainly not what mainstream progressives are espousing."

&gt;He was vilified by his enemies (often referred to as the Sorcerer Pope or some such nonsense) and was expelled along with the Roman Emperor in 1002 (I had to look up that date).

Um, he was expelled from Rome because his reformist tendencies upset the elite in Rome, and he returned to the city after only two years.  It had absolutely nothing to do with his scientific inquiries.  

&gt;They were political pawns and quite useless as religious leaders. 

That's ridiculous.  Was Urban II an imporant religious leader?

&gt;The Church in Rome was essentially under the control of the Roman government for the next 50 years 

And Popes in the 7th century were appointed by the Byzantine Emperor, what is your point?  This has absolutely nothing to do with the repression, or lack thereof of ""science"" in the 11th and 12th centuries.

&gt;Although, I wholeheartedly dispute the notion that political powers in Europe and Asia weren't trying to control the whole of the Mediterranean (Jerusalem is an eastern Mediterranean city). That's just established fact.

Really?  that's odd, because all the contemporary documents talk about liberating the Holy Land, which is why most of the crusaders packed up and went home once they captured Jerusalem.  I have no doubt that the leaders of the various powers in the 12th century would have been happy to control the entire Mediterranean (who wouldn't), but they were well aware that such a control would be effectively impossible.  

&gt;While true that the High Middle Ages included some structural advancements, by the 12th Century, the Catholic Church had inescapably fused with the political powers. 

Um, that had happened by the fourth century.  The idea of a distinction between the religious sphere and the political sphere is an entirely modern idea.  Moreover, the Church regularly found itself in conflict with the dominant political powers, most notable during the Investiture Controversy.  I'd argue that the period in question actually saw the rising independence of the Church from the (to use an anachronistic term) states of the period, from the height of their unity in the Carolingian empire.

&gt;In fact, in the so-called ""Renaissance"" of the 12th century, universities were created for the express purpose of translating and teaching previously written Greek and Eastern writings.

That's not what the university was created for, and universities generally emerged after the 12th century.  The Renaissance of the 12th century was generally centered around cathedral schools such as Chartres, and occurred prior to the re-introduction of Aristotelian texts.  The most important texts were platonic, and had been in circulation for centuries.

&gt;I know some historians have a soft spot for the 12th century, but it wasn't a time of advancement, more a time of realignment.

So, improvement in farming methods, developments in philosophy and theology, the beginnings of the emergence of nations, the increased urbanization of Europe, the development of trade networks that stretched far into the east, and, the creation of the university, were all simply ""realignments"" not advancements?

&gt;Also, and it feels odd that I must mention it, but the High Middle Ages included constant debilitating outbreaks of every conceivable kind of plague, including the Black Death. The universities were a great place for hiding from rats, but the ""science"" of the time was useless if you were an average citizen.

Is your point that because the people of the 12th century hadn't developed the germ theory of disease and penicillin that it was a dark age and no intellectual development was going on?  You are aware that plagues have been a perennial problem in human history, especially as people become more urbanized and trade networks develop, such as they did during the period in question?

&gt;there was no separation of the Church and the State 

There was also no internet or modern nation states.  Weird, it's almost like those things developed later in human history.

&gt;By the time the true Renaissance rolled around, the Church was actively and enthusiastically stifling scientific advancement. 

Really? give examples.

&gt;Galileo lived 200 years after the general beginning of the Renaissance, and look how the Catholic Church treated his teachings.

So, a single incident, 500 years after the time period in question proves your point?

China is also going to support Portuguese debt. The Portuguese Minister went to China and apparently got some sort of deal (before Spain, even). The same with Brazil and several Arab states.

This is actually the strategy in place by the current government: try to guarantee that there are plenty of buyers beforehand. It might even sort of work since foreign relations seems to be one thing that this government does well (some might say the only one). 

However it clearly shows the ultimate failure of the EU, at least of the present economic model: there is no free lunch, and what Portugal (and Spain) is doing is going outside of the EU to seek support, which will no doubt have strings attached, since there is no internal support to speak of. Which means that even in terms of any supposed unified foreign policy all bets are off  - something quite clearly seen in the US Security Council 2010 election, among others."

In the Japanese mocking I heard the words ""Kuruma"" (car) ""Chotto"" (small, little, short), ""Ichi"" (one), ""Kara"" (because), ""Demo"" (but) ""Desu"" (is, sentence clause). Of course he was using a lot of syllables so the words you could recognise can vary. I even thought I recognised words I don't know the definition of :P So yeah, key to mocking (and recognising) another language is to copy the syllables.

In European languages it's hard, as long as you know how to pronounce the vowels in that language you can do it somewhat effectively but you need to know the quirks of that language. Which parts of a sentence are stressed? What type of intonation is common? 

Asian languages can be easier since some have fixed number of syllables.

Guess I'm really just stating the obvious. :P

http://ask.metafilter.com/35550/Why-A

&gt; This exact question is answered in the book ""Imponderables: The Solution to the Mysteries of Everyday Life"" by David Feldman. It's a rather long, messy answer, spanning 5 different cultures. I'm not going to type the whole thing out(sorry), but I will try to give a summary.

&gt; THE EGYPTIANS

&gt; The Egyptians had 5 distinct stages of writing, with the last stage being very close to the alphabet as it is today. However, even with the advent of letter sounds, they still clung to the first 3 stages.

&gt; 1. Hieroglyphs as pictures of things: ""horse"" is a picture of a horse. Every single word needs it's own character, and abstract concenpts cannot be represented.

&gt; 2. Idea Pictures: a leg can mean not only leg, but running or fast

&gt; 3. Sound Pictures: One symbol was now used to describe a sound that existed in words of a spoken language rather than a graphic description of the word signified.

&gt; 4. Syllable Pictures: The same syllable hieroglyph can now appear in many different words.

&gt; 5. Letter sounds: One symbol now took the place of one letter in a word. They eventually whitted the redundant letters down to 25. 

&gt; THE UGARITS

&gt; Although the Phoenicians are widely hailed as the inventors of the alphabet, it's now that that it originated in the city of Ugarit in northwest Syria. A tablet was found that has Ugaritic letters displayed opposite a column of known Babylonian syllabic signs, proving that the Ugarits conciously order their alphabets. Although the phonetics of the Ugaritic alphabet were identical to that of the Phoenicians, the actual script was different from the later Phoenician alphabet and the earlier Egyptian and Semetic languages.

&gt; THE PHOENICIANS

&gt; Although the Phoenician alphabet probably developed about the same time as the Ugarits, they are much more important because they spread their alphabet throughout much of the world. They were traders who used their alphabet to track inventories, standardize accounting procedures, etc; they left no literature or books behind. They carried their alphabet to most of the major Mediterranian ports by 1000 BC.
They had totally dropped out picture sounds and kept only the symbols that signified sounds. The Phoenician's work ""aleph"" meant ""ox,"" and the letter ""a"" was made to look like a ox's head. The ox, the most important animal of the time, was the basis for the first letter of most European and Semetic languages, including later, English. They also had no vowels. 

&gt; THE GREEKS

&gt; The Greeks took their favorite elements from the Semetic and Phoenician languges. They took 16 consonants from the Phoenician language and addes five vowels: alpha, epsilon, upsilon, iota, omikron. Alpha became the first letter of the Greek alphabet. They was not taken from the Phoenician aleph, which was a consonant, but from the Hebrew language, where aleph also happened to mean ox. The first letters of the Hebrew alphabet are ""aleph, beth, gemel, dalth,"" which mean ""ox, house, camel, door."" The Greek equivilants are alpha, beta, gamma, delta. The Greeks needed vowels to express the sounds they made in their language. The Phoenicians did not have them, and though the Hebrew language did inclufe some vowel sounds,, they were used erratically and sporadically. So the Greeks took Hebrew consonants that had no use in speaking Greek(like aleph) and converted them into vowels.

&gt; By adding a few consonants of their own, they ended up with 24 letter alphabet. They had no c or v, and some of their letters stood for different sounds than they do now. However, the order was pretty much the same as it is today, with a few exceptions(z was 6th letters).

&gt; THE ROMANS

&gt; The Romans were ruled by the Greek speaking Etruscans. Before their decline the Romans adopted the Greek alphabet and made changes. They established the current alphabetical order used by English-speaking countries, but with only 23 letters. J, U, and W were added after well after the birth of Christ. There are various reasons why individual letters got changed. Z was originally dropped, not needing a place in Roman speech. When the Romans cionquered Greece, they needed Z back to transliterate Greek words into Roman. They had formalized the order by then, though, so Z was dumped at the end.

The US economy is only balancing itself by quantitative easing (AKA printing money) at this point. This process just lowers the value of each US dollar because their notes are not backed by anything of real value (IE: gold).

Many countries are in talks right now to unlink the oil market with the US dollar. When the US dollar gets dropped as the world's reserve currency, inflation will start to drive prices up in the USA ... and fast. Think $5/ gallon gas in a matter of weeks! Then $10/ gallon a month or two later. This is when riots and panic sets in. There will be blood in the streets as the price of bread, milk, clothes, food, energy, etc. regularily go up from 20% to 40% in days or weeks! This is what happened when the British empire began to crumble after WW2 ... the British LB used to be the world reserve currency before the US$ took over it's reign. Every reign ends ... the US jackels running the country had a damned good run.

If I had kids living in the USA, I would be working very hard to get them out now, before the real pain begins. There was a modest rebound before the real pain of the Great Depression set in. Dont underestimate how fast this global induced inflation policy will crush the American population. The Chinese, Russians and Europe will enjoy this very much.

Shit happens fast when a paradigm shift goes down in world politics. The US population is indoctrinated to being safe, being the world currency, being a safe haven, etc. This is ending very soon.

Americans have become fat, bloated sponges of assets to be squeezed dry and drained by their corporate overlords. Get out if you can, or find a way to be more self reliant with like minded friends now. The days of having government at your service in the USA are quickly eroding.

I don't think more labor influence or a more progressive government would taper that growth, just smooth it out for the better, and increase the living standard.

 Simple, isn't it? Everyone would be satisfied. There's a single problem here. ISP's are greedy, so they oversell. This allows them to give the end-user a lower price, but what is usually untold is that they still have an enormous profit margin, which means that if they actually had what they sold, and reduced just a tiny bit their profit margins, we could maintain (roughly) the same price. And even then, here in Europe I pay roughly 30some € for VoIP-connected phone with free landline calls (pretty much) everywhere I'd want to call, and severely discounted cellphone fees, plus 10MB (it's sufficient for me) bandwidth internet, and IPTV with more channels (HD and 3D, too) than I can count.

The tenants are mostly foreigners who (and I've lived in Europe for four years) either refuse to learn American customs or are so rich and arrogant they feel they don't have to abide by them.  You know what - scratch that - they didn't even seem to have HUMAN customs.  There's trash everywhere, puke and blood in the hallways, people passed out in stairwells, destruction of property, cars vandalized...it was hell.  The ONLY thing that was good, was their staff - they were pretty cool people.  Everything..I mean EVERYTHING about it sucked.  One time someone threw a chair off the fourth floor at a girl walking her dog, then came back with a paintball gun and lit up the parking lot.  There's fights EVERY WEEKEND and cops always around.  Please Please Please trust me and don't move there.  We ended up moving to Scottsdale Gateway which is close to campus - it's on McKellips and N. Scottsdale Rd.  Just north of the 202.  They have hardwood floors upgrades amenities and the property and people are wonderful.  There's a starbucks on the corner, a sports bar across the street and your so close to everything.  Plus we were paying $1250 at Grigio Metro for a loft unit, here we have a one bedroom but with Utilities included it's only $650.  We absolutely love it here.  I really hope this helps.

TL;DR - DON'T MOVE TO GRIGIO MOVE TO SCOTTSDALE GATEWAY."

""Nor in the EU"" simply isn't true: many works will enter the public domain in the E.U. this year, and *none whatsoever* in the U.S. - this is *exactly* the point the original article was making!  See also [this article](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday) linked to from the OA.

Changes made to United States copyright law in 1978 extended copyright to ""75 years-from-publication"" for perhaps most significant works published between 1923 and 1977.  The U.S. congress, on behalf of  corporations like Disney, had this [extended in 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act) to ""95 years-from-publication"".  What that means is that *nothing* published in the U.S. after 1923 will be available until 2019 at the earliest, and given past evidence there's no guarantee that this period will not be extended again (particularly when it looks like Disney's earlier works may be getting close to copyright expiration).

In the meantime, people in the E.U. will be able to access hundreds of copyright-free works every year from now until 2019...  At the very least this demonstrates that European countries have shown a willingness to see works released into the public domain.  A change in E.U. law in the mid-nineties did extend copyright to ""author's death+70 years"" (In the United Kingdom, for example, it had previously been ""author's death+50 years"").  As of 1998, the law in the U.S. for works published *after* 1978 is also ""author's death+70 years"".  

So while perhaps it may be true to say that for works published today things are just as bad in the E.U. as the U.S., for earlier works the situation in the E.U. is definitely better.  For example, ""The Great Gatsby"" will now have entered the public domain in Europe, because Fitzgerald died in 1940.  (Though in Australia and Canada it's been in the public domain for 20 years already).

(The U.S. situation is actually [a bit more contrived](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm) than I could be bothered explaining above, but for the most part Americans will be waiting another 8 years before anything enters the public domain)."

And the coalitions within the EU with counter intuitive coalitions (like our current predicament) that shatter and break so easily.

If we had a Proportional Representation (PR) system, and there were two or three nutcases in each constituency voting to put farm animals into parliament, they would pull it off and that would be no use to the running of the country.

The 2% refers to those voters in marginal seats, but Labour lost a number of previously solid seats (Dewsbury for example), and that is why it is vital for people to vote even if they think that they're in a solid Tory/Labour/Lib-Dem seated constituency.

As for the 3% lead required for Labour to win and 11% for the Tories, that is all down to constituency demographic which was updated with boundary changes prior to the 2010 election in favour of the Tories as it happens.

FPTP puts emphasis on a strong (ideologically effective) government vs. completely proportional. If we wanted everything to be completely proportional we wouldn't even vote people into parliament, we'd all vote individually on every issue and every item of legislature...

Not true. In some countries, exclusivity ended as early as early 2009 (and marketshare did indeed jump up a bit), in some it's only just ending now.

It's also not quite a similar situation; in most cases, in Europe, the difference in quality between the major carriers just isn't as great as in the US. In this country, for instance, the big two, Vodafone and O2, both have essentially full coverage. The iPhone was originally on O2; when it became available on Vodafone that wasn't a huge deal because for most people there was no real service difference between the two. Family plans are also not common in Europe, while I gather they're a big deal in the US."

I hate to sound harsh, but this is down-right culturally ignorant. I've heard it before from American redditors, and I can only assume that this opinion comes from living in a country that is so large and naturally diverse that travelling abroad hasn't been needed much.

What you might compare to the difference between a person from Arkansas and Massachussets would be the difference between various regions within a EU country. For example Bavaria and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany, and even then it would sometimes be a stretch: I live in Copenhagen in Denmark, but my mother's side of the family is from [Vendsyssel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendsyssel), and most people from the area of Copenhagen would not understand the dialect of my maternal grandparents. And that is in a country as small as Denmark.

But between different EU nationalities? That's a whole different ball game. Having different languages, religions and thousands of years of history and culture is not comparable to states largely settled by Protestant Anglo-Saxons within the last few centuries."

You don't stop though. You assert that immigrants on average are more likely to abuse welfare regulation. With this comes the assumption that welfare spending on immigrants is high enough to be a burden.  

Lastly, you claim that the majority of the population are opposed to allowing either any immigration, or opposed to allowing in as many as the EU currently is.  

Consequently:   

1. The European countries do not need more workers and should cut down on immigration for economic benefit.  

2. Current levels of immigration is a drain on the countries's recourses.  

3. Most immigrants come from poorer countries and are uneducated.  

4. The EU has no international obligations to accept a minimum of refugees and therefore there is no reason to accept them.  

5. The mentioned refugee quota from poorer countries is very high.

I never said that places in Europe are not melting pots; just that they've historically been less of a melting pot than America. Meaning, there weren't many (if any) people of Asian or African or Native American descent in Ireland until relatively recently. Yeah, there were white-skinned people from other parts of Europe, but that's not as drastic as an assemblage of people from all parts of the world.

&gt; You forgot what you brought over? Really? Got some evidence of that, or is it more likely that culture just evolves?

It's common sense. If I had a German grandparent, their knowledge of German culture wouldn't transfer to me but only in minuscule traces or fragments. Call it what you want -- evolving or forgetting -- but it doesn't remain in its original form and can get overpowered/eliminated by other cultural influences.

&gt; What gives you the authority to judge what an entire continent of people feel, just because you have some sort of problem with your own continent?

Again, I'm just using my common sense. Being in close proximity to Mexico (I live in Central Texas) means that their culture influences my own. The closer something is to something else, the more likely it is to influence it. Therefore, one can assume that living in close proximity to downtown Paris would cause you to be influenced by the culture of downtown Paris. 

I can't believe I have to explain this all.

&gt; Just so happens I do live in a city with plenty of the above, and have worked with Latino's and Black's in my old job. 

Yeah, I know. But I could open my door and look out and I may not see any ""European American"" people at all. It's on a different level here. 

&gt; Anyway, by your definition, how long does it take for an ethnicity to form? 

That's a really good question and I'm not sure as to what the answer is. Interbreeding between different genetic groups is what *creates* ethnicities. 

But I could ask you how long it takes for a race to form. The thing is, Americans are abandoning the concept of race. Because it is harmful. It's much better to say ""Irish American"" than it is to say ""white person"". It's much more specific and doesn't group certain peoples arbitrarily. We have a long, painful history of dichotomizing human beings according to the flawed concept of race.

Your friend Joey is of a certain Asian ethnicity (Korean or Japanese or Chinese, etc.) not of Asian race.

Because they save local activism for problems abroad? No other industrialized country cares less about problems of other countries in relative terms. What the fuck is wrong with a person using that as an argument? The stupidity is burning.

I will give you a reason: Because Americans are used to capitalistic bullshit like that. They get raised and educated to think it's okay to build their world on fascist ideals. Money = power. Education = costs money. Debt to get an education/a better job = okay.


Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with the person who wrote that article?

Another reason is that America has a fully developed scholarship system while it is completely underdeveloped in Europe (it never was needed as tuition was easily paid off... or there was no tuition in the first place).

In America no good student wouldn't complain because they get a lot of their stuff paid for anyway.

Maybe Americans also don't riot *as much* (they did riot, remember, they were shot at by the American army for it... maybe another reason they don't riot: because they are severely oppressed by their police state), because they think of college education as a basis for their new job and are far more competitive while in some other countries education is valued as a personal investment for enjoyment. Some people just love education and have still follow Humboldt's ideals of free knowledge and education and people excelling in their fields of expertise instead of producing the highest academic output and making a lot of money. Something that interfers with equal rights of education for everyone and providing the public with higher education without problems for the individual is bad.

People in other countries also don't accept that their governments spend more on military than on education. They also don't accept that tax cuts for the rich get accepted while university education gets more expensive.

Yes, maybe it's because they just aren't apathetic and ignorant when it comes to dealing with their social and economical environment. 

There were two acceptable paragraphs in that whole article:

&gt;Nina Power, one of the student protestors, wrote in The Guardian that “It was a protest against the narrowing of horizons; a protest against Lib Dem hypocrisy; a protest against the increasingly utilitarian approach to human life that sees degrees as nothing but ""investments"" by individuals, and denies any link between education and the broader social good.”

Because that's exactly one of the reasons why people protest.

&gt;British students are fighting a transformation of their society that has long taken hold in the US.

Because that's a true statement.

Yes, American students should riot, too. This is just pathetically horrible that they stopped fighting and that system was able to take hold.

It's a reason why European students have to fight even harder, so exactly that can't happen."

It's possible that the faceting is a similar offshoot to their adoption of saint-prayer to lull and befriend the pagan populations of Europe... however, the idea that a single being can have multiple personalities is not exactly new, nor is it exactly entirely fictional.

But it rarely includes people of different cultures, excepting tourism, wherein a lot of (in my experience European) men find it perfectly acceptable to be creeps to obviously tourist women. But they don't treat their local women like that, just the guests, so yes, it's still creepy to follow someone home, or make obscene gestures across a restaurant.

Within a culture, you should learn the rules of what's acceptable. Making mistakes in adolescence can be overcome. Girls can be creepy too, remember. There was that recent story on reddit about the cute girl from the coffee shop or whatever that the guy asked out, and then it turns out she stalked him and he didn't even go through with the date? She was cute, but **creepy**. And also psycho.

I had a girl who had a crush on me who was kinda cute I guess, but she talked about printing out pictures of my boyfriend and throwing darts at them. She was a creeper! (And not because I don't like girls, I do.)

There is a correlation to attractiveness, yes. But being creepy is about making moves on someone after you've been rejected--it's creepy because they aren't listening to your lack of consent, and have become a possible threat, whether they mean it or not.

But creepy applies to other stuff, too. There were a couple of incredibly creepy guys at my school who were equally disliked by the guys."

- Yes it is possible to convert a FAA licence to a JAA licence. But the time it takes to convert is in the region of 8-9 months. Unless you have over 1500 hours which I doubt.
- There are many many European schools at almost all small airfields. You'll mostly find adverts in flight magazines etc. for Integrated courses. But, most modular schools don't really advertise as they operate on smaller budgets. I highly recommend getting the Flight Training circulars/news or visiting flight training websites. There are many many forums available on the internet that will give you information too. Word of advice on internet forums, take everything with a pinch of salt. A lot of dodgy flight training organisations like to post fake reviews etc.
Since I'm from the UK my knowledge of schools outside of UK and America are limited. So I rather you do your own research and ask for affirmation if in doubt.
- Very few or almost no airlines in Europe run their own academies any more. They stopped soon after 9/11. You need to be trained upto a fATPL before an airline will consider you for further training on a specified aircraft. This is because all training to fATPL is standard. Then the advanced training for Jets/Props/Turbo Props require selective training on the aircraft type. This is mostly done by the companies after they have selected you.
- From experience I can tell you that the competition for a cadet programme sponsored by an airline tough. Around 1000 applicants for 6 places. This is due to the sheer financial burden of flight training.
- The fATPL (forzen ATPL) on average gives a pilot around 200-250 hours of flight time. This is what you require to join an airline in Europe. And the ATPL has to be JAA for Europe.
- You do not need a degree (BA/BSc) to be a pilot in UK. I'm pretty sure you don't need one for Europe either. But, America requires one. A degree is always a good option as a backup. But, try not to put all your eggs in one basket. Don't get a degree in Airline related fields as, if the industry is in a downturn.. getting a job as pilot or a office guy in the airline will be equally tough.
- From a conversation with the head of training of a very large airline in the UK regarding degrees for pilots, the exact words I was told was 'It doesn't matter'. "

If price is a selling point then it's an obvious choice. If comfort's your thing, then you may want to look elsewhere (as for in-flight entertainment, with today's gadgets that shouldn't be much of a concern; take the $250+ you are saving and buy a sweet portable blu-ray player or iPad).

On other websites there are agree and disagree counters on posts. I checked your posts by controversial filter and your top one (militant agnostic) is pretty funny and true... But the one about the islamic center I disagree on. If you've read the qu'ran and seen opinion polls of the views of the muslim population then you'd know that it's not just terrorists that give islam a bad reputation. If an atheist organisation had a book as hateful as the qu'ran, had as extremely intolerant views and were linked to consistent violent acts against those whose only crime was not submitting to their authority then I doubt they'd be allowed to have schools and community centers. Islam gets a free pass just because it's old and established.

And don't give me the Christianity is just as bad malarkey. When have the majority of christians supported the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates? Just look at the least peaceful countries on earth, most are islamic and of the most peaceful none are islamic. It's not a coincidence. Iran has given the death penalty to thousands of people whose only crime was being born homosexual. If the fact that 68% of muslims polled in the liberal UK want similar laws doesn't frighten you then you're quite frankly an ignorant and horrible person. In the UK muslims commit 13 times more hate crimes against homosexuals than the average population. If we don't do everything we can to peacefully retard it's progress then we are failing the future generations who will have to live in a very scary world indeed. And that is their goal, to take over the world, ""to fight until all is for Allah"". The longest serving muslim leader said europe would be taken over within 30 years.

To call the people that hate islam intolerant is ludicrous, it's a really cowardly and disgusting attitude that you must respect every view. I do not have any respect for people that want me to spend eternity being tortured. It really pisses me off that muslims can have the most extroardinarily intolerant views, they could barely be more intolerant, and yet you respect them and instead you're calling the atheists intolerant for seeing it for what it is. You are complicit with the daily torture most gay people in islamic societies face. And yet you think you're the one being more reasonable and peaceful! Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.

You really don't understand at all, do you?  *I have no faith*.

&gt;Because your leaders examine their braille ""fact"" after the effects of reality.

The more likely scenario is that the military is not in the business of thinking about what happens to ammunition after it has been fired.  It has everything to do with priorities and nothing to do with your ridiculous scenario.

&gt;Your elect leaders of economic peace marker political wizards.

And as I said, you're trying to take a complex system and oversimplify it to the point of uselessness.

&gt;Its simply the 5 senses braille after effect of looking backwards at only ""facts"".

We use far more than just the five senses available to humans (by the way, [there are more than five senses available to the human body.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense)) - we have hundreds of different types of detectors and sensors dedicated to finding things we can't otherwise detect.

Besides this, however, the problem for your faith-based view remains:  you can't demonstrate anything else to be real.

&gt;Should we go over some of these again, yet others are pending the game still afoot.

I see no purpose in it - you refuse to acknowledge that you use allegory and baseless rationalizations to shoehorn events in to your vague prophecies.  Until such time as you can examine them in an intellectually honest and consistent manner, the exercise would be a waste of my time.

&gt;It is a Biblical representation of the ""end times"" forces that are anti-Christ.

And you're basing these apologetics on what, exactly?  Obviously Babylon can't affect current events anymore, but it was *still around* when the bible was authored.  Face it:  you **have** to make it be some amorphous word without hard definition, because otherwise none of Revelations makes any sense when faced with the hard fact that Babylon the nation doesn't exist anymore.

&gt;Israel was captive under Egypt then Babylon then released by Persia....

You're not looking at the historical religious context in which Muhammad made his religion in the first place.  Part of it was based in Christianity, his first major message was essentially ""Allah is one"" - that all the gods are really just different aspects of the overgod, Allah, and that this overgod is really the Judeo-Christian god, as are all monotheistic gods.  Strip away Christianity and its spread, and he'd never even have heard of the god of the bible, likely.

&gt;Which gods made promises that absolutely without equivocation can not under any circumstances not be fulfilled.

Your god has, for starters.  Regardless, this is not objective evidence in favor of his existence - it is merely evidence that his authors know how to spin vague enough prophecy that many events could fulfill it.

&gt;From GOD's hierarchy down from Heaven, GOD's contact with man begins in the House of Israel, the Jews, they were the only prophets of GOD and Christ was the last.

This isn't evidence of your god's existence, it is a story that presupposes his existence.

&gt;Tyranny always finds a way.

Christian tyranny caused the dark ages.  Remove christianity and there's no such tyranny around to destroy knowledge and hold humanity back.

&gt;Lead silverware still floats in the elect gene pool and every ponzi scheme eventually (like gravity) collapses.

Government isn't a ponzi scheme (we've been over this - like many things, you oversimplify the concept to the point of uselessness), and it seems to me that you're vastly oversimplifying the fall of the Roman Empire - I'm guessing you don't really understand how or why it happened.

&gt;Well there's Christianity and there's catholicism, they've never been the same thing. catholicism made Europe, Christianity America.

Catholics are christians, just a different sect.  Regardless, Christianity never made America - you've been drinking deeply the Glenn Beck coolaid if you believe that load of bullshit.  Most of the founding fathers were Deists who actively denied the Christian faith.

&gt;What is there about Christ Word, works that you can not follow?

It's not that I can't follow it, it's that I see no reason to when you can't demonstrate that he, or your god, are real.  There's some good stuff in your bible, but there's a lot of horrible stuff in there as well - terrible things that your god defines as ""moral"" that to our sensibilities are ridiculous, arbitrary, and wretched."

This subplot was introduced to explore the potential positive effects of de facto ""legalization"" of the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks. The posited benefits, as in Amsterdam and other European cities, were reduced street crime, city-wide, and increased outreach of health and social services to at-risk populations.[citation needed] The name ""Hamsterdam"" comes from the drug dealers mishearing Herc refer to ""Amsterdam"".](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyViO_qy7LI)

That's why we get expressions like ""acting white"" for minorities who want to succeed in school. You don't get real activism unless you get enough people on the same page.

Perché  [comprare oro](http://www.comprooroafirenze.com) può essere ancora un buon investimento, di seguito proviamo a fare alcune considerazioni utili a indicarci il futuro dell'oro sui mercati finanziari. 
Nonostante la crescita continua del prezzo dell'oro iniziata nel 2008, che ha portato il metallo giallo a raddoppiare il proprio valore, ci sono ancora molti buoni motivi che fanno pensare 
al perpetrarsi del trend positivo dell'oro. La situazione americana che vede il deterioramento del deficit interno e la politica della Federal Reserve che è stato giudicata come 
favorevole ad ulteriori apprezzamenti dell'oro, a questo bisogna aggiungere la debolezza del dollaro e la relativa volontà da parte degli altri paesi di voler riconvertire le ingenti riserve di 
denaro in dollari accumulate in altre forme di riserve più al riparo dalla svalutazione del biglietto verde, tra le diversificazioni possibili l'oro è sicuramente una delle favorite, anche se la 
non facile reperibilità di questo metallo lo rende utile solo marginalmente a coprire l'enorme valore necessario per poter sostituire le riserve in dollari accumulate soprattutto da quei paesi 
emergenti che stanno traendo grossi profitti dalla crescita economica o dalla vendita del petrolio come nel caso dei paesi arabi. Oltre a questo la domanda attuale dell'oro supera l'offerta 
disponibile sul mercato contribuendo a farne salire la quotazione, la crisi dei paesi Europei non favorisce certo molte alternative agli investitori oltre alle materie prime che vedano nei 
metalli preziosi e non uno degli investimenti più sicuri attualmente, anche il rame è salito alle stelle toccando record mai raggiunti prima. Anche gli analisti vedano il continuare di un trend 
positivo per oro e altre materie prime. Dopo i fallimenti delle maggiori banche americane con conseguente perdita di soldi da parte di quegli investitori che avevano affidato alla gestione 
delle banche i loro risparmi, gli investitori hanno rivisto in modo totale i propri metodi d'investimento decidendo di affidarsi a comparti più reali e tangibili e decisamente le materie prime
sono quanto di più adatto per questo genere di investimenti. Per completare il quadro anche nel caso di una ripresa economica nei paesi industrializzati di lunga data, gli scenari inflazionistici 
che si presenterebbero porterebbero l'oro a continuare il suo andamento positivo, molti analisti confermano le condizioni favorevoli per l'oro anche nel 2011.  "

European and American play tends to be involve more out of the box thinking, and the players are usually more open to trying crazy or new things.

These differences are especially visible anytime Idra plays in MLG or a non-Korean tournament. He will almost always open up with exactly the same build, being entirely predictable.

I'm not saying that secularization is necessarily a bad thing. But saying ""Look! Scandinavia is happy with it"" is kind of empty, because nearly all Scandinavians enjoy a healthy, wealthy life anyway. That's why socialism works for them: the majority looks to give to rather than benefit from the system. Not so in the United States.

Many Europeans do not get that when Americans say such things, they do not mean it in the same sense that Europeans do, as in that they are actual citizens of that country.  What Americans *really* mean, for example in your ""part Italian part Irish"" instance, is that they are of both Italian and Irish *descent.*  This sense of the meaning is automatically understood by other Americans but is often confusing to those from other parts of the world.    

The reason Americans talk this way is because descent matters in the US.  While it's probably not as important as it once was, it's a shorthand way that we can tell a great deal about each other beyond what's obvious from any regional accent or other cues.  Again, in the case of your ""part Italian and part Irish,"" example, right away I know this person was probably raised at least as a nominal Catholic, and probably has lots of relatives in the large northeastern cities.  They *might* be an evangelical from Minnesota or the deep south, but its not that likely and this is just one of many bits of social information that I pick up on when they tell me their descent.  To a greater or lesser degree, all Americans do this, whether they are aware of it or not.  The reason it seems strange to Europeans and others is that they live in much more historically homogeneous nations whereby, if someone says ""I'm Irish,"" or ""I'm Italian,"" as in an Irish or Italian citizen, you don't really need any further qualifications since that alone gives you a ton of information about who they are and where they come from.

It is well defined in Hungarian judiciary system. And if someone is fined by the media oversight body for hurting human dignity, they can appeal to a court, which has very well defined practices for deciding if something hurts human dignity or does not. There is nothing vague about it.

What you just said is a classic: ""because Fidesz is not a party which tends to show self restraint if it has different political interests""
Who are you to judge, if a political party can show self-restraint or not? Do you think, that a party which lost 2 elections, and still remained strong, and even gathered more knowledgeable people, and by studying the laws of other EU countries managed to remain the single competent party in Hungary, that that party cannot restrain itself? For the comparison, what can you say to what Gyurcsány, and even Demsky (the former mayor of Budapest) said, that they fucked up politics and let corruption blossom, because they didn't want to lose power? Was that a display of great self-restraint? That was the biggest show of how the soc-libs cannot restrain themselves, when their political interests clash with that of the population. You are applying double standards. 

And besides, the oversight body does not answer to the parliament. What makes you think that anyone could influence the oversight body? Did the Socialists have a fair media oversight body? And even if they were corrupt, that media oversight body did work. There were some issues around radio-frequency allocation, but it was working. What is that (besides your political prejudice), that makes you think that Fidesz could not operate a fair media oversight body?

Most people approach this subject thinking of the legalities, but I always think of it in terms of the principles.  What we are talking about is not allowing authors to profit from their novel works.  Not at all.  We're talking about allowing leeches to prevent the expansion of our culture in order to illegitimately make profit.

I've got no problem with profit.  Morally, I think capitalism (in principle, please don't bitch about the various practices they call capitalism that doesn't even fit its own definition) is the only way to go.  Both sides of a transaction completely free to engage or not only to mutual benefit.  This is a complete violation of that idea.  The publishers and rights holders are NOT approaching customers with an offer of exchange for like value.  They know that their product (distribution, duplication, etc) is worthless in these cases (and the Internet makes it worthless in MOST cases, but that's a different topic).  So they turn to the government.  The only entity in a free society which is not required to rationally defend their actions.  They use force, through guns and jails, to carry out their actions.  They don't persuade or convince anyone.  It's a dirty job but someones got to do it.  Anyhow, these publishers go to the government and they ask to have their product given artificial value.  They know that these works have entered popular culture.  They know that these works ARE our culture.  But to make some cash, they get the bullies to rough people up that can run circles around their product.

I don't think that anyone in the publishing industry, at least none in the position to make decisions, believes in the principles behind the copyright laws.  I think that they believe that so long as they can find SOME way to pry a few more dollars out of the public, they are justified in doing so because of the twisted ideas of corporatism that have infected pretty much all of society.  If they were told that tomorrow they could just simply steal money from people without providing a product (there are laws that allow this in some countries, such as the tax on blank media in Canada and Europe provided to various companies in return for absolutely nothing) they would line up and claim they were doing 'the lords work'.

Infuriating."

I did Air Force ROTC and got a information systems degree.  I wanted to go into the Intelligence career field but based on my degree, got stuck with communications.  I could have applied for a career change after a couple of years in the Air Force, but was planning to get out anyway.  I also wanted to get stationed in Europe and it took me 3 years and 2 assignments to get there.

Can you put your skills and interests to use?  In theory, yes, but it's not likely.  If the military needs you to do something, you do it.  I had an ROTC classmate who worked very hard for her nursing degree and wanted to be a nurse.  The Air Force didn't put her in the nurse corps, but rather personnel field (glorified secretaries).

Are the benefits worth service?  If you're single and could otherwise have afforded to pay for college, hell no.  If you're married with a minivan of kids and didn't have a dime for college, hell yes.  After you make captain at the 4 year mark, you'll be making a very comfortable living and staying in the service for 20 years for retirement can be a good idea.  

Warnings/etc. - keep your nose clean.  Prepare for Mother Blue to keep an eye on everything you do.  Being in the military is like living in a fishbowl.  If you can tolerate ridiculous rules, subjective commanders, and standards that are anything but standard, go for it.  I'm proud of my 5 year career and wouldn't trade it for the world, and wouldn't take the world to go back either."

Similar to ""Chicago School"" economics.

I am brown and when I returned after traveling throughout the Middle East (Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan) all they asked me was if I had been on any farms.

I was traveling during the Gaza fighting too and the only ones who gave me shit were the Israeli's., two hours of stupid questions followed by my American smart ass responses.  The question about my religion though applied to every country I went, it was even on some of the  VISA forms so it's not really anything new and it shouldn't be for you either.  

As a Citizen of the USA, you need to be aware that you can refuse to answer certain questions and eventually they have to let you in.  You can be detained for a maximum of 48 hours (rarely happens) and then they have to let you go.  The questions they ask you are to see whether you get nervous or contradict yourself and maybe even to rile you up.  Just like any law enforcement officer, they can ask you the stupidest questions.  It is YOUR fault if you decide to answer though, because you as a Citizen can refuse to answer questions that can incriminate you or that infringe on your privacy.  All they need to know are Your name, Your birth place, Are you a Citizen?  Where you are going or what you were doing is none of their concern.

Yes, you will prob miss your connection (the airlines are pretty cool about it) and you will get searched and hassled, but every country does this shit(doesnt make it right, but they do it to protect themselves, they think FUCK YOU if youre not a citizen).  The UK even asked me what my job title was, how much I earned, how long I was with my company, who did I know, where was I going, all sorts of BS questions.  I answered a few of em, the ones about my salary and time at work I refused because I told them it was against company policy to divulge that information and that I had to comply with the US/UK Anti-Corruption Acts, etc.  The stupidest question I got from the CBP on my way back from Asia was if I had traveled back to Europe or the Middle East during my 5 days in Asia.  I asked him if he knew how long it takes to fly from Far East Asia to the Middle East or Europe and return.  When he said no, I told him, its not possible in 5 days and he didn't ask anything else.

So sorry you got hassled, but I doubt it was profiling.  Maybe some dumb CBP agents or maybe you looked crazy suspicious and they wanted to trip you up.

For other redditors, I draw my examples from extensive travel throughout the world.  From Europe, Asia, Africa, America, I've encountered the same BS. (None as bad as Israel, that place is the WORST, stay away!)  For the CBP stuff, most of my friends from HS, a few of my family members and their friends are CBP.

That said, most educated and intelligent Americans that have actually bothered to think about it, don't really use that formulation anymore and increasingly it is a thing of the past.  Conversely, having lived in Ireland, I can tell you that most educated and thinking Irish people have long since figured out that when some American yokel says that they are ""Irish,"" they don't mean that they are actually an Irish citizen.  (Although in my case I actually am (thanks granddad!) due to the old dual citizenship that was so easy to get in the early 90s --let's just say that there was a woman involved and it seemed like a good idea at the time, though I certainly don't consider myself ""Irish"" and don't use the passport outside of Europe.)

It shows no evidence that food prices have been manipulated, the spanish participants, Secretary of State for International Trade, Pedro Mejia, and Secretary General Alfredo Bonet, are the ones who in one line *suggest* a price increase. 

**There is no mention of action** or deception. 

In fact,** the US Senator mentioned in the cable stresses ""the importance of science-based decisions in the agricultural biotechnology context""**.

&gt;   1. Transfer of GM bacteria to Bee Gut Here is an excerpt from an article by a microbiologist, Mae-Wan Ho:

That paper is not published in any known scientific journal.

Furthermore Mae-Wan Ho is well know for pushing her own agenda. 

Lastly, the modified crop she is talking about isn't even grown. I don't know how a crop that isn't grown can be killing bees, do you?

But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, lets just imagine instead of posting that useless paragraph you made the more intelligent argument that CCD is caused by BT toxin. However, even then, these are peer reviewed published article directly refuting that claim...

[""Although the additional stresses that honey bees face in the field could, in principle, modify their susceptibility to Cry proteins or lead to indirect effects, our findings support safety assessments that have not detected any direct negative effects of Bt crops for this vital insect pollinator.""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18183296)

[""The results with kurstaki and aizawai demonstrated that, in general, the Bt strains are safe to B. terrestris bumblebees""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20024947)

[""Our results suggested that Cry1Ac + CpTI pollen carried no lethal risk for honey bees.""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700762)

[""Oral exposure to CCRI41 (BT Cotton) pollen did not affect learning capacities of honey bees in both the T-tube maze and PER tests. ""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872243)

It is clear that BT is not having a significant effect on bees. CCD is much more likely the result of viral infections, varroa mites, and broad spectrum pesticides like imidacloprid (which technology like BT helps prevent use of).

&gt;k?

Yeah, it is now totally clear that you have no evidence what so ever.

I put down a challenge and you failed on both accounts.

Now, I will admit that it's kind of an all-or-nothing type of thing where you really have to be fluent to take advantage of it.  I know enough Chinese to get around, but no company is going to hire me to do anything that would rely on linguistic ability because I simply don't have it. So in an employer's view, I'm no more valuable than the next guy.  I suppose if you were hired to make occasional trips overseas to check on manufacturers or something it might help a little, but that's not going to be a determinative factor in most cases.

If you're fluent, though, the possibilities are endless.  Everyone talks about ""China's eventual rise,"" but in reality that is going to happen in the very near future.  Soon, China will reach a point where it is no longer advantageous for its educated elite to expatriate to North America or Europe to start businesses and careers, and a growing number of people with the ability to drive innovation are going to remain in China.  Once this happens, or more accurately, once China earnestly begins the transformation from the world's manufacturer to the world's innovator (we can hold out hope and say ""one of the world's innovators""), the currently dominant global corporations are going to be clamoring to find qualified employees to do business with their Chinese counterparts.  Further still, Chinese corporations are going to need native English speakers to do the same.  Granted, China is in no short supply of native Chinese who speak English fluently, but in many areas (for example, marketing and public relations, software localization, etc.) having a native speaker is far more beneficial than even a fluent non-native speaker.  

If you're willing to live out your life in China, the opportunities are already there.  I lived there for a while and befriended an American who took a job at a chip manufacturing plant on a whim and read his first Chinese lesson on the flight over.  Within a year he founded his own company there and now lives extremely comfortably (and speaks Chinese quite well, I'll add).  I mean he doesn't have a mansion, but his giant HD TV comes out of the floor in his condo.  That puts you pretty high up on my list.

**TL;DR**: If you're fluent in Chinese, you have job security.  If you know a little bit of Chinese, you have interesting conversations when you order takeout.

*Edit*: Just realized my allusion to my well-to-do friend contradicts my entire premise, but in nearly every case, you're far better off being fluent."

I see what you mean. Unfortunately I have to criticize the US for an explanation -- your media hardly ever reports on non-catastrophes in other countries, and Reddit is also quite US centric. Usually, when there is a report about other Western countries, it only serves to make a US-domestic political point. So, US Liberals like to highlight our social or economic policies that yield positive results, while US Conservatives focus on the troubled economies. The result is the bias you've noticed.

There are some things that work very well in Germany, and others that are problematic. If you're interested in some in depth non-biased reporting that gives a general overview about long term trends, not day-to-day political issues, there's a series of [eight articles](http://www.economist.com/node/15640987) (links at the side) in the Economist's Special Report on Germany. (The Economist only permits non-subscribers to read five articles per week, so you may have to delete their cookie half way through.)

&gt; I know yall love your country but we dont worry about hick KKK groups or ban rated R games. Its something that annoys me and never gets any press on reddit. Yes our Constitution isnt perfect (or the way we execute it) but we really do believe in it. We believe in the freedom we purport to love.

Yes, and that's the point I was trying to make. We just live in different societies, and societies are shaped by their history. There are many things about the US that I just can't comprehend, that I find appalling, inhumane, paranoid or, quite frankly, just retarded. But I understand that this is through a lens that was shaped by the society *I* grew up in, and that my perception is based on the values I was raised with. Sometimes I can see the inner logic behind it, sometimes I assume I just don't know the US well enough to understand certain attitudes. And hey, sometimes I even come across things I like or even admire.

That's why I tried to contrast our ""Human Dignity"" vs. your ""Freedom of Speech"" in my other comment, as they are given about similar priorities in our respective societies.  
Our experience with a very liberal (in the classic sense) constitution was that it couldn't handle the stress, and once it fell, all the rights went out the window and weren't of any help. Lesson learned: Make sure the society that guarantees those rights doesn't fail.  
It's not just one right that's important, there are many. Sometimes they're in conflict, and have to be weighted against each other. ""My freedom ends where yours begins,"" but where exactly is that? Those differences in where you draw the line and how you weight conflicting rights against each other define a society. 

That's one reason why I like to spend time on an international forum like Reddit, to learn about different perspectives and attitudes. I'm interested in an outside perspective on Europe in general and Germany especially, because that's the perspective I inherently can't have. It helps me question things I take for granted, and highlights the larger patterns that you can only recognize from a distance, but not when you're standing right in front of them."

European insurance (I assume you are talking about health insurance, since I have seen few price differences in other insurance -- rather, it seems cheaper in the US, if anything -- surprising, given the litigation structure in that country) is generally in some form obligatory and built into the tax system (via social contributions).  It has its problems, but it does seem to be far less worse than the current system.  Maybe Obamacare will fix it, who knows.

American housing is definitely, with the exception of certain cities, cheaper than comparable areas in many European countries.  From what I have seen, this is true for rents and for purchase prices.  I could only dream of homes going for the equivalent of $100k in France, the UK, or Germany.

&gt; but unfortunately it's just wishful thinking. I

Public transportation in most urban agglomerations exists -- it's just really bad and insufficient.  People do not use it, nor do they push for its improvement to the point where it is consistently usable, because it is cheaper to drive.  

Look at the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly SF, arguably possessed of one of the better public transit networks in the country.  Twenty years ago, BART or not, it was pathetic.  In the meantime, SF made major investments in MUNI (whose buses still stink, and whose train coverage is poor but vastly less so than when I was growing up there), BART was extended significantly and equipped with commuter garages, CalTrain received a lot of attention, Santa Clara county (San Jose) built a light rail system, etc. etc. etc.  

Meanwhile, everyone was told that they should be able to own a house, and bought property as far away as Stockton, which suffered one of the worst crashes in the country.  Now they have huge commutes and worthless houses.  That is not sustainable.

&gt; America was designed for commuting on cheap gasoline. 

No, it was not.  Some of it grew that way because of the lack of a need for good public transit.  Los Angeles used to have one of the premier urban public transportation networks in the country.  It was dismantled.  

And that's no excuse -- I'm sorry to say, Lagos, Nigeria is in the same boat.  Sprawl sprawl sprawl, without bothering with any sort of planning or adequate allocation of transportation resources, and you're going to have to go through some pain until you figure out where your priorities lie.

That's not sour grapes, just a statement of fact.  Cheap gasoline is gone, probably forever.  

&gt; People don't change until they're forced to, so car makers can make all the high mileage cars they want, but you won't see but a small percentage of the population switching to them because people won't be forced to.

I'd say not being able to support your gasoline bill is pretty tantamount to being forced to change something.  And if people can still afford it and are willing to put up with the high price, well wa-hey, welcome to France/England/Germany."

Messi? I completely understand that it's all about this year, and he's been fantastic, but when he was 20, Barca didn't win anything at all."

I remember a few years ago, people were talking about Wimax being the GSM evolution path, and now it is LTE. In any case LTE is not a specific technology of a GSM catchall keyword. For example, Verizon's implementation of LTE does not have SIM cards.

&gt; Care to elaborate?

UMTS is actually another name for a version of CDMA technology. GSM's TDMA based system is actually quite inferior, that even European companies decided that they should pay up Qualcomm to use CDMA patents. Basically UMTS is CDMA with SIM cards (if in doubt check the Wikipedia article). CDMA is also more resistant to interference, and lacks many synchronization issues present in TDMA technology. It also tends to use the spectrum much more efficiently, as there is no waste of a reserved but unused channel.

tldr: CDMA &gt; TDMA, which is the tech behind GSM. UMTS is CDMA with SIM cards."

Solution:  Don't *add* a holiday.  Repurpose / shift an existing holiday.  [Here's the list](http://www.opm.gov/Operating_Status_Schedules/FEDHOL/2011.asp) of US Government employees' holidays.

Columbus Day seems like a reasonable candidate:

* It's (the second Monday) in October, which is not that far from election day, so you're not shifting things around too much.  (Long periods with no time off == yuck.)
* It has fallen out of favor a bit anyway, since it's a celebration of European oppression of the New World or something.

And to be fair, it's not as though we have a strategic language like English to learn, as we already know it. And European languages require some considerable time actually spent in the country to attain fluency, and Europe is half a world away by plane. Chinese is probably an upcoming strategic language for Aussies to learn, but there is a steep learning curve which probably puts many off, and considering many people learn English to gain access to western music and movies, until people see quality entertainment coming from China, there may not be the same incentive to learn Chinese.
I'm all for getting languages to a high priority in schools and society, but implying Aussies are ignorant because everyone doesn't know a second language is a disengenious analysis of a complex problem.

It will save you a ton of money.  When you do travel around the UK (which you will), book your tickets online a few days in advance.  It will save you hundreds.

Other than that, be willing to spend money.  Lots of it.  British students do very little work compared to students in the US (at least this was my experience), so you'll probably have endless free time to go traveling (unless you want to drink yourself silly).  I highly recommend traveling.  Europe is quite small, and airplane tickets are cheap.  Use RyanAir or WizzAir and go on weekend excursions to places (Often less than $60 round trip.  Book a few weeks in advance, if possible).

useful links:
http://eastcoast.co.uk  (I found them to have the best site for train travel)
http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/Offers/funfares.cfm

You can often find ridiculously cheap coach (think greyhound) funfares around the UK.  So keep up to date on the travel prices.

Oh, and the train system doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense if you ponder it too much.  Often, the tickets you get are not really for a specific time, so you can frequently go later or earlier.  It really depends, but you'll perhaps get the hang of it.

Also, I'd recommend NOT hanging out with the Americans -- it's too easy to do this, and you might not get to experience all the other Europeans who are often pretty awesome."

The comma is also used to divide grammatical structures (in some (many?) continental Europe languages that is basically *all* it is used for in a sentence). And periods are also used for abbreviations in every language using a latin derived character set.

&gt; I'll let you figure it out from there, or you can tell me how my statement is incorrect or irrelevent.

Since a number is a single entity separating it analogously to sentences is absurd (and of course abbreviations are completely different). It is much more akin to interrelated grammatical structures in a single sentence. In fact, if the grammatical separator wasn't spelled out in speech, a pause would be a possible, if ambiguous (much like pause commas), way to indicate it.

The only illogical use of . would be as a thousand separator and, indeed, sane European languages use small, unobtrusive amount of whitespace.

I'd say figuring it out your way is counterintuitive and the statement is irrelevant since decimal numbers don't have a sentence like divide. "

Our economy isn't horrible, but our unemployment rate is traditionally twice the US's, our childhood poverty rate is horrible, all of our natives are on welfare and we're pretty sure there's some immigrant groups which are also entirely on welfare but we don't know for sure because nobody keeps stats on that stuff.

We have some of the top living conditions in the world and we don't brag about it, except we brag about the fact that we don't brag about it all the fucking time.
