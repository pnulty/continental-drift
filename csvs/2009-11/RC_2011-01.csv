Just like in the United States, actual citizens have right of way when it comes to picking a candidate for a job. The reasons for that are obvious: where foreigners need to adapt to cultural differences, locals are already ""ready to go"". In addition to that, foreigners often have higher salary requirements and hiring them means that the company will have to fill a ton of paperwork.

In my opinion, your best shot at finding a job here is to get transferred from an US branch of a company to a French subsidiary/succursal. This indeed means that you would be working for a large company, which is not necessarily easy especially considering that US companies tend to find Ireland a lot more attractive for branchs. France's high tax rate on companies make it a somewhat undesirable place to do business as a foreign company.
And of course, there is the fact that no matter how hard you study and practice, your knowledge of French will always be weaker than that of a French-born worker.

The few Americans working here in Lyon (or in other places) transferred here from management positions in the United States or Canada. A few years ago, my dad and his associates sold their company to a very large US firm (medical field) and some of the firm's execs started working here in Lyon as liaison agents or simply local execs.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm still a student but I was interning at an US company in France last summer and I found myself in a company that was shifting over from French workplace management to US-like workplace management (you guessed it... My dad's company) and I must say, the latter is a lot more rigid and nonsensical than the former.

Overall, I believe that working in an European environment as an American would do you much good and be a very enriching experience. Not to mention how much it would add to your work experience when you go back to the United States.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help but I'm still a student. As for life in France, I would be extremely glad to tell you whatever you want to know over emails or private Reddit messages. Seriously. Contact me.",3,True,t3_eu7y3,0,False,c1b0c7e,

Imagine that you're a teenager, who loves watching G.I. Joe, and dreams:

""I want to be a soldier one day, and free the innocent from the clutches of the evil communist monsters.""

So you put your mind to becoming a U.S. soldier, because you believe in stuff like freedom and happiness.

In between, you hear about things like, ""Iran tortures American hostages"", or ""China bloodily prevents protests in Tiananmen Square"", or ""Another journalist killed for what they say"" or ""Soviet Russia: Now with even more censorship!""

""No way!"" You imagine. ""We must spread the awesomeness of Freedom and happiness to those sad, enslaved people! It's my duty as an American!""

Quickly being enlisted as a private, you parade through your hometown, giving speeches about ""I believe that not only Americans, but people around the world should enjoy the awesomeness of freedom!"" People cheer! ""Fight for freedom! Fight for justice!"" your girlfriend yells.

Sent off to Afghanistan, you go with a small feeling of revenge, but also with empathy for those who are so blinded that they attack the freedom that American intervention gives them. Everything, your sanity and your friends was lost, but you remain firm with the thought that: 

""This is what must be done for the oppressed, and for the free at home.""

But things change. While defending a girl's school from the evil Taliban, the mission changes.

""Get your ass over to Iraq! We've got new orders.""

Iraq? We didn't even find Bin Laden yet. Why are we leaving?

""They've got WMD, they torture citizens, they kill thousands without reason! Let's go, private!""

So you wave sadly to the educated, veiled girls, knowing that they will be at risk of a terrorist attack the instant soldiers leave. Your commander sees you sadly waving to them.

""Don't worry, private. They're sending a new unit in soon."" Your stress then lowers.

You say quietly to yourself, ""Everyone deserves freedom. Iraqis deserve it, too.""

Later in Iraq, you helped kick Saddam's sorry ass back to the hell it came from. In the streets of Baghdad, people cheer for you, as they have achieved freedom. A little girl cheers for you.

Years pass, and things are still bad in Iraq. New rules of engagement come in, forcing soldiers to shoot anyone who looks at them funny. Strangely, the same people who cheered for America are now horrified by the sight of a U.S. soldier. 

""Must be those damn terrorists and their propaganda.""

A new order comes in. ""There's a terrorist hidden in a house about two miles from here! Shoot anything that moves.""

POW! Gunfire noises. ""Terrorists! Freedom-haters! You shall die by my hand!""

""Hey! Private! We got the terrorist!""

A camera? Some pieces of paper? ""But there weren't any weapons!"" You think.

Back at the base, a headline grabs your eyes. ""10 girls killed during attack on school."" No. It can't be.

Why'd I come here? Why did I have to abandon them?

Another job comes up. It's in intelligence. And they want you to handle it.

""It's not for the faint of heart, private. Prove to me that you can handle it.""

""Don't worry, I've seen worse. As long as it helps me defend freedom, and happiness from those evil, hostage killing terrorists.""

It's a room. Filled with secrets. You know what secrets lie in there. Horrible ones, about other countries who hate freedom, and threaten journalists. But as long as America knows these horrors, those evil countries will never be safe again.

The crimes against humanity seep into your mind, about endless torture, people laughing when they blow up a busful of children, lies, cover-ups, and corruption everywhere.

The worst part? It was the culprit. A name you never imagined that would be associated with such war crimes.

America.

The person you apprehended? He was tortured to make him confess. The girl's school? Accidental drone strike. 15,000 more casualties than reported. Horrible atrocities kept away from the public's eyes. All of this fits Soviet Russia better, not the freedom-fighting America.

You come out, submit your report, and go out to lunch.

""Hey. Jim.""

""Whut?""

""If you saw that someone was causing horrible atrocities, what would you do?""

""Hey. Aren't you an American? Have you forgotten what we came here for? We came here to blow the shit out of those who hate freedom and who enslave and torture people.""

""What if it had been kept secret? What would you do?""

""Why do you even have to think about that? Remember the Nazis? If someone had spoken out against the Holocaust, and got people to stop it, there WOULD BE NO HOLOCAUST. But no, those little underlings just let it be, and us Americans had to save Europe. If I were at Nuremberg, and I tried one of those faggots, I would call for the goddamn death penalty.""

""Well, what if America did war crimes? Would you report them?""

""What the hell, man? Why would we do war crimes? We punish war criminals. We punish evil terrorists. You're telling me we would do war crimes?""

""Uh... yeah! I was just speaking rhetorically.""

What would you do in this situation? Horrible atrocities were kept secret. We tortured people even when there wasn't a shred of evidence that they were terrorists. We killed journalists without reason, and laughed after shooting anti-tank rounds at them.

If one of our founding fathers caught wind that America was doing this, they would have called for revolution. They would have leaked those secrets so the culprits could be put to justice. If our reputation was at stake, it wasn't because the atrocities were leaked. It was because we conducted them, and allowed them to happen. They would have condemned those who saw these secret atrocities, and didn't report them, as the real traitors. And now you're telling me that he should be hanged?

Or you can think of it like this. You're a German Nazi in an investigative sector. Propoganda keeps telling you that everyone else is the evil enslavers. But at the same time, you find out that Nazis raped Polish women, burned Jews, and suppressed freedoms. If you leaked those secrets, at least some people would be outraged, and would have stopped all this in a revolt. But you would gain serious enemies, and might even be killed. So what would you do? Live a cushy life while people died? Or gone out and did the right thing?",1,True,t3_eu7ds,0,False,c1b0chc,

The origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in Vatican-Argentine relations before and during World War II.[2] As early as 1942, Monsignor Luigi Maglione contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the ""willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European Catholic immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country"".[3] Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to Portugal, continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration.[3] According to historian Michael Phayer, ""this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline"".[3]

Spain, not Rome, was the ""first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists"", although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican.[4] Charles Lescat, a French Catholic member of Action Française (an organization suppressed by Pius XI and rehabilitated by Pius XII), and Pierre Daye, a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government, were among the primary organizers.[5] Lescat and Daye were the first able to flee Europe, with the help of French cardinal Eugene Tisserant and Argentine cardinal Antonio Caggiano.[5]

By 1946, there were probably hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists.[6] According to US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Vatican cooperation in turning over asylum-seekers was ""negligible"".[6] According to Phayer, Pius XII ""preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in POW camps in zonal Germany"".[7] Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy, centered on Vatican City, the ratlines of Spain, although ""fostered by the Vatican"" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.[8]

&gt; Because it performs so poorly relative to more secure democracies, the status of the
U.S. as an advanced 1st world nation is marginal and may even be at risk; the World Economic
Forum recently downgraded the U.S. from its long standing first place status in global
economic competitiveness, ranking some other democracies as more competitive (WEF, 2007).
The societal and economic failings of the U.S. are all the more remarkable and difficult to
explain because no major nation has such extensive financial and physical resources with
which to overcome its internal defects. With ~5% of the world’s population the U.S. possesses
a quarter of the global financial assets and uses a similar portion of the planet’s energy
production; but this means that America is the least efficient advanced nation in terms of
converting wealth and assets into social health (Marks et al., 2006; Rosnick and Weisbrot,
2006; Sapolsky, 2005).

Here’s what WHO has to say about it:

&gt;*Definition and principle sources*

&gt;PM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The particles are identified according to their aerodynamic diameter, as either PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 µm) or PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm). The latter are more dangerous since, when inhaled, they may reach the peripheral regions of the bronchioles, and interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs.

&gt;*Health effects*

&gt;The effects of PM on health occur at levels of exposure currently being experienced by most urban and rural populations in both developed and developing countries. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer. In developing countries, exposure to pollutants from indoor combustion of solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections and associated mortality among young children; indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is also a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer among adults. The mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15–20%. Even in the EU, average life expectancy is 8.6 months lower due to exposure to PM2.5 produced by human activities.

But since there are still some unresolved misunderstandings between us, let's hit a couple more points.    
    
I don't want to be convinced of ""this"". What did you mean when you said ""this?"" I would love to have clarity on moral questions. I am endlessly muddled. And I have to admit that even though these philosophical debates that right and wrong is objective are indeed old matters in philosophy (utilitarians were ""just"" saying that secular evaluations of what hurts people vs. what makes them happy is a worthy substitute for fundamentalist scriptural ethics--and they won the debate on many fronts, such as slavery, routine torture of petty criminals, etc.), they are worth reframing and pushing to the fore because people in the international sector really are using cultural relativism as a blank check for what are, in my mind, true crimes (mainly in the Muslim world as far as I can see, though your example of sexuality is a good one insofar as I agree that a mature and humane prostitution industry or consensual sex between teenagers should be legal). 

Harris is definitely affirming, not introducing, ""well-being"" as a unit of measure for what's good for the world. It's the basis for the globally espoused ethics of the UN Millennium Development Goals, among many other things.   
   
Sam's new argument in this book isn't that it's immoral to have religiously mandated laws, I'm １00% on board with that claim, because my morals (which come from philosophy), prioritize prevention of human suffering over cultural tradition. I've always liked Sam's (and your) critiques of such things, because our moral philosophies align. I disagreed earlier that it was a big deal to announce to the world that ""hay, we're scientists and we can measure suffering and well-being"" (which seemed obvious to me given that I'm surrounded by academics who do exactly that and are involved in politics/public health). I still disagree that science tells us that suffering and well-being are the end-all and be-all of morality (as Sam repeatedly implies in his talks).    
   
I'd also like to recommend a short reading to you, the freely available [preface](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Ethics-Leslie-Stephen/dp/141020782X#reader_141020782X) to Leslie Stephen's *Science of Ethics*, published in 1882. Gives a short intro to some books on the topic that seem to me to be historically relevant predecessors to Harris.     
     
I think you think you're at the start of a revolution, while I think you're in a revolution against the religious morals that is 90% complete in the USA and even higher in some liberal European countries.   
     
I don't cringe at destroying human life. I'm in favor of keeping abortion legal and by the logic I described, killing skin cells should also be illegal in a few years once we can grow them into clones of ourselves too. The burqa argument is very easy to follow but it doesn't address the fact that the reason for the burqa has nothing to do with human suffering, it involves other dimensions of morality that are not really part of science, they're part of philosophy.

How good would it be to get inside the Vatican archives?

The Vatican also refuses to open its archives in the matter of [Croatian Holocaust victims](http://www.vaticanbankclaims.com/press2.html) seeking to sue it for compensation from the [Croatian State Treasury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Works_of_Religion#Other_allegations) funds that were transferred wholesale to the Vatican Bank.

There is however undisputable evidence of facilitating the escape of Croation Fascist being Vatican policy. From [this link](http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/the_vatican.htm): 

&gt;Following the Nazi invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia was established as a clerical-fascist state under the rule of the Croatian fascist party, the Ustashe. Some 700,000 Serbs, Jews, Romas and other anti-fascists were killed in the Jasenovac death-camp complex, while many more were killed in smaller camps or in local massacres. While the Ustashe regime set about to racially exterminate all Serbs, Jews and Romas living within its borders, it also carried out a systematic policy of plundering the assets of these three nationalities. These looted assets, the property of millions of people, were never recovered. The bulk of it was smuggled out of Croatia at the end of the war to the Vatican, and from there to still other destinations. 


&gt;the looting by the Nazi's of Europe's gold, including victims of the holocaust in Yugoslavia, and how the Swiss profited from it from banking it, and how they kept it safe for the nazi movement after the war by moving it to either Spain or Portugal and then on to countries such as Argentina. As The Observer noted on 7th December 1997:

    ""Some of the bullion went via the Vatican and the Iberian dictatorships to Latin America, the destination of choice for Nazis on the run""

A study commissioned by the Swiss government estimated that Swiss banks received about £2 billion in looted gold stolen from the mainly Jewish, Roma and Slavic victims of the Nazi holocaust (The Guardian December 5th 1997). The Papal State has come under heavy pressure to open it's archives. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) released a declassified letter from the US treasury which showed that in 1946, the Americans were told that:

    ""Money and gold stolen from the Jews and Serbs (in Yugoslavia) were sent to the Vatican"" (The Guardian, December 5th 1997).

And also:
&gt;In turn, the Vatican set up a ""smokescreen"", pretending to forward the gold to Franco's fascist regime in Spain, and then onto Argentina. Under the dictator Juan Peron and his wife Evita, Argentina became a safehaven for other escaped Nazi war criminals such as Klaus Barbie, Adolph Eichmann, and Joseph Mengele. (The Guardian, 23rd July 1997).

 &gt;The Vatican not only hoarded the gold the Croats looted, it also helped them escape - with a nod and wink from the OSS and MI6. In 1986 for example, the US government released documents that revealed the Vatican had organised Pavelic's safe-flight from Europe to Argentina, along with 200 senior officials of his regime. During their escape, they had hidden ""frequently in cloisters"" in Catholic churches and in many instances, had ""disguised themselves as Franciscan monks"", according to Vladimar Dedijer , writing in The Yugoslav Auschwitz (Ahriman-Verlag, Freiburg, Germany, 1988, p53).

On the basis of ""Harris morality"", I would argue that it certainly is immoral to have religiously mandated laws: The set of moral decisions you make based on the ""well-being"" standard differs from those made on the basis of religion; and if ""well-being"" is your standard then the shit that comes from the Bible, wherever it differs, is immoral; and where it agrees, is redundant.

Harris argues, for a whole chapter, that well-being is the *only* standard for morality that is relevant and makes any sense. This appealed strongly to me and I'm convinced. If you don't agree, I think you're still the victim of some muddled thinking. Of course, not having read the book also puts you at a bit of a disadvantage. I don't remember enough of his arguments to lay them out for you and -I'm sorry- I'm too lazy to quote mass quantities for you from the text.

The USA holds some positively medieval views on morality. I get the impression parts of USA are closer to the Middle Ages than modernity. 90% is hugely overstated, I say. I would put European countries at 80-90% and the US at maybe 50-60%.

From [Wiki/science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)

&gt;Science (from the Latin scientia, meaning ""knowledge"") is an enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [natural world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature)

Digging deeper:

&gt;Nature is a word used in two major sets of ways in English and other European languages. These meanings are inter-connected in a complex way, for reasons related to the history of science, epistemology and metaphysics, particularly in Western Civilization.

&gt;1. In modern scientific writing ""nature"" refers to all directly observable phenomena of the ""physical"" or material universe, and it is contrasted only with any other sort of existence, such as spiritual or supernatural existence. In a scientific text, the unqualified term “nature” normally means the same as “the cosmos” or “the universe”.

IE, this is the traditional definition of science, represented rather poorly in an unsourced Wikipedia article.  

&gt;2. Historically, and also in casual speech, “nature” does not include all things, because it excludes the artificial or man-made. For example it generally does not include manufactured objects, and also generally does not include human interaction. In this case, the unqualified term “nature” generally means the same as “wilderness” or “the Natural environment”.

This excludes the social sciences.  But it's folly to investigate the natural world without taking into account the human interaction because much can be learned from another.  A historical investigation into a past event would use many scientific disciplines in their approach (carbon dating, metallurgy, organic chemistry for art history, etc.).  

&gt;An older meaning still in use today is that of Aristotle, for whom scientific knowledge was a body of reliable knowledge that can be logically and rationally explained.

Aristole would call the investigation of that history, entirely of man-made interactions as it were, science.  I defer to Aristotle above Wikipedia.",4,True,t3_euadi,0,False,c1b0mag,

In compiling this list, priority goes to shows with complete, or nearly complete, recordings readily available to ordinary collectors, are reasonably good quality recordings, are of exceptional performances, or have some notable historical significance either as classic bootlegs or as preserving historically significant performances. 

Earlier versions of this list identified particular bootlegs to get for these shows. In this revision I've removed most of these recommendations since they regularly go out of date as new sources or new versions of available sources emerge. For information about which sources to procure for these shows, I recommend perusing the thread for the shows you want here in the What Place To Rest The Search forum. If a show has no such thread, post a request in this thread and surely someone familiar with the show and its available sources will fill you in on the relevant details.

Must-Haves
These bootlegs offer a sampling of what I think are the best sounding and highest quality complete or nearly complete performances from all their different eras. The emphasis here is on shows that have for a long time been regarded as key moments in Led Zeppelin's performing career, though some newly circulating shows merit inclusion.

1969.01.05 Los Angeles, Whisky A Go-Go - The second earliest recording to appear. The recording probably was made in-house, from the stage. An energetic performance overall. Includes the Yardbirds tune For Your Love.

1969.04.27 San Francisco, Fillmore West - Available in a great quality SBD recording, as well as an AUD recording that together offer a complete recording of one of their best ever shows. See the Classic Bootlegs section below.

1969.08.31 Lewisville, TX (Dallas) - A short performance at the Texas Pop Festival. A nearly complete SBD recording and an AUD recording offer together a complete version of this great performance. Some video footage exists from a documentary about the festival.

1970.03.07 Montreux, Switzerland - The SBD recording is inferior to the very good AUD recording, but using the SBD to fill the gaps in the AUD, the complete show is available.

1970.09.04 Inglewood, LA Forum - The show which yielded probably the most famous Led Zeppelin bootleg of them all: ""Live on Blueberry Hill,"" named on account of the final encore of this classic show. The second Led Zeppelin show ever to be bootlegged, and even then, back in late 

1970, two different recordings circulated. By now, numerous AUD recordings of this show circulate, and various combinations of them allow for the complete show. See the Classic Bootlegs list. See also the rare performances of LZ songs list.

1971.04.01 London BBC - The official release is heavily edited. A Pre-FM Master recording includes the entire performance, including a longer Heartbreaker solo, more elements of the Whole Lotta Love medley, and a false start to What Is and What Should Never Be. See the Classic Bootlegs list below.

1971.09.29 Osaka, Japan - Numerous sources for this great show circulate, and in various combinations offer the complete show. See the Classic Bootlegs list below. See also the rare performances of LZ songs list (this show is the source of the only known concert performance of Friends). See also the Japanese Tours list for more gems from the 1971 Japanese Tour. 

1972.06.25 Inglewood, LA Forum - Some of this show is on ""How the West Was Won,"" but out of proper order and mixed with tracks from (the also great) Long Beach show two nights later. On the bootleg you hear the complete show including quite a bit of interaction with the lively crowd. The encores are fantastic.

1972.10.02 Tokyo, Japan - Another great performance. The Whole Lotta Love medley includes Killing Floor, I Can't Quit You Baby and You Shook Me. See the Japanese tours lists below. On the Historically Significant Shows list since it includes the first ever performances of The Song Remains the Same and The Rain Song.

1973.01.22 Southampton, England - A recording taken from the multi-track tapes of a professional recording by the band, so the sound quality is outstanding. A sometimes rough, but generally energetic performance (especially by Bonzo), with interesting use of the Mellotron by Jones.

1973.03.24 Offenburg, Germany - Considered by many to be among the best of the Spring 1973 European Tour. See the section below on the Spring 1973 European tour, and the Classic Bootlegs list.

1973.07.21 Providence - One of the best shows from the 1973 US Tour. Generally good performance, and a very energetic crowd. The AUD recording is nearly complete.

1975.02.14 Uniondale - The most recent of the steady flow of 1975 soundboards is a great one. Filling the gaps in the SBD with bits from the AUD recording offers a complete version of perhaps the best of the early 1975 shows. The introductory jam to Heartbreaker is unique.

1975.05.25 London, Earl's Court - The closing night of the five night stand at Earl's Court. See the Earl's Court and video sections below.

1977.04.27 Cleveland - Not the best show from 1977, but not the worst either. The quality of the nearly complete SBD is very good, though. This show was bootlegged shortly after the performance, and so is quite familiar to older collectors. See the Classic Bootlegs list.

1977.06.21 Inglewood, LA Forum - A great performance with a great quality AUD recording. With the tape flips patched by material from a lower-quality recording of the same show, the entire show is available. The show opener, The Song Remains the Same is available in one of the menus for the official Led Zeppelin DVD. Plant's introduction of Bonzo before the Over the Top solo is particularly amusing. See the Classic Bootlegs and Mike ""the Mike"" Millard sections below.

1979.08.04 Stevenage, Knebworth Festival - Their last truly great performance (though of course this show has its detractors), very well documented in a swarm of AUD recordings and a SBD recording drawn from the virtually complete professionally shot video of the show, all of which circulate widely. See the video and classic bootleg sections below.

1980.06.29 Zurich, Switzerland - The complete show is available in SBD and AUD recordings. Some rough spots, but overall a good performance. See the Classic Bootlegs section below.

As for the gap, there are probably 2 or 3 main causes. 
1. If you're about to die, and you want to end up as a fossil skeleton the vast majority of resting places will not result in you being fossilized. Conditions really have to be perfect, which is why you hear so much about cave sites having early modern human fossils. Exposure to elements is low, and there's a possibility of being quickly covered by sediments that wont just dissolve bone. So if you're being buried out on a nice pasture on top of a hill that will probably erode in a couple thousand years expecting to enjoy your fossil-afterlife, good luck. 
Aside from that, even if you end up in a cave, there's always the possibility that you're going to get chewed up by some scavenger and scattered all over the place. 

2 and 3 really boil down to a sound research plan and luck. You can't just excavate every cave in the middle east. And even if you do, you sure as hell will not be able to excavate every square foot of that cave.  Time and money are very limiting factors in archaeology.

HSBC is (has) relocating (relocated) to Beijing and has sent the best message I have heard: [Capitol is mobile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyqJauH0hDM&amp;start=17m15s) {start at 17:15}.

I'm sure many /r/finance readers are aware that China is/will be the next superpower and that the United States Empire is falling (history has shown us that all empires do, this was inevitable). I wanted to make this to clearly show the data that support this conjecture. Keep in mind the data I linked are mostly from 2009 and that China is in a better position than ever, while the USA recovered slightly in employment, but has more debt and little improvement in exports.

Some people have speculated that China is the next Japan. I believe this is ludicrous. The two are entirely different situation and while both ""Asian,"" that is where their similarities end.

Others have also pointed out that perhaps the internet/technology economy will save us. To those people I say ""Capitol is mobile."" As we have seen, large tech companies (ie: Google) can move money around seamlessly to [reduce their tax rates](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html). You better believe that other large and intelligent companies use similar tactics or will now. Other companies move operations around to circumvent regulations (IE: The use of sweatshops for labor). When a market or (skilled) workforce changes location, companies will follow.

The only questions that really remain are: how long will the full switch take to be recognized? and, How will the U.S.A., China, and the world react to this?

I find it hard to believe that the U.S.A. will take this lying down. It has also been generally accepted that the U.S.A. flaunted its position at the top of the world. I think this is only natural. However, others (people and other countries) do not take kindly to this. This is analogous to the kid who was bragging that he was the shit at a basketball, then soon a new kid comes along who challenges him. It results in a 1v1 game, and the new kid schools the previous champion who had rubbed his prowess in others faces. The former champion is then subject to harassment by other players AND the new champion. 

I'm not saying there will be some type of 1v1 battle between the USA and China, or that there will be a war, or a world war at that. I am merely pointing out something worth paying attention to.

Another point is that the USA fiscal policy is based on issuing new debt. In order to issue debt, you need to have people willing to buy USA's debt. Now when China begins issuing debt, I believe they will keep tighter reigns on it relative to gross GDP. However, China's debt will be in high demand. You have a new entrant into the market which reduces demand for the USA's debt inherently but this also leaves us with another question: Will countries even want our debt when China takes the thrown of world superpower? We have kicked every country (or nearly every country) in the shins, and it is possible that they have only dealt with the USA because we were still the superpower. If that is taken, what incentive do they have left?

What happens is also largely dependent on how the EU fiasco resolves.

Right now though with current debt levels at what they are, the USA and the EU could be purchased via debt by China (if they take the USA's place) and they would be under the economic control of China. I don't know if Russia or Brazil would be interested in joining forces with China or what but they are also two countries who are in good circumstances right now and they are improving.

Sorry for the long post, but I had more to write than just this. I think this subject deserves this type of discussion.

Any comments, questions, critiques, etc. are encouraged.

1) The director cared enough to play through the games before filming the movies (By his own admission). This is clear to anyone who is merely paying attention the visual style of the film. 

This is an achievement in itself because most directors couldn't give a shit about capturing the cinematography and the visual style of the source material. There are scene for scene, shot for shot remakes of scenes from the original game. I'm sure you can identify them.

2) The director cared enough to hire Akira Yamaoka for creative input and musical direction. The creative team cared enough to put actual music from the game in the film. It could have easily been a soundtrack of b-side marilyn manson/nin songs, but the director was intelligent enough to know that music was part of the spirit of silent hill. You can't have silent hill without Akira's music. Period. A thousand points for that.

3) I agree with your first and second points, I'd file that under the category of the movie's flaws. I actually thought the transition from the real world to the dark silent hill world was perfectly captured in the film, and it was the only good thing about Homecoming. 

The director does a pretty good job of balancing taking creative liberties where needed, and being faithful to the spirit of games.

It looked like they secured another European director to shoot the second film, which is good because us Americans don't have the sensibilities to do horror anymore. The silent hill video game series itself took a nosedive when it was left in the hands of an American studio (Homecoming).

What they SHOULD DO, is hire David Lynch to direct the third silent hill film. I recommend watching inland empire, there are scenes that had me and my brother saying, wow, he'd be perfect for a silent hill film. Don't bother making it scary.

China is surprisingly tolerant as a society of LGBT... or at least the LG part. (Don't think the BT part is past the status of ""What?? o that, isn't that what they do in Thailand lol?"") It's a different kind of 'tolerance' than you might expect in the west, it's more of a ""as long as you don't try to mess with me, I don't care at all"" for a lot of people. But there's sorta a catch, they will most likely look at you funny and/or talk under their breath with their friends right in front of you. It's hard to describe, but it won't be malicious, and it is not as much straight homophobia as it is more like 'homo-curiousness' in that you = novelty and they might poke/prod/stare at you like a weirdly colored jelly. They treat a lot of strange/uncommon/foreign things in that way.

In modern/pop Asian culture (see: Japan - re: 'androgynous'), there is even a certain kind of regard for 'middle-gender' and some take that concept even further, making a lot of the younger generations in urban places pretty open minded in those terms. I rarely went to clubs/bars because I never felt it was for me, but I had tons of friends that always went and were pretty deep in that 'scene,' so I always heard stuff, saw stuff, etc, so hopefully I'm not too far off base here.

There were a few clubs/bars that were known as 'gay bars,' and the stigma attached with those was about the same as you'd expect from a bunch of alpha males in America joking with each other - ""hey man why don't you go to *that* place, you look pretty fruity today lololol""... not much more IMO. Of course, older generations it's pretty different, and it's entirely unheard of for kids to 'come out,' and it is in fact assumed that there is something wrong with you if you can't/don't get a girlfriend by a certain age, and don't get married by a certain age, and don't have kids by another age.

That all said, the younger generations (especially those that go clubbing etc) are, as mentioned above, largely pretty open minded when it comes to it. In a very vague and generic fashion, here's a random guess - responses generally range from the extremes of ""cool"" to ""wtf gay i'm gonna get my buds and beat your ass,"" with a majority probably going 'wut' or just pretending it doesn't exist. 

**EDIT to add**It's different in school/etc of course for kids, as I said it's pretty much unheard of to come out, but the point I'm trying to make here I guess is that bar/club context is pretty different, in fact you might find that Chinese are entirely different people/personalities when it comes to parties/clubs/bars/alcohol, the difference can be startling even, but I guess it's a way of dealing with stresses and pressures in everyday life.

--------------
Yeah, you should expect some contempt, especially from other males.. in your context, maybe most relevant would be taxi drivers, bouncers, perhaps bartenders, older more 'Chinese' people. Just a bit though, and like I commented to someone else, it's a really mixed bag out there in China, one taxi driver might hate you so much that he just grunts responses and spits out the window every time you talk, the next might try to speak to you in broken English and ask about your family

You will defo have a harder time getting into clubs. Clubs (and bars to lesser extent) are all about the glamour scene, they want to attract well-to-do Chinese, and having a bunch of white/black hip-looking people is as good an attraction as the best DJs, music, alcohol, etc can ever be. So they love letting foreign looking people in... if you're going to China with foreign looking friends, just tag along or make them come with you, lol, it's the reality of it, sorta sucks I guess. Having white kids with you can do nothing but help in the clubbing scene, unless they steal all the attention once you get in of course. 

But again, not all places are like that, most places I knew of in Beijing had 'VIP lists', plus unwritten or less clear 'super VIP lists', and did give priority to people who met certain combinations of criteria. A couple of my friends got pretty high on certain lists. And on top of all that, the most 'prestigious' clubs do try to maintain some pretense of professionalism and prevent favoritism etc.

&gt; I recall a recent article (Economist? If you're interested I can dig it up when I'm back from holiday with access to a better machine that does not eat draft posts) describing how the Chinese military threat, at least at present, is vastly overrated, if only due to issues like (still) technological lack of capability -- the need to go buy advanced jet engines from the Russians being only one element of this.

Try this one. It is actually very, very good for major publication on a complex defense topic: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402788.html?hpid=topnews

The technological sophistication of China is often over blown. But often times this is because they are moving so fast that it is hard to nail down where they are now. But we must remember that a fight for Taiwan would be right off China's coast, and the geographic advantages would easily make up for decades of technology development and tens of billions in equipment. So China may be overblown as a world power certainly, but she is slowly building a regional dominance. 

&gt; To be honest, I think it's all a moot point, as I do not see China invading Taiwan. 

That is a separate can of worms altogether. Not that it is not extremely relevant, just that it is wholly irrespective of whether they can win or whether Taiwan should prepare. 

&gt; I believe that this is posturing for the benefit of a domestic audience that is assertive and nationalistic, to show that ""look, we have tanks on boats, we could invade Taiwan if we wanted to"".

Yeah as I said before, pictures from the PLA are rarely released by accident. But I doubt it is for the domestic audiences as the nuance of where this monstrosity would be used is likely lost. Fighter planes, tanks and other prestige weapons are the choice for domestic propaganda. I think it is far more likely that this is a message to the world (circa 2003 when I can find first mention of this photo) that despite their deficit in sophisticated conventional platforms, do not discount China's ability to influence its region (because of numbers, proximity and commitment to the Taiwan issue). 

&gt; China, I believe, knows that at least at present, a military assault on Taiwan would expose its fragile and vital overseas supply lines and resource operations to an intolerable degree.

The US can easily cut off China's lines of communication and China is building relationships, ports and pipelines to lessen the significance of this fact. But it is many years before this will not be the case. 

&gt; I don't care what anyone says about the ""String of Pearls"" strategy, China simply does not have the force projection means to defend its economic reach overseas, and will not for a very long time.

The ""string of pearls"" strategy is a concept that was theorized by an American author/officer, and not a confirmed policy. No one credible is saying that China has the capability to defend its overseas trade routes or have that capability for years. 

&gt; Lastly, I am convinced that China's leadership understand that the last thing it wants to do right now is get involved in a shooting war over Taiwan. Even were they to be capable of pulling off a tactical win (note that I am not discounting this at all, it'd just be really really costly and definitely not a sure thing, and it certainly would not be due to this sort of ""weaponry"") it'd be a pyrrhic victory in not just a non-military sense. China of all countries has proven itself to be pretty astute in understanding multifaceted strategy and would not sacrifice other advantages for a military win.

Agreed, but with a few caveats. Recent history has shown China that the rest of the world will forgive many trespasses as long as she provides them a profitable market and cheap goods. [This article that Europe is willing to consider bending to China even a very short time after condemning her for the Nobel Prize controversy.](http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5342402&amp;c=ASI&amp;s=TOP) America is more involved in the region and much more resolved to have a peaceful outcomes. But the rest of world just wants to get a piece of the pie they see as China's expanding economic growth. They will not go along with the US blockading a source of revenue. 

One could say that the situation was the same for the USSR invading Finland during the Cold War. It would have created a major storm on many levels, and likely to be a net loss for the Soviets. But the threat of violence was enough to subjugate the political forces in Finland. In effect it was conquered by intimidation rather than the physical point of a bayonet. See Finlandization. 

&gt; In short, I still don't think this is in any way viable, nor is it likely to be used.

Well I guess we will have to agree to disagree. This is a tool of very limited uses, but in an environment where it could be used. And we know its environment to be similar to other circumstances where it has been used in the past (Sicily, Normandy, Southern France, Italy). And all for a potential conflict that is frequently openly threatened, as well as a potential conflict with increasingly few consequences for the aggressor. ",15,True,t3_eu811,0,False,c1b0z2z,

For example, before world war 2, countries in general were doing badly, mostly because of the aftermath of the great depression. This resulted in a lot of calls for more efficient government, and basically the downfall of democracy in Europe.
By the time of world war II, there were very few democratic governments left in Europe. This not only helped certain totalitarian states to consolidate power, but it's also generally considered to be one of the causes for the ineffective response to totalitarian expansionism which allowed WW2 to grow into as big a problem as it is.

Similar processes also took place in latin america, which still hasn't recovered from the setbacks to democracy.

To focus on the utterly simplistic view of totalitarianism, in which only Nazi genocide was really the problem, would be a mistake. The moral here is rather that people often desire a benevolent dictatorship when democratic processes seem to be too slow or ineffective. The consequences to this are almost always more severe than they seem. 
The simplest example of the problem they pose is, for example, that they establish mechanisms of control which can easily be (and have historically rather often been) subverted.

Note that many of the European autocrats have been highly praised until recently when we have had the chance to actually study what their effect was.

Edit: It's also worth pointing out, for the sake of historical humor, that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were often brought out as examples of functional benevolent dictatorships, and served as something of an example to quite a few authoritarian movements.

Cuba isn't just not allowed to import cars from America but advanced manufacturing, computers, technology and even internet services are blocked from them as a ""sponsor of terror"". Google and Microsoft had to withdraw services from the country so they weren't allowed microsoft messenger as it's ""Licensed software.""



The embargo covers technology companies,  medical technology, medical manufacturing, mining tech companies. Many of the big pieces of new technology that are from international companies who are covered by the US sanctions, US sanctions concerning foreign companies trading with cuba or by companies that want to be favourable with the US government.   
USA is the biggest market for pretty much every product so if the choice is between cuba and a favourable American government who can help it get approved as a product to sell, then there you go.


This is the main issue for Cuba. They are a poor country. Other poor countries focus on manufacturing that utilises cheap labour and that's how they get their money. Cuba by ideology doesn't believe in a race to the bottom of worker conditions vs india or vietnam for labour prices which would make them competitive.


So what did Cuba try and do? Focus on natural resources and a market of medical knowledge / supplies. What's the issue with that? The US embargo blocks sustained progress on them fronts as they can't buy the newest tech to build large scale mines, they can't buy the newest medical tech to save money, they can't use software and certain computers.


It also puts them at a disadvantage when exporting to China, Russia and Canada. They can say to China ""We can provide you with nickel."" but in turn they have to say ""But we can't import the tech from America, can you produce this tech for us, to mine nickel, to sell to you"" when china could simply get it from another country which isn't sanctioned.

They are trading with Canada, Russia and China. People seem to think the economy is completely broken but compared to the rest of the world they're not doing too bad, debt isn't anywhere near 100%+ of GDP like in some European countries, and they're [78th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)_per_capita) out of 190 for generic GDP per capita according to CIA fact book from wikipedia, how trustworthy one doesn't know.



As you can see the embargo isn't simply ""We won't buy your cigs lol!"". It undermines the competitiveness of Cuban products vs others on the world market by restricting efficient tech. It undermines the development of infrastructure with limitations of tech and internet/computer technology. It undermines the ability for Cuba to aim for a knowledge based economy and not one focused on exploiting labour.


Furthermore we have to remember it's embargo and sustained attempts to bring down the government. Like North Korea America's propaganda war and repeated attempts to bring down the government inflate the military budget from paranoia. The propaganda station that America controls is pure propaganda meeting that of Castro's pro-government crap, but Cuba has to combat that with an equal if not more expensive measure. For America millions on a propaganda station is trivial, for Cubans millions to combat it takes away money from elsewhere. So there are sustained attacks on all fronts to undermine any attempts of Cuba to move itself forward. Also anyone can fuck up parts of their economy easily.

Well, it kind of did. Remember, the Korean War started when the North invaded the South.

I think things would be very much worse if the North had succeeded in taking over the South.

&gt;The people in North Korea have to want to change things themselves and spearhead it on their own before anything will improve.

The North Korean people are so browbeaten and propagandized that they probably don't know what they want, most having never known anything other than the current regime.

That being said, I don't think the South would initiate hostilities, Japan certainly wouldn't, the Europeans don't have the stomach for invasion, and the Chinese aren't about to, which leaves only the U.S. leading an invasion of North Korea. That would most likely be a big clusterfuck, in addition to us already having a full plate before us. Short of the North igniting full-on hostilities and being beaten back and taken over, I can only wish that someone in the North would come to power and have the courage and compassion to dissolve a government that is just not working in favor of re-unification, with the South running things, kind of like how Gorbachev dissolved the Soviet Union.

A French Jesuit priest who encountered them in the 1650s wrote: 'No poorhouses are needed among them, because they are neither mendicants nor paupers.... Their kindness, humanity and courtesy not only makes them liberal with what they have, but causes them to possess hardly anything except in common.'""

""Gary Nash describes Iroquois culture: 

*No laws and ordinances, sheriffs and constables, judges and juries, or courts or jails--the apparatus of authority in European societies--were to be found in the northeast woodlands prior to European arrival. Yet boundaries of acceptable behavior were firmly set. Though priding themselves on the autonomous individual, the Iroquois maintained a strict set of right and wrong.... He who stole another's food or acted invalourously in war was ""shamed"" by his people and ostracized from their company until he had atoned for his actions and demonstrated to their satisfaction that he had morally purified himself.*""

You can see why a surface reading of those ideals would appeal to many people in any country, in any day and age.  *Everyone* wants to find a ""baddie"" on whom to blame their woes: this is a big driver for the current polarization in American politics (afflicting both sides).  It's only when ""marginalize"" becomes ""margarine-ize"" that moderates realize just how radical some of the party fanatics are, and recoil and hopefully revolt against the hard-right (or -left) extremists.

So if you break those precepts down into two basic themes (1. boost your local economy, via and alongside 2. shoving ""foreigners"" down &amp; out), you can see the attraction in early TwenCen Europe.  Many countries' economies were suffering badly after WWI, especially Germany.  The German ""nation"" (including bloodlines, language, and physical boundaries) had been weakened repeatedly through inbound immigration and the splitting-off of historically ""Germanic, but not German"" sub-states.  Fascism was seen as somewhat harsh but ultimately reasonable way to simultaneously turn their economy around, by focusing on the ""upright and traditional"" citizens who represented the ""heart"" of the perceived classical Germanic nation, while conveniently shoving out the ""troublemakers"" (Jews, in this case) on whom all recent unluck was blamed.

The question asked by your teacher is deeply relevant today.  Examining the reasons for Fascism's popularity in 1930s Europe is an indirect way of asking yourself whether similar conditions aren't again taking root around the world; not only in central Europe (note Germany's gradually rising frustration toward the last decade's influx of unskilled EU immigrants), but perhaps in America as well (some of the Tea Party demagoguery, however naively intended, bears disturbing echos of Nazi propoganda).

To the rest of the redditors, READ TFA PLEASE.  America is trying to pressure France and Europe to use a real, science-based decision making process with regards to Genetically Engineered foods.  The agricultural industry in Europe told our diplomats that only threatening retaliation would be strong enough to make this happen.

European governments resist GE foods for entirely woo-based reasons.  Please look up the science for yourself, everyone from the National Academy of Science to the Royal Academy and the United Nations have conducted tests, and surveys of tests.  So have the national academies of countries such as Germany, France, Spain, and Australia.  They all concluded that there is no health threat from GE foods.  

In fact, thanks to the rigorous testing the FDA puts them through, they are much safer than ""organic"" cross-bred and ""organic"" radiomutagenetically altered foods.  Many modern foods which we get through cross breeding would not pass the rigorous standards we put forth for GE foods.  Peanuts, Kiwi fruit, and others are much more harmful and cause more deaths per year than any GE food ever has.

It is a GOOD THING to pressure nations to institute science based policy-making on subjects such as GE foods.  That's what we, the rational human beings of the world, want.  Millions of people die every year, and GE foods can lower those numbers drastically, with - according to the overwhelming scientific consensus - no negative health consequences.  

Don't succumb to the same emotional bullshit arguments that catch the anti-global-warming crowd.  Be smarter than them.  Look up the science for yourself, and do it from respected, peer-reviewed journals rather than opinion blogs.  Read the UN report on GE foods, or the Royal Academy of Science report, or the analysis of another equally serious scientific body.  Be smarter than the climate deniers.  Be more rational and science based than the creationists.  Don't be fooled by bad science, shoddy research, and good marketing.  

I am happy that the US is pressuring other nations to institute science based policymaking around GE foods.  GE crops already save hundreds of millions of lives per year, and the number is set to grow.

First off: For better or for worse - mostly better, imo - farming is now an industrial process. For the environmentalists who classify organic farming as a positive process, please look at the numbers in terms of arable land needed, amount of pest- and herbicides required, and carbon footprint increases that would result in the dismantling of industrial agriculture.

Secondly: Europe? Deal with it. Just deal. Be glad you're not having to punch through a Russian or German firewall just to read this website. 
Frankly, there has not been an effective polity on the European continent since 1945. Except the Soviet Union. And even that was a failed 70 year experiment in alternative politics.

France can do what it wants. It has been a debtor nation since 1919, and has effectively committed a national-identity suicide. If the (current) French gov't chooses to deal with it's internal and external security problems, contribute to EU defense, develop it's own advanced agricultural technique, and not blame the US for it's problems; I'm pretty sure everyone would be happier.

All the Brits here: You've been living on US credit since 1946. Look up a man named George Marshall. He is the reason you're not sliding (yet) into a third-world state, and have food in your bellies and a reasonable assurance that you will remain a (semi) functional nation-state. But stop fooling yourselves.

And I guess...to Europeans in general: The United States had to de-fang, and then keep on a leash your worst enemy - Germany. After doing that, the US spent unrecoverable lives and treasure ensuring that you lived and live in a democratic union.

I also posted in a follow up that there are some legitimate concerns but IMO opinion they pale in comparison to what we already do.

&gt;Also, if the EU doesn't want to allow GM crops ""just because"", what's the big problem?

I have no problem with any sovereign nation deciding that they dont want to grow GMOs just as I dont have any problem with any person not wanting to eat them or farmer grow them.  I am not arguing for or against what american did, planned to do or thought about doing, I am only attempting to help explain GMOs.

&gt;And I think the unethical (putting it mildly) practices of Monsanto are more than enough to want to keep that mess contained on the other side of the Atlantic.

I am not defending Monsanto, there are alot of GMOs that are not being produced by Monsanto.  Some of which are being done for very altruistic reasons, see [golden rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice)

Your first example is a perfect illustration of my first point, this is not a GMO or science problem this is a business problem specifically Monsanto thinks its data is strong enough to support its claims whereas the french government does not agree.  Solution do more research until one side is proven correct.  In order to stop things like this from happening we need to have strong Food laws and do good science, the only people who would disagree with this are corporations looking to make money and I am perfectly happy with them disagreeing.

Your second example is actually somewhat of a geniune concern but as I already responded it is largely overblown given what we already do with irradiation and chemical mutagensis (I do see that priegog replied to my response so i will make sure to address what he says).  I am not going to repost what I already wrote, so please read what I have said and will be saying in the link.

Your third example is well disappointing, the first thing he says is completely and utter crap in any 1st world biotech company.  Now I suppose that this could happen in some poorly run biotech company but then it wouldn't be a GMO or science problem but a business and a regulation problem (there are strict regulations on when and how you can expose new GMO plants to the outdoors).

The second thing he brings up has little backing given that he gave no data and I have been unable to find any scholarly source that actually blame the plant for this.  All the source I have found like [this one](http://www.aidenvironment.org/Upload/Docs/2009%20Public%20report%20GM%20Soy.pdf) state the biodiversity is being loss because of increased acreage being planted and herbicide use, this isn't the GMO getting lose and killing biodiversity but farmers tilling more land and using more herbicide.

There were girls I thought looked good or were funny, but they all tried to ""save"" me. I was always like the oddball, me and the other foreign kid. The girls never liked us because we didn't go to church, they only wnated boyfriends who would go to church with their families...needless to say I didn't have a girlfriend throughout high school although I did go on dates. But since this was my first exposure to American girls, I figured most American girls would be like that.

When I got to college, I met a girl on the first day. A Catholic girl. We dated and eventually got into a relationship, but it didn't last long. As I was in school I noticed that most girls were completely opposite from the experience I had in high school. Not only that, but my girlfriend became pushy about her religion and going to church, blah blah blah. At this point, I wanted out because I saw how cool the other girls were and because she too was trying to ""save"" me from my ""hedonistic"" ways. Thing is, religious people are very good about using guilt to manipulate others. She made all sorts of promises about not bothering me about religion, as long as I don't brake up with her. I liked her, aside form the religious thing, so I gave her a shot. Her promise lasted a week, I pointed it out to her, she ignored it. We'd have talks about how I want my beliefs to be my own and that I didn't want everyday to be a failed conversion for her. She started acting all weird after that, incited her friends against me, tried to trick me into religious activities (e.g. one night she told me her friend was having a party and we could go together, I agreed...it was a Bible party...). I had given her a second and a third chance to accept me for who I was, after all she wanted to stay together more than I did, but she never seemed to listen.

 I told her one day that I was through, no more chances and she was crying her eyes out citing Bible verses that she apparently took as relationship advice. She said she had been reading the Bible trying to figure out how to save our relationship, I told her, if she had just put the Bible down she would have saved the relationship. Then she started cursing me, calling me the devil for tempting her and misleading her, etc. I kinda pushed her out into the hall and closed my door. That day, her and her friends decided to vandalize my dorm. They waited until I had left, but forgot to take into consideration that my roommate was still there. My roommate was there when they tried to break in through the window. He said, he could hear someone trying to unlock the big window through the small window, both of which were behind drawn shades. My roommate, thinking somebody was coming to steal his shit grabbed a text book and started beating the fuck out of the hand coming through the window. He said, it seemed the person panicked and couldn't get their hand back out the window, so he just kept pummeling the shit out of it. We figured, if it was a student, they'd have a pretty gnarly looking hand. Two days later, I see my ex, her hand is all sorts of fucked up. I asked her what happened and she admitted the whole thing to me, she said she wanted me to believe that god was punishing me for breaking up with her. She asked if I forgave her. I told her I did, but the next time she thinks its a good idea to deliver god's messages to me the police might not be so forgiving. 

Since that time I have only been with agnostic or atheist girls...well one Buddhist girl, but her beliefs were never pushed on me. All I gotta say is that I don't think I could ever date a religious girl. Nope. Not at all. If you think the world is 6,000 years old, its just gonna be impossible. I can deal with agnostic girls, but anybody who bases their life on a collection of fairy tales...I can't do it.

The first thing you need to be aware of is that Norway is badly affected by [Dutch disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease). The country has been awash with oil revenues since the 80s, which has a distinct effect on what people focus on. I was born in the mid-80s myself, and am thus a prime example of someone who's grown up in an extremely pleasant society. Now, first of all it should be said that Norway has done some [very wise things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway) regarding saving, investing and not using up the oil revenue. That's great, and it's given us a lot of security. The problem (inevitable side-effect, perhaps?) is that people become apathetic and *just don't care* about real issues anymore.

Some corrections to the cartoon follow.

**Atheism:** I'm sad to report that Norwegians are predominantly christian. The survery that managed to define 70% as atheists surely fell victim to people *not caring much* about their religion anymore. But the thing is, if you press them on their actual beliefs, you'll find the basic supernatural tenets or religion survive and flurish. For example, I'm quite sure that at least 70% would at the very minimum answer that ""there is probably some divine force in the universe"". That's perhaps not American-style christianity, but it sure as hell isn't atheism. 

Lately, alternative supernatural beliefs (such as in angels and healing) have taken a hold aswell. If religion in the classical sense ""is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions"", then I think the modern-variety nonsense we're seeing is the sigh of the comfortable, fat, content and bored citizen of a successful rich social democracy.

**Education:** I can imagine that the statements are true if they refer to the percentage of people with a higher education, or something like that. But if you look at the *quality*, we're merely mediocre. High school education has consistently been shown to be mid-range by European standard (don't have a source available right now), and this looks even worse when you factor in how much we spend on the school system. As for higher education, it's again mediocre. We're not in any way horrible, and you have to remember we're just 5 million people, but our universities really could be funded a lot better. Again, most people don't care. ""Why do science, we just need to know how to drill for oil"" seems to be a common attitude.


Now, after making these corrections, I'd also like to add that Norway is a very peaceful, comfortable place to live. It's a sparsely populated country, but the major cities feel like civilization, and you have beautiful nature closeby and readily accessible. The weather tends to be shit, but the summer months are beautiful.

3) Stone Age. A very good introduction to the worker placement genre. While Agricola and Caylus are more popular (and might be better games), I think Stone Age highlights the mechanic at its best.

4) Race for the Galaxy. While it shares some similarity with Puerto Rico, I think Race (with its expansions) is a good example of how to take a deck of more than a hundred unique cards, and produce a consistent game experience out of it.

5) Pandemic. Pandemic is an excellent cooperative game. Unlike Shadows or Battlestar Galactica, it is not built around a traitor mechanic at all, making it a good example of the genre in my opinion.

6) Ra or Modern Art. Both of these are very good, and very different, bidding games. Personally, I'm not a fan of Modern Art (it feels like a math exercise to me). Ra is a very casual player friendly game.

7) War of the Ring or Twilight Struggle. Two wonderful strategic 2p games. While the mechanics are completely different, I think these cater to similar strategic needs.

Its was a worse interpretation of the seduction material mostly because it got muddled with a bunch of other junk. As far as seduction knowledge go 2nd hand wise seddit is the best by far or at least by my knowledge. 

&gt;See Mat_Cauthon's reply. To me 'Be yourself' also means you should stay congruent. Lead an interesting life so you can enjoy it more and make others enjoy your company, but don't wear a mask, don't bend yourself and don't pretend.

Oh yes the ""interesting life"".  Now how is that being yourself? What if your interests arent interesting to others? What If I don't want to backpack around europe just so I can brag to other people basically? At what point does doing things for yourself basically crosses over for the sake picking up women? 

&gt;It's not a facade, it's leading an interesting life. You as the one who leads it get the most out of it.

Yes yes going places and doing things. And you *have* to do this get with ladies correct? You don't see at all as being part of the facade?

But this was originally refering to something else. More along the lines of how to dress to impress ladies,w hat to do to seduce ladies, Topics conversation  tailored for ladies, how your body mannerisms should be around ladies etc.  Any time seddit suggests ""this what you should do..."" Its just another brick in the facade you are building. 

But its alright. All social interaction is built on lies. Everyone hates honesty. 

&gt;You are oversimplifying social interaction. Understanding social interaction and attraction and all that helps, but it is never as straightforward as something you'd find in /r/howto.

Its a game. Literally the premier fucking book of the community is called ""the game"".  Experience is gained through social interaction and you eventually level up. Stupid and nerdy as that sounds its basically the first advice new comers get here. The way reports are done here makes it seem very game like as well. 

Figuring out a woman's brain of course is very tough but it can be done and simplified. That essence is basically the advice you read or hear about it given by others.  

&gt;This paragraph is so mangled I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say. You can be very experienced in social situations and still be so boring that you don't attract anyone. Also read up on the 'married man challenge' that was posted in seddit some time ago. The principles still apply in a relationship.

I apologize I am tired. But really? I thought just be being yourself was enough was good enough! You mean there are some sort of tricks you need to use to attract others?! 

&gt;The whole boy/girl thing usually leads to sex, with or without seduction/pua knowledge.

Being friendzoned is much higher is a male does not know he has to show some sexual interest. 

&gt;Whether or not it becomes an ons or a ltr mostly depends on one party saying 'You should be aware that I am not looking for more' or not. It does not matter whether the situation arose with or without seduction/pua knowledge.

I guess the term ""pick up artist"" was made for ltrs as well? He dates a chick for a about a year and picks up another one or something? 

I don't think there is much wrong with guys using this for solely ltr's but the terminology screams one night stand and its baffling to think otherwise. 

But mostly my complaint with your idea that it could be used for ltr is that there is nothing, no advice after you engage in that relationship. I guess technically it falls in another field but to me it seems it was intended for one night stands. 

&gt;Without seduction/pua knowledge, 'he' might just not be able to tell whether or not 'she' is interested (point in case: lots of askreddit/sex/ra posts about whether she is interested or just being nice). If she isn't, why pursue further? And again, with or without seduction/pua knowledge, people are looking for others that want the same as they do. Just this knowledge helps to find someone suitable, and then to make it go somewhere.

This isn't true seduction in a sense its playing the numbers. Ask a hundred girls for sex chances are one will say yes. The idea of moving on quickly is established to increase your chances to sleep with a women that night. Ill admit its not all numbers game obviously but the idea moving on quickly is very one night stand sort of mentality instead. And when you say looking for what others want is the same it sort of enforces my point that basically its for that one night stand. 

&gt;Yes. Some people need those because they didn't just 'get' nutrition and staying in shape naturally. So they read up on how it works. Your point is?

They are unnecessary. They are substituting will for following orders. But you might be right: some people do in fact need them.

&gt;Your example is flawed in several ways. Firstly, you assume that they will use their understanding of social dynamics for Bad Stuff (tm). Secondly you try to liken pickup to sending 'your kids off to die in a war'. Thirdly you assume that people will not call the politician out on his bad policies because he is so 'charismatic'.

Oh of course there are good politicians and bad politicians don't get me wrong. But in politics its always the lesser of two evils or the more charismatic one.

&gt;Pua can be used this way or that, but it can't be used to magically get women to sleep with you against their will. How you come to try and liken it to sending people to war is beyond me.

That wasn't really my intent but let me put this way: A girls snatch is her most precious thing and to even look at it requires you to instill a great deal of emotions in her about you. Things like trust, love, confidence, value, etc all things you need to build up. 

In essence a mothers son is basically the same thing: Her most precious thing. And a politician needs to somehow convince her that sending her him off is the right thing to do. Of course there is little logic behind it so the politician needs to instill emotions in her to make her accept this. 

&gt;And lastly, if people don't call the politician out on his policies because he's so charismatic they want to be deceived. Cognitive disconnection or something.

This is a very deceptive statement, although possibly superficially correct, for multiple reasons.  Firstly, India was no more united than Europe at the time of the East India Companies charter.  In fact, I'd argue that it was even *more* divided and splintered than the contemporary Europe.  After all, the entire concept of a politically united India is a modern construct; although there were historical instances in which the Indian subcontinent was at least nominally ruled by one entity, most prominently under the Mauryan Empire, these brief and incomplete—no Indian Empire was able to repeat the feat to the same extent as the Mauryan did over 2,000 years ago—instances of unity where ephemeral, and their cultural impact could in no way rival that of the Roman Empire in Europe or even Greek Hellenism in the Near and Middle East.  These short-lived empires did not foster a cultural convergence similar to that done by the Roman Empire in its territories, but merely existed as delicate political entities that quickly vanished to become mere footnotes in the history books.

And it was not merely in the political respect that India was fragmented.  Genetically, linguistically, culturally, religiously, and in many other regards India was—and still is—much more diverse than Europe.  Although on the face of it there might appear to be some underlying strata that encompasses much of India, Hinduism for instance, but on closer examination these shared beliefs prove illusionary.  Take the previously mentioned Hinduism, it may seem as a possible unifying force due to its ubiquitous practice amongst Indians, but one must bear in mind that it is also an overwhelmingly local religion that shelters many different, and often contradictory, beliefs under its umbrella.  It has no centralized authority or canon of beliefs that can act as a glue for uniting a diverse society like, for example, Catholicism.

This is a slight tangent, but arguably Britain's greatest contribution to India was the molding of it into a single entity.  For that reason alone, Britain's colonialism could very well be justified.  Although there are numerous successionist regions of India, I believe that on the whole most would agree that an imperfectly united India is much better than one that is fragmented into dozens, if not hundreds, small states a la Europe.  Remember, even at the dawn of India's independence, there were still hundreds of more-or-less autonomous princely states within India.  It is extremely unlikely that without the outside intervention of Britain and colonialism that India would exist as the one country it is today, there were hardly any historical precedents for it and very little, if any, commonality on which such a state could have been founded on.

Another reason that India's so-called wealth is misleading is because India had a greater population than all of Europe combined.  In 1600 Europe had only two-thirds of the population of India—roughly 91 million versus 135 million.  What that means is that when you compare Europe as a whole—which for reasons stated above is a more accurate comparison on more than just population grounds—against India as a whole, Europe not only has a larger economy in absolute terms, but also in regards to per capita.  Britain, for instance, had nearly twice the per capita ""GDP"" of India at that time.

&gt;by then, and the British effort was purely exploitative, not developmental.

I believe this is yet another misconception about the British colonization of India.  Up until 1854 the balance of trade with India was roughly even, and from 1909-13 Britain maintained a surplus with India, exporting roughly £10 million yearly more than they exported from India; in total this averaged out to £54 million worth of trade arriving in India from Britain, or in other words India was receiving almost 25% more in trade and investment than Britain was simultaneously extracting from India.  Furthermore, these exports were increasingly products such as machinery and steam engines, instead of merely consumer goods like clothing.  This surplus trend on the part of Britain continued all the way until 1934, where it was finally reversed, largely because Britain was in the throes of the Great Depression and the process of leaving the gold standard.  What this data reveals is that as a rule Britain contributed more in value to India than it extracted from the colonial era, because India's deficit was never repaid or compensated in any other manner; and to me the fact that Britain maintained a trade surplus with India supports a more developmental rather than purely exploitive relationship.

This is further reinforced by the investment done by Britain in India.  By 1870 Britain had invested £180 in the Indian subcontinent, of which £100 million was infrastructure.  This trend continued and accelerated until by 1914 the total had reached £381, 70% being in infrastructure.  The fact that many of these infrastructural works are still in use—for example, nearly all of the Indus River's irrigation and flood control works date from this time, and it was the lack of the indigenous governments continued maintenance and investment in these works that led to the unfortunate flooding late last year; and the Indus Valley is far from an exceptional case, many of the Indian subcontinents bridges, ports, roads, and railways are the same ones created and financed by the British—pays concrete testament to the beneficial impact that the British colonial, and simultaneously reveals the domestic government's neglect.

Finally, it can be exaggerated how dependent and integrated Britain actually was on ""exploiting"" its colonies.  In fact, the majority of British trade was with its developed neighbors.  For instance, by 1850 the Empire was receiving only 30% of Britain's exports, and from the 1870s to 1914 it was receiving 35% of Britain's exports, while at the same time Britain imports from these colonies was equated to only 25% of Britain's total imports.  Total imports from the empire only reached their peak, at 35-40% of Britain's total imports, during the Napoleonic Wars—in which much of Europe was persuaded to cease trade with Britain.  This shows that although much of Britain's trade was with its colonies, it paled in comparison to the amount of trade Britain had with more developed neighbors.

And of course I'm not saying that the British colonization of India was wholly beneficial, or that it wasn't outright detrimental in many regards.  On the contrary, Britain's continued export of food during famine and their insistence of switching from food to cash crops directly led to millions of deaths, to name merely one of the infamous consequences of Britain's colonial rule.  But what I am saying is that the relationship cannot accurately be called a purely exploitive one; it was much more complex than that and Britain's political, material, cultural, and technological contributions should not be ignored.  For better or for worse—and my personal feeling is that it was overall and in the long-term for the better—India would not be what it is today without its era of colonialism by Britain.

[""A 2008 review published by the Royal Society of Medicine noted that GM foods have been eaten by millions of people worldwide for over 15 years, with no reports of ill effects.""](http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/101/6/290)

&gt;This, however, is just one study; you can view many others that essentially come to the same conclusion.

That link doesn't lead to where you think it does.

&gt;These results, coupled with the heavy push for GMO's in Developing Countries &amp; Europe, have led many to believe that their (hidden) goal is some sort of population control via control of the food supply (/tinfoilhat). 

This is conspiracy nutjob bullshit. Bring evidence or shutup.

&gt;Once these things get out there, they are near impossible to remove unless they've been designed with terminator genes.

That has never been put into commercial production.

Depending on the selection pressure on the trait, they will either fix in the population or degrade due to drift. Either way, no evidence of environmental harm has been found.

[""We can find no compelling scientific arguments to demonstrate that GM crops are innately different from non-GM crops. ""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12042859)

[""The data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized GM crops has caused environmental harm.""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522828)

&gt;I'm not trying to sound alarmist, but I truly believe GMOs to be one of the most dangerous perils we face as a civilization.

...

You cite bullshit evidence and claim the sky is falling...

but it's okay, he is not trying to sound alarmist.

&gt; If all the unmodified crops get replaced by GMOs and they suddenly fail to produce viable seeds for the next generation,

However:

* Yes, India was indeed many nations at that time, but how does that change the fact that India (or the states of India) didn't _need_ trade relations with Britain the way Africa does today? Divided or united, the fact remains that India was relatively prosperous.

* While I completely agree about the political and linguistic divisions, religiously (and mostly culturally too, depending on how culture is defined), India was to a large extent united. Hinduism did, and has always, sheltered different and often contradictory beliefs, but those philosophical level differences were not regionally fragmented, and any mythological level differences (which were indeed regionally fragmented) were smoothed out long before the British arrival. South Indians were worshipping the same Vishnu and Shiva that North Indians did, at least as early as  the 10th centure AD, and at the philosophical level, the scriptures from different parts of India had symbiotic relationships, and most importantly, recognized a common base.     
While there is no formal central authority like in Catholicism, there have from time to time been unifying authorities like Sankaracharya or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa who were almost universally accepted and who did manage to unify the religion to a large extent.     
However, I do not believe this commonality was a strong enough factor to have created a united India by itself, and agree that British played a large part in it.

* I do agree about the population issue regarding economies. But again, my point was not that India was as good as or better than Britain or Europe, but that there was not as much economic parity as between China and Africa to merit the comparison. 

* The export related figures are interesting, and since I don't have any knowledge regarding these, I take them at face value. However, it raises an interesting question - why did they do that? From the famine responses and such things, it seems that they did not consider the colonial population to be meriting a very fair treatment under their crown, so what was the motivation behind not sapping off them completely?

The main points of the concordat are

&gt; The right to freedom of the Roman Catholic religion. (Article 1)

&gt; The state concordats with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932) remain valid. (Article 2)

&gt; Unhindered correspondence between the Holy See and German Catholics. (Article 4)

&gt; The right of the church to collect church taxes. (Article 13)

&gt; The oath of allegiance of the bishops: ""Ich schwöre und verspreche, die verfassungsmässig gebildete Regierung zu achten und von meinem Klerus achten zu lassen"" (English: I swear and vow to honor the constitutional government and to make my clergy honor it; Article 16)

&gt; State services to the church can be abolished only in mutual agreement. (Article 18)

&gt; Catholic religion is taught in school (article 21) and teachers for Catholic religion can be employed only with the approval of the bishop (article 22).

&gt; Protection of Catholic organizations and freedom of religious practice. (Article 31)

&gt; Clerics may not be members of or be active for political parties. (Article 32) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat

So they got church taxes and swore not to oppose Hitler. 

&gt;""Put yourself in the position of a 1933 German Catholic as you read the text of the Concordat between Nazi Germany and the Vatican, the Reichskonkordat.

&gt;""The German Catholic Church has rescinded its ban on joining the Nazi Party. The Catholic Centre party has dissolved itself. [And Articles 31 and 32 prevent any revival of this democratic Catholic party which had opposed the Nazis.] In the Reichskonkordat, the Vatican has promised that German Bishops and their subordinates will be obedient to and honour the Nazi state (Article 16). It has promised that German Catholic educators will teach children patriotic love for the Nazi state (Article 21). It has requested and received the Nazi dictatorship's promise to enforce internal Church decisions (Article 10). Cardinal Bertram of Breslau has called on Catholics to avoid all subversive or illegal (by Nazi definition) activities.

&gt;""How should you respond to the Nazi's new nightmare state? Doesn't the Catholic Church teach you to view Church officials as exemplary? Shouldn't they be emulated?

In the US it is illegal to label food as a GMO, so consumers are not even allowed to choose if they want to not eat modified food. So your reasoning for the market to regulate it is invalid. 

While it is true that America was attempting to push GMOs in Europe, I suppose that they would be possibly able to label them GMOs in their supermarkets. Unlike in the US, Europeans actually care about what they eat and buy, so I can guarantee an american product would fail if people knew what they were getting. I lived in France for 3 months, so this statement comes from my experiences with French people. (Who are awesome people, btw). 

So I can assure you that the government/ monsanto (they're pretty much the same thing) would push for the no labeling laws that apply in the states. So this is where the coercion applies. When there is no way to boycott a product, the ""Free market"" concept is worth nothing.

It’s worth its weight in gold.

When one Asian silkworm egg, weighing only 1/30,000th of an ounce, hatches, the emerging caterpillar will produce a beautiful silk thread. In demand for thousands of years, silk has been one of the world’s most valuable fibers.

For thousands of years, the secret of producing silk remained hidden. However, the process eventually became known to others outside of China.

During the Christian era, silk was one of the most costly items in trade between the Roman Empire and the Orient. It was truly a mark of the wealthy. The Emperor Justinian (A.D. 483-565) eventually built a monopoly in the silk trade. He sent two Persian monks to China to bring back the means for producing silk to Constantinople. The monks had learned the secret of silk-making while residing in China. In 550 A.D., using hollow bamboo canes or staffs, they successfully smuggled silkworm eggs into Greece. This was a very dangerous assignment. If the eggs had been discovered in the staffs, the monks would surely have been put to death by the Chinese.

Eventually, other nations, such as Korea and Japan, acquired the know-how for making silk. Later, China shared its knowledge with India and in time, the silk industry was established in Europe and later in America.

I'm not sure about this, but there are lots of places in Europe that you will need no visa whatsoever for if you're just touristing around. You could use that opportunity to ""do"" job interviews. Then, when a company is interested in you, they can intervene on your behalf with the immigration authorities to get you a visa and/or work permit. Since the economy is roaring, skilled people are in demand. Work visas are hard to get but if the company is able to convince the authorities that you are just the mad genius they need, it goes much more smoothly.

If you have mad romantic skillz, you may also be able to shortcut the whole procedure by simply marrying a Norwegian girl. I'm afraid I can't boast any experience in this department, though.",1,True,t3_eudmn,0,False,c1b2gdl,fsmgold13

If this newspaper is good enough for Noam Chomsky it's good enough for me.  This is a fantastic article: 

Imagine a world with a strong China reshaping Asia; India confidently extending its reach from Africa to Indonesia; Islam spreading its influence; a Europe replete with crises of legitimacy; sovereign city-states holding wealth and driving innovation; and private mercenary armies, religious radicals and humanitarian bodies playing by their own rules as they compete for hearts, minds and wallets.

It sounds familiar today. But it was just as true slightly less than a millennium ago at the height of the Middle Ages.

In recent years it has become conventional wisdom that the post-cold-war world will see rising powers such as China and Brazil create what international relations experts call a “multi-polar” order. Yet for the next 10 or 20 years, it is not at all clear that the future many imagine will come to pass – namely that the relative US decline will continue, Europe will muddle along, China and India will grow ever stronger, and other straight-line projections.

In fact, the world we are moving into in 2011 is one not just with many more prominent nations, but one with numerous centres of power in other ways. It is, in short, a neo-medieval world. The 21st century will resemble nothing more than the 12th century.

You have to go back a thousand years to find a time when the world was genuinely western and eastern at the same time. Then, China’s Song dynasty presided over the world’s largest cities, mastered gunpowder and printed paper money.

At around the same time India’s Chola empire ruled the seas to Indonesia, and the Abbasid caliphate dominated from Africa to Persia. Byzantium swayed and lulled in weakness both due to and despite its vastness. Only in Europe is this medieval landscape viewed negatively.

This was a truly multi-polar world. Both ends of Eurasia and the powers in between called their own shots, just as in our own time China, India and the Arab/Islamic community increasingly do as well.

There is another reason why the metaphor is apt. In medieval times, the Crusades, and the Silk Road, linked Eurasia in the first global trading system – just as the globalised routes of trade are doing today.

The merchant houses of Bruges and Venice financed transcontinental ventures to discover sources of spices and other riches. Marco Polo reached the court of Kublai Khan in China, but only after admiring the vineyards of Kashgar and being awestruck by the material abundance of Xi’an. Arab pilgrim Ibn Battuta made an even greater parallel voyage from Morocco to the Far East, visiting the thriving civilisations of southern India and Sumatra along the way.

Now, globalisation is again doing much the same, diffusing power away from the west in particular, but also from states and towards cities, companies, religious groups, humanitarian non-governmental organisations and super-empowered individuals, from terrorists to philanthropists. This force of entropy will not be reversed for decades – if not for centuries. As was the case a millennium ago, diplomacy now takes place among anyone who is someone; its prerequisite is not sovereignty but authority.

Some see contrary trends in the light of the financial crisis. But given the power of the forces pushing a new medievalism, it is too simple to speak of a “return of the state” evident in the bail-out of Wall Street and the stimulus packages of governments. Far more revealing about the future is the crumbling of most of the post-colonial world from Africa to the Middle East to South Asia, where over-population, corrupt governance, ethnic grievances and collapsing infrastructure are pushing many states towards failure.

From Congo and Sudan to Pakistan, many “states” are likely to see a move towards a hybrid public-private system of governance. Take Afghanistan, where a postmodern arrangement between international extractive companies, the Kabul government, local warlords and foreign peacekeepers seems as likely an outcome as any – a neo-medieval model also being used in Africa and elsewhere too.

In the economic sphere, most states, rich or poor, western or eastern, have become filters, trying to manage inflows and outflows of goods, money and people that globalisation has imposed on them. In medieval times, one’s welfare depended on family status, guild membership and property holdings. Cities were stratified according to socio-economic caste. Loyalty was not to the “state” as such, but to whoever delivered the goods.

Today, the world’s population turns ever more to companies to provide essential services, whether security or healthcare. Even in rising India, much “public” welfare is provided by industrialists such as the Tatas and Ambanis, whose family businesses also run entire factory cities. They are increasingly the equivalent of the House of Medici, the family that came to dominate Florence from the 14th century. The Islamic world today is replete with such political philanthropy, with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Hizbollah in Lebanon functioning as political parties but also as social institutions supplying healthcare and schools.

Of course, no analogy is perfect. But the medieval parallel is at least a warning against over-simplified references to the neat 19th century “Concert of Europe”, the balance of power between European states that followed the Napoleonic wars. This system saw a modus vivendi between a handful of nation states. But our new world is far more complex.

The only missing piece, of course, is America. The Middle Ages was pre-Atlantic. Yet today we have the legacy superpower of the US, located in the new world. If the European Union today plays the part of the Holy Roman Empire, then the US is the new Byzantium, facing both east and west while in a state of relative decline. The Byzantines lasted for many centuries beyond their material capability, through shrewd diplomacy and deception rather than by force.

This new world will mean huge challenges, for the west in particular. But if the US applies a genuinely Byzantine strategy, it has a good chance of stopping a slide into conflict. And remember that, despite its bleak reputation, the Middle Ages was actually an era of great invention and discovery – and one which eventually gave way to a great Renaissance too. As we witness today’s great power grievances mount and fear another world of war, we must remember the same is possible today.

It was only after Native Americans started dying off and European-Americans started building up disease immunity that it became financially worth it to purchase African slaves.

In other words, African slavery was more about financial motivation, which then led to the brutally violent and racist actions slaveholders perpetrated.

Given the observation that right now Spain hasn't collapsed, it's strange to base the assertion that Spain is in trouble on the figures as they are now, rather than on estimates of where they're going. If you look at those numbers, the picture for Spain looks infinitely better: the austerity measures both Ireland and Greece would only implement after a EU bail-out have already been put into effect and while the current numbers of Spain look bleak in and of themselves, they've been relatively stable throughout the crisis, compared to the rest of Europe. As such, the risk of a sudden event that would make Spanish debt soar (like the bail-out of banks in Ireland) or the cost of Spanish debt soar (like the correction of older, highly misleading, economic data in Greece) is lower. Secondly, he mistakes the political unwillingness to commit a priori to carrying the cost of a bail-out of Spain with an inability to actually carry the cost of a bail-out were it required. It's going to take a bit of a fight over who pays what if Spain were to ask for a bail-out, but I think it's unreasonable to fear that there would be no outcome of that fight. Thirdly, he suggests a narrative of a cascade with the inevitable collapse of the Euro, but even without a bail-out of Spain, the consequences would most likely be either a controlled devaluation of the Euro from Brussels (not a collapse) and Spain having to take on more loans than they expected, provoking harsher austerity measures, but probably not an actual defaulting on debt.",8,True,t3_euiqb,0,False,c1b2jxg,

I think your synopsis of the situation is accurate (except for the part about me being misinformed haha) You're right that they would push for the no labeling laws. But I think that is a separate argument from the general argument as to whether GMOs should be allowed on the shelves of EU stores. If the EU held firm and said, we'll allow GMOs but they must be labeled as such otherwise they won't be sold here, the US would have little choice but to accept.

Like I said, I think the EU has every right to hold firm. I think if GMOs are sold in Europe they should absolutely be labeled because consumers have the right to know what they are buying. And if they aren't sold in the EU, I'm fine with that because I think the officials representing these nations have the right to make that decision on behalf of the electorate. Heck, I wouldn't want GMOs in the marketplace if I was a citizen of a EU member nation. I'm just taking issue with those who are spinning this into something it's not by claiming that the US pressure on the EU to accept GMOs is some sort of unprecedented, vile and as someone else put it ""criminal"" behavior when similar posturing is common throughout the international community. The US government and the EU are both acting rationally. The US is just representing the interests of a major constituency, just as the EU is working on behalf of its members - that's just how government works.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think that ingesting *some* fluoride is going to have that many adverse effects, rather the EPA has set *outrageously* high standards for the acceptable amount of fluoride that can be in the water supply.

There also seems to be an unbalanced distribution of where high fluoridated water levels are found, namely inner cities and prisons. Also, over 40 of the largest 50 US cities are fluoridated, compared with less than 2% of Europe.
 
It's interesting how everyone is pointing to how in the film Dr. Strangelove the ""communist"" conspiracy of water fluoridation was lampooned.

Bringing in an ""outrageous"" conspiracy theory into a valid and serious topic is the perfect way to discredit the opposition, and this proved very effective in the public eye in the 60's.

This campaign to distract from the real issue was described succinctly by anti-fluoridation advocate Dr. Frederick Exner:

""most people are not prepared to believe that fluoridation is a communist plot, and if you say it is, you are successfully ridiculed by the promoters. It is being done, effectively, every day...some of the people on our side are the fluoridators' 'fifth column'.""

The author of the book *The Fluoride Deception* Christopher Bryson has this far more logical explanation for the initial boost in the fluoridation program:

From the wiki.

Also from the wiki :

""Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation.[3] For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped.""

And another:

""There is anecdotal but not scientific evidence that fluoride allows more time for dental treatment by slowing the progression of tooth decay, and that it simplifies treatment by causing most cavities to occur in pits and fissures of teeth.""

Anecdotal evidence is meaningless.

I'm sorry for being so hostile, but this is an issue that I argue with Americans on a regular basis. Here in Canada, our government has accepted the recent science done that more or less proves water fluoridation being good for your teeth as false :

http://www.nofluoride.com/reports/Science%26Ethics-Canadian_Dental_Assoc.pdf

The PDF is legitimate, in case you wondered about the source. 

In fact, the *only* country to produce *studies* about the benefits of water fluoridation seem to be the United states. Almost every other western nation has accepted it as bunk.


http://www.health-science.com/fluoride_toxicity.html

Speaking honestly, the issue is still up for debate. But the good science rests with the debunkers, while the studies done on the benefits of water fluoridation are flawed and generally bad science.

The reason we have so many issues with booze in our society is that we create a pent up demand for it at the exact point where we begin to shape our opinions and learn how to deal with it - in our youth. 

The prohibition era spillover of keeping booze away from children,  is something that is truly foolish and in the end costs  countless lives. 

 In my first year of Uni,  I can't count how many people wanted to do one thing and one thing alone,   get completely fucking drunk out of their minds.  Not because getting blasted and puking for a day afterwards was *really* that fun,  because the act itself *isn't*.   It's the *fuck you* to society thats fun.  It's the cookie in the cookie jar that kids love - that humans love.  

Growing up my parents (of European decent)  never,  not once denied me booze.  My father always said that if I wanted a beer,  there was the fridge,  go and get one.   And you know what?   I may have done it once or twice.   But it wasn't that fucking interesting once the cookie jar was accessible.   And when i was 18,  I had zero desire to get drunk out of my tree,  while my other friends were getting their stomaches pumped. 

So we now have organizations like MADD,  who's original intent may have been admirable (keep drunk drivers off the road),  but who now lobby governments in the same way temperance unions did in the 20's and 30's.   Basically,  MADD is increasing barriers to booze in effect making the cookie jar harder to access,   making teenagers want booze *even more*.   Can you guess what the outcome of that will be?

And yes, I get your point that the middleman is what jacks that price up. But even without them, the cost of most medical stuff would still be beyond even the richest individuals simply because the tech, meds and trained personnel are expensive to develop and expensive to maintain. 

Don't judge your price comparisons based on what insurance companies pay vs what self-payers pay, because that's like basing the true cost of the manufacture and transportation of a t-shirt on what Wal-Mart pays a sweatshop for them. Insurers get those low rates through bargaining, volume purchasing, government subsidies and other artificial price alterations (like simply refusing to pay more, regardless of the true costs). The actual cost would be somewhere in the middle, and possibly closer to what the cash amount is than not. Which would still be far beyond most individual's ability to pay themselves for anything but basic care. Plus, a great deal of the markup you pay as a single-payer *isn't* related to insurance costs or government costs, but to covering the shortfall of those who can't afford to pay.

Remove all of this and it would be more like a week's worth of care costing you $20,000 instead of $50,000. A huge discount, yes. But still not affordable by any means, resulting in the need for government system to catch the shortfall. Which is the sort of system many of us are hoping for when we think about government-payer care -  cut out the privatized middlemen to lower costs from that end, then amortize the remainder through a small tax increase spread over the entire population, with available private care/insurance for those who want that, i.e, the standard European model.",2,True,t3_euibe,0,False,c1b2sze,

Yes we did get paid well, and yes we did have a good pension, and yes some people did not work that much.  All of these things were true.
  
On the other hand, a lot of people worked very hard, some people could have been paid better in other places, and a lot of people had better pensions.

Because of my job, I was able to see what people in the office did all day.  A lot of them had to take a break from playing games on their computer, or watching their stocks, or talking about their golf game, to talk about how lazy the people out on the floor were, and how they were paid too much.

On the other hand, I had a lot of managers who were good at what they did, and were good to work for.  Actually, in 30 years, I personally had only two managers I could not stand, and a lot I would like to work for again.  I was just lucky that way.

In both cases, in the shop, or in the back office, the hard workers had to work a lot harder to make up for the lazy people.  The really lazy people would go out and brag about what they got away with.  So everyone knows about Generous Motors.

Originally so many people maimed themselves, or got sick from the dirty air and poisonous chemicals, that if we did not have a 30 and out retirement plan, they retired then a couple years later died.  We are much safer now, and the air quality is much better.  30 and out probably does not make as much sense now.  

We had people way up in the company making billion dollar mistakes, then getting paid mega bucks, because they were too valuable to lose.  Year after year they would give each other bigger pay checks, much bigger then top people in the past when compared to the average worker, then complain when we wanted more money.  You don't give yourself better wages then cut the average joes paycheck, not if you have any common sense.  If you want to bargain with a union, and expect anything to go your way, you need to stop rewarding the people who could not make good management decisions, and be willing to give up something yourself.  Remember lead by example?

Along the way, we bargained away things like extra paid days off, for a bonus or what ever.  All people remember is the bonus or what ever we got in exchange.  Even with the extra paid days off, we did not have as many days off as our friends in Europe.   

I asked a union rep once why they would help a someone who came to work drunk nearly every day, keep their job.  These people made not only managements life hard, it made our work harder, and less safe.  More then one said they wished they did not have to, but it was the law.  They could be sued if they didn't, and lose their job.  One told me that he had actually hinted to management how they could get some of these guys fired, and management was too dumb to follow up on it.  Mostly all he wanted them to do was fallow their own rules, and document every little thing.
As far as getting paid for not working, yup that is true.  The idea was that if GM had to pay us even when there was not enough work, they would try to do a better job of planing for the down times. Also they would try to write their contracts with outside suppliers in a way that they could bring work back in house during the lean times.  Instead GM decided to just pay us to not work.  I am sure there were tax incentives when they lost money that way, and it made the union look bad.  Believe it or not, a lot of people did not like doing nothing all day, it was very hard on them. 

Bottom line is, why do we care more about someone making a middle class income with little or no education, then we do about rich people paying other rich people in government to make rules that help them get richer and richer?

I really believe in the American dream, I just think that if you look at any graph of the last 100 years, you will see that rich people in America have taken a much bigger piece of the pie then they did in the past.  And a long the way they changed the rules so if they make big mistakes they personally do not have to pay for it, well most of them anyway. 

Rush L. says we shouldn't worry about how much of the pie they take, the pie grows, well rich people, don't worry you can share more of the pie, it will grow to meet your needs.

You can make a good argument that by refusing to release them in an un-altered format, he is doing a harm to our culture. 

Think of all the works of literature that exist only in fragmentary form or re-constructed from fragments of different versions, or known only by descriptions written by contemporaries. What we are facing here is a similar situation. Its possible that the originals could be lost, and that would be a tragedy, not because they are great movies, but because of the impact they had on the culture. Films have been lost before and now exist only in fragmentary pieces, or incomplete wholes. Fritz Langs [Metropolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) is a perfect example of this. Released in 1927, it was and is considered a groundbreaking film. But it was butchered after its premier, and has taken over 80 years to recreate the whole film, based on pieces discovered scattered around Europe in the intervening time. 

So, what it comes down to is that he can butcher the damn things all he likes and release them, but he does our culture an insult by not releasing a copy that is identical to the theatrical premier.

my point is, all the technology in F1 is so heavily protected by copyright that it almost never filters down into actual production cars, and so called innovative tech, like KERS, is already in production vehicles, and f1 is, if anything, borrowing the technology from other sectors of the automotive world.

i suppose you can make the argument that wind tunnel testing and aerodynamics in f1 have contributed to modern cars, and in a sense it may have driven the technology further, but wind tunnel testing didn't originate in f1 and design more often than not influences the look of cars today.  

edit: also, i think the point IS to make f1 appear green.  the stripes on option tires are green for a reason.  kers was introduced as a green technology, even though it is a gross consumer of energy because of the increased energy needed in production, testing and use. if f1 was really serious about reducing energy consumption, all races would be in Europe, and the cars would be governed by rules which change much less frequently.  take for instance the f-duct.

&gt;&gt; Originally, Palestine was taken over by European Jews, more or less in the spirit of Victorian European colonialism.

Really. I believe you have absolutely no idea of what the principles of Zionism are, or the way European Jews started *buying* land in Ottoman Palestine, or the fact that Zionism is a completely [anti-colonial](http://www.zeek.net/politics_0306.shtml) political movement.

&gt;&gt;I think the British and Americans were very happy 

Britain embargoed Israel at the bequest of the Arab states for some time after independence. The US only expressed any kind of interest in Israel in the 70s.

&gt;&gt; Zionism transplanted a foreign people and culture to a land on which they had no claim.

Are you aware that the documented claim of Jews to the land of Israel predates the creation of Islam by a couple thousand years? Are you aware that the only autonomous self-contained political entity that ever existed in most of that area was a Jewish state? Are you aware that prior to '67, when Egypt lost Gaza and Jordan lost the West Bank, there had been NO requests whatsoever to create a Palestinian state, indeed, the Palestinians in the West Bank all had Jordanian citizenship and appeared to be very happy with that ? (The Palestinians in Gaza didn't have Egyptian citizenship, were under Egyptian military government and didn't seem to be bothered too much by it - no attacks against Egypt, for example)

&gt;&gt; I guess the importation of Eastern Jews further colours the picture but I feel the spirit of colonisation is intact.

The MB don't believe they're ""ordained"" by God--ordain as a verb has ministerial or priestly connotations. There's no such thing in Islam. The MB aren't special. They're a body of Muslims following a certain Islamic school of thought/jurisprudence. Most Muslims, by definition, believe they should establish Sharia law, being God's law--they differ in interpretations of that law, but not in its applicability. That's already in the constitution of Egypt, article 2.

Now, back to my opinion. I'm basing it on a number of things:

1. They recently lost the rigged parliament elections--they won 0 seats, compared to 71 seats in the (also partially rigged) 2005 elections. They took it well, and only held peaceful demonstrations.

2. They've repeatedly stated they're not interested in presidency, and that they'll throw their support behind deserving candidates, which they've abode by. They offered no one in 2005, and plan to support El-Baradei if he's able to enter  in 2011.

3. If they're elected democratically, that means they're elected by the will of the people, following the constitution. That is, the people would actually have power, compared to the current status where they have none. In that situation, voting them out should follow the same procedure. They have no power beyond the people behind them.

If the MB are voted out and another party takes their place, so long as that party is operating within the constitution (as in, does not violate article 1 about democracy or 2 about the Islamic identity), they would cede their place.

You might think this infeasible, but I do believe it possible. Islamic jurisprudence is full of diverse opinions on almost all matters of life, and in Islamic history there's been both periods of acceptance and periods of rejection of such diversity. Based on the ideological leadership of MB (e.g. Qaradawi, being one of the scholars most accepting of differing opinions), I think they would not resort to violence or dictatorship.

Now, perhaps what you're asking is: Do you think they'll ever cede authority if they get voted out by a party opposed to Sharia? That amounts to: ""Do you think they'll cede authority to a party going against the constitution?"". That's like asking what the US or France would do if an Islamic party--intending to apply Sharia--was voted into authority. I don't think it's democratically possible in the near future either way, Islamic party in US/Europe, or anti-Sharia party in Egypt. Purely from a demographics standpoint.

To conclude: MB claim they follow the democratic process and have abode by it thus far. From a scholarly point of view, there's no hints at abolishing the process, but rather the opposite (i.e. [Shura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shura)).

They neglect to mention some pretty important items (emphasis in bold by me):

In lengthy e-mail exchanges with FoxNews.com, Smith alternatively defended her online postings, denied being anti-American, called the Sept. 11 attacks an inside job, the U.S. a terrorist organization and **praised the American-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al Awlaki -- architect, trainer and inspiration for many of the recent terrorist attacks attempted or committed against the U.S.** President Obama last April approved Awlaki's inclusion on the CIA's targeted killing list.

In one e-mail to FoxNews.com, Smith wrote:

“If your neighbor was being attacked by a perpetrator, would you just stand there and say, 'Oh I will let someone come who has a gun to help them'? No, you would rush to their defense. And use any type of ""weapon"" to help that person... this is what I am doing. I am defending the defenseless. I am defending my home and family and their right to safety. No matter who it is at my door. These are the rights the Constitution gives me. The very right this Communistic government is trying to take away from me and the rest of the Americans.”

In the nearly six-minute video under investigation, Smith and her husband, known online as Salahudin Ibn Ja'far, 28, appear posing and hugging and holding weapons interspersed with photos of known and suspected terrorists and assorted jihadist propaganda, like an Awlaki sermon album cover.

There also are photos of German Taliban Mujahideen -- German nationals who have formed their own splinter group within the Taliban -- and mug shots of members of the Saarland cell of Islamic Jihad Union charged with plotting failed terror attacks against U.S. targets in Germany, including a 2007 plot to bomb the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein.

Smith said of the Ramstein plotters featured in her video:

“The so-called 'jihadists' you have mentioned are actually personal friends of my husband from childhood. In the video he was expressing his love and gratitude to his friends, who have died fighting for freedom. Just like any other American or European citizen who displays pictures of soldiers who have died on their videos. There is no difference in gratitude and love. It is just that your government has deemed these noble men as 'terrorists' because they are not on the same side. Least us not forget the Mujahideen who fought the Russians for the U.S. They were deemed 'heroes' and lead by Osama Bin Laden at that time, and now because the government says so... they are ""terrorists.””

In addition to being close childhood friends of convicted terrorists, Salahudin has posted content from the German Taliban’s media outfit and the Islamic Jihad Union on forums and social networking sites. **He's also written in support of his “noble leaders” -- bin Laden, Awlaki, the Sept. 11 hijackers and other terrorist leaders.**

Salahudin appeared to maintain forums devoted to hosting Awlaki’s sermons. **Earlier this month he uploaded videos to his since-deleted YouTube account that included German muhajideen training at jihadist camps in Pakistan, and another featuring the widow of a German Taliban jihadist directing the wives of jihadists to fulfill their obligations while their husbands are off fighting.**

In other English-language posts, **he suggests he himself has trained in these same jihadist camps.**

On Facebook, he is ""friends"" with the notorious Al Qaeda English-language online magazine Inspire, thought to be principally authored by American-turned-Muslim radical Samir Khan. Salahudin also has used his online posts to call for the deaths of U.S. citizens, military and government leaders, and recently joined in on another user’s thinly veiled threats against Condoleezza Rice, according to postings discovered by FoxNews.com and screen shots provided by the Jawa Report, a watchdog blog that has been following the online activities of Smith and her husband.
...

On her MySpace page, currently available for viewing via Google cache, Smith wrote: “As salamu alaikum akhi.. it is time for Jihad and it is now Fard ayn for ALL Muslims whether their in the United Snakes or else where...Insha'Allah!!!!”

Smith has lauded Awlaki, celebrated the deaths of U.S. soldiers -- who she called “terrorists” -- at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan, **and applauded another user’s posting of a rendering of the two planes hitting the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001**.

Maybe there was... and with the brief break in in my algorithms, caused by the human emotions welling inside of me, I did not notice the gleaming spear, sailing through the air, piercing a gap in between the plates of my heavy armor, and embedding itself deep in my left pectoral region, exactly where a heart would have been if I had one. If the spear had been any heavier, it may have punctured deeper into my central cortex and into the remainging human tissue I had.

Don't you think the Romans are kind of a lousy example? I could understand if you stopped at Greek hellenism. 

India was definitlely a monolithic cultural construct before the east India company came. Columbus was looking for ""India"" not gujurat. The Arabs used to trade with ""hind"" and ""hindiyya"" traders not punjabi ones. It doesn't compare at all with modern Europe, which is much more culturally diverse.  

Britain might have left the subcontinent as modern nation-states, but   certainly by any practical measure, more divided than when they found it. It's  telling you don't see anything like the 1971 war in the centuries leading up to British rule.

So not only is it inaccurate to say India was hopelessly divided before the east India company, but to actually credit the British for unifying the subcontinent and couch it as a positive contribution to their modern welfare is downright disgusting. Your rhetoric is quite the opposite if mine. I'm bent on portraying the British as the greedy bloodthirsty savages they were but are somehow never credited as, and you seem bent on apologizing for British atrocities, dismissing millions dead from famine as an unfortunate and regretable footnote in an otherwise benign relationship.     

Lastly the trade numbers you cite tell a misleading story. In the first place, they are from 1850 when Britain had normal trade relations with the united states, a former colony. More importantly, the goal of predatory mercantilist trade policies in the empire was not to create an insulated economy within the empire, it was to give Britain a comparative trade advantage over other developed countries, its real trade partners. In that context the numbers you cite are shockingly high. 30% of all exports went to colonies? Freaking 25% of all imports came from colonies? Do you realize that's almost twice what the united states imports from china? And up to 40% during the napoleonic wars? Shocking. I don't think you realize how disturbingly high those numbers are.

The scientific method is not a natural thought process.  It requires statistical stringency, rejects confirmation bias, and eliminates confounding variables, and is the opposite of the natural human tendency.  It took the smartest minds of Europe approximately 250 years to really discover it.  It is possible individuals without scientific training perform somewhat scientific methods, but the majority won't.  The majority relies on anecdotal evidence, subject to confirmation bias and the placebo effect, which is the norm of human thought.

Do you live in a fairly large city? Again, a slightly higher chance of your kid dying, this time in exchange for a lifestyle you find preferable to the alternative.

Some children die because their parents lack the $50 to get them life-saving medication, while others live because their parents or the countries their parents live in are willing to spend $200,000 on a small chance that it might save their life.

The MTV Europe hosts were actually interesting people, whereas the TMF hosts were bimbo's and idiots that couldn't say one single interesting sentence if their life dependend on it. They were just so dumb and so lacking any talent, culture and flair. 

Then MTV bought TMF. And I know really know what happened. We stopped getting MTV Europe. We got MTV Netherlands, which the same talentless zombies as hosts. 

As for the music, which they did play back at the time. It stopped being as diverse as it once was. I think MTV Europe was all R&amp;B and Rap, mixed with the occasional pop song. Crappy enough for at least me, to not turn it on ever. And TMF was a bit similar, with some dance music, but also a lot of the most extreme commercial crap ever. I mean: songs that nobody really liked, but that were just very very pushed. The few people that liked the song, really don't know any music, and wouldn't care if they played anything else anyway. It were songs that pandered to teenagers in the most pathetic way possible ""Sex on the beach"" or crap like that.

There was also ""The box"", where you could send a text-message to make them play a song. They were still very diverse, and people tend not to want to pay for shit music, so the commercialised-pushed bullshit songs, they weren't played that much. That was still watchable. 

But from that point on, I don't think I've even turned on MTV, TMF or the Box. The only nice thing Viacom has ever given us in that regard is Comedy Central. That's the only channel, here in Holland, people were very happy to get. Not because the shows are great, but they are an actual improvement about white noise and/or static.

But it was little too late. I don't think the youth watches less TV, because of the Internet. I think there is like this 5% to 20% percentage of youth today, that just doesn't want TV anymore, at all. And the others are tasteless smucks that really don't care what they are watching. 

To me. MTV is dead. TMF was never alive. And there are just too many talentless hacks, bimbo's and idiots on my black list to ever take the change of turning the thing on. I mean at this point, on television there are too many people i just hate. That completely digust me. 

Enough to not risk turning it on and ruining my day by being confronted by the fact that these people exists. If you want to make a TV channel and get somebody like me to watch, you advertise in news papers with a list of talentless fucks that you promise will never _ever_ be on there.

Oh and you put the stream online. Because honestly, I don't know anybody my age, that would pay for a cable subscribtion themselves. So as soon as they leave the house, live on their own. They don't have cable. They don't care enough to go through the hassle. It's not even a money thing. It's just not important enough.

Mikhail Lermontov. Considered the second most influential (all in all) poet of that period. His prose was very good too. A Hero of Our Time is very good read for those who want to learn Russian (although somewhat old, as the novel was written in the 19^th century) and get another glimpse of the mysterious ""Russian soul."" 

Dostoevsky can be daunting, as he has a very complex and rich style of writing. Inhabitants of the Village of Stepanchikovo would be a good read for someone who is curious to know Dostoevsky but finds it difficult to read his classics, Crime and Punishment, Idiot, or Besy (Demons).

Anton Chekhov is considered the first truly European ""classic"" Russian author. He is probably the most ""played"" Russian author: Chaika (The Seagull), Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard.  

Alexander Kouprin has a very light style, easy to read--which, however, does not take away from the depth of his writings.

Ivan Bunin has an absolutely fantastic, unmatched (in my view) ability to describe nature in a way that makes you feel as if you are there, physically.

Mikhail Bulgakov' s Master and Margarita is a piece of genius. His other novels are somewhat less impressive although they're absolutely worth reading--if you want to have a comprehensive idea of him. His Dog's Heart is very good though.

More lately, Sergei Dovlatov has an unmatched sense of humour and craftiness of writing. Ironically, he himself had a complex of inferiority and was always regretful that his style was somewhat inferior to the classic authors.

If you're interested in sci-fi, I cannot recommend more the Strugatsky brothers (Arkadiy and Boris). Their active writing life can be conventionally split into three large periods. The first period was all about grandiose, ""hardcore"" sci-fi (conquest of planets, struggles and heriosm and such). The second period is the one I highly recommend. As they became mature writers, their focus of interest changed to the so-called ""social sci-fi"".  The Doomed City, The Ugly Swans, Limping Fate, and a number of other novels - are absolutely brilliant, deep, phylosophical, and hugely uplifting. Their ability in putting together sentences beautifully is second to none. They are by far the most recognized and celebrated sci-fi authors, whose art transcends across various styles. I cannot recommend them enough.

Even more contemporary, Victor Pelevin is someone who is considered the ""voice of a generation."" However, this is really ""contemporary"" Russian which means the reader has to make certain conventions, and compromises in terms of expectations of a style, vocabulary etc. Also, one has to understand a lot of context from Russia in the 90s, otherwise he will somewhat struggle trying to figure out the meaning.",3,True,t3_eum8u,0,False,c1b44yc,

Yet it's been about a decade now. And you would think that someone would have gotten innovative and  that we could be expressing the complicated decentralized reality, rather than continuing to focus on a penguin or a joker figures as if they were single handedly pulling all the strings behind the scenes.

Sorry to be offended when I hear Hitler being quoted. Not about his opinion on cats, but on the main corner stone of the nazi ideology. I don't want to Godwin, but you must be joking?

The nation-state is founded up by the idea to connect country, culture &amp; race. One nation, one culture, one people. It's why ""Americans"" are living the ""american dream"" in ""America"". Give it a few generations, and suddenly the american people is a people. An ethnicity.

We all still hang on to the idea of the nation-state. But we just stopped confusing heritage and ethnicity. A country has an almost mandatory opt-in culture for it's inhabitants. You can _become_ an american by _choice_, you are not born as an american. It's not a race, right?

As to ehtniciy, it's a racist delusion. It doesn't exist. 
Repeat after me:

**THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ETHNICITY**

As for comparing the numbers of Wolfram-Alpha. Let's add Holland (my country) to the mix.

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+ethnic+germany,+usa,+netherlands

This is very interesting. **Collecting information about ethnicity in Holland is a crime.** It's treason. I wouldn' t be suprised if the same is true in Germany. (considering their history!)  So, where did Wolf-fart Alpha get these numbers from?

Well, there are not numbers about ethnicity, they are about first generation immigrants. They also do not contain terms like ""jewish"", ""white"" or ""black"". They contain the name of countries. Specific countries. So, these percentages are about people that immigrated here. Not their children, which are just normal dutch or german children. 

You are comparing that to the American numbers, which do contain the made up ethnicities. Black. White. Seriously, and those numbers add up? What about all the crossbreeding? Do you use like a DNA-test? Or do you just consider being black to be like a contagious disease? Ifso, I have bad news. We're _all_ from Africa!

And what's white? We should assume they are from Europe? Ireland? Perhaps Holland? So, the ethnicity of ""white"" should be more separated out, right? But Dutch people are actually germanic, slavish, south-european from origin, because we literally build holland. Nobody lived here 2000 years ago. It wasn't a place you could live. It was only swamp and water. 

So, there you go, with your ethnicity. It just doesn't exists, except when you talk to a rascist like a Nazi or a KKK (i mean NRA) member.

It also, is not a fair reflection of culture. In Holland we have a few million Frisians. They speak their own language. They are not part of any common dutch religion. We also have  dialects. As far as we are concerned I can't understand about half the people in Holland. And guess, what? Germany is even more diverse. 

**So, to summarize:**

I'm all for helping people get medical care, either through charity or by helping to bring the cost down.  Incidentally, the cost of medical care is grossly inflated, both due to the costs of the sheer bulk of ridiculous lawsuits that the legal system isn't equipped the handle, and the cost of regulation on the medical profession as a whole.  Off the top of my head, my brother got contacts the other day.  Do you realize how insane it is that you need a prescription from the doctor to get a piece of curved plastic to put on your eyeball?  That could have cost two dollars and been done by a high school student with two machines and a poster board if those laws weren't in place.  Expertise is not involved.  Don't even get me started on the cost-benefit of legalizing drugs.

They do. In Germany they call it 'high-german'. Its the dialect everybody sort of gets. In Holland it's actually referred to as 'hilversum' (the place where most tv stations are located). 

Some accents are understandable, and some just aren't. In between Germany and Holland, you really have a lot of in-between-dialects, for example. We have cities, where one street is half german, half dutch. Y ou don't really think they suddenly speak a different language at house number 115. They don't. They all speak the same language in such a city, the in-between dialect. The country borders are not really visible in any culturally meaningfull way. It sort of just 'progresses' slowly from Holland to Germany.

Also, we have some dialects that are not at the border, that are just really their own languages, they just never got that status. The people can speak clean Dutch, sort of.  But it's not their native tongue. Frisian is an actual accepted official language, although they need to speak normal dutch as well to interact with the government and everything.

&gt;Once again, I am interested in cultural differences, Germany does regular censuses where they keep track of who comes from where.

Yes. A census on Immigration. So, in their census a white person from South Africa would, just as black person from South Africa, be listed as 'south-african'.

Notice how the table is a list of countries. Places with passports. That doesn't fit your definition as well.

But this is interesting:

&gt;I'm not sure what your experience is living in America, but ethnicity is self reported in America, which means it is what the person sees them self as, which means it is a fairly reliable indicator of culture, which is what I was referring to.

Self-reported? So, where are the trekkies?
Where are the browncoats? Where are the redditors?

It appears to me, nobody that fills in the census, in the US, uses your definition of ethnicity. They think of mine, and fill in whatever race a rascist would consider them to have.

You come up with a table labeling people as ""black"" and ""white"" and suggesting these percentages have a correlation with problems in your country.

Our resources are limited, and we have to make decisions when distributing them. As it turns out, our decisions indicate that we value the average American or European *pet* far higher than we value the average African child.

But that's only the start of the insanity.

In most western countries, millions of dollars are spent on keeping old, suffering, severely ill people alive even though they themselves do not want to live anymore. That same money, spent on preventative medicine (even in the west), could save many, many lives. Yet our decisions show that we value forcing old people to suffer one or two years more than helping prevent currently healthy people from getting sick and dying.

Just a few years back, my hospital started euthanizing babies. None of these babies had any chance whatsoever of long-term survival - for all of them, the only thing that could be achieved was stretching their suffering for a few more days, weeks or months at most, often at a cost of many thousands of dollars. The choice to euthanize in these cases led to an international scandal, with criticism from people like the pope and George W. Bush.

In the US, a single free clinic can save quite a few lives by providing people with timely treatment and diagnosis. Just a handful of abortions in cases where the prognosis is death and pouring in money will only result in adding a few more months of suffering could save enough money to pay for such a free clinic.

In countries with universal health care, the situation is similar. Reducing waiting times and increasing the number of general practitioners saves far more lives than going the extra ten miles for cases that are probably lost.

If you think the idea of giving up a child over costs is disgusting, consider this: having ambulances available within a mile of any location where people live would be immensely costly, but it would save numerous lives - including those of children. Yet we don't do this, because the costs have been judged to outweigh the benefits.

If you saw both your car and a young child falling down a mountain, and you could save only one of the two, you'd undoubtedly save the child.

So during the great deluge, in addition to all that rain, water sprung up from the ground. The theory was that the continents squeezed the water up through cracks until the layer was about 50 ft thick, where it acted as a lubricant. The continents separated at about 40 miles per hour and slammed into each other, creating the mountain ridges in India, Europe, and North America.

Western Europe is [running into obscene debt even faster than we are.](http://www.visualeconomics.com/gdp-vs-national-debt-by-country/).  Keep in mind, that's with a higher tax rate than us, no vast tracts of land to cover with infrastructure, and no horrifying military abomination to support.  That's all social services right there, and they are going to crash and burn.

&gt;We are, and that is due to the top 10% of the people owning 90% of our nation's assets. Due to wealth distribution which is a systematic flaw in our economy, which is what this healthcare debate is making quite obvious.

Boo hoo, the successful are rich.  Wealth isn't a zero sum game.  Their success doesn't hurt you in the slightest.  You might want it, but that's not the same thing.  Wealth tends to snowball.

Well, actually, you can, but then you're the entitled American middle class (badum-tish).  We cannot run our country's economy like a moron with his first credit card.  We just can't.  It destroys people, and it'll destroy nations too.

&gt;My point.

My point being, you're asking government to save you from a problem that government played a major role in creating.  

&gt;Exactly the reverse of my point. Health care, basic food, yes, a right in my opinion. Restaurant food no... America is so fucked right now that they think McDonald's is a god-given right. Can't wait for McPalin McMooserib.

There are no rights like that.  Clean water isn't a right.  Food isn't a right.  Healthcare isn't a right.  Rights are ways of defining what the government isn't allowed to do to you.  They aren't allowed to take away your life, your liberty, or your pursuit of happiness.  They aren't allowed to infringe upon your speech, or prevent you from owning firearms, or quarter troops in your house, or do anything to you outside of rigorously documented legal contexts, or any number of other things.  Rights don't say a damn thing about what the government gives you, only what they don't take away. You're expected to figure the rest out for yourself.  

&gt;Who are these people who are no longer obligated to pay? Patients? Right now, sunny boy, they go bankrupt.

The reason these costs are so high is because this shit is expensive.  All corruption and profiteering aside, it is inherently costly.  We can make it cheaper by carefully deregulating some aspects and charitably funding things, but that's about it.

We can sympathize and connect with people of all different ages, genders, cultures, languages, there is no barrier now that cannot be crossed.

We need to bring the machine to a stop.  Look at those recent riots in Europe.  What if, instead of rioting, those people just didn't go to work for a week.  What if in stead of 20,000,000 unemployed we had 100,000,000 people who just stopped showing up to work because we're not going to help this machine along unless the people in power start listening.

Right here we have a huge community of people who want to do something, we just need to figure out what and move forward.

And I think that's the thing too, we don't need to do just anything.  I think the first step is to get more clear about *what* exactly it is we want.  An end to war?  Hunger?  AIDS?  I personally feel that with the technologies we have, the threats we face as a species, and the current political climate what we need and possibly in order functionality is 1) An end to hunger, because so long as there are people whose children die of starvation/malnutrition/inadequate drinking water there will be people willing to fight/steal/kill and people willing to take advantage of them; 2) A complete disarmament of the entire planet, I don't mean individuals getting rid of guns or even an end to say the police force, but I mean an end to war being a viable means of resolving disputes; 3) Save the environment.  Even if you don't believe that global warming is real, i don't think anyone can say that eventually the amount of plastic in the ocean, the lack of clean air in certain places (LA and SLC spring to mind), the extinction of certain species (bees anyone?) don't pose a potential problem for our survival as a species.  Also, no one seems to be dealing with the fact that eventually this planet will become uninhabitable and our only hopes of long-term (as ridiculous as it sounds, I know we're talking about millions/billions of years here) survival is to get off of this planet/out of this solar system/into deep space.

I mean really, if the ""end game"" of this planet is destruction, shouldn't our collective goal as a species be to combat that?  The further I get into this rant the more I feel like our main goal(s) should be to make life on earth as sustainable as possible so that we can live long enough to make or at least find out if deep-space travel is even possible.  

(Side note: Dude, what if we were able to develop a sort of ""noah's ark"" where you had a space ship that was pointed at what we thought was the closest thing to an Earth-like planet, and on this craft were a bunch of incubators that would create genetic clones of humans once it reached its destination.

Here's a simple question: if a jewish parents have a child, that child is jewish right? What if that child rejects the religion? They still do consider themselves to part of the 'jewish' people. Obviously they are using the term as an etnicity, and not as a religion.

The nazi's didn't spare jewish people that renounced their fate or something. It wasn't about religion. They killed people that had some jewish grand-parent or relative. Because of their ethnicity, not because of their culture.

The difference between opt-in labels and born-in labels may seem minimal, but is actually very crucial. 

But that's just on the PC playing field. Let's look at reality. People are asked what their 'etnicity' is, they answer with 'black', 'white', 'hispanic' and 'asian'. I'm pretty sure, if they were asked what culture they were part of, the answers would be quite different. It seems the people filling out your census thought it was about race. Nobody filled in 'American' or 'Canadian', right?

You may be right, that because of the separation, culture really was divided over race lines. But I wonder what a new immigrant from Senegal would fill in. That person isn't part of the american ""black"" culture, is he? 

As to Europe. The term ethnicity is only used by racists. Ever. And when I look at the states, it seems to be case there as well. Perhaps you just didn't notice.

And your argument, really is the argument used by the NRA to explain why there is ""more violence In america"". ""Because of the ethnic diversity""

I'm sorry for wall of downvotes you were getting. I don't like PC-ness either. But ethnicity is the PC term for being a racist. It's the diplomatic double-speak for judging people based on their race and/or heritage.

And let's be honest, between the black and white americans, moral values tend to be the exact same. It's not like the debate about abortion, gay rights or foreign policy is split over these categories. It's not. 

That little cultural diversity that you have, shouldn't be causing more problems than any other country. The simple fact you can talk to 99,999% of all americans, including illegals by just speaking two languages. If I drive for 60 minutes, I can't understand half the people around me anymore. 

If white/black were really about culture, and not about race, does this mean that a liberal hippy from San Francisco, is claiming to be part of the same culture as a Redneck from Texas, but not of the same culture as Tiger Woods or Will Smith? You've got to be kidding me.

I'm sure you are aware of China's currency fixing regimen designed to boost exports.

Zionism is a movement started by a number of European Jews in the 1890's who claimed Palestine as their homeland due to so called historical biblical ties. 

Out of a population of 1,000,000 people in Palestine in 1897 only 5% or 50,000 were Jewish.

Those few Jews in Palestine reacted negatively to Zionism. They neither saw the need for a Jewish state in Palestine, not did they want to exacerbate relations with the Palestinian Arabs. At this time in the Holy Land, religions lived together in relative harmony, a harmony only disrupted when the Zionists began to claim that Palestine was the rightful possession of the Jewish people to the exclusion of its Muslim and Christian inhabitants.

In 1914 the Zionists had 127,000 dues paying members world-wide and had been trying to push the Jewish people to Palestine since 1890

The didn't want to go, In world war 1 the Jews were told to go to Palestine and only 25,000 actually went.

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews and later Austrian and Czech Jews stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe.

In 1935 as a result 60,000 Jews moved into Palestine. This was not enough as the Zionists wanted millions to move there, but of course just like WW1 no one wanted to leave the green pastures of Europe to go to the desert, a final solution was created, either go to Israel as the Zionists wanted or be persecuted and exterminated by the Nazis who were funded by the Zionists Rothschild's league of bankers.

The Jews had a choice, move to Israel or get persecuted

History as written always goes to the winner and the globalists back then and the operation mockingbird MSM haven't actually told the truth about Hitler's roll in WW2 on behalf of the globalists.

We hear a lot about the Jewish holocaust but not much on the fact the Zionists funded and controlled/owned Hitler and his agenda.

http://www.savethemales.ca/hitler_was_a_godsend_for_israe.html

&gt; As soon as the Nazis assumed power in 1933, the Zionists gained a visibly protected political status. After the Reich-stag fire, the Nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. But not the Zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. Zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the Third Reich."" The Zionist uniform was the only non-Nazi uniform allowed in Germany. Same with their flag. Hebrew was mandated in Jewish schools. Still German Jews wanted to stay in Germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" But the Zionists scorned the German Jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate.

Then came the Zionist funded holocaust

The older generations can vouch for it in Germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth

After WW2 the Nazis/Zionists scientific operations were moved from Germany to the United States under operation paper-clip forming organisations like the CIA and NASA etc and America became the new foreign military corporation for the Rothschild league of bankers and the Zionists new dog.

Moving the ideology of the people since 1915.

U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947

Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States"".

Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers"".

In the Late 40'/50s after WW2 and the Nazi migration to the United States the CIA was created and under one of their most successful operations they took over the media

[Operation MOCKINGBIRD](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=operation+mockingbird&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;num=100&amp;lr=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;ft=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_rights=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;cr=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;safe=images)

&gt; The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.

The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 (guess who owns them) companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.

Whatever they say is still taken to the water cooler and made gospel globally by the many people who just don't get it.

In the 19th century an European Royalty/Vatican/House of Rothschild pact was made pooling their resources to form a global financial system controlled by private interests

Some extremely credible resources to learn the true history of the how, who and when this came to be by Professor Carroll Quigley who was asked to act as historian for this secret group.

From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was ""the most influential course in their undergraduate careers"" and he revealed all in his books.

I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.""

Professor Carroll Quigley

""The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole... Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world's money""

**And finally The Old Zionist Trick**

When ever any criticism is directed towards the Zionists who own the media and financial systems globally they turn any criticism of them into criticism of the good Jewish people and then hide in amongst the Jewish communities yelling out anti Semitic anti Semitic. People need to stop using the word Jews when talking about Zionists otherwise they will make you look anti-Semitic every time.

**1. Accept that you are in the minority**

With acceptance comes a level of inner peace.  Being on the Internet, at college, and (especially) on Reddit likely skews your thinking into believing you are in the majority and (more importantly) that you are right in everything you believe.  You may very well be, but the majority of Americans who vote (and those you choose not to shouldn't) have spoken in multiple elections over the last 3-4 decades and consistently delivered Republican power in some form.  Stop railing and just lay back and accept the rogering.

**2. GTFO**

Related to point one, really.  Once you ACCEPT that you ARE in the minority, you may not like it and you probably won't enjoy keeping quiet about it.  You're full of righteous indignation and being the smug know it all at work or in your family probably won't adequately dissipate all that rage.  So...leave.  Pack your shit and head to Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia (though we don't like Yanks that much to be truthful), anywhere really.


**3. Can't beat them?  Join them!**

Do you like money?  Do you like happy-happy joy-joy singing on Sundays?  Do you like guns?  Do you like bow-ties and rainbow colored signs?  No?  Hmm...well you can always learn to love these things, especially if you didn't like my advice in point 2.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group#USA

""Ethnicity theory"" in the US refers to a school of thinking on race that arose in response first to biological views of race, which underwrote some of the most extreme forms of racial social stratification, exclusion and subordination. 

""Ethnicity theory came to be synonymous with a liberal and neoconservative rejection or diminution of race as a fundamental feature of US social order, politics and culture. Ethnicity theorists embraced an individualist, quasi-voluntarist notion of identity, which downplayed the significance of race as structuring element in US history and society. Michael Omi and Howard Winant have argued in the their book Racial Formation in the United States: from the 1960s to the 1990s that ethnicity theory fails to grapple effectively with the meaning and material significance of race in the US and offer a theory of racial formation as an alternative view.""

It was evacuated by Ariel Sharon, who was Likud (later Kadima). Up until it was evacuated, settlers continued building settlements, and soldiers were there.

Sharon was a stalwart pro settlement zealot.  Ask yourself why he'd ""change""?

[Here's some reading for you](http://www.jmcc.org/Documentsandmaps.aspx?id=698) from an interview with Sharon's friend and advisor Dov Weisglass.

You should read the interview, but if you don't want to then:

""When you say `maneuver,' it doesn't sound nice. It sounds like you said one thing and something else came out. But that's the whole point. After all, what have I been shouting for the past year? That I found a device, in cooperation with the management of the world, to ensure that there will be no stopwatch here. That there will be no timetable to implement the settlers' nightmare. I have postponed that nightmare indefinitely. Because what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did. The significance is the freezing of the political process. And when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state and you prevent a discussion about the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package that is called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed from our agenda indefinitely. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress. What more could have been anticipated? What more could have been given to the settlers?""

&gt;Alternatively, a peace treaty could work.

If Israel wanted one sure, but why would they when they have all the power in this relationship?  All the Palestinians could do is throw essentially bottlerockets from Gaza and face heavy retaliation.

&gt;The ""significant to Judaism"" part is very dubious. Israeli government is hardly religious, and the main considerations brought are those of security. The main fear of giving back the West Bank is that Israel will have a narrow strip that's easily divided by an enemy army, which will split Israel into two.

Religious significance attracts settlers.  Why do you think Hebron is being carved up so aggressively?  Also who will divide nuclear armed Israel into two?

&gt;You were claiming that Israel has laws discriminating Arabs, which is false. I agree there are various forms of discrimination against the Arab minority, as is true of virtually every minority everywhere, particularly where there is a prolonged conflict.

I live in Luxembourg, which is less than 1,000 square miles in area, so it's almost impossible to create a new landfill site here.  As a result a lot of stuff is recycled.  We have separate collections for plastic and aluminium (every 2 weeks), compostable (every 2 weeks), paper (every month), glass (every month).  Each time, there are 3 guys in a municipal truck driving around our small town for a day.

It's very energy-intensive, and the downstream sorting and reshipping takes more energy.  There's no local market or processing plant for most of this stuff, so a lot of it is sent off by train (to Germany or Eastern Europe, I think).

We do this because there is not much choice.  But the energy cost (and budget) is enormous.

There are also real, measurable benefits of reducing poverty.

An obvious one is a reduced crime rate (at least for physical crimes like robberies or theft). A less obvious one is that a small spread in purchasing power in a region leads to products that are better suited to your needs. For example, I live in Switzerland and it is simply impossible to find as low-quality food as it can be found in other European country because everyone can afford a healthy standard. Consequently, there is more shelf-space left for goods I care about, which benefits me. Also, the whole transport infrastructure is built for people with high purchasing power.

I'd bet money the vast majority of British Muslims, or Muslims in general, didn't give a crap. And sure enough, they quote the one UK Muslim crackpot, Anjem Choudhry who's known for his crazy views that do not represent the mainstream majority of Britain's Muslims. It's disingenuous of the Daily Mail to go and quote him specifically instead of Muslims more representative of the population (who'd want to bet they had to waste some time selectively hunting down Twitter updates that met their criteria?), but hey... that's how they roll. It's the Daily Mail.

As to the claim itself...

I saw it. I loved it. I thought it was hilarious.

I liked the part where they dressed up in burqas, because they didn't even make a fuss about it. 

Remember all the hoopla about how burqas were prisons, impractical to wear and especially for female drivers? They were men and had no problems with it, and on a car show where they complain about the most minute thing. While driving across the Syrian desert. If anything, it'd be an endorsement of the burqa (if you can call the idea that ""hey, there's nothing wrong with this, it's okay"" an endorsement and relative to the Islamophobic sentiment sweeping across Europe, I guess you can).

Also made for some hilarity.

It wasn't politically correct though. Isn't the burqa outlawed in Syria or extremely rare there? Must be an honest mistake though, they usually visit like Dubai or Abu Dhabi or something where it's a common sight.

I found the Stig scene at the end to be ridiculous, and in that sense quite funny (particularly considering the falling out they had with the previous Stig), but also blasphemous. Then again, I don't think they were trying to imply that Stig = Jesus, perhaps that the Stig was the ""new"" Jesus, a.k.a. Antichrist (because Jesus is obviously long gone), which seems exactly like the sort of joke they'd make on the show. 

They make far more fun of Christianity, which does disturb me a little. Though it doesn't really cross the border into insulting Jesus outright, just mocking Christians. In fact, I think it's quite telling that they don't themselves try to make Jesus out to look bad, only the view that his followers have of him. For instance, during the polar special they had that Jesus doll which said random quotes when you pulled the string. They didn't make that doll, or the gold coin in this episode with Jesus' face on it. Christians did. So I more or less view the show from the context of an outsider watching Christians (or ex-Christians) mock other Christians. I admit I don't know the whole story or their motivations, as only someone in their position could. But I definitely don't take this to mean that they are unbiased sources of knowledge on Christianity (like I wouldn't trust an ex-Muslim to tell me anything unbiased about Islam, only about their own personal experiences).",8,True,t3_euwkp,0,False,c1b54j4,

   ""With America desperate for jobs, now is the worst time for the Federal Communications Commission to be imposing “net-neutrality” and potentially scaring away  
   billions of dollars in telecommunications investment, according to Robert Litan of the Kauffman Foundation and Brookings Institution and Hal Singer of Navigant 
   Economics.""

So how does this benefit us?  So far I haven't read anything that makes me want to say: Yes!  FCC bring it on!  Free us from the already open and free internet!""

   ""Julius Genachowski, Chair of the Federal Communication Commission and appointed by President Obama, worked closely with big telecommunication corporations 
   to put in place fake net neutrality rules that heavily favor industry and are bad for consumers.

   The new rules are actually worse than doing nothing to protect net neutrality as they allow mobile networks to block lawful content and allow ""paid  
   prioritization."" Even worse, the FCC failed to reclassify broadband under Title II, so even meager protections are sure to be thrown out by the courts.""

Based on that I would say that Net Neutrality will actually hamper the progress and development of the internet.  Think, HTML 5 is on it's way out.  Some companies like Firefox and Google's Chrome and others are already making changes to support it.  HTML 5 should be a major, much needed, improvement on the basic language of the internet.  What would happen if the FCC decides, in accordance with Net Neutrality, that HTML 6 needs to be more ""fair and open and free.""  What would that mean for us?  Perhaps it would mean that freedom of development was limited or bogged down in government oversight in order to ensure that is ""free and open.""  Has anybody so far complained about any of the HTML X's being restrictive?  NO.  In fact, every iteration of HTML X has been a vast improvement on the previous standard.  Therefore each new version of HTML has vastly improved the way we view, download, interact, and surf the World Wide Web.  I guarantee that once Net Neutrality is signed into law that the next version of HTML will be heavily regulated.  Again, I ask, why?

Then there's the matter of what Net Neutrality gives the government power of in the future.  They will literally have the right to impose laws on how you search the internet or surf the interet.  For example, say I wanted to find to read about Hitler and other tyrants like Chairman Mao.  The government may say that people like them should not be read into as their influence on someone may be negative.  Good point, I am sure that most who read about Hitler either go one of two ways; he was a tyrant, he was a visionary.  Whichever way you sway, THAT'S YOUR RIGHT.  The government has no business telling me how to believe. It also gives the government the power to impose new laws on the physical infrastructure of an ISP's network.  If the government decrees:  Every ISP shall provide up to 12 MB a sec download speed for every customer!  You would say,""Fuck yea!""  However, what does that mean for you.  It means that your ISP and all ISP's will have to modify, or improve the infrastructure.  Which won't be cheap. Who pays for all of that?  Who pays for the workers to dig up the lines and add new ones? Who pays for the manufacturing of new cable?  Who pays for the upgrading and building of new servers?  Who pays for the expansion of buildings to hows the now regulated bandwidth?  It certainly won't be the government.  Even if it was the government, it would still be the same people paying it....YOU, the consumer.  You will be forced to pay for all these great new things that the government has now commanded the ISP's do.  

If you have never really had much to complain about when it comes to the pricing of your internet, the bandwidth and such, then why make your life harder and let the government tell ISP's how to be ""free and open"".  It's not warranted.  Advancement of the internet comes naturally, just as it should.  If you use a ton of internet, like I do, you should pay extra for the above normal usage.  If you use it for the basics, then you should pay less than I do.  

One argument for net neutrality is this:  Everybody gets the same amount of bandwidth, download/upload speed as everybody else.  Sounds great.  BUT, that is going to cause MAJOR disruptions for all ISP's.  Currently, the infrastructure of the internet is adequate to handle the current load, with improvements made everyday. Most people in the US have great service. Compare that with Europe, who in the UK the average download speed is a maximum of 120 kbs a second.  And that's ONLY if no one else is on the internet in your ""exchange"" area.  Look up internet exchange and you will see what I am talking about.  That absolute crap. Think of it this way:  If you are online playing COD: Black Ops (or any online game), you cannot have the internet running anywhere else in your house.  That means no laptop, PC or any other device.  Also EVERY ISP has a limit on how much you can download per month. Usually 40GB's.  Now I don't know about you, but I am a heavy downloader,  I can fly through 40Gigs in a matter of a week or two. (Currently, I have about 32+Gigs in torrents downloading) All this is done under the guise of being open and free for everybody.  

Lets say you only use the internet for e-mail and basic things like checking weather.  Do you need a ton of internet usage for that, no.  But, people like me who use the internet for games, movies, music, surfing, reddit, etc...would appreciate not having to give up chunks of my internet to someone who won't use it.  I hope this is making sense.

This is what Net Neutrality will do.  It will limit what you can do under the morale guise of being open and free.  It will give the government, not yet seen, power to what it likes in the name of being open and free.  Net Neutrality will hamper progress and development and keep investors away.  Who want's to invest in a product that has to have a government stamp of approval. (Side note: Name on government intervention that has helped improve the lives of it's people.)  

If you were one of the unfortunate who burned by your ISP I apologize on their behalf.  It was wrong and shady.  It should never have happened.  Hopefully your experience has turned out for the better.  

If you read this far, I applaud you.  I know this post is EXTREMELY long.  But I was getting tired of people telling me this is good, when I haven't been able to read anything that backs that up.  Be a smart citizen, don't take my word for it, RESEARCH by your lonesome.  Get the facts on your own volition.  Don't let anyone tell you what to think!

**Americans also need to know who runs Israel and the Untied States of America** *not that i actually care if they dont, but here is a few basics on how it works*

Zionism is a movement started by a number of European Jews in the 1890's who claimed Palestine as their homeland due to so called historical biblical ties. 

Out of a population of 1,000,000 people in Palestine in 1897 only 5% or 50,000 were Jewish.

Those few Jews in Palestine reacted negatively to Zionism. They neither saw the need for a Jewish state in Palestine, not did they want to exacerbate relations with the Palestinian Arabs. At this time in the Holy Land, religions lived together in relative harmony, a harmony only disrupted when the Zionists began to claim that Palestine was the rightful possession of the Jewish people to the exclusion of its Muslim and Christian inhabitants.

In 1914 the Zionists had 127,000 dues paying members world-wide and had been trying to push the Jewish people to Palestine since 1890

The didn't want to go, In world war 1 the Jews were told to go to Palestine and only 25,000 actually went.

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews and later Austrian and Czech Jews stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe.

In 1935 as a result 60,000 Jews moved into Palestine. This was not enough as the Zionists wanted millions to move there, but of course just like WW1 no one wanted to leave the green pastures of Europe to go to the desert, a final solution was created, either go to Israel as the Zionists wanted or be persecuted and exterminated by the Nazis who were funded by the Zionists Rothschild's league of bankers.

The Jews had a choice, move to Israel or get persecuted

History as written always goes to the winner and the globalists back then and the operation mockingbird MSM haven't actually told the truth about Hitler's roll in WW2 on behalf of the globalists.

We hear a lot about the Jewish holocaust but not much on the fact the Zionists funded and controlled/owned Hitler and his agenda.

http://www.savethemales.ca/hitler_was_a_godsend_for_israe.html

&gt; As soon as the Nazis assumed power in 1933, the Zionists gained a visibly protected political status. After the Reich-stag fire, the Nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. But not the Zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. Zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the Third Reich."" The Zionist uniform was the only non-Nazi uniform allowed in Germany. Same with their flag. Hebrew was mandated in Jewish schools. Still German Jews wanted to stay in Germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" But the Zionists scorned the German Jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate.

Then came the Zionist funded holocaust

The older generations can vouch for it in Germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth

After WW2 the Nazis/Zionists scientific operations were moved from Germany to the United States under operation paper-clip forming organisations like the CIA and NASA etc and America became the new foreign military corporation for the Rothschild league of bankers and the Zionists new dog.

**The Zionist media steers the American public like sheep into what ever paddock they want them on any issue**

Moving the ideology of the people since 1915.

U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947

Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States"".

Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers"".

In the Late 40'/50s after WW2 and the Nazi migration to the United States the CIA was created and under one of their most successful operations they took over the media

[Operation MOCKINGBIRD](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=operation+mockingbird&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;num=100&amp;lr=&amp;as_filetype=&amp;ft=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_rights=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;cr=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;safe=images)

&gt; The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.

The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 (guess who owns them) companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.

Whatever they say is still taken to the water cooler and made gospel globally by the many people who just don't get it.

**The Zionist Money System** Federal Reserve Systems/Commonwealth Reserve (neither federal/commonwealth or a reserve)

In the 19th century an European Royalty/Vatican/House of Rothschild pact was made pooling their resources to form a global financial system controlled by private interests

Some extremely credible resources to learn the true history of the how, who and when this came to be by Professor Carroll Quigley who was asked to act as historian for this secret group.

From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was ""the most influential course in their undergraduate careers"" and he revealed all in his books.

""I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.""

Professor Carroll Quigley

""The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole... Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world's money""

**The Two Party Punch and Judy Puppet Show Fools Democracy**

When it comes to Prime ministers or Presidents you only get to choose between two people both selected behind closed doors loyal to the agenda, anyone else who dares to stand is taken out by the Zionist controlled media while the two selected puppets get funded by the Zionist controlled financial systems and corporations

http://imgur.com/YMmZJ guess who troll guy is?, the same for all two party systems, why risk losing control of the agenda when you can own both puppets and ensure long term agendas go the way you want.

**And finally The Old Zionist Trick**

When ever any criticism is directed towards the Zionists who own the media and financial systems globally they turn any criticism of them into criticism of the good Jewish people and then hide in amongst the Jewish communities yelling out anti Semitic anti Semitic. People need to stop using the word Jews when talking about Zionists otherwise they will make you look anti-Semitic every time.

There aren't a lot of black folks here and I personally think that racism isn't as far spread in (western) Germany than in a lot of other european countries - precisely because of the troubled history of this country.

A lot of this mistrust is due to the failed german immigration policies. Take a look at Berlin, which has a big turkish populace. The predominantly turkish quarters are indeed criminal hotspots and the people there are not integrated (not to a great deal) into the larger society and instead formed a parallel society of their own.
That - wrongfully - ""marks off"" onto the larger turkish (and thus the muslim) community in Germany. Those folks are probably the minority, but are the louder part (tragically, you rather remember the turkish boy insulting you in the sub than that guy that simply passes you by in the street).

Furthermore, a real debate - about this issue - has only recently started to emerge.

Even with fairly low APM, you could easily make it into a moderately high league (probably gold, *maybe* low platinum).

Wanna know why?

Because APM isn't what's going to decide a game.

Just because you have high APM (even high conscious APM) doesn't mean you're a good player.

That's like going to /r/chess or any major chess forum and saying ""if I can move my pieces faster, what advantage will I have?"" (granted it's not exactly like that as Starcraft is in real time, but the principle is the same).

A lot of European and North American players have fairly low APM for the pro stage. 

The last few winners of the GSL (biggest Starcraft 2 tournament) had only ""average"" APMs for their skill level.

APM isn't a specific skill you as a player try to achieve.

It's a side effect of understanding the game so well that the strategies you conceive in your head translate to your fingers automagically.

Much more important than the speed at which you perform different strategies is the strategies themselves.

Even when two players are absolutely equal in every way, APM will not be the deciding factor.

It will be whoever reacts and performs the best.

If both are perfectly equal at that (although that's pretty much not possible and it usually changes per map and per race matchup), it'll be the person who doesn't slip first.

Sorry that this is turning a long rantfest.

If you want to play Starcraft (1 or 2), don't worry about APM. If you're someone who can either:

A) Think and react mentally blazingly fast

B) Be willing to put in a bit of time to learn enough about the game that they can learn to react blazingly fast.

Then you'll do fine.

Admittedly, your first few days on multiplayer may feel like utter abuse and chaos...

But join /r/starcraft and understand how to play.

Also, search through [this guys Episode Archive](day9tv.blip.tv) and watch some of the ""Newbie Tuesday"" vids (You might have to search through a bit).

""With America desperate for jobs, now is the worst time for the Federal Communications Commission to be imposing “net-neutrality” and potentially scaring away
billions of dollars in telecommunications investment, according to Robert Litan of the Kauffman Foundation and Brookings Institution and Hal Singer of Navigant Economics.""
So how does this benefit us? So far I haven't read anything that makes me want to say: Yes! FCC bring it on! Free us from the already open and free internet!""
""Julius Genachowski, Chair of the Federal Communication Commission and appointed by President Obama, worked closely with big telecommunication corporations to put in place fake net neutrality rules that heavily favor industry and are bad for consumers.
The new rules are actually worse than doing nothing to protect net neutrality as they allow mobile networks to block lawful content and allow ""paid
prioritization."" Even worse, the FCC failed to reclassify broadband under Title II, so even meager protections are sure to be thrown out by the courts.""
Based on that I would say that Net Neutrality will actually hamper the progress and development of the internet. Think, HTML 5 is on it's way out. Some companies like Firefox and Google's Chrome and others are already making changes to support it. HTML 5 should be a major, much needed, improvement on the basic language of the internet. What would happen if the FCC decides, in accordance with Net Neutrality, that HTML 6 needs to be more ""fair and open and free."" What would that mean for us? Perhaps it would mean that freedom of development was limited or bogged down in government oversight in order to ensure that is ""free and open."" Has anybody so far complained about any of the HTML X's being restrictive? NO. In fact, every iteration of HTML X has been a vast improvement on the previous standard. Therefore each new version of HTML has vastly improved the way we view, download, interact, and surf the World Wide Web. I guarantee that once Net Neutrality is signed into law that the next version of HTML will be heavily regulated. Again, I ask, why?
Then there's the matter of what Net Neutrality gives the government power of in the future. They will literally have the right to impose laws on how you search the internet or surf the interet. For example, say I wanted to find to read about Hitler and other tyrants like Chairman Mao. The government may say that people like them should not be read into as their influence on someone may be negative. Good point, I am sure that most who read about Hitler either go one of two ways; he was a tyrant, he was a visionary. Whichever way you sway, THAT'S YOUR RIGHT.

It certainly won't be the government. Even if it was the government, it would still be the same people paying it....YOU, the consumer.

Hah. The fall-back position of the right on the Israel-Palestine question. Don't worry, I've heard this all before. Any criticism of Israel is anti-semitic, therefore Israel must always be supported no matter if it is a terrorist state.

No. I don't accept your argument. Don't think you can just twist words with me. Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Jews, not criticism of Israel. They are not the same, nor will they ever be the same. As long as Israel continues to use terrorism against the peoples of Palestine, as long as it continues to seize their land and kill their children it shall be criticised: and it doesn't matter if you are Jewish, Christian, or Arab; if you support that kind of disgusting behaviour you'll be criticised along with it.

And I'm sure you'll say ""well the Palestinians are terrorists!"" or that I support Hamas or something equally silly. Peoples have a right to self-defence and a modern military versus a bunch of guys who struggle to find a few old guns is not a fair fight and I'll always come down on the side of the oppressed and weak. Israel could stop bulldozing their houses, but it won't. And if I say it should, according to you, I'm anti-semitic!

 &gt;the Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland.

Of course private negotiations works, becuase that's the only way negotiations are ever conducted. If you try a strategy 100 times it is bound to work a few times no matter how flawed it is. That doesn't mean public negotiations with the full input of the people actually affected on the ground wouldn't have worked. Besides, the Good Friday agreement isn't a complete success: The situation in NI continues to be unstable. You're just acting as an apologist for imperialism: Go to a country (without asking anyone), fuck up a country (without asking anyone), pretend in a half-assed manner to have left the country (without asking anyone) - secrecy works!

&gt;The most impressive thing about them wrt the Arab world is how much they were willing to support US policy.

Exactly, becuase they were allowed to operate in secret free from the scrutiny of their peoples - such is the hallmark of dictatorial and terroristic regimes. If someone bothered to ask the actual people being affected - Both Israeli, Palestinian and Arab - we might make some headway. As long as these regimes are allowed to be secretive, to hide from their own peoples, you get international power politics where imperialist behaviour is the norm. As long as people like you justify and act as apologists for these things then these things will continue. Leaders will always act in the interests of their ruling class, from the US to Iran, and as long as they are allowed to do this free from scrutiny, free from openness, and therefore free from democracy, the ordinary person will always lose out: Jewish, European, American or Arab.

I don't usually downvote people simply for presenting an argument, but if you're fucking stupid, ridiculous and insulting enough to call someone anti-semitic for a criticism of Israel you deserve every downvote you get.

This is especially rue of dancing, with regular classes and social dances in almost every style you can imagine.

I think the most important piece of advice I can give you about picking a style of dance is to be sure to chose one that is danced to music that makes you want to dance - but don't necessarily dismiss a style just because you aren't yet that familiar with the music.

That said, though, for me, it has to be Swing: Lindy Hop and Balboa in particular.  Although I was indifferent to the music at first (I'd mostly listened to classical music up to the time I started dancing), I now find it impossible to sit still if a swing song comes on.  Here are a few other reasons I love swing (and why you might, too):

- There's a lot going on in London.  Check out [Swing Out London](http://www.swingoutlondon.co.uk/) or [Swing Dancers of London](http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/) for a fairly complete listing of what's going on.  For classes there are many, many choices but at the moment my advice for beginners would be to see what [classes Swing Patrol might be running near you](http://swingpatrol.co.uk/class-timetable.php).

- The dances have a good combination of structure and improvisation, so there are rules and patterns you can learn to start out while there is also a huge amount of freedom just to play, too.

- Connection: it's hard to explain this to non-dancers, but a huge part of most kinds of partner dancing is the dynamic physical connection you have with the person you're dancing with.  It takes a  while to learn how to really make the connection feel great, but when it happens it's the best thing in the world.  One of the most surprising things that has happened to me while learning to dance is realising that how well I connect with someone on the dance floor can have a huge influence on how I feel about them.  There are absolutely gorgeous women that i've got along great with - only to lose all interest in after a single, underwhelming dance - and women I might never have noticed until something magic happened on the dance floor and I was left feeling like I now knew this complete stranger more deeply than I have ever known any of my non-dancing friends.

- Speaking of women: I have always had a few close female friends, but I now know quite literally hundreds of wonderful, clever, beautiful and talented women from all over the world - thanks to dancing.  Almost everyone I've dated in the past five years has been someone I've met on the dance floor - and there have been a lot more than I would ever have imagined before I started dancing.  Plus, with women generally outnumbering men at most events, being even a moderately competent dancer will make you very popular.

- The travel opportunities: the Lindy scene is global, and there are weekend dance camps and exchanges going on somewhere in Europe almost every weekend, plus amazing things like the [Herräng Dance Camp](http://www.herrang.com/), which runs for four or five weeks every summer.  I'm currently in Stockholm yet again, having spent the last week at [The Snowball](http://www.thesnowball.se/) dancing with friends I've met at previous events and making new ones.  In the last year I've also been dancing in New York, Gothenburg, Vilnius and Budapest, not to mention Newcastle, Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol.  In most of these places (and many more) I have stayed with friends I've met through dancing.  I have outstanding invitations to visit Copenhagen, Moscow, Ljubljana and Prague, amongst others.  In return, I've hosted dancers from Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Slovenia when they've come dancing in London.  It's like couch-surfing, only much better.


I'm guessing that most other social dance scenes have awesome stuff like this too, though, so even if Swing doesn't do it for you you can probably find a dance which does.  And, in the interests of full disclosure, there are a few disadvantages to Lindy in in comparison to other dances:

- It's not really easy to learn for beginners.  Not as hard as Tango, to be sure, but it's not as easy as Modern Jive or Salsa, for example.

- Although it is hugely popular (and growing), Lindy Hop is still a fairly niche dance compared to, say, ballroom, latin or tango.  This means that you can't necessarily count on finding a great dance scene in every city you might visit.

- If you do get into it, you'll find it insanely addictive - to the point that if you ever decide to leave London you'll find yourself picking amongst other places to live based on which ones have the best dancing...

- There are some weird demographic anomalies in the Lindy Hop community.  A huge proportion of the men tend to be from backgrounds in IT or engineering, while amongst the women there are a lot of teachers and nurses.  This is much less the case in London than in some other cities (Dublin, notoriously, where the first thing I was asked when I went dancing there was, ""So, do you work in IT too, then?""), but it's fair to say that the Swing scene is not very representative of the general population.  Of course, this might mean you have quite a lot in common with the people you will meet - and for me at least there's much to be said for taking dance classes from someone who thinks the same way you do.  (Also, somewhat embarrassingly for a dance that was originally created by by a predominantly black community in Harlem in the '30s, there are surprisingly few non-caucasians who dance Lindy today.)",3,True,t3_eum24,0,False,c1b584w,

Your analysis of the cover is not really objective either; if you would actually have read the content of the magazine you might judge differently, but you seem to be one of those judging something by its cover and categorizing it as ""brainwashed shit"" without even trying to empirically prove your thesis. 
The Spiegel has the tradition to put its Main Article on the cover, this time it was a well researched historical article about Goebbels, which I don't find wrong in any way, new facts about him were discovered and we're a country that can speak openly about their past, so I don't see any wrong there. Once again, you did not even read the article, flagging the magazine to fit your stereotyped opinion and making it sound scandalous and fascist to publish this kind of article that was  neither of those.

Nothing to blame here either in my opinion, except perhaps the colors of this title making it sound a bit harsh.

Divided or united, the fact remains that India was relatively prosperous.

The simple answer is yes.  It is true, India, like China, was an autarky.  For that matter, Europe was also more-or-less an autarky; however, for whatever reason Europeans had created an artificial demand for, by their very definition, unnecessary luxury products that was not nearly reciprocated to the same degree in India or China.  Why Europeans had this thirst for spices, resins, silks, and other such foreign products, while Orientals were much more complacent with their, relatively speaking, lower standards of living is anyone's guess.  It's not that Europeans didn't have products to offer—for instance, Indian Armies' modern firearms were provided by Europeans, and in a reversal of the roles of today, Britain also supplied large quantities of finished clothing to India—and in most all regards they were scientifically and technologically more advanced—the Catholic priests won their respected position in the Chinese Emperor's court due in no small part thanks to their mechanical gifts and demonstrations of more accurate astronomical models than those domestically possessed.  My personal theories are that this imbalance can be traced to differing political, social, and economic structures, and maybe even genetic predisposition.

Before briefly elaborate on these possible and theoretical explanations, let me start off by saying that I'm painting a picture with very broad strokes.  These are generalizations and stereotypes, and therefore these are far from hard and concrete rules and there are innumerable exceptions; however, I think that they contain more than a grain of truth to them and are apt given the long-term and encompassing picture I'm trying to portray.  Anyways, Orientals are often seen as being more communal in contrast to their Western neighbors' individuality; subservient in contrast to independent; despotic in contrast to democratic; et cetera.  Now, as I warned above, these are stereotypes and they often do not accurately describe the differences between West and the East, let alone at all times throughout history.  But I believe that these contrasting traits of Westerners and Easterners, no matter how imperfect descriptors they are, do have an uncanny and coincidental tendency to manifest themselves in the different norms for political, social, and economic structures.  Orientals political institutions usually concrete power more completely into the hands of one ruler, social structures are often more rigid, and economically the vast majority of the poor peasants are dependent on agriculture; all of these characteristics stunt trade because the classes become extremely stratified and any productivity beyond subsistence is often confiscated or taxed away by a ruling elite.  Obviously these supposedly unique traits of the Oriental are, historically speaking, hardly any more foreign to the West; however, a major difference is that Europe was slowly and surely undergoing a revolution that was transforming its political, social, and economic structures in line with what they are today, while on the contrary the Orientals were retrenching into their antiquated and ossified structures of yore.

Finally, genetic predisposition may not be as farfetched as it initially seems.  For example, genes coding for increased testosterone levels—which do, of course, exist—would lead to a more adventurous streak amongst its carriers.  If these genes were found in higher frequencies among Europeans, that might contribute to explaining why it was the Europeans who explored the world looking for wealth and establishing distant colonies instead of the equally viable Chinese.  This is merely hypothetical speculation and even if true would only be one of many factors that explain these tendencies, but I don't think that possible genetic influences in behavior should be  excluded in favor of only environmental influences.

&gt;religiously (and mostly culturally too, depending on how culture is defined), India was to a large extent united.

My understanding is that Hinduism is no more a uniting influence than Greco-Roman polytheism, Chinese folk religions, or the steppe nomad's shamanistic Tengrism.  By their very nature these are all examples of tolerant and fluid religions, and those traits nullify many of their potential for creating a homogeneous society.  Now that's not to say that there isn't intolerance in Indian culture and religion, most notably the caste system and all of its intricacies; however, I tend to view it as mostly a traditional social structure that was only grafted onto the current iteration of the religion of Hinduism.  In other words, its not a fundamental aspect of Hinduism, just as the niqab isn't one of Islam but instead a culturally tradition anteceding Islamism that has over time become closely associated with it.  

Another problem for Hinduism is its very esoteric, metaphoric, and interpretive nature.  This means that outside of Brahmin and other dedicated spiritualists, the vast majority of Hinduism finesse is lost on the equally vast majority of lay Indians.  And what rudiments of Hinduism they do follow correctly are often supplemented and intertwined with traditional folk beliefs.

These are at least why I tend to think of Hinduism being a poor adhesive for binding Indian's together under a common set of values and beliefs.  But given your background and superior knowledge in the subject, it seems I may need to reevaluate these opinions.",1,True,t3_eua92,0,False,c1b5cv0,

But again, my point was not that India was as good as or better than Britain or Europe, but that there was not as much economic parity as between China and Africa to merit the comparison.

Likewise.  I never really addressed the relationship of Britain and colonial India as being comparable to China and Africa today because I think it's untenable.  In my mind they are only comparable in the most abstract sense; the only reason it is often deemed ""neo-colonialism"" is for political reason, because for many colonialism contains many negative connotations.

&gt;The export related figures are interesting, and since I don't have any knowledge regarding these, I take them at face value. However, it raises an interesting question - why did they do that? From the famine responses and such things, it seems that they did not consider the colonial population to be meriting a very fair treatment under their crown, so what was the motivation behind not sapping off them completely?

My interpretation is that initially the colonial endeavors were mainly attempts to open up new markets—note how the Western powers so highly emphasized open trade, even when dealing with powers that were not colonized, like China and Japan.  This idea arose because the crude economic models of the time stressed the importance of quantitative instead of qualitative production, and that meant the continual and insatiable search for more markets and customers.  In other words, in that time productivity was creating value faster than technological improvements; this being, after all, the dawn of the industrial revolution.  So they neglected to deem increasing standards of living as being an equally viable catalyst for economic growth as instead spreading a lower standard of living amongst a larger number of people.  To rephrase it one last way, the fear was that unless more and more customers and markets could be created for British goods, then economic growth would falter and ultimately stop or reverse.  So the colonization—in India at least, the same cannot be said for other locations like the Americas or Africa because their market potential was incredibly limited; their political structures were often quite elementary to begin with and little other than natural resources to offer the Europeans (note: this is an incredible simplification about colonization in the Americas and Africa, so don't look into too critically)—was primarily economically motivated, in particular with fostering trade.  

And one must also remember that the colonial effort was actually begun by the private East Indian Company, and like all companies its primarily motivation was profit.  It was only later, after the  ""Sepoy Revolt"", that the British Crown set up the Raj and thus direct administration of India.  Before that, although the British government was increasingly playing a role and attempting to regulate the company, India was still practically a personal fief of the autonomous East Indian Company.  The British government was primarily the enabler who protected the monopoly of the East Indian Company instead of directly being involved; and actually, they made several half-hearted attempts to actually restrain the Companies often reckless expansionism.

So what we have here is the colonization of India being divided into two very distinct eras, the first during which it administered by company officers and which short-term profit was the main motivation, while the second under the British Raj in which long-term profits and humanitarian efforts began to obtain increasing importance.  It is true that while under direct British rule some of the worst of the famines did occur, but those were primarily the result of poor administration, economic ignorance, and lack of comprehension of the situation's gravity instead of spite or heartlessness.  But generally speaking, after the British government took over administration from the East Indian Company, the rule become more benevolent, amenable, and lenient.  More concessions were granted and more interest was paid to dissent—the last thing Britain wanted was another uprising. 

This change in attitude beyond solely trying to remain in the black was also a reflection of changing values back at home.  Although still thoroughly racist, the majority began to see their role as being patrimonial; missionaries became more numerous and not only proselyted but also carried out many humanitarian projects; and the concept of the ""White man's burden"" to civilize the ""barbaric"" peoples of the world began to reach maturity.

Who knows how many will get killed in the initial bombardment. They will certainly all get killed when they get overrun by infantry in tanks.

&gt;They will know that it is coming and they will bunker down. 

How do you know that? Sneak attacks are notoriously difficult to see coming. North Korea doesn't have to move anything around, which would be the only way to spot an attack coming, in order to make a full-fledge attack.

&gt; Ironic that you then say that the UN would likely not do anything, since the foundation of the UN was predicated on collective security

Not really, considering they screw up that whole angle on a regular basis. They'd get blocked by China and maybe Russia anyway. China would likely argue that South Korea instigated it. Regardless, many nations would send help without UN approval.

&gt;As for the North Korean government...

I highly doubt Kim Jong-Un is going to go soft on South Korea, especially since the events of the last year. If he doesn't maintain the same level of animosity, then he will only increase it. He can't afford to look weak by placating the South. That's why experts expect more attacks from the North in the near future.

&gt; my summation of the sentiment as gun porn?

Gun porn is talking about military hardware for the sake of talking about military hardware, because it's super cool and all that. It's *not* talking about the practical application of said hardware in a real world scenario for the purpose of determining the outcome of a war.

&gt; I'm not sure what super weapon you think that North Korea will be deploying to ""put giant holes in the runways of all of the air bases.""

Uhhhh.... cruise and ballistic missiles, of course. Also, it's possible their special forces infiltrators will be equipped to disable airports, or something. Cruise missiles and short ranged ballistic missiles are plenty capable of hitting something the size of an air field. They don't need the anti-runway bomblets either. They just need to put big holes in it. It won't take them down for more than a few weeks, but those will be some crucial weeks. Osan could easily be overrun in the time it takes to repair the runways. Or at the very least the North could take Seoul and position its artillery within range of Osan AFB.

&gt; maybe they've got an Air Force chock full of Iron Eagle motherfuckers

Doubt it, but it's possible they could make some suicidal, low-level bombing runs if their missiles don't work. Certainly their pilots have enough skill for *that*. 

&gt; And I seriously doubt that Japan has any actual concerns of being invaded by North Korea in the middle of a full frontal push into South Korea.

Yeah, but they'd certainly be worried about North Korean missiles with WMD on them. That would make the war mighty unpopular for the Japanese.

&gt;60 years of preparation is so far beyond ridiculous that I can't even fathom how layered the defenses on both sides truly are.

The problem is that artillery is mighty handy with dealing with static defenses. The DMZ is the only really heavily fortified area. There are so many people living in the Seoul area and to the south of it that solid defenses are impossible and impractical for daily life. The problem then is that if the North can break through that first line, they could have plenty of momentum to just keep pushing, blitzkrieg style. Just ask the Nazis how their ""fortress Europe"" plan turned out.

&gt; Somehow I'm thinking that North Koreans won't be getting the same courtesy.

The only guns in the country are controlled by the government. From what my Korean friend said, many government buildings have caches of weapons that would be handed out, I guess to those reporting for mobilization. That would certainly make things more difficult, but at the same time they're an *army* with tanks and armored vehicles. Civilians with guns will only be so effective. Also, the North Koreans will probably be shooting at anything that moves, so I don't think they'll be worried about their welcoming.

&gt;An army marches on its stomach

Well, estimates say they have enough food, ammo, and fuel stockpiled in their forward bases to last 4 months of solid fighting. They will also certainly be able to pillage food and fuel. They may even be able to use captured weapons and ammo. As for hitting their logistics, I think their offensive forces would be the more pressing matter. Most air power would be running support sorties. Any planes, except for the stealths, would come under considerable fire if they go near or north of the DMZ to make attacks.

&gt;even easier when the folks who have the most facts still end up having to make shit up

That is certainly the crux of the problem. 

&gt; Anyhow, I'll have to leave any further points in the ""agree to disagree"" column, but it's been a fun thought experiment.

Indeed, indeed. I'm obviously a pessimist when it comes the US military power. I've seen a bit of the Army from the inside and I know the kind of people who join the military very well and I'm not terribly impressed. Most seem to be nothing more than socio-economic conscripts, so in a big war I wouldn't want to have to rely on them. As for me, I'll likely be fighting if war breaks out in the next couple years. I live in Korea and will certainly not be evacuating with all of the other teachers.

This criticism is based on the belief that the low corporation tax rates enabled Ireland to compete unfairly in attracting international investment.

How about placing the blame on the deterioration of the parental role in a child's education.

Now, parents want to be their child's friend and the home is ruled by the child who never sees any consequences to their bad behavior. Children are no longer responsible for anything and everything is done for them. Parents have enabled their children so much that it is evident at the workplace; in one case a mother came to her son's job interview. Parents no longer reinforce a teacher's discipline of their child but instead report the teacher to the superintendent for abusing their child. Parents make sure that their child gets to every sporting event they participate in and owns every new electronic gadget but fail to make them read every day and especially in the summer (when required to read 5 books, only a third of the school read one) when reading scores drop dramatically. Parents can't even get their kids to do their homework. A higher value is placed on sports rather than education as in other cultures (e.g. Asian) who are surpassing the USA. Parents do not promote experiential play  which develops imagination, problem solving and socialization. Finally, schools are being asked to do more than just educate; they have become the surrogate family for our dysfunctional American home. 

In regard to Finland, who was ranked 27th (? approx.) before they decided to make education a priority, they first reduced class size which always has a significant impact on ""test scores"" if that's what you value as opposed to creativity and inquiry. They also reformed teacher education which I believe is one of America's main problems for creating poor teachers. Many teacher college courses assign mindless activities instead of teaching problem-solving and inquiry based strategies and methods to enhance creativity. In addition, America is one of the few countries that forces schools to teach the entire population when 50% have an IQ that is below average; can't change a mouse into a dolphin.

Australia has old, unproductive soil and highly variable weather.  It doesn't tend support to settling down or advancing civilisation.  When the British rolled up they already had a millenia-and-some of knowing about irrigation and building things courtesy of being in Europe.

As a further counterpoint, many current cultures never advanced far beyond tribal hunter-gather societies for a variety of reasons.  This was not by any stretch only seen in Australia.  For example, there are still tribes in the Amazon that have never seen western civilisation.  The terrain, ecology and relatively unproductive nature of the soil means it becomes very hard to maintain any sort of sustainable agriculture - and without it there is very little incentive to move towards what we could consider civilised society.  I don't think that makes them stupid, backward, or that they lack innovative ideas; just that circumstance doesn't provide much incentive to move in a direction we would call forwards.

So if you lost a regional seat by the width of a hair, then you have a *massive* amount of votes for the 40 supplementary seats and will get many of those. (the system is somewhat intricate but ensures a fair power distribution in the single chamber). The remaining 4 seats are distributed with 2 to Greenland and 2 to the Faroe islands elected directly there.

You need at least 2% of the votes to end up in the parliament. Otherwise, those votes are counted as lost votes (essentially this gives a party at least 4 seats). This is fairly low and usually ensures a large number of parties: 8 at the time and some independents because they broke from their respective parties.

Furthermore, elections are held every 4 years at *most*. If the prime minister decides, or a majority (90 seats) vote for election, then an election will fall. It is quite rare that all 4 years pass as it is worth more to the sitting PM to choose the election when it is beneficial to him or her.

-Size ('much smaller')

Whether 300 million or 80 million - this doesn't matter at all. Even if you live in a country with only 2 million people you won't feel magically connected to those people. Real life works on a much smaller scale. I sadly can't remember the right term for this phenomenon but in the end it boils down to the fact that there was never an evolutionary incentive for us to develop the ability to feel empathy for such an amount of people.

-diversity ('more homogeneous')

Again I don't think this can be seen as a very good argument. While you have (old) people speaking bad about certain a ethnicity (e.g. Italians) in the US you have the same within Germany e.g. towards people from eastern Germany or Bavaria. People will always find reasons why they should discriminate against  certain people if they want to. And while I give you that the diversity in ethnicity might be a factor, you will never find the degree of patriotism (or nationalism) that you have in the US in Germany. So when you argue that ethnic diversity drives the US apart - patriotism should negate this effect.

In the end the two points you named are pretty irrelevant. The reason why the laws are the way they are in Europe and why most countries in Europe have a social-capitalist system isn't because it's easier here but because of what we call 'western values'. Those values were created during the age of enlightenment and if you believe that every person deserves the same chances and that not the wealth of your parents (-&gt; public education, social welfare) or your genes (-&gt; health system) but your own capabilities should be the deciding factor in your life, then social capitalist legislation is the logical answer.",1,True,t3_euole,0,False,c1b5sxe,

The first is the extreme steps both sides will take to differentiate themselves from the other. I was reminded of this conversation I had where I see you also commented: http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/emeb9/a_probe_into_the_history_of_ashura/c198269 although I never addressed you. Just like shias try to marginalize Hazrat Abu-Bakr, Umar and Usman, sunnis try to marginalize Hazrat Ali and Hussain. This really does nothing other than increase the rift between the two sides. And the problem is both sides are puposedly taking themselves further from the truth to increase the rift. And for that I think it is a good watch for Sunnis. I'd also point out that Shias are guilty of antagonizing the Sunnis more but the Sunnis are eager to ignore Karbala when it was a very important event in Islamic history.

The second is how much the Muslims glorify the Caliphate as a papacy or a God-given right to rule like the Monarchies of old Europe. Still many people believe the only thing wrong with Islam in the modern day is that it doesn't have a Caliph. But why do we give so much credence to this idea of a Caliph always representing the right when that office was subject to as much political play as any other powerful position. Isn't it telling when we never use the phrase Ameer-ul-Momineen to describe any of the first four caliphs but it is used when describing other caliphs.

You make it sound like they instigated the coup. What actually happened was that privately they concluded it was illegal, while publicly they simply described it as ""murky"" and took no action.

Nowadays, some white women think that they're much prettier than anyone from other races. Over hundreds of years whereby white people have mainly been richer, healthier and more powerful; I think this can have an impact on the rest of the world. 

Western fashion is dominant throughout the world now. You see Africans, Chinese, Egyptians and everyone else wearing suits and other western apparel. Fashion is a very impressionable thing, and we often find new fashions coming from those who are often in popular culture, rich or powerful. The idea that things or people look nice is entirely under the influence of the viewers own preconceptions.

Although, I do agree that white women have certain features which are attractive. For example, high cheekbones, larger eyes and high brows are more common traits in white women and are attractive. This does not mean that my own perception of beauty has been moulded to the worlds slowly forming assessment about beauty which I believe is affected by a humans ambition to be richer or more powerful, Attributes in modern culture, often found in white people. 

For example, what if Europe had never become a major power? Say, a disease broke out, and halted their advancement for 200 years or something. Leaving America to have become colonised by a different nation. Like Japan; slowly it was found that the Japanese were the most powerful and richest on earth, bringing slaves from Europe say. Everyone would want to be Japanese right? And, if the Japanese had control of all the media- their movie stars would all be Japanese! Megan Fox would be a ""pretty"" Japanese woman!

I agree, that if the definitions are not the same, they can still both be valid in their context. But you were comparing the context.

&gt;Rap culture uses the word 'player' to mean a guy who is sexually promiscuous and dominant
&gt;Mainstream American culture uses 'player' to mean person who is playing a sport on a team.

So, saying Michael Jordan is bigger player than Brad Pitt, makes very little sense.

That's equally true when comparing statistics about race (ehm, culture?) in the US vs immigration-numbers from Germany, that bare no relationship to culture, religion or race.

&gt;""Oh, well in Europe only racists use the term, therefore, anyone who uses the term anywhere uses our same definition, and is a racist.""
&gt;Yeah, sorry, that doesn't make sense.

That's wasn't what I was saying. I was saying that according to Wikipedia the definition was slightly altered to make it sound less racist by people that had a racist agenda.

&gt;Except that you still are asserting that it has the same meaning, and anyone who uses the term anywhere is a racist.

Culture != Etnicity

It isn't in the states either. However, in the states etnicity, as we have discovered now, refers to heritage as well as race, according to _some_ ( but not all) americans. They suggested, that because culture==race in the USA, generalising over race, is like generalizing over cultures. 

So, yes, your definition is different. But, not any less racist, because it is founded on a racist premise. 

Now, I'm quite sure, it's not your intent to discriminate based on race at all. But you have to admit, suggesting the fact that a smaller portion of the American people is white, is the reason for a number of problems, isn't inherently placing the blame at specific cultures. And if cultures==race, it's equal to laying the blame at specific races, right? Your definition of etnicity, includes this premise. We have established that much now.

Etnicity is about culture in american definition, because americans do not distinguish between culture and race. Now I don't think this premise as popular in the states, as you might want us to believe. But even if it is, it doesn't make etnicity any less racist.

And this still doesn't in any invalidate that the numbers didn't add up at all. That it appears most people fill in these census based on race. Where are the irish? Where are the canadians? Where are the fresh african imports? 

The only way for the actual categories to make any sense, would be to suggest that these categories are not defined by people themselves, but by prejudice from other people. He looks black, so he must be part of black culture. This canadian looks white, so he must be part of the white american culture. But they are not. They is culturally no reason to put the Canadian or man from Senegal in the same box as anybody who's parents and grandparents have lived in the states in the years.

Let's summarize the different definitions:

  Rest of the world: etnicity == a race/people 

Determined at birth by etnicity of parents, upto where we can keep track of it. Makes no sense, in the end, we're all from Africa.

  America: etnicity == a race/people &amp; associated culture

Determined by culture of upbringing, coincidentally (?) using racial labels.

Just a bunch of questions about your census data:

- what does a black mormon fill in?
- is it multiple choice? 
- did really nobody fill in Irish, Canadian or African-American? 
- does the government convert these labels to super-categories like Black and White and Asian?
- Are you allowed to make up your own category? 
- Is white assumed to be Christian? 
- What does an adopted black boy with white parents fill in?
- What should a fresh modern dutch immigrant fill in?
- Can you lie on the census?
- How is truth determined concerning your etnicity?

In the end, all I can conclude is that:

 - your definition of etnicity isn't the one used by your government while administrating the census or it isn't the one used by people when filling out the census. (or both)

 - it still makes no sense to compare that data to the data from Germany about first generation immigration. It bares little relationship to cultural diversity.

 - just because the relationship between race and culture is stronger in the US, and your definition therefor by extension, suggests cultural differences, doesn't make the concept of etnicity less racist, just a tad more practible. It means that etnicity, although extremely blurry to determine, has as least some conceptual value. 

 - the fact that racists changed the definition to make generalizing statements about groups of people seem less racists, does not suggest that usage of this concept is any less racists; quite the contratry.

Now, again, I don't think this is your intent. And I understand that it may appear to have less of connotation in the US. The proccess of slowly extending the definition, makes it all a bit more blurry. 

But when you look at the census data you provided, the intent of the people that changed the definition. The practical problems with the given categories, you have to admit, it sounds kind of racist.

There were lots of interesting seminars on various topics, along with plenty of dancing and other *ahem* fun activities.  People who only started learning the language 2 weeks ago were able to communicate and participate by the end of the week....some even less time.  I chatted in Esperanto with a slovakian girl who had only started learning days before, although she had had the committed help of her 4 friends who were all highly fluent.

It was the best new years party I've ever been to, and I'm eager to go to my next event.  I heartily recommend Esperanto to all :)

As a reference, I spent about 40 hours studying Esperanto last January, and then a week during the summer at a beginner's Esperanto event in Slovakia, and then I spent the last week of December practicing before going to the New Years event, and I was able to have plenty of interesting conversations with people.

Here in Berlin there's a decent number of people in the local Esperanto club, and during the summer in Europe, it's possible to spend almost the whole summer hopping from event to event, all with hundreds of people attending (or thousands, in the case of the main ""Universala Kongreso"", except I've heard that it has less of a party scene than the other events).  The 2011 Kongreso will be in Copenhagen (and was in Havana, Cuba last year), so due to the pretty accessible European location it's expected to have about 3500 people in attendance.

How it is afforded is quite simple.

Go to the emergency room in the UK and the cost of your treatment is the hourly rate of the staff that treat you plus other incidental admin/back office etc costs and the cost of a bandage. AT THE VERY MOST you're looking at $100.

You will find if you get the cost of every medical procedure and drug in the EU states and compare them to what the PROFIT DRIVEN COMMERCIALLY BASED medical care system in the US is charging, that without fail the US prices will be several times that of the EU costs.

1. you will be assailed by touts demanding your attention at all occasions. steer clear of them. plan and book everything way ahead and try to get pick up and drops from your hotel. u will be stared at while walking down the street. do not eat anything offered to you by a stranger. try to be back in your room before 10 and definitely before midnight. just like california lol. 
2. you will come across filth but will get used to it in due time.
3. you will find really warm and helpful ppl whenever u need them. for example asking directions is much easier than it is paris ;)
4. you will see guys holding hands while walking. they are just friends. public displays of affection with opp sex are frowned upon except in cosmopolitan areas like delhi or gurgaon but that too in pubs clubs etc. 
5. except churches all religious places will require u to remove ur footwear incl socks. some temples will have designated places to store them where u get a token to retrieve them. its better to have ur head covered with cloth in case of doubt. 
1. 
if u are a women do not wear skirts higher than your knee in del/gurgn and not at all in UP(uttar pradesh) rajastan.no low cut shirts or hot pants etc.  imagine ur going to meet ur future inlaws at a church for the first time when deciding what to wear and you should be fine. women might still get lewd comments but highly unlikely and only if u venture in the decrepit areas. if ur a man try wearing full length pants and if ur young three fourths will also do but some temples might have a problem with that. avoid shorts. 
7.  taxis and auto rickshaws may overcharge to the tune of ten times the actual fare. demand to see the tariff sheet before boarding. ask your hotel for distance pointers so that you have a fairly good idea of directions and time it will take or be ready to fall victim to driving around the city to go a minor distance. this happens in USA as well so no biggie there. 
1.  Carry your cash, passport, and cards in a secure money belt, with only enough cash for a few hours at a time in your wallet or other accessible place. as was the case for south america or some parts of europe like rome for that matter. pickpockets are an international concern :)
1.  food is usually spicy but delicious. ask for less spice. browse sites like [this](http://www.zomato.com/) for good ideas.you will get mc donalds kfc pizza hut and dominoes almost everywhere but they they do not serve beef though dominoes does have pork pepperoni. do not ask for beef unless at a 5 star or high end restaurant which are again a good place to reserve your experiments with bar-be-cued food like kebabs. stick to hot off the stove stuff at relatively clean places. a good way to judge it to observe the clientele and prices. yes the class divide is alive and rampant more than the caste divide. as a foreigner u will have no problems getting into a pub/club even if u are a ugly derpy dude :). 
1. book flights online at the airlines site or a one shot portal like [this](http://www.makemytrip.com/) or [this](http://www.yatra.com/) i prefer indigo or kingfisher. 
book train tickets at [irctc.co.in](https://www.irctc.co.in/) its fairly tedious but worth the effort. look at the [faq](https://www.irctc.co.in/beta_htmls/quickbookguide.html) first. 
1.  the region u r travelling to are all in north india spanning the states of rajasthan delhi and UP. while new delhi is fairly cosmopolitan (not [old delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Delhi)) rajasthan and UP are quite conservative but are fairly used to the white tourist. there are certain prejudices here like white women are loose and white men are rich (not actually a prejudice but will be when touts fuck u up) if ur black then yes some indians are racists as well but be sure most will not realize it outright.
1.  so be safe and yeah dont drink the water. purchase only known brands like kinley aquafina bisleri or kingfisher and u should be ok. else rely on soft drinks like coke. try out [frooti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGoGh_SVEWk) for a change lol .

A) Germany had to pay huge reparations and only recently finished paying reparations for the first world war.
B) Marshall money was overwhelmingly granted in credit form, very little was given without interest.

In the article Robert Kushen says that the situation of Roma should not be considered as an issue of the EU, but as that of the countries where Gypsies primarily live. This is wrong on two sides. The western states are responsible for the geographical distribution of the Gypsy ethnicity. That is, in the middle ages, Gypsies were driven (beaten to death if they didn't) out of western countries, and their allowed stay in eastern Europe was a kind of a compromise between eastern and western states. So to say something like Kushen said, that ""this country should be responsible for the situation of the Gypsy ethnicity, but not the EU as a whole"", forgets the historical responsibility of the west. 

The second one is that of recent history. Socialism (or communism as was called) which ended 20 years ago was a very wasteful system (corrupt too, but thats another matter), but it did provide for the poorest social classes, and provided some employment to the Gypsies. The industry in east Europe was taken over (relatively cheaply) by western multinational companies, which were not obliged to employ (the uneducated) Gypsies, they only needed educated, but still cheap labor force. The non-employment of the Gypsy population is showing its price now, which must be paid by someone.

The title of the post is somewhat misleading. The ""Right Wing"" party is the Jobbik, which is an opposition party, not the governing party. The EU presidency is held by Hungary under the Fidesz government, which a center-right party, with more leftist voters than the Hungarian Socialists.

Chronology of notable book burning incidents perpetrated by Christians:

* 325 Books of Arianism (after Council of Nicaea)

* 364 Library of Antioch (by Jovian)

* 385 Writings of Priscillian

* 392 Destruction of the Alexandria libraries

* 435 Nestorius' books (by Theodosius II)

* 1085 Competing prayer books (at Toledo)

* 1121 Abelard forced to burn his own book (at Soissons)

* 1141 The writings of Arnold of Brescia (at France and Rome)

* 13th century - Destruction of Cathar texts (Languedoc region of France)

* 1242 The Talmud (at Paris), first of many such burnings over the next centuries. Since the Church and Christian states viewed the Talmud as a book hateful and insulting toward Christ and gentiles, subsequent popes were also known to organize public burnings of Jewish books. The most well known of them were Innocent IV (1243–1254), Clement IV (1256–1268), John XXII (1316–1334), Paul IV (1555–1559), Pius V (1566–1572) and Clement VIII (1592–1605).

* 1410 Wycliffe's books (at Prague)

* 1427 Codices of the peoples conquered by the Aztecs

According to the Madrid Codex, the fourth tlatoani Itzcoatl (ruling from 1427 (or 1428) to 1440) ordered the burning of all historical codices because it was ""not wise that all the people should know the paintings"".[17] Among other purposes, this allowed the Aztec state to develop a state-sanctioned history and mythos that venerated the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli.

* 1480s Non-Catholic books (by Torquemada)

* 1497 Decameron, Ovid and other ""lewd"" books (by Savonarola)

* 1490 Arabic and Hebrew books (at Andalucia)

In 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition. In 1499 about 5000 Arabic manuscripts were consumed by flames in the public square at Granada on the orders of Ximénez de Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo.[18][19] Many of the poetic works were allegedly destroyed on account of their symbolized homoeroticism.

* 1526 Tyndale's New Testament (in England)

* 1553 Servetus's writings (burned with their author at Geneva, and also burned at Vienne)

In 1553, Servetus was burned as a heretic at the order of the city council of Geneva, dominated by Calvin - because a remark in his translation of Ptolemy's Geographia was considered an intolerable heresy. As he was placed on the stake, ""around [Servetus'] waist were tied a large bundle of manuscript and a thick octavo printed book"", his Christianismi Restitutio. In the same year the Catholic authorities at Vienne also burned Servetus in effigy together with whatever of his writings fell into their hands, in token of the fact that Catholics and Protestants - mutually hostile in this time - were united in regarding Servetus as a heretic and seeking to extirpate his works. At the time it was considered that they succeeded, but three copies were later found to have survived, from which all later editions were printed.

* 1562 Maya sacred books (by Spanish Bishop of Yucatan)

July 12, 1562, Fray Diego de Landa, acting Bishop of Yucatan - then recently conquered by the Spanish - threw into the fires the sacred books of the Maya.

* 1584 ""Obscene"" Maltese poetry (by the Inquisition)

* 1585 Bernardino de Sahagún's manuscripts on Aztec culture (by Spanish authorities)

The 12-volume work known as the Florentine Codex, result of a decades-long meticulous research conducted by the Fransciscan Bernardino de Sahagún in Mexico, is among the most important sources on Aztec culture and society as they were before the Spanish conquest, and on the Nahuatl language. However, upon Sahagún's return to Europe in 1585, his original manuscripts - including the records of conversations and interviews with indigenous sources in Tlatelolco, Texcoco, and Tenochtitlan, and likely to have included much primary material which did not get into the final codex - were confiscated by the Spanish authorities, disappeared irrevocably, and are assumed to have been destroyed. The Florentine Codex itself was for centuries afterwards only known in heavily-censored versions.

* 1624 Luther's Bible translation

Martin Luther's German translation of the Bible was burned in Catholic-dominated parts of Germany in 1624, by order of the Pope 

* 1624 Marco Antonio de Dominis' writings (in Rome)

The theologian and scientist Marco Antonio de Dominis came in 1624 into conflict with the Inquisition in Rome and was declared ""a relapsed heretic"". He died in prison, which did not end his trial. On 21 December 1624 his body was burned together with his works.

I actually know someone who used to work for the European Union in the Ivory Coast, and as a matter of fact she's still in Abidjan right now. 
I'd say the West got a little too involved, i.e. they forced the Government to hold democratic elections, knowing full well that were the Opposition to win them there wouldn't be any way whatsoever to impose the winner against the existing regime (which is in fact what's happening this very moment). I chuckled a little when this friend of ours was telling my wife over Skype this December about how a colleague of hers from the European Union delegation, who had helped organizing and imposing this election, started crying during election day when she saw people voting. She was that naive, never daring to think what will happen in either of the 2 possible scenarios at that time. 

This whole story of ""let's impose democracy to people all around the world"" reminds me of one of Marx's funny stories, about a mid-1850s English capitalist who thought that in order to establish Capitalism in Australia it would be enough to import fixed capital (tools, machines etc.) and labor-force, and to try to re-establish in Australia the same labor relations as those present in England of that time. Of course that once the imported workers first set foot in Australia, and when they saw that they could have all the land they wanted for little or no cost, they ditched the Capitalist with all his tools and they started having an independent life once again, as they ancestors back in England used to. Anyway, I'm not that good of a narrator, but the morale of the story is that you can not force history's hand.

Several people were seriously injured, including one guy who ended up having emergency brain surgery due to a blood clot on the brain after being smashed in the head by a policeman (the guy was rushed to hospital, and police complained that he had been rushed to the hospital where their injured were being treated (there were a few) - the ambulance driver insisted, and the police eventually relented!). A guy with cerebral palsy was pulled out of his wheelchair and dragged to the kerb for ""rolling his wheel chair towards police""! thousands of people were ""kettled"", which is to say trapped in a small area without food, shelter, toilets, etc in sub-zero temperatures for hours at a time, and several people were injured trying to get out, and doctors later trated people for crushing-type injuries due to being trapped in a press of people. There were children as young as 12 (by one account, 13 or 14 by others) in there too, often seperated from their parents or guardians. The police charged horses at the crowds repeatedly. 

There are currently cases against the police for false imprisonment and breaches of the human rights act in response to that protest's policing. The police, however, are apparently contemplating water cannons for next time. 

This is the most recent major case, but not the only one - the previous student protests have recieved similar responses, although not quite as bad, after one of the early ones broke into the Conservative party's election campaign head quarters, dragged sofas out into the street, and generally occupied the building. Other times I have been aware of the police using attack dogs to disperse crowds. 

Last May there was another protest during which the riot police came out. One of their number hit a guy who was walking along with his hands in his pockets and got a little too close but was otherwise completely uninvolved. The guy fell over and hit his head. He was not given medical aid, and later died of injuries resulting from that fall (according to two of the three post mortems carried out - the first one was done by a police pathologist who was shortly thereafter barred from doing such autopsies due to failiures in unrelated cases). No-one was charged with anything over his death after a lengthy investigation by the criminal prossecution service. Last I heard the IPCC and the guy's family were appealing that decision. 

Riot cases make for the best headlines, but there have been others - two police men were sent to prison for what the judge described as ""tantamount to torture"" after holding a woman in a full nelson against a table and telling her they would hold her there until she told them what they wanted to know. That one stucks in my mind because the police were actually charged, prosecuted and convicted! 

The police take the DNA of everyone arresed for anything and store it on a database. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that storring the DNA of innocent people, and of children, is illegal, but the police still have it and despite election proimises from our new government, no moves have yet been made to take it away from them. 

On a far more petty level, I have personally seen police cars parked on double yellow lines (no parking), and on corners, and I have seen police stop in the middle of a junction, get out and go to get a chinese takeaway to get dinner, then get back in and drive off - I have seen this several times because it happened about once a week just outside a house where I used to live! 

As for the IPCC - in principal they are great, they have the powers they need, they just don't have the funding to investigate very complaint properly and independatly! Unfortunately our current government are cutting everything (amazingly even policing and military) so they are unlikely to get any new funding in the short term. I happened across their annual report last year (I was writing a letter about them to the new home secretary, Theresa May), and it all but outright said several times that they really wanted to investigate a lot more cases themselves, and oversee more closely a significant amount of the remainder but couldn't afford to. 

On a related note, it is not possible to sue the police for incompetence in the UK - if the police scew up just because they are not capable of doing their job then tough shit! IIRC this decision was made by the Law Lords after someone tried to sue the police for not stopping a notorious serial killer earlier, despite arresting and questioning him before he killed his last victim. This means that lack of competence *is* an excuse for the police! 

Finally it is not entirely supporisng the IPCC closest similar body is in Hong Kong - the UK owned it until 1999! 

Blimey that was long! References can be found for most of those things, and for similar ones.

Please please please avoid Rosetta Stone at all costs. It is far too expensive and far too inefficient to be worth its price. Many of the words you will learn are not that useful and your understanding of how to formulate complex sentences will be limited at best. This is from personal experience in trying out multiple European languages and doing Chinese with it over a period of a few months.

Rather, I highly recommend the following three books:

* Assimil Swedish With Ease. It's only available in French (""Le suédois sans peine"") so unless you speak French the best alternative would be to apply the Assimil language-learning method to other courses, as the Assimil courses are among the best out there. Learning usually involves listening through a dialogue, studying it and picking it apart, dissecting the language's structures, and applying it to memory either in terms of the whole dialogue itself or certain key phrases you know you'll use. I'll explain this in more detail in the next bullet point.

* The [Teach Yourself Swedish](http://www.amazon.com/Yourself-Swedish-Complete-Course-Package/dp/0071451188/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293998774&amp;sr=8-1) course. The Teach Yourself courses don't always have the highest of ratings, but I've found a good way to work around them: do the same as for the Assimil course. Instead of going dialogue by dialogue and then doing exercises and grammar and whatnot, listen to the dialogue a few times to try to get the gist of it, then go through it, learning the new words and structures (checking in the grammar section if necessary), and repeating after the speaker on the audio. Again, after all the repetition, you should pretty much have the general structure of the audio naturally devoted to memory in some way or another.

* The [FSI Swedish Basic Course](http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php?page=Swedish). It was designed for diplomats in the 50s and 60s and pure efficiency so it can be pretty dry, but if you apply the same ""absorption"" method I just described you shouldn't have any significant problems with it.

Also, it's usually suggested that you work out of more than a single course at once, so if you're able to use all three or two of three or any other courses you'll learn more quickly.

I hope this is helpful in some way! Also check out [how-to-learn-any-language.com](how-to-learn-any-language.com); their forums are awesome!

Being a student I have little money. I don't own a car, public transportation is almost perfect here. Very few issues with family, I have a lot of friends but not many that are very close. All my friends are male (when I think about it I have very loose friendships with two exes). I don't know: either I want to hook up with a girl or I have no interest and then I fear they fall for me if I would pursue friendship. (Trying to get over with that kind of thinking)
I am struggling to get more structure into my life, studying could progress a lot faster. so that is not perfect.

I found that there are very different social circles, my usual one consists of only guys that are pretty much in the same position of having no clue (even if they have a gf at home), these are fun to be with but wont help with the girls. Then one friend got me into a very social social circle, that consists of a fair share of guys, girls and couples and is fertile ground for any kind of intermingling. These people party a lot (!) and also actively try to hook their friends up with each other. With them it effordlessly worked two times for me but for some external reasons it didn't last.

My problem is that my very first dating/love experiences were full of rejection, I was very insecure back then. I wouldn't even look my friends in the eyes always scanning the ground. Some bullying occured. Got always friendzoned when I got closer to a girl and getting girls was the ultimate mystery. I would watch my friends flirting and always thought they acted like assholes but it seemed to work.
I recovered from being this insecure guy, it took years, one guy who knew me back then even came up to me paying respect asking how I managed to become the guy i am now and that he admired it so much (he was a little drunk and it was a tad awkward). But its still in my head, all these insecurities, I just don't show them anymore.

I met my first gf at age 18 on the internet, she was a bit older. We fell in love through chatting (wow that sounds so weird thinking about it now). Eventually we secretly met in a hotel and had sex after like 5 minutes, then for the whole weekend we stayed in bed. It was awesome. We had a long distance relationship for 2 years I was madly in love. She broke my heart when telling me on the phone she met someone else. Two weeks later I had somehow managed to have a new gf, met her on a party, we were together for 5 years then it went stale, so we both decided to end it. Then I got into pickup, it helped my understanding of social things a lot but also fucked me up a little I think. Had six girls in that time and then I hit a dry streak somehow that still lasts.

Also I don't drink, smoke or do drugs which makes things a lot harder. (recently I relaxed my rules on that)

As far as social life goes, I would say I have a pretty strong group of friends in my new home, but I'm still trying to branch out like I did in college.  The current group is laid back, but a lot of what we do is drink, eat, and go out.  While it's fun and I look forward to hanging with them, I often feel like I'm just ""living for the weekend"" while not doing anything particularly meaningful. Drinking is also starting to take its toll; I find that I drink sometimes just to numb my mind, and I realize this is not a good thing at all.  Some of my other New Year's Resolutions is to drink less and to branch out socially.

Thanks for the video link.  It's a really interesting talk -- Buddhist in philosophy, perhaps?  And I know more than ever what he means by experiencing serenity with something in nature (Southeast Asia is plentiful in eye-opening scenery).  I don't mean to suppose that I know exactly what he's talking about, but to a certain extent, I feel as if his philosophy is THE reason why I was able to get through 5 years of engineering with a smile on my face. When I mentioned above that I decided to settle back into engineering, it stemmed from an inner mentality that my career is NOT a definition of who I am inside, and that my true happiness was inside.  And while, fundamentally, I agree with his philosophy, I also feel as if there is a degree of unleashed potential inside me.  For instance, he kept giving examples of reaching for something in the pursuit of happiness, and this is what makes us unhappy... But for me, in engineering, I've never really tried to reach for something in the pursuit of happiness?  I sought to excel simply because... well, I don't really know why (maybe this is what Srikumar Rao is talking about?)... and this is what's particularly troubling to me.  Now, now I've reached a point where I'm recognizing that there is a degree of unleashed potential inside me, and that I *never* really reached for my inner passions.

As far as these projects - they're defined as Projects by the company and the champion and the sponsor (they're not called those things here but that is pretty standard terminology so I'll use it)    There is a quality team, a release team, a validation team, a testing team, a regression team, a compliance team, etc etc.    all of those teams interact with the main project team and all of those interactions are evaluated by the release team and the validation team.

one of the things that happens is we sometimes will see a project that is NOT in fact, ""really"" a project -- so we have to change the track it is on from a financial and workflow perspective and change it into a Full Cycle Change Control (as example) or something that denotes that this is, in fact, not really a project - i.e. it doesn't alter current functionality of the platform in any way.

and yes, projects vary wildly in size.  interestingly enough however - where I am projects are confined in scope on the basis of when they intend to go-live.   i.e. ""go live"" dates are set in stone at least 1 year in advance (I'm working on the 2012 schedule right now in fact).   This forces projects in the Oracle and Siebel realms to limit their scope on the basis of their go-live.  Their scope is defined in essentially 8 week increments.  

I'm not young (well, this is relative - 35 yrs old? - young?  sure, maybe...i dunno) , nor full of myself -- i'm a gold plated cog in a HUGE machine.   But, the cog that I am is pretty important.  I have a lot of power over the process.   This means that when I say ""no"" to something (and I better be able to back it up!) it's not uncommon for a CIO to leave their office and try to persuade me to say ""yes"", because I may have just cost him growth, dollars, time - you name it.   Honestly, haveing sign off authority means I'm clicking little check boxes quite often for requests made - i'm checking other people's work, and i'm always trying to make sure that someone didn't attempt to ""game"" the system in some way.

The end result of what I do seeks two outcomes.  1) protect the system that already works - making sure that nothing that is introduced to said system damages production (example: If a project ""goes live"" and that introduction of the new code or module causes European Operations to go down for 1 day - that would be my fault.)   2)  insure the overall quality of the project deliverable       ",1,True,t3_eusmt,0,False,c1b6j57,

Thus at a certain point, and not very far in either, from what I remember, producing faster still is actually not economically wise, from an input-output perspective. Of course, I've already said that a lot of the input is absorbed by the government, in the form of road-maintaining, for instance. Access to cheap oil is also secured without corporations having to bear the costs. So all the rest of what you say may be true, but you've ignored my point that government subsidizes, and makes artificially profitable, bigness in corporations, right now.

I've not ignored your point.  I'd already acknowledged it in the first post I made on the subject.  But it's now up to you to show that without the subsidies they would necessarily fail (the big leap, remember?).  The only thing you've suggested so far is subsidised roads.  
However this is trivially small, dependent on which country you're talking about, and wouldn't really make any difference.  I'll explain why:

I live in the UK, and here, like in the rest of Europe, fuel is taxed quite heavily [50.35p per litre plus 17.5% sales tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_tax).  Which means at current prices, the government are currently taking in about 67.7p per litre.   This obviously rises in direct proportion to road use and size of vehicle, so big corporations must pay far more.  About [26 billion](http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947327894) litres of petrol are sold in the UK every year, so the government gets 17.62 billion pounds in revenue from this, which is more than enough to cover the cost of the roads, which cost only [£6.5 billion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/may/17/uk-public-spending-departments-money-cuts#zoomed-picture) to maintain and build.  Therefore in the UK, distribution by road is not artificially cheaper, it could well be artificially more expensive by a huge degree! This could offset the benefits of another whole bunch of subsidies.
In Europe, we have some of the [most expensive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_and_diesel_usage_and_pricing) fuel costs in the world.
Yet McDonalds and Apple are still able to survive here just fine, and there's no sign that it helps little stores complete against big ones.  With regards to cheap oil, can you be much clearer on what you mean?  Do you mean the government helps secure the oil thereby effectively subsidising the cost?  In this case, this would not dramatically cause a big difference in marginal cost as both the small and large company would pay the same for each additional litre, and countries with more expensive fuel still have corporations.  Or did you mean the corporations alone get oil cheaper?  Either way, could you quantify any of this?

&gt;I don't have the study at hand, but I've heard it said that distribution costs rise steeply when production savings are much slower to progress.

That's clearly not the case in the world we're living in now, so if you want anyone to believe your claim, you have a huge burden of proof, and ""I've heard it said"" isn't going to cut it!  It took me two minutes to find that stuff out.  Why don't you research some stuff independently? Check it out for yourself and form your opinions from that!

&gt;The fact is, there hasn't always been brands and advertising, and instead of competing on image, companies used to compete on prices and actual value. I think that's what they should do. But it's easier to brainwash people into buying brand A or brand B, instead of them actually, critically, assessing the product and its price, and comparing it with other products and prices.

You've confused is and ought.  Just because you think something ought to be the case, doesn't mean it magically will be!

&gt;I do not know what people will do, I'm only saying that the large corporations are unable to strive on their own. 

But you haven't given any figures to back that up.

No, you would specifically say ""in Germany"", just like most people refer to The United States of America as the ""US"" when targeting something specific to the country and not the continent.

I met a girl on myspace some 5 years ago in a most random way.  I was in the States - she was a university student in Western Europe, though originally from and a citizen of our sworn ""enemy"" Iran.  Dum dum dummmm.

I was really attracted to her style and her pictures and she kinda commented on my blog every now and then - but it wasn't a big deal. Then one day we chatted on messenger and I felt something inside of me that we were meant for each other.  SO CRAZY.

One day I gave her my phone number and within minutes we were long distance chatting.  It lasted maybe 7 hours.  The next day - another 7 hour phone call.  

We started chatting on the phone for HOURS each day.  I was really feeling it for this chick.  

I can't tell you how many times I would meet a girl online only to meet in person and nothing clicked - either on her end, my end or both.  I was so scared the link between us was an online/phone thing only.  I didn't want to shell out the many hundreds of dollars to go to Europe to have it all blow up in my face.  It wasn't like she could come to the US since she had an Iranian passport.  

But I was motivated at this point in my life to say ""yes"" more to opportunity.  I booked a flight and went over to Europe to meet her.  We had a blast together and traveled together and experienced new cities and new things.  

But when I came home, it seemed clear that she wasn't feeling the relationship as much as I had hoped she would.  I guess she was scared.  I too was doubting whether something SO crazy could work, given all that was going against us that was beyond our control.  She wrote me a letter telling me, essentially, this isn't working, can't work, won't work.  It hurt but I decided to move on - hit the local dating scene and enjoy my singleness.

That lasted two weeks.  I looked at my life and saw that this girl was the best chance I had at happiness.  I asked her to be with me, long distance, to just try it for a week or something.  She agreed on a VERY limited basis.  But before too long we had been together for six months, long distance.  And I booked another flight to Europe to see her again.  I wanted to know that our relationship could work in person.

It worked.  We had a great time together.  I came back home and announced to her that I would be moving to Europe to be with her.  I told my parents about the relationship, that I was with an Iranian and that I would be moving to Europe.  Wow that didn't go over so well - let me tell ya!

But I moved to Europe and we moved in together.  It was bumpy at first at times but it ended up being a warm, wonderful relationship.  A year or so later I asked her to marry me.  A year after that we married.  And now we are together in America having an extremely happy, warm, wonderful marriage.  It's almost been two years or marriage and 4 years of living together.  

I can't believe the circumstances that led to us being together.  We were never supposed to meet.  Common sense would tell you not to drop everything and go halfway around the world to meet some internet chick.  But I was open to trying, and it led to the greatest thing in my life.  

I don't know what will happen to you pixel, or any of the others writing amazing stories in the comments.  I just wanted to say that the modern way of meeting people is quite different than any other point in history.  In my mind, it's extremely exciting that you have more chance at love than ever before.  People these days don't have to shack up with the person down the street due to lack of options.  

When you find the person, no matter where on earth they may be, I say pursue it to the fullest because love is the most important thing.  It's more important than money, and risk, and the familiarities of home.

Increased atmospheric CO2 is clearly and reliably measured.  Calculations of the total mass of energy burned and forests cleared indicate that human activity is putting an excess of CO2 into the natural CO2 cycle.  The isotopes of carbon in plant matter are different than the atmosphere, and we can measure the change in ratio of isotopes in the atmosphere as more fuels are burned.  There are direct satellite measurements of reduced black-body radiation from the earth at wavelengths absorbed by CO2.

Over the last 20 years there has been a significant minimum in the solar cycle.  This is really ironic because contrarians often cite the solar cycle as the ""natural"" explanation for the warming trend in the last 35 years.  If you look at the temperature record over the last 150 years, you can in fact see there is a sharp uptick in the last 35 years, and the recent flattening is totally within the noise, and understandable given the solar minimum.  It should be no consolation that temperatures have flattened out *at the highest levels in recorded human history*.

Our models do not yet predict anomolies like the recent extreme solar minimum.  Models, do however, include the solar cycles, as well as PDO, albedo, and all kinds of other things contrarians like to presume they omit.  If you use past data of things hard to predict (like the finer details of sun cycles) then the models actually match the actual observed temperature trends quite well - but only if you include CO2 effects.  Otherwise all the other observations of sea level, solar cycles, volcanics activity and temperature can't be accuractly modelled yet.

If some contrarian could put together a model that explained measurements to date using *only* solar cycles, PDO, volcanoes and all the other forces, but excluding CO2, then I'm pretty sure they'd get published in Nature and get lots of attention.  Why is nobody publishing that paper?  Either you believe some global conspiracy of thousands of independent folks conspicuously avoiding this magic model for some unknown motive, or else the current models may actually be the best explanations for the current data.

Not saying there won't be better models, but nobody has produced one yet.  Repeat, the contrarians have not produced a model that provides a better explanation of current observations.

The extreme cold across North America is a red herring.  Number 1, it's only extremely cold in some places.  Where I live its an unusually warm winter, and it was an unusually warm summer too.  It has been the same in the far north (which by the way is a huge area, just not highly populated - have you ever looked at how big northern Ontario, norther quebec, Labrador, NWT, Nunavut, Yukon, Alaska are?)  It's just a perverse coincidence that its locally colder in places with large, and politically noisy populations.  Number two, local weather is not climate.  There will still be record cold temperatures during warming periods, it's still winter and there are large effects that swing temperature both ways.  Finally, it is well established that changes in climate can produce local effects that are contrary to the global average.  The cold in Europe right now is very plausible, based on reduced effectiveness of the Gulf stream and ocean warming slows the progress of that current to the European coasts, combined with a warmer arctic which causes changes in atmospheric currents.  Even if those arctic air currents are warmer than they used to be, they are still cold by continental European standards, so when the currents change Europe gets a deep freeze.

Meanwhile, in the summer the permafrost in Alaska, northern Canada and Siberia is melting, with the potential to release loads of methane, which is an even more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.  Just happens that there are very few people there to complain about unusually hot summers.

It seems to me that the problem of concentrated wealth and power in society is what prevents ""progressive"" libertarians from joining with their more rigidly ideological brethren to work together politically.

I think the best way for me to answer your question is through a sort of thought experiment.

So, to begin, let me assert the following: wealth has no meaning unless it is accompanied by power, by some implicit or explicit threat of force.

I think that this is not an alien concept for libertarians.  The non-aggression principal does not condemn the use of force for self defense and for defense of property; in fact, I think most libertarians would say that it is only the fear of a well-armed property owner that would maintain the social order if libertarian policies were actually implemented in the real world.

A natural and obvious extension of this idea is that groups of property owners in a libertarian or anarchic society would contract out with security companies to defend their property.  Large property owners would directly employ armed security personnel as part of their business organizations.  And because the state's ability to impose force would be minimal in the ""ideal"" minarchist libertarian society, large companies would employ or contract with security forces of a size comparable to modern police forces, in order to defend their interests.

Now, in an ideal libertarian society dominated by the non-aggression principal, these security organizations would only be used for self-defense.  Property owners willing to obey the non-aggression principal would never permit their security forces to wiretap competitors' business communications and otherwise invade their privacy to steal trade secrets and blackmail them.  Certainly, they would never instruct their security forces to use their defensive weapons to steal goods in transit, nor intimidate their competitors' workers into staying home, nor murder shareholders and managers.

But libertarianism is not, or at least should not be, utopian.  **This is the problem:** immoral people will not follow the non-aggression principal, and there are more immoral people than there are moral people.  Once the capability exists for one large commercial entity to use its security forces not just for defense but also for competitive advantage, those security forces *will* be used for competitive advantage.

Even if 99% of corporations used their security forces for self-defense only, the 1% of corporations that used their security forces to compete would would become more wealthy than the rest, and would be able to afford larger and more sophisticated security forces, further increasing their competitive advantage.  Corporations following the non-aggression principal would be put out of business.  Having a dominant security force would become a prerequisite for being in business in the first place.  Small businesses would have to pay extortion/tribute/taxes in order to stay in business, and only those small businesses that didn't compete with the dominant corporation would be allowed to stay in business at all.

Corporations, in other words, would become de facto governments.  Authoritarian governments.  Feudal governments, to be precise; in many ways my description parallels the development of European society after the decline of Rome.

I have made this argument before, and in the past hard-core libertarians have trashed it by asserting that sufficient competition between security forces would create an optimal outcome for consumers of security services, or something like that.  The answer is never satisfying.

For me, it all comes down to this: **the men with the biggest guns will take your stuff unless you also have guns that are of a similar size.**  It doesn't matter if the people with the biggest guns are employed by a formally-constituted government, are Backwater consultants, or work for the local warlord, it's all the same.  

But at least in the case of government, the use of force must be justified as *legitimate* within a system of laws, and those laws must themselves be *legitimate*, even if they are biased and arbitrary.  In other words, governments are at least in theory subject to moral oversight, and democratic governments, if justly and effectively implemented, are also accountable to the people.

Please, convince me that I am wrong.  I *want* to believe.  But maybe I have read too much history to believe that the black-and-white division libertarianism draws between the public and private spheres, between government and business, actually exists.  You will always be subject to government, because there will always be someone out there with the will and the power to do so.  The question is: what is the form of government you want, what are it's powers, and how will it protect your interests?

Yes. I'm gonna Amazon myself the book.

Oh wait... it's all online, even? I can see that's going to be painful reading. I pledge that I will start, and try.

Hmm, I did. I read the commentary and the conclusion.

OK, so a number of archaeo/litero-historians poured years of their lives into proving that civilizations a few thousand years ago were sufficiently competent at astronomy to induce the precession of the equinoxes? That the Mayans and the Stonehengers and the Egyptians all dabbled in astronomy, and were capable of making sufficiently accurate measurements to determine the length of the cycle of this precession?

Well, cool. I thought everybody knew that.

Here are a bunch of ancient civilizations doing remarkably good science in view of the fact that their technology was based on wood, rocks and bronze.

These remarkably clever folks knew which heavenly bodies moved, and where and when. So what did they do? They traced shapes around those stars big enough to be visible to the unaided eye, and they gave them names and invented personalities to go with them, and then they made up stories about them because they desperately wanted to know more about the world. The practical spinoffs? They had a reasonably good grasp of tides, managed to navigate by the stars and managed to impress each other with predictions of eclipses.

Did they have any idea of the size or the age of the universe? No, because the unaided eye can't see beyond the nearest handful of galaxies. Because they could not see or measure radio, infrared, ultraviolet or gamma radiation. Did they even have telescopes? No, because ground glass mirrors and lenses weren't invented until 1600-something.

Like the ancient tribes of Judea, these folks ran up against a brick wall when it came to any technology more advanced than smelting and casting iron. The antikthera, the old Greek astrolabe, was a marvel of patience and precision and skill, but it was made of brass so if you set it down too hard the gears would bend, because there was no steel. Humanity was in a technological hole for thousands of years because nobody knew to do anything more sophisticated than burn and melt and hammer stuff made of stone, wood and simple metals.

As a result, ancient ""science"" spent most of its time twiddling its thumbs: Melting and mixing stuff in an attempt to make gold, creating clever little weapons and simple war engines, building ships, making music, discovering mildly poisonous herbs, domesticating animals, managing early agriculture, inventing some mathematics and... thinking up stories. Myths. Myths about the gods and other inspiringly cool beings allegedly attached to the stars. The authors of Hamlet's mill discovered, surprisingly, that the myths of different cultures had remarkable similarities. Maybe because they were looking at the same stars? Maybe some of them travelled?

Yes, there were stone age people who managed to drill holes in their heads without killing the patient. That's pretty amazing, and speaks for how tough people used to be. What did they achieve with this? Probably nothing. Lifespan in antiquity was about 30 years. These were the parameters of human existence for millennia!

Admittedly, the data underneath the book is a treasure trove, a wet dream for any historian or philologist. There is a great wealth of knowledge about cultures and their myths and other stories. There even seems to be some interesting speculative anthropology, e.g. about the alleged Magdalene culture in Europe. So yeah, there was yet another group of people doing stuff with stone and bronze and wood and leather.

One can marvel about these ancients in much the same way as one is proud of the kid who made a cool drawing in art class. *But none of this is in any way indicative of any knowledge or technology that we don't have today.*

&gt;PNE chairman Maurice Lindsay has also told media United ""have suggested they would like Matty James back as well"". James, however, is at Deepdale on a season-long loan and, for now, remains at Preston.

So this suggests that the other two were always due back. This is standard practice, I think it's unfortunate timing and makes it look like we brought them back out of spite. Fergie is not in full charge of Utds youth and reserve, I doubt he had much involvement at all here. King and De Laet have both played in our first team, De Laet played in Europe for us last season, it's likely the loans expired at this time because we may need them for backup, otherwise why not put them on the same season-long loan like James? Or to look at it another way, if normal procedure was to have a half season loan then extend it, why was James not on the same half-season loan? I honestly believe it has absolutely nothing to do with Darren Ferguson being sacked. Neither of them were playing that much anyway. King had made 6 appearances, De Laet had made 5.

And a bunch of standards and processes were introduced, so now, whatever the domestic bank account and sorting code numbering schemes of the different countries are, any EU bank account also has an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Bank Identifier Code (BIC=SWIFT).

But one day last fall she quit, fed up with how surreal and ultimately sad it is to be young in Italy today. 

It galled her that even with her competence and fluency in five languages, it was nearly impossible to land a paying job. Working as an unpaid trainee lawyer was bad enough, she thought, but doing it at Italy’s social security administration seemed too much. She not only worked for free on behalf of the nation’s elderly, who have generally crowded out the young for jobs, but her efforts there did not even apply to her own pension. 

“It was absurd,” said Ms. Esposito, a strong-willed woman with a healthy sense of outrage. 

The outrage of the young has erupted, sometimes violently, on the streets of Greece and Italy in recent weeks, as students and more radical anarchists protest not only specific austerity measures in flattened economies but a rising reality in Southern Europe: People like Ms. Esposito feel increasingly shut out of their own futures. Experts warn of volatility in state finances and the broader society as the most highly educated generation in the history of the Mediterranean hits one of its worst job markets. 

Politicians are slowly beginning to take notice. Italy’s president, Giorgio Napolitano, devoted his year-end message on Friday to “the pervasive malaise among young people,” weeks after protests against budget cuts to the university system brought the issue to the fore. 

Giuliano Amato, an economist and former Italian prime minister, was even more blunt. “By now, only a few people refuse to understand that youth protests aren’t a protest against the university reform, but against a general situation in which the older generations have eaten the future of the younger ones,” he recently told Corriere della Sera, Italy’s largest newspaper. 

The daughter of a fireman and a high school teacher, Ms. Esposito was the first in her family to graduate from college and the first to study foreign languages. She has an Italian law degree and a master’s from Germany and was an intern at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. It has not helped. 

“I have every possible certificate,” Ms. Esposito said dryly. “I have everything except a death certificate.” 

Even before the economic crisis hit, Southern Europe was not an easy place to forge a career. Low growth and a corrosive lack of meritocracy have long posed challenges to finding a job in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Today, with the added sting of austerity, more people are left fighting over fewer opportunities. It is a zero-sum game that inevitably pits younger workers struggling to enter the labor market against older ones already occupying precious slots. 

As a result, a deep malaise has set in among young people. Some take to the streets in protest; others emigrate to Northern Europe or beyond in an epic brain drain of college graduates. But many more suffer in silence, living in their childhood bedrooms well into adulthood because they cannot afford to move out. 

“They call us the lost generation,” said Coral Herrera Gómez, 33, who has a Ph.D. in humanities but still lives with her parents in Madrid because she cannot find steady work. “I’m not young,” she added over coffee recently, “but I’m not an adult with a job, either.” 

There has been a national debate for years in Spain about “mileuristas,” a nickname for college graduates whose best job prospects may well pay just 1,000 euros a month, or $1,300. 

Ms. Herrera is at the lower end of the spectrum. Fed up with earning 600 euros a month, or $791, under the table as a children’s drama teacher, Ms. Herrera said she had decided to move to Costa Rica this month to teach at a university. 

As she spoke in a cafe in Madrid, a television on the wall featured a report on the birthday of a 106-year-old woman who said that eating blood sausage was the secret to her longevity. 

The contrast could not have been stronger. Indeed, experts warn of a looming demographic disaster in Southern Europe, which has among the lowest birth rates in the Western world. With pensioners living longer and young people entering the work force later — and paying less in taxes because their salaries are so low — it is only a matter of time before state coffers run dry. 

“What we have is a Ponzi scheme,” said Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University and an expert in fiscal policy.

He said that pay-as-you-go social security and health care were a looming fiscal disaster in Southern Europe and beyond. “If these fertility rates continue through time, you won’t have Italians, Spanish, Greeks, Portuguese or Russians,” he said. “I imagine the Chinese will just move into Southern Europe.” 

The problem goes far beyond youth unemployment, which is at 40 percent in Spain and 28 percent in Italy. It is also about underemployment. Today, young people in Southern Europe are effectively exploited by the very mechanisms created a decade ago to help make the labor market more flexible, like temporary contracts. 

Because payroll taxes and firing costs are still so high, businesses across Southern Europe are loath to hire new workers on a full-time basis, so young people increasingly are offered unpaid or low-paying internships, traineeships or temporary contracts that do not offer the same benefits or protections. 

“This is the best-educated generation in Spanish history, and they are entering a job market in which they are underutilized,” said Ignacio Fernández Toxo, the leader of the Comisiones Obreras, one of Spain’s two largest labor unions. “It is a tragedy for the country.” 

Yet many young people in Southern Europe see labor union leaders like Mr. Fernández, and the left-wing parties with which they have been historically close, as part of the problem. They are seen as exacerbating a two-tier labor market by protecting a caste of tenured older workers rather than helping younger workers enter the market. 

For Dr. Kotlikoff, the solution is simple: “We have to change the labor laws. Not gradually, but quickly.” 

Yet in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, any change in national contracts involves complex negotiations among governments, labor unions and businesses — a delicate dance in which each faction fights furiously for its interests. 

Because older workers tend to be voters, labor reform remains a third rail to most politicians. Asked at a news conference last year about changing Italy’s de facto two-tier system, Italy’s center-right finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said simply, “You can’t make violent changes to the system.” 

New austerity measures in Spain, where the overall unemployment rate is 20 percent, the highest in the European Union, are further narrowing the employment window. Spain has pledged to raise its retirement age to 67 from 65, but incrementally over the next 20 years. 

“Now people are being sent into early retirement at age 55,” said Sara Sanfulgencio, 28, who has a master’s degree in marketing but is unemployed and living in Madrid with her mother, who owns a children’s shoe store. “But if I haven’t started working by age 28 and I already have to stop at 55, it’s absurd.” 

In Italy, Ms. Esposito is finishing her lawyer traineeship at a private firm in Lecce. It pays little but sits better on her conscience than her unpaid work for the government.

Another because she's my BF. The thing with them is that they both will insist on paying me. That I do appreciate.

Everyone else pays. If they b*tch about it I tell them to call best buy or the local computer place. I bill for everything. When they pay they get value. I will give advice for free if it comes via an email and it's too time consuming (most of the time they can google for the answer).

We're a rugged people who came from Europe with little more than our Christian ideals and a dream. We rely on ourselves. If we need to hunt for food or defend ourselves, we reach for our guns. 

We believe in god and traditional families.

We distrust government, particularly when it wants to take our money so that it can provide for others things they should be able to get for themselves. 

We distrust outsiders and prefer not to interfere in their affairs. However, when they threaten us, our right to defend ourselves supersedes other obligations. Our only obligation is to ourselves!

We believe that when others come to our country, they should speak our language and try to become more like us. If they do not, we are at risk of losing the traditional American culture this nation was built on. Our ancestors came here legally, learned the language and adapted. People who come here illegally should be punished and sent back.

We are plainspoken and prefer common sense to scientific mumbo-jumbo.

We believe the government should limit its size and function, and run its financial affairs the way a responsible person runs a household budget: paying as you go, avoiding lavish spending and never relying on credit.

Now, Dextro-amph primarily acts on the DA neurotransmitter but also raises levels of serotonin, while l-amph primarily acts on norepinephrine/noradrenaline. Other trace amounts of neurotransmitters are released (e.g. most notably GABA) but the others are much more drastic. Stereochemisty is a very peculiar subject because such similar compounds can be wildly different.  

I'm not entirely sure why drugs like adderall are mixed amphs but I wouldn't think it would be due to cost because it's been around for over 100 years. (Amphetamine was actually in Vicks nasal spray in the 40s until widespread abuse became rampant. The good ol' days when you could tweak off your nasal spray.) I honestly have no idea why because Vyvanse apparently concentrates your socks off and it's entirely d-amph bound to an amino acid. 

I checked out wikipedia and to paraphrase why they used mixed salts, it's because d-amph and l-amph have different half lives and this makes the onset and withdrawal more subtle. 

Amphetamine tolerance is caused by a build-up of Ca+ ions into the calcium channels, which is controlled by NMDA molecules, so you need an NMDA antagonist to counter act this influx of Ca+. This is to keep Ca+ ions flowing through the channel. Magnesium is an NMDA antagonist and b-vitamins do actually help to keep tolerance low in addition to promoting a positive well being. Prescription NMDA antagonists such as Memantine and Acamprosate are available for Alzheimer's in Europe but I'm not sure of the bio-availability of them in the US.

I take 250mg of magnesium before bed because it does help one relax as well as a b-vitamin complex. I'm on a quest for immortality.

Other healthier products are forced to use sugar just to compete.

Compare that to the UK and Germany with around 30% membership (and far better benefits and working conditions) or the fact that 8 EU states have 50% or higher union membership (and unions have real power).

Unionisation is not only low but it also seems to be frowned upon (although the way US unions and union regulations work that isn't that surprising).   The most recent and applicable information that probably supports my point is from an independent research study conducted by Strata Research related to the EFCA.  That found that ""American workers hold a net unfavorable image of both organized labor unions (51%) and Corporate America (72%). Similarly, 40% do not trust organized labor unions and 51% do not trust corporate America.""...  It seems that 40% of Americans don't trust unions, 45% believe they have too much influence...

I support restricting immigration from muslim countries, and working hard on integrating the muslims we already have, something which europe has failed miserably at. In addition to USA stopping its shennanigans in the mid east and all over the world, which of course doesn't help.

Culture is not biological. But obviously it doesn't spread as much as we'd like to certain groups, otherwise all or most of the muslim immigrants in europe would be happy, liberal, democratic citizens, and no one would have a problem. It is my opinion that allowing in something so antithetical to the values we cherish, and simply hoping our values will 'wash off' on others, is extremely naive and also quite dangerous. The big problem is that islam is still a young religion, and is still growing. Of course I don't want a rise of christianity in my country, but that will never happen no matter how many christian immigrants we take in; christianity is dying out. I hate to mention the whole birth rate thing, but it is something to keep in mind. Islam is in fact pretty much the only religion which is growing in my country, although it is still a tiny minority. All others have been steadily decreasing.

The reason my country (Australia) has had such great success with multiculturalism is because our immigrants haven't had such prejudices. Our first immigrants were white europeans, then asians, especially chinese, vietnamese, indians, etc. All of these people gladly adopted liberal values, and added great things to the country's culture.

Discriminating against who should be allowed into your country is not oppression. I would say it is very smart; in fact all countries do it. You want to allow in people who will integrate well, and people who are educated and are going to contribute to your society and your country's economic wellbeing.

&gt;There's absolutely no indication whatsoever that....it was done by ""the church.""

How about the following? Were any of these actions undertaken or sanctioned by ""the church""? Or was all of this done at the hands of No True Christians?

Chronology of notable book burning incidents perpetrated by Christians:

* 325 Books of Arianism (after Council of Nicaea)

* 364 Library of Antioch (by Jovian)

* 385 Writings of Priscillian

* 392 Destruction of the Alexandria libraries

* 435 Nestorius' books (by Theodosius II)

* 1085 Competing prayer books (at Toledo)

* 1121 Abelard forced to burn his own book (at Soissons)

* 1141 The writings of Arnold of Brescia (at France and Rome)

* 13th century - Destruction of Cathar texts (Languedoc region of France)

* 1242 The Talmud (at Paris), first of many such burnings over the next centuries. Since the Church and Christian states viewed the Talmud as a book hateful and insulting toward Christ and gentiles, subsequent popes were also known to organize public burnings of Jewish books. The most well known of them were Innocent IV (1243–1254), Clement IV (1256–1268), John XXII (1316–1334), Paul IV (1555–1559), Pius V (1566–1572) and Clement VIII (1592–1605).

* 1410 Wycliffe's books (at Prague)

* 1427 Codices of the peoples conquered by the Aztecs

According to the Madrid Codex, the fourth tlatoani Itzcoatl (ruling from 1427 (or 1428) to 1440) ordered the burning of all historical codices because it was ""not wise that all the people should know the paintings"".[17] Among other purposes, this allowed the Aztec state to develop a state-sanctioned history and mythos that venerated the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli.

* 1480s Non-Catholic books (by Torquemada)

* 1497 Decameron, Ovid and other ""lewd"" books (by Savonarola)

* 1490 Arabic and Hebrew books (at Andalucia)

In 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition. In 1499 about 5000 Arabic manuscripts were consumed by flames in the public square at Granada on the orders of Ximénez de Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo.[18][19] Many of the poetic works were allegedly destroyed on account of their symbolized homoeroticism.

* 1526 Tyndale's New Testament (in England)

* 1553 Servetus's writings (burned with their author at Geneva, and also burned at Vienne)

In 1553, Servetus was burned as a heretic at the order of the city council of Geneva, dominated by Calvin - because a remark in his translation of Ptolemy's Geographia was considered an intolerable heresy. As he was placed on the stake, ""around [Servetus'] waist were tied a large bundle of manuscript and a thick octavo printed book"", his Christianismi Restitutio. In the same year the Catholic authorities at Vienne also burned Servetus in effigy together with whatever of his writings fell into their hands, in token of the fact that Catholics and Protestants - mutually hostile in this time - were united in regarding Servetus as a heretic and seeking to extirpate his works. At the time it was considered that they succeeded, but three copies were later found to have survived, from which all later editions were printed.

* 1562 Maya sacred books (by Spanish Bishop of Yucatan)

July 12, 1562, Fray Diego de Landa, acting Bishop of Yucatan - then recently conquered by the Spanish - threw into the fires the sacred books of the Maya.

* 1584 ""Obscene"" Maltese poetry (by the Inquisition)

* 1585 Bernardino de Sahagún's manuscripts on Aztec culture (by Spanish authorities)

The 12-volume work known as the Florentine Codex, result of a decades-long meticulous research conducted by the Fransciscan Bernardino de Sahagún in Mexico, is among the most important sources on Aztec culture and society as they were before the Spanish conquest, and on the Nahuatl language. However, upon Sahagún's return to Europe in 1585, his original manuscripts - including the records of conversations and interviews with indigenous sources in Tlatelolco, Texcoco, and Tenochtitlan, and likely to have included much primary material which did not get into the final codex - were confiscated by the Spanish authorities, disappeared irrevocably, and are assumed to have been destroyed. The Florentine Codex itself was for centuries afterwards only known in heavily-censored versions.

* 1624 Luther's Bible translation

Martin Luther's German translation of the Bible was burned in Catholic-dominated parts of Germany in 1624, by order of the Pope 

* 1624 Marco Antonio de Dominis' writings (in Rome)

The theologian and scientist Marco Antonio de Dominis came in 1624 into conflict with the Inquisition in Rome and was declared ""a relapsed heretic"". He died in prison, which did not end his trial. On 21 December 1624 his body was burned together with his works.

For the many years before the Gaza war, for example, few Israelis were killed, but life was impossible in those cities, as they were forced to run to/from the shelters.

One of the reasons few are killed is because Israel has the infrastructure to reduce fatalities (something the Palestinians are not allowed to have and wouldn't be effective against Israel's modern military anyway).  

The other reason is that the Hamas arsenal is just not that effective.  I mean they're literally lobbing missiles blindly into Israel and hoping they hit someone.  Even Israel, which is a fairly densely populated country is still mostly unpopulated especially the mostly arid areas around Gaza.

Of course they achieved their task of terrorizing Israelis around Gaza, but that is a different story from actually killing a lot of people.

&gt;I think it is probably possible to do a land swap such that the majority of the settlers remain in Israeli control, and the Palestinians get equivalent land elsewhere. That will mean far fewer settlers would have to be evacuated.

You mean just the settlements around Israel's 1967 borders?  There are many settlements chopping through the West Bank that would have to be demolished and Israel certainly doesn't get to take the entirety of the West Bank's borders with Jordan like the Likud demands.

Harding is at the top of the list of presidents who have been categorized as black. This line of thought goes back to the obsession that many 19th and early 20th century Americans had with ""blood lines"" during what is a time when the ""one drop rule"" was used to define race. Segregationists and Social Darwinists found it important to be able to define race and so argued that any person with a black ancestor was black. In today's world, overt racism is frowned upon in the public sphere, people can self-select from a range of ethnicities and races on the census, and intellectuals discuss race as a social construction. Current discussions of ""post-racialism"" are a near inversion of the understanding of race that prevailed a century ago. Obama's responses to racially charged issues have been measured and stand in a clear contrast to the role that race played in Harding's campaign for the presidency in 1920.

The issue of race was injected into the 1920 presidential campaign as part of an effort to sink the campaign of Harding, the Republican nominee. William Estabrook Chancellor, a professor at the College of Wooster, attempted to destroy Harding's candidacy by charging that he was a ""hybrid,"" an ""octoroon"" descended from ""Negro"" ancestors. Chancellor was a devoted scientific racist. He was also an avid Democrat who worshipped outgoing president Woodrow Wilson. In short, Chancellor argued that Harding's supposed mixed racial ancestry disqualified him for the presidency. He believed that the American public would agree with him, warning Americans that electing Harding could endanger white supremacy.

What did Chancellor offer as evidence of Harding's ancestry? Chancellor found people in central and northern Ohio who were willing to testify that members of the Harding family were black. They offered a variety of stories with little consistency and no hard evidence; indeed, Chancellor and many of those he interviewed dealt in the worst stereotypes of black promiscuity or vague descriptions of physical appearance. Perhaps the only thing more confusing and inconclusive than Chancellor's evidence was the genealogy that the Republicans created to counter Chancellor's charges in an attempt to document Harding's ""blue-eyed stock."" Rather famously, Harding refused to comment on the ""scandal,"" privately noting that for all he knew one of his ancestors might have ""jumped the fence.""",1,True,t3_euzal,0,False,c1b7rx5,

No, the Greek isn't derived from the Latin: the Latin is derived from the Greek.

That's a pretty strong correlation.  It may not be the only culprit, but don't you think atomizing a slightly radioactive heavy metal over an area might cause health problems?

From the wiki on gulf war syndrome:

""The use of DU in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects. Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Because uranium is a heavy metal and chemical toxicant with nephrotoxic (kidney-damaging), teratogenic (birth defect-causing), immunotoxic, and potentially carcinogenic properties, uranium exposure is associated with a variety of illnesses. The chemical toxicological hazard posed by uranium dwarfs its radiological hazard because it is only weakly radioactive, and depleted uranium even less so. DU has recently been recognized as a neurotoxin. In 2005, depleted uranium was shown to be a neurotoxin in rats. Epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU.

E.g. it was purposefully non-enforceable propaganda meant far more as a puff piece to justify the war for the North than anything else.
At the time, the United States had suffered defeat after defeat and, at one point, if Robert E. Lee had pressed his army just a few more miles into Washington, D.C., we wouldn't even have a United States any more.

On his deathbed, he had seen how things turned out and how Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had
eviscerated the Constitution

1. turned the United States away from the Public Trust it had been (with the Preamble of the Constitution serving as the Trustee Agreement) into a monolithic for-profit corporation,
2. how they had forceably unified under the tyranny of gun- and bayonet-point thirty-three sovereign countries with as much or more rights than Germany, France, and other EU countries today into one monolithic federal apparatus, at the cost of millions of lives
3. after they had subjected all 10 states of the former Confederated States of America to fourteen years of harsh military martial rule over every aspect of society from voting, to who was in office, to basic economic decisions and even the sacking of entire state governments on the Whim of the Executive and military
4. after only ending the military juntas once each state was forced to declare fealty to their oppressors and agree to state constitutions written by their Northern aggressors meant to make illegal their sovereign right to dissolve from supposedly voluntary union as well as disadvantage them economically.

After all of that, he said that not sacking DC was the greatest regret of his life. He said that he didn't want any more blood on his hands and that he honestly thought that by getting so close the North would be broken at heart and that peace could be had.

He said the empty Emancipation Proclamation had galvanized the idiotic, uninformed and blindly patriotic of the North, while Lincoln and Johnson simultaneously sacked entire governments (like the entire state government of Maryland, the entire city government of New York City (when they both tried to secede -- NYC wanted to become the first non-tax, non-tariff city in the entire world... think of what would have happened if they did! How much progress!), and shut down literally hundreds, if not thousands, of newspapers and churches (usually sending the speakers/writers to PRISON) for daring to point out the truth of the Proclamation or the War Crimes of the Northern Aggression.

What you need to do is research it yourself and -- even better -- go to some ex-CSA state and actually listen with open ears to the old people who still remember the true histories passed down by mouth, since for literally decades writing it down would get you imprisoned, at best.

I honestly think this post needs to be submitted to reddit itself. People really should know this stuff, especially Europeans!!

CAN""T YOU SEE THE EU IS REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKES WE, IN AMERICA, WERE **FORCED AT GUNPOINT AnD THE DEATHS OF MILLIONS** TO ACCEPT?! STOP IT NOW! DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!

By the way. The Confederate States of America had the best generals of the era on their side, esp. the famous French ones. Combined with the fact that the vast majority of the war involved the U.S. wantonly invading the CSA territories and the CSA's home-field advantage along with guerilla tactics, the only way the war was resolved in the U.S.' favor was by General Grant obeying Lincoln's express wishes.

The wishes of Lincoln were so egregious that the top U.S. general at the time refused to cooperate and was summarily sacked by Lincoln and replaced by Grant. Grant and Sheridan enthusiastically executed Lincoln's express and in writing desire to ""utterly destroy the South"" and proceeded to be the first generals in the pre-modern era to initiate the doctrine called Total War:

They would burn everything, kill male over the age of 13, rape the women, even young girls, while taking all able-bodied young males (under the age of 14) as slaves, while systematically burning and destroying everything. They would go into homes, destroy all property, evertyhing. They would go into the Black Ghettos, burn down the huts, rape the women, and generally totally screw them over. They showed no mercy on any one. Entire cities were lost. Vast portions of the south during Sheridan's so-called ""March to the Sea"" were utterly desolate to the point that grass would not grow for several years, and millions of people were made refugees, with virtually all of the men dead, with a nearly complete genocide of men aged 60 and above.

Just 8 years later, these same fucking generals waged another war. The American Indian War. And we should all know how that turned out!! Only that time, instead of just raping the women and young girls, they killed them afterwards!

* If you want to know why America invades so many countries.
* If you want to know when we started falling so far from the principles of the founders.
* If you want to know why we have such a collective bloodlust.

&gt;John Boehner, the new speaker of the house, went around in the House to distribute cheques from the tobacco lobby when they were about to vote on a law on tobacco. I've seen him admit to it. He wasn't apologetic about it, thought that maybe it was indeed not the best idea to do it -right then-. He's bought and paid for and he makes no bones of admitting to it. And that's 1 example of who knows how many. These people are not working for the average American.

You're right. He was supporting the Tobacco industry in an illegitimate way. But Tobacco is also a large part of many southern states' economies. Since it would increase jobs and industry, it's not politically correct, but it's naive to say that there is absolutely no benefit for the people.

&gt;The US has lost a lot of standing in the world since 2000. It holds far less political sway than it used to. Netanyahu doesn't even bother to pretend he listens to Obama.

And Obama pushed right back, threatening to reduce support. Remember the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement? The U.S. is just as influential as it was ten years ago.

&gt;Let's see how big the deficits build up in the next few years and what other countries think of that balance of payment.

And meanwhile, the European Union, with the second biggest reserve currency, can barely manage to bail out its own members. The US dollar continues to be the most stable exchange unit in the market, even with the economic downturn.

&gt;The US is on the way to becoming a military junta.

When is the last time your heard of the military influencing domestic politics? When is the last time you heard of the military influencing foreign relations outside of the Afghan area? I'm sure 90% of the U.S. couldn't even tell you who the most senior military official is, minus the commander-in-chief.

The U.S. is the only country in the world that has food stamps, so yes, technically you are correct.

I have a B.Sc from the #26 university in the WORLD and am native in english and spanish. Certifications in highly specialized enterprise software that pays very highly everywhere else. I'm half spanish and after a stint in Canada as a Project Manager I decided to switch careers. Got a job in Madrid and took it simply because of how difficult it is to get the first job in my type of consulting (think, Oracle, SAP, etc). I had to take more than a 25% paycut to move to Spain. Never got a raise, had to live with my parents, could not afford a car or rent. Tried renting once but it was about half my take home pay (about 1300 euros). This is considered good pay in Spain sadly.

After 2 years, the projects started to dry up and the work experience was not relevant to my career anymore. Many of my coworkers were laid off. I interviewed for other jobs with the big 4 consulting firms and when I asked for 30k euros I often was laughed at. Told that a 27 year old would not make that for at least another 10 years and that the sun in Spain was somehow worth the pay. (That's about $35000 USD).  I saw the contracts and knew exactly how much was being made from my labor (approximately 110K euros a year).

I routinely see jobs in my area advertised with salaries of 18-24k euros a year. My line of work in the US typically gets you about $120k for a noob and over 200K for an expert consultant.

Needless to say, this past summer I quit my job, returned to America and multiplied my income by about 700%. I've even started to get more job calls from Spain because English is in demand from multinationals. Unfortunately, the rates they keep offering are a joke.

Imagine then, if you're only qualified for a regular job that typically pays 40-80K in the States, Canada, or the UK, in Spain you'll be lucky to get half.

As for moving around Europe, I've seen many friend attempt to go to the UK and elsewhere. Unfortunately, Spain's population is not like Portugal or Holland where most people have learned to speak English as well as an American (sometimes they sound more american than I do!). I've seen them go to London and back within just weeks after realizing that they only thing they can do is clean hotels or work at restaurants. 

This isn't just a problem of jobs not paying enough and living costs being too high. This is a problem with huge socio-economic ramifications. Unlike in the states, almost no one in Spain can afford to have a baby, sometimes in their life (decrease of population), unable to afford to buy a house or even rent (home buying is one of the biggest economic drivers, you're talking about 10K per room when a family buys a home and furnishes it, trickle down economics  motherfucka). This all leads to a decrease in tax revenue, an increase for southern american immigration, further driving down wages, and a recipe for disaster.

The EU doesn't help matters either. Now in Spain home prices are still averaging 200K-300K euros. Mostly driven by speculation but aided greatly by an incredible influx of wealthier Brits and Germans buying up summer homes. The average spanish wage is 21K, while in Germany it is 40K!.

England is a good choice IMO, since you're on an island with a large enough navy to deter any invasions (you'll likely lose your continental territories though). But whichever nation you pick, be wary of France the big blue giant. 

I mostly played in windowed-mode, so whenever I had trouble doing something I'd just google how to do it. Some things are not very obvious, like how to load troops on to a ship (ships should be on the water, not in the port), but for the most part, I think once you get a handle of the basics, the rest you will gradually pick up on. 


One suggestion on play-style: I like to play by setting it to max-speed, then keep my thumb on space bar(pause). So I let it run at full speed until I see something that needs my attention, then I pause and investigate. This way it plays out almost like a turn-based game. This game is not for the impatient and playing it this way makes it feel a lot snappier IMO. In a large multi-front war though I slow down to lower speeds.

Even multiplayer doesn't get full run of much of the island.  It really feels like Reality Pump just plain ran out of time and had to push out a very unfinished product.  

I've heard rumors of a ""Gold patch"" to be put out on the day of US release, but who knows what that will involve.  It's also rumored the larger island is reserved for DLC, which I doubt.  We've simply got a case of unfinished game, and that's not all that rare these days, but I do have to say I'm highly disappointed, it's a great game and enjoyed my time with it.

The second link clearly shows that that isn't true.  There isn't a general consensus about that at all.  How about [this](http://www.scribd.com/doc/2404356/Age-of-Aishah): it's a book debating different scholar's examinations of the age of Aisha/Aishah.  Or how about these:  

""According to hadith in Bukhari and Muslim, Aisha is said to have joined Muhammad on the raid that culminated in the Battle of Badr, in 624 CE (Sahih Muslim, 19:4472) and then in 625 CE in the Battle of Uhud. (Sahih Bukhari, 4:52:131) As no one below the age of fifteen was allowed to accompany raiding parties,(Sahih Bukhari 5:59:423 , Sahih Muslim 19:4466 ) Aisha should have been at least fifteen in 624 CE and thus at least thirteen when she was married following the Hijra in 622 CE.   

Ibn Hisham's recension of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rashul Allah, the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad, records Aisha as having converted to Islam before Umar ibn al-Khattab, during the first few years of Islam around 610 CE. In order to accept Islam she must have been walking and talking, hence at least three years of age, which would make her at least fifteen in 622 CE.(Ibn Hisham, Al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, Vol. 1, p.227 - 234, Arabic, Maktabah al-Riyadh al-hadithah, Al-Riyadh )  

Tabari reports that Abu Bakr wished to spare Aisha the discomforts of a journey to Ethiopia soon after 615 CE, and tried to bring forward her marriage to Mut`im ibn `Uday's son. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam, but if Aisha was already of marriageable age in 615 CE, she must have been older than nine in 622 CE.(Tabari, Vol. 1, pg. 493, Habib ur Rahman Kandhalwi, Age of Aisha, Al-Rahman Publishing Trust, Karachi ) (p.91)   

Tabari also reports that Abu Bakr's four children were all born during the Jahiliyyah, (Al-Tabari, Tarikhu’l-umam wa’l-mamlu’k, Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Dara’l-fikr, Beirut, 1979) the pre Islamic period, which is said to have ended in 610 CE, making Aisha at least twelve in 622 CE when Aisha started living with Muhammad.   

Aisha is reported to have said that at the time Surah Al-Qamar, the 54th chapter of the Qur'an , was revealed, ""I was a young girl"".(Sahih Bukhari 6:60:399) The 54th Surah of the Qur'an was revealed nine years before Hijrah.(M. M. Khatib, The Bounteous Koran, 1989 ISBN 0-333-34738-2) According to this tradition, Aisha had not only been born before the revelation of the referred Surah, but was actually a young girl, not even only an infant at that time. So if this age is assumed to be 7 to 14 years then her age at the time of marriage would be 16 to 23.   

According to these, your first assumption, that all scholars agree on her age, is obviously false.  Also, you defended your insistence that it was okay for a grown man to marry and have sex with a nine year old child, because nine year olds were more mature then, I refer you to the passages about Aisha bringing her dolls with her, and playing with them after her marriage.  Or how about this: from the wikiislam:  
Praise be to Allah and peace be upon the one after whom there is no [further] prophet.  
After the permanent committee for the scientific research and fatwahs (religious decrees) reviewed the question presented to the grand Mufti Abu Abdullah Muhammad Al-Shemary, the question forwarded to the committee by the grand scholar of the committee with reference number 1809 issued on 3/8/1421 (Islamic calendar). The inquirer asked the following:  
It has become wide spread these days, and especially during weddings, the habit of mufa’khathat of the children (mufa’khathat literally translated means ""placing between the thighs"" which means placing the male member between the thighs of a child). What is the opinion of scholars knowing full well that the prophet, the peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, also practiced the ""thighing"" of Aisha - the mother of believers - may Allah be please with her.  
After the committee studied the issue, they gave the following reply:  
It has not been the practice of the Muslims throughout the centuries to resort to this unlawful practice that has come to our countries from pornographic movies that the kufar (infidels) and enemies of Islam send. As for the prophet, peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, thighing his fiancée Aisha. She was six years of age and he could not have intercourse with her due to her small age. That is why [the prophet] peace and prayer of Allah be upon him placed his [male] member between her thighs and massaged it softly, as the apostle of Allah had control of his [male] member not like other believers.""    
So, sex was out because she was too young, but he could molest her?  That sounds like a great role model, and obviously six year olds are old enough to have non-intercourse sexual relations.  

Second, in the wikipedia article I referenced, slightly down the page, is this: ""Denise Spellberg states that ""these specific references to the bride's age reinforce Aisha's pre-menarcheal status and, implicitly, her virginity.""[4] This issue of her virginity was of great importance to supporters of the Abbasid Caliphate.""  So again, the idea that she was menarcheal, or that Muhammad waited until she was menstruating, isn't established or settled. 
As for age of puberty: The average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.  Researchers refer to this drop as the 'secular trend'. In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females. In Norway, girls born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years. In France the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In England the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In Japan the decline happened later and was then more rapid: **from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.**
A 2006 study in Denmark found that puberty, as evidenced by breast development, started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, a year earlier than when a similar study was done in 1991. 
Note:  not a drop by 11 months over all the years between 1840 and 2010, but a drop of 11 months per decade in Japan, during a specific time period.  Way to misrepresent.  
I never claimed that the average age of puberty beginning had been steadily dropping for centuries, I said that it had dropped significantly in recent years.    
Furthermore, girls don't start getting their periods immediately when puberty begins.  [Menstruation generally begins a few years after the onset of puberty](http://www.mgh.harvard.edu/children/adolescenthealth/articles/aa_puberty.aspx).    

As for you numerous assertions that why would Muhammad do anything against the words in the Qur'an, I don't know.  I don't pretend to understand the hypocrisy of religion, or the fact that religious figures violate their own doctrines.  Maybe because people seem to assume that the ""prophet"" was above everyone else?  That he shouldn't be held to the same standards?  Because, as has been clearly shown, priests and religious figures are completely above hypocrisy (Ted Haggard, George Rekers, Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker, I could go on and on), or twisting/ignoring the words of their religion to suit their own needs or desires.

It would send a stream of high-quality candidates into jobs in the military and government, which would improve the quality of both those institutions.

I found it using FF, so I don't know why it would have crashed your browser.  It is an abstract from a study from 2006 and states that only 20% of German workers belong to a union.  Here is the text of the abstract:

This paper traces the profound decline in German unionism over the course of the last three decades. Today just one in five workers is a union member, and it is now moot whether this degree of penetration is consistent with a corporatist model built on encompassing unions. The decline in union membership and density is attributable to external forces that have confronted unions in many countries (such as globalization and compositional changes in the workforce) and to some specifically German considerations (such as the transition process in post-communist Eastern Germany) and sustained intervals of classic insider behavior on the part of German unions. The 'correctives' have included mergers between unions, decentralization, and wages that are more responsive to unemployment. At issue is the success of these innovations. For instance, the trend toward decentralization in collective bargaining hinges in part on the health of that other pillar of the dual system of industrial relations, the works council. But works council coverage has also declined, leading some observers to equate decentralization with deregulation. While this conclusion is likely too radical, German unions are at the cross roads. It is argued here that if they fail to define what they stand for, are unable to increase their presence at the workplace, and continue to lack convincing strategies to deal with contemporary economic and political trends working against them, then their decline may become a rout.

""Sports-only/casual"" gamers didn't have nearly as much influence back then...don't give EA too much credit.

Dude, just take a look at how the European market was treated up until just this past decade. You rarely got games from Japan sooner (or even at the same time) as us American gamers did, ports of games had even less chance of getting to your market, big companies like Nintendo &amp; Sega developers didn't even care enough about the PAL standard to keep crappy hardware issues (like the borders around N64 games or even slower framerates in Saturn titles [than the US versions]). This isn't a knock against you or anyone in Europe...but truly, up until the PS2/XB/GC generation what happened outside of Japan &amp; the US was very inconsequential.

The Saturn &amp; Dreamcast actually did well in Europe. Hell, you even got a port of Shenmue II...American gamers didn't get that for DC. Also, you had long-running official Saturn &amp; DC magazines...again, us American gamers didn't have that because even though the systems sold okay in the US, for our population, it wasn't good enough.

A good comparison would be to how music sales are tracked globally. In the US, you need to sell a million albums (1 CD albums) to get Platinum. In Japan, 250k sales = Platinum. In the U.K., 300k = Platinum. It's all based on market size and potential. 

In terms of the Dreamcast, the fact that it took Japan over twice as long to get a little over half as many DCs sold in the US was the real issue. Where the Saturn had been more popular in Japan than it had been in the US, the DC wasn't exciting anyone over there.

""we as a nation had to fight in the blood and the shit of Europe and the Pacific in the 40s"" - The key here is 'we as a nation.'  When the USA fought WWII, the whole culture changed.  We rationed stuff.  Women went to work.  Most of our current culture seems to be trying as hard as possible to not be inconvenienced by the current wars.

""Feel good Americana of the 50s"" - unless you were black, jewish, gay or other minority.  Or McCarthy was after you.  Or you were a woman who needed an abortion.  

""the countercultural wave of free thought that was the 60s"" - unless you were drafted and went to Vietnam.  Or were any minority.

""the neon drenched happiness of the 80's"" - I grew up in the 80's and it was fun personally, but culturally it sucked.  Regan reshaped the country by metaphorically beating all the hippie out of the country.  We ended the cold war by basically spending more than the Russians until they went broke, then spending even more.  Wall Street was riding a wave of greed and douchebaggery that would not be seen for at least another twenty years.

And the Russians haven't flown over US carriers, it would cause WAY TOO MUCH crisis and might lead someone to think there was a war. There have been incidents of fighters and such.

[A reference](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_books)

Let me start by suggesting you take a look at the *Heir to the Empire* trilogy, by Timothy Zahn. Zahn is the pioneer of Star Wars EU (Expanded Universe), and his trilogy was one of the first to expand upon the characters in the movies. It was my first trilogy, and one of my favorites.

That said, here is my opinion of where you should start off. Just ask yourself these questions and you should be good to go!

**Are you concerned with reading books in chronological order?**
If **YES**, then you should pick up *Fatal Alliance* and the *Darth Bane* trilogy. Those do a great job of telling great stories from way in the past, and have some interesting characters.

**Are you only interested in reading about characters from the movies? (Anakin, Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, etc)**
If **NOT**, click that link I sent you, and pick a novel at random, they are all very good.

Now we get to my real recommendation. In my opinion, the essential readings are all book that take place **after** Return of the Jedi. I *can't fucking stand* the prequel books, I hate most of the Clone Wars era novels (except for Karen Traviss's Republic Commando books). There are some realy good books in the prequel era, like the one you read about the Emperor. But, in my honest opinion, the really good books are the ones that tell the story about Han Solo, Leia, Luke and their futures. And believe me, there are some really fantastic stories about where they end up. Below, I'll list some books that delve into their lives post-ROTJ:

* Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, The Last Command
* Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force
* Before the Storm, Shield of Lies, Tyrant's Test
* The whole X-Wing series (especially Wraith Squadron)
* The Truce at Bakura
* The Han Solo trilogy

When you think you've read enough about your favorite characters, try the *New Jedi Order* series, but **be warned**, they do some terrific and massive plot/character twists in that series, and maybe you want to read some precursor stuff so you know a little background.

I hope I didn't ramble too much...

Your lack of knowledge about Muslim countries is embarrassing, especially for someone who makes statements such as yours.

In case you have not realized it yet, I am slightly bothered by your reading into my words things that I am not intending to put in there. I am not sure that this conversation can continue, as you are either intentionally (in order to troll me) or unintentionally not understanding what I am attempting to say.  I value your comments on my pontifications: they have given me a good start to try and refine my rhetoric, in the hopes that I can be more convincing to others.  I do appreciate this conversation, frustrating as it may be.  I will try and make one more parting shot:

&gt;The difference between thugs and a government is that governments are enabled by horizontal support among the governed. People think that governments are just, moral and necessary. No one thinks the same thing about the Latin Kings.

Elsewhere in this thread, you seem to indicate that you would like to get rid of government mostly or entirely. (I could be wrong, so my apologies if I am.) Yet here you define government as being inherently legitimate. I am trying to throw you a philosophical sop and spin the idea that governments are inherently illegitimate.  Governments maintain a monopoly on violence, and use that violence to extract taxes/tribute/percentage in order to fund the government's activities, which include violently extracting resources from the ""governed"".  You state that governments require popular support, while I would say that governments require a minimum level of participation, plus a lack of significant competition, and a lack of non-participation by the populace that is coerced (forced, bribed) to give up their individual sovereignty. Possibly a hair-splitting distinction, but enough to indicate to me that you somehow have internalized that government is either a necessary or a legitimate institution or both.   To try and give more examples, most people throughout history have not consented to the government they find themselves under.  The feudal serfdom of Europe; the colonial period of the European Powers; Slavery in America, Brazil and the rest of the New World; I can't imagine that the people born into servitude supported their government. Many even tried rebellion and revolt, and were quashed brutally.  Humans seem to have this nasty tendency to hierarchy.  In any given situation, some person will climb to the top, and start bossing others around.  If they are good enough, then the rest of the group won't mind in the least.  And for those that do mind, or even want to replace the Big Chief, obstacles are put in the challenger's way to defeat them or just gently put them out of the game. ""Sorry kid, you've got to have had these certain list of parents in order to qualify for king."" And, sooner or later, the Big Chief will want to extract a commission for doing the hard work of bossing others around.  So we get kleptocracy.  That leads to more consolidation of resources and requires more power to keep the system in place, creating a self-reinforcing system with positive-feedback tendencies.  I am asserting (without references) that this is a fundamental character flaw in humanity that will be a real pain to overcome.  So exactly, I am long-windedly agreeing with you that:

&gt; in fact if you were to abolish the State tomorrow, there would be a new one the next day.

I also assert that there are already new governments waiting in the wings - even if the people who find themselves under a new government consent to it or not.  Any entity that can create a monopoly on violence and extract resources automatically qualifies for a government.  Perhaps there needs to be a better word for it, but I'm not going to search for it just now.",1,True,t3_ev40e,0,False,c1b8yyb,

Yes, I followed your logic, hence the term ""luddite"".

Why? And based on what? There is no evidence that any permanent problem has emerged. Economies have been dealing with liberalization-regulation cycles for quite awhile, and I suspect that Europe will deal with the current problem by once again liberalizing its labor policies.

&gt; If you imagine a time in the future where robots can do everything for humans, how would a human then make money

If robots are doing everything for us then there is no need for human labor and there is no shortage of resources, _by definition_. Please think hard about that.

One surprising development is that amateurs are more capable than the big professional installations: we did a moon-bounce last year that was reachable from Australia to Europe using a backyard dish, after Arecibo and Stanford said that it wouldn't work. Moon-bounce was used to communicate with distant submarines before the age of satellites. 

Post-collapse, there are a bunch of redundant systems that could be repurposed for comms: modern traffic grids have routing built in as an entirely independent network. Sewer systems provide a natural 'watershed' style coverage area. 

Packet radio is of course the easiest, but it is always susceptible to jamming/interception/interference. The US used to have a system called GWEN (Ground Wave Earth Network) that provided near-continental coverage with minimal infrastructure. ELF systems are low-bandwidth, but are more robust (GWEN was designed for a post-nuclear environment). 

Cell networks are quickly evolving towards becoming the ultimate post-collapse networking infrastructure: in Africa, each cell station might be solar-powered, or run off a bicycle-powered generator. It's robust enough to work in the most unstable environments the world has to offer (Mogadishu, Somalia).

Some military satellites are also available for repurposing: The US Navy FLTSATCOM system is currently very popular in rural Brazil, where truckers use it like a digital CB, with improvised transceivers.

not all the europeans who adventure in china come from wealthy families and you have to remember, besides the visa issues and transportation, a lot of the housing and food are free

in asian culture, when you are a valued guest, you are given completely free food and lodging (another reason why american culture is selfish)

Saddam was quite angry at Kuwait for not adhering to OPEC quotas for oil exporting. In aftermath of the 1980s war between Iraq and Iran, Iraq owed serious cash monies to those countries that it borrowed from during the wartime - Kuwait loaned Iraq many millions of dollars during this time (without checking Eugene Rogan's book, The Arabs, I believe the sum was $15 billion, a significant portion of Iraq's debt). Iraq's ability to pay back those loans was directly linked to price of oil. Iraq was losing about a billion dollars in revenue for every $1 dollar decline per barrel of oil. And the price of oil was plummeting. It was the 80s, baby, oil was cheap. And to piss off Saddam even more, Kuwait just wouldn't abide by those pesky OPEC quotas.

Kuwait at this time had its own gas stations that it exported to in Europe. Therefore, a decline in price per barrel of oil did not affect their GDP as much as, say, war-ravaged Iraq. Furthermore, Kuwait was not in the mood to listen to its pleading neighbor, Saddam Hussein, asking Kuwait to follow OPEC quotas. After all, Kuwait had just loaned the country billions to fight Iran. Fuck those guys, Kuwait thought. 

So as Kuwait profited from exporting as much oil as they could, Iraq's economy tanked and ran in the red. Those oil fields across Iraq's border in Kuwait looked mighty tempting to one Saddam Hussein. And alas, the rest is history. 

EDIT: (I did bring a copy of some of my study materials with me on vaca. I am, indeed, a nerdpenguin) Direct quotes from Eugene Rogan's, The Arabs:

""Besides a restive populace, the most immediate challenge facing Saddam Hussein at the end of the Iran-Iraq War was the reconstruction of his country's shattered economy. Iraq's wealth derived from its massive petroleum resources. For eight years, the country's vital lifeline of oil had been cut by attack on pipelines and port facilities, and a ruthless tanker war that took the Iran-Iraq conflict to the Gulf's international shipping lanes. Deprived of oil revenues, Iraq has been forced to borrow billion of dollars from its Arab Gulf neighbors to sustain its war effort. By the war's end in 1988, Iraq owed some $40 billion to the other Gulf states, and debt repayment consumed over 50 percent of Iraq's oil income in 1990"" (Rogan 442). 

""Compounding Iraq's difficulties was the steady decline in the price of oil. To pay off his country's debts Saddam Hussein needed oil prices to remain in the range of $25 a barrel (at the height of the Iran-Iraq War, prices had reached as high as $35 a barrel). He watched in despair as the international price slumped to $14 by July 1990. The Gulf, at peace once again, was now able to export all the oil the world needed. To make matters worse, some Gulf states were producing well beyond their OPEC quotas. Kuwait was one of the worst offenders. Kuwait had its own reasons for breaking ranks with OPEC over production quotas. Earlier in the 1980s, the Kuwaiti government had diversified its economy by investing heavily in Western refineries and opening thousands of gasoline stations across Europe under the new brand name ""Q-8,"" a homonym for ""Kuwait."" Kuwait's crude oil exports increasingly went to its own facilities in the West. The more crude oil the Kuwaitis sold to their Western refineries, the higher their profits in Europe. These refining and marketing outlets generated higher profit margins than the export of crude and insulated Kuwait from variations in the price of crude oil. Kuwait was more interested in generating maximum output than seeking the highest price per barrel by hewing to OPEC's guidelines"" (Rogan 442).

""Iraq, in contrast, had no such external outlets, and its revenues were inextricably linked to the price of crude oil. Every drop of one dollar in the price of barrel of oil represented a net loss of $1 billion to Iraq's annual revenues. In OPEC meetings, Iraq and Kuwait found themselves on the opposite side of the table, with Iraq pressing to reduce output and drive up the price of oil, while Kuwait called for greater output. The Kuwaitis paid little little attention to Iraqi concerns. In June 1989 Kuwait simply refused to be bound by the quota it was assigned by the other OPEC members. Having supported Iraq's war effort against Iran with loans totaling $14 billion, the Kuwaitis felt justified in putting their own economic interests first now that the war was over"" (Rogan 443). 

""Saddam Hussein began to pin the blame for Iraq's economic woes on Kuwait, and he responded by applying pressure and threats to the small Gulf shaykhdom. He called on Kuwait not only to forgive Iraq's $14 billion debt but to make a further loan of $10 billion for Iraq's reconstruction. He accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from their shared Rumaila oil field. He also claimed that Kuwait had seized Iraqi territory during the Iran-Iraq War, and he demanded the ""return' of the strategic islands of Warba and Bubiyan at the head of the Gulf both for military facilities and to provide Iraq with a deep-water port"" (Rogan 443).

The girls at Jezebel.com are finally starting to wake up and smell the coffee, and they don't like it at all. 

The case against Polanski was 30 years old. Also, Samantha Geimer didn't want him to be extradited. Most importantly, we're not going to have Interpol warrants plucking American citizens off the streets of American cities after breaking a condom on a European vacation. That would have been the end result of a reciprocal extradition arrangement between the USA and EU, with a precedent being set by the Polanski case.

A big part of the Male Rights agenda has to be reforming legal terminology of sex offenses to acknowledge distinctions between male and female, straight and LGBT, ""hebephilia"" and pedophilia. 

Additionally, the euphemism ""statutory rape"" should not be used to describe voluntary sex with adolescent minors. It should be called something else if it was not rape. Heterosexual vs homosexual offenses should always be noted by the legal language of whatever charges are filed. The term ""minor"" should only describe teens in order to avoid lumping adult/teen sex offenders with adult/preteens sex offenders. 

Making these distinctions would save a lot of basically normal men the suffering of being lumped together with some of the most undesirable men in society. 

The feminists are going to oppose this 100% because they're effectively a ""sexual union"" who seeks to elevate sexual demand for themselves, as women by causing scarcity of sexual availability for all men. 

Sabotaging justice with gender-neutral terminology hobbles normal men and thereby serves the greater goal of the sex union, increasing demand. 

This legal sabotage must be resisted so that we're not subject to feminist totalitarianism. Let the real perverts face real justice, and let normal men enjoy their lives. Who knows, maybe we'll want to be with women our own age rather than teenage girls. 

It depends on whether women act less mature as they progress from teen years to adult years, or whether they can maintain at least as much common sense as they had when they were teenager. 

Currently, it seems female emotional maturity takes a dive after year 16 and reaches its nadir around 30, especially if they don't find a stable relationship by then. ",-6,True,t3_ev8w4,0,False,c1b972p,

&gt; This dance, originally know as the chalk line walk originated among the Black slaves of Florida. It was an exaggerated parody of the more formal dances of Whites that they witnessed. While first performed in the spirit of rebellion it was eventually assimilated into plantation life as it spread northward with the slave owner often dolling out hoecakes to the winners of sanctioned competitions. By the time minstrel shows carried the dance throughout the United States and introduced it to Europe, it became known as the cake walk. Because of the racist nature of minstrel shows the dance was transformed from being a parody of Whites to that of Blacks aspiring to dance as White people. With the addition of ragtime music in a climate of growing racial tensions the cake walk became a fad and was depicted on numerous postcards. It is not always easy to determine the butt of the joke on these comic cards as they can be of this Black dance or of the Whites who are trying to dance it.

- In some countries, oral agreements are binding.
- Many places have tenants associations, that will give you legal assistance in case of disputes, while small claims court does not exist
- There are frequently incentives for landlords to make places more energy efficient, in the form of tax rebates and subsidies
- Some countries require you to bring your own kitchen (!) with you, to get gas/power/water turned on by yourself, and to deal with routine maintenance (e.g. chimney sweep, heater inspection, etc.)
- There are often formulas for how long individual components (e.g. wall paint, carpets, etc.) are expected to last, and how frequently you can insist that a landlord replace them

The series was created by David Greenwalt and John McNamara, and starred Adrian Pasdar as the titular character, Jim Profit. In February 2008, episodes began airing on Chiller in the USA. In October 2010, episodes began airing on CBS Action in Europe.

Considered by many to be ahead of its time, the show is a precursor to more recent edgy television shows that include The Sopranos, Nip/Tuck, Dexter, Breaking Bad, and The Shield.

It was one example of how no religion is immune to fanaticism.  I don't know if bringing up the crusades actually helps your point.  If anything it shows via history that Christianity is pretty susceptible to fundamentalism just as Islam or any religion for that matter is.


&gt;All religions are susceptible but not to the same extent islam is.  You have to be blind or living in a bubble of politically correct self delusion not to see that. But your attempt to draw moral equivalence between a top gear stunt and a innocent women going into hiding because of actual real threats to her life suggests that you are.

Clover, for example, loads up with estrogens when it is grazed, in sufficient quantity to suppress ovulation in farm animals if they are allowed to graze the same field for some time. Other grasses generate what are in effect antibiotics to suppress ruminant ferntation. Tropics greenery is so toxic that ammals have to eat clay in parallel to be able to excrete rather than absorb these toxins. Coffee's caffeine is a nuerotxin, tobaccos nictine the same and most of capsicums/ tomato/ potato family would never pass a toxicology screen. 

There is a cost to such compounds and plants make them when they are challenged by insects. Insecticides make for safe vegetables. Slow growth exposes plants to a higher chance of predation, so drought and salt stress, low nutrient availability etc all lead to toxin production. Low fertility leads to toxic plants. 

Does that mean that you pour on the agrochemicals? Of course not. Integrated pest control is much better (economically and environmentally) than lashings of pecticide; but it does on occasion *use* pesticide. There is no Holy Writ that forbids it. 

The marginal utility curve for agriculture is usually extremely flat. That is, some inputs increase economic returns very steeply, but these flatten off whilst yield continues to increase. Policy has to decide if it wants more food (with more inputs) or to go to the first inflection point and stay there. Silly regulatory regimes - such as the EU CAP or the Bush agribinge - pay by production volume, not net value added. Consequently, people pour on whatever makes for high volumes, because they are subsidised to do so. 

Farmers who operate in a market-based or rational regime are usually acutely aware of their net income. They are not inclined to lash on chemicals without regard to the returns from them. That said, they may not see the full picture, or may lack information. That is why extension services are so very valuable. Unhappily, many of these have been influenced by NGOs with an anti-technology, gender biassed or other hobby-outrage agenda to push. Whole swathes of potential are thereby shut down, from hub-and-spoke plantation agriculture (""paternalist, captives of capitalism, inorganic"") to agbiotechnology (""captives of the multinationals, destroyers of biodiversity"".) I came across on group who were fighting against market interventions designed to prevent so-called ""turkey cycles"", oscillations created by poor market information. This policy was supposed to be a design by the rich nations to guarantee supplies at the expense of the poor. In fact, the person driving this was deriving a happy living from marketing righteous indiganation and safe outrage to a coffee morning bunch of supporters in the US.

Now, depending on your OS you have to make a change in the Windows control panel, in order to make the Minecraft server use the Hamachi IP for accepting connections. This may be an important step, no matter how you are trying to create the server.

WinXP: Network Connections -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; In the ""Connections"" area move entry called ""Hamachi"" to the top position.

Win7 (from memory): Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Manage Network Connections -&gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Settings. Under the Adapters and Bindings tab, move Hamachi to the top of the list.

Now that that's done, download [MCAdmin](http://www.mcadmin.eu/Main_Page#Download_Latest_Version_of_MCAdmin) and use that to manage your server. It does almost everything I need from a MC server.

The problem though is the vocabulary that is used and what definitions we attach to these words.

What is it in a spiritual seeker, that ""realizes"" the nature of self? If there is no separate consciousness than what does it mean for self to realize self? What is left after the experience?

In my experience/research, ""Self"" is a construct of the mind (this agrees with the article above, more or less): it's all our past experiences, emotional attachments, and belief systems.

In reality the only reason why the government runs many utilities companies is because it has a monopoly in those industries through force and the population of the countries rarely get good value for money, sure some people pay nothing and get free utilities but people that do pay, they pay more than they should through taxes. 

Often when the government run infrastructures get privatised, which we have seen happen in the uk, we find that it rarely gets fully privatised all they do is keep the worst of both as i like to say. They keep the monopoly of the government run industry and they take on the profit aspect of the private sector. So what we are often left with is an industry that was ex government, that now has fake competition due to government regulation. Where realy there is not much difference between them all and they are just reaping profits while exploiting the government enabled monopoly. 

Accepting subsidies from the state for an industry that could be funded by private investors (if the state got out the way) because there is such a demand for the service, especially in the usa and europe, is the last thing they want to do. Accepting subsidies will give the state a reaching arm in to the industry, it will then enforce ridiculous monopolist regulations that will distort the market.

There is a title under the link which you sent me which reads ""Warfare (Jihad bil Saif)"". Yes it is not only to do with warfare, but it does include warfare. Muhammad himself went on military campaigns as I explained earlier.

&gt;As you understand if you read the Wiki.

It doesn't look like you have read it. Here are some quotes.

""to refer to three types of struggles: an internal struggle to maintain faith, the struggle to improve the Muslim society, or the struggle in a holy war.""

""he prominent British orientalist Bernard Lewis argues that in the Qur'an and the ahadith jihad implies warfare in the large majority of cases.""

""The term 'jihad' has accrued both violent and non-violent meanings""

""""The Prophet... returned from one of his battles, and thereupon told us, 'You have arrived with an excellent arrival, you have come from the Lesser Jihad to the Greater Jihad—the striving of a servant (of Allah) against his desires.""""

""jihad is the only form of warfare permissible under Islamic law, and may consist in wars against unbelievers, apostates, rebels, highway robbers and dissenters renouncing the authority of Islam""

The Qu'ran includes many stories of Muhammed going on militrary Jihads himself, don't be so ridiculous to state that it has nothing to do with war.


&gt;To claim that Jihad shows that Islam is evil is the same as to claim that football supporters chanting shows that all football supporters are assaulters and rapists.

I do not claim Muslims are bad people, but their absolute beliefs are dangerous. And football fans do not have moral teachings so this comparison is invalid.

&gt;We are supposed to show the Muslim world our free and liberal world, we should not act the same as the worst of the worst and create more problems than we solve.

I am not suggesting it's good to join the EDL and other organisations that are similar. Obviously it just creates riots, and there is no danger of the islamification of Europe either. But like Christianity I think it's dangerous and breeds fundamentalism. You only have to look at the middle east to see what this kind of absolutist belief system does.


&gt;Yes, some of the backward Muslim areas of the world has as of yet such socio-economic problems that they cause terrorism

That is true; however, that particular statement was mostly directed towards the earlier states.  I still would like to address it and give my two cents on the Moghuls though.

The Moghuls, as I'm sure you know, were outside invaders who spoke a language and practiced cultural traditions foreign to India.  Now on the face of it, this presents no problem.  Foreign invaders have often contributed greatly to unifying the disparate peoples into a single entity, and crafting a common identity that remains long after the foreigners have been assimilated or thrown out.

However, I don't believe the Moghuls achieved this with India.  They crafted a political entity that nearly united all of the Indian subcontinent into a single empire, but they failed to mold the inhabitants into a similarly united entity.  Thus, a few short decades after the Moghul Empire reached its territorial peak it quickly began unraveling, and India quickly began devolving back to its more natural and divided state.  No successor state filled the void left by the Moghuls collapse, instead India returned to its traditional regional and sectarian divisions, and the numerous successor states were just as apt to fight the Moghuls as amongst themselves.  In other words, their creation was transient and its overall impact was minimal.  All that remains to attest to this short-lived unity are their architectural monuments scattered across the land and a limited linguistic diffusion that eventually stabilized into Urdu.

I believe the reasons for the Moghuls Empire's temporal nature are hinted at above.  Firstly, they were aliens to India; elite and aloof.  They built an artificial empire by the sword, and they held it together by the sword; it had no other foundational supports beyond its arms.  There was no binding glue amongst the many variegated Indian peoples and cultures with which a successor state could establish a pan-Indian Empire.  Secondly, although their reigned for centuries in the Northwestern India, much of their hold on other large swathes of India lasted mere decades before contracting apace.  Thus the limited nature of their acme reveals their laudable efforts to control India through a centralized administration were less effective and widespread than might be imagined.

&gt;India was definitlely a monolithic cultural construct before the east India company came. Columbus was looking for ""India"" not gujurat. The Arabs used to trade with ""hind"" and ""hindiyya"" traders not punjabi ones. It doesn't compare at all with modern Europe, which is much more culturally diverse.

Mere geographical descriptors and ignorance on the part of outsiders.  The Indian subcontinent has a geographic context just as Africa has a geographic context; the first is bound by mountain ranges and the ocean, the latter by the Sahara and ocean.  As for ignorance, it led to Europeans often calling any and all nomads who emerged from the eastern steppes Huns, and the Chinese continued to call Europe ""Rome"" long after the fall of both the Western and Byzantine Empires.

Similarly, when Alexander the Great crossed the Indus he found so-called ""Indians"" to be far from united in a political or cultural manner.  There were democratic city-states and autocratic kingdoms; peaceful Buddhists and warlike Hindus; nomadic wagon tribes and sedentary agricultural towns.  All these were of course called Indians, because they lived in the Indian subcontinent; for little or no other reason.

&gt;Britain might have left the subcontinent as modern nation-states, but certainly by any practical measure, more divided than when they found it. It's telling you don't see anything like the 1971 war in the centuries leading up to British rule.
&gt;So not only is it inaccurate to say India was hopelessly divided before the east India company, but to actually credit the British for unifying the subcontinent and couch it as a positive contribution to their modern welfare is downright disgusting. Your rhetoric is quite the opposite if mine. I'm bent on portraying the British as the greedy bloodthirsty savages they were but are somehow never credited as, and you seem bent on apologizing for British atrocities, dismissing millions dead from famine as an unfortunate and regretable footnote in an otherwise benign relationship.

I'm in no way trying to whitewash Britain's role in colonial India.  Admittedly, I focused on the more positive aspects of their rule, while only briefly mentioning the negatives, but that was merely because I was attempting to repudiate what appeared to me a distortion of the picture.  And it might be true that by today's standards the British may have seemed crass, demeaning, and racist; however, by contemporary standards I don't believe they were any worse than most others.

And I'd say being divided into three countries (five if you include Bhutan and Nepal) is better than dozens or even hundreds.  After all, when they arrived India was fragmented into hundreds of independent entities.

Finally, you have to remember that the Indians themselves enabled the British Raj to exist.  Both Company rule and the British Raj made extensive use of local intermediaries.  This manifested itself not only indirectly through the largely autonomous princely-states, but also through countless locals directly employed as mayors, tax-collects, et cetera.  How else could 300,000 colonists—most of whom were nonadministrative family members—rule over 300 million Indians in the midst of their own country?  So I don't think trying to blame British colonialism for all of India's problems today and trying to ignore their contributions is a very fair or realistic assessment.  

&gt;Lastly the trade numbers you cite tell a misleading story. In the first place, they are from 1850 when Britain had normal trade relations with the united states, a former colony. More importantly, the goal of predatory mercantilist trade policies in the empire was not to create an insulated economy within the empire, it was to give Britain a comparative trade advantage over other developed countries, its real trade partners. In that context the numbers you cite are shockingly high. 30% of all exports went to colonies? Freaking 25% of all imports came from colonies? Do you realize that's almost twice what the united states imports from china? And up to 40% during the napoleonic wars? Shocking. I don't think you realize how disturbingly high those numbers are.

It is true that colonies were often used to obtain a comparative advantage through preferential trade.  However, my point was that the figures show that Britain exported more value *into* India than it extracted *out* of India.  This trade imbalance of trade was for all intents and purposes free development aid in the favor of India; disclaiming the myth that Britain insatiably exploited and ravaged India for a pittance.",1,True,t3_eua92,0,False,c1b9g19,

First let me say in civ 4 stacks sucked. I hated them because they were painful to manage and the new system offers for actual tactics rather than ""Lets see who has the more guys"". They whole needing a transport ship was annoying as well in the civ gmes mostly because it required a ton of effort on your part just to ferry your army across an ocean . 

Of course however I miss things like religion and cultural captures and espionage amongst other things. 

As for the game itself the first 50 turns always was that slow. The art had a certain style and they went with it. 

The AI itself is a bit wonky and its hard to tell was it because the difficulty I was playing on or that the AI is just stupid. However I played on huge earth and started off in north America with only one other civilization which declared war on me and subsequently lost. I then went on to capture the 2nd biggest civilization in south America besides my own. But the point of this is during that time in Europe, Africa and Asia the civs were constantly warring with each other and a few died off before a lost legionnaire of mine actually discovered them.

Because these civilzations could no longer trust one another and I had built up a technological advantage due to conquering others, conquering them happened relatively swiftly with hardly a whimper of fighting back. Probably my most dangerous opponent, napoleon, I caught off guard while he was finishing off England in the southern tip of Africa. He decided to finish of England rather than deal with me as I rolled through his cities in middle Africa and then conquered his capital that was somehwere in eastern Europe. 

But basically at this point the only way I could have been dealt with is that if rest of civs rallied together against me but like I said were too disillusioned with each other at that point to do so. Mind you Civ is like a chess game: There is a certain point when playing that victory is assured if you make the right moves in the early game.

&amp;

&gt; But the point being made by Eaton here doesn't require that the differently balanced programmes were more successful; just that alternatives exist.

Well this is really the crux of the issue here, Eaton has simply written an argument where he makes no points worthy of discussion and simply hypocritically accuses others of being ideological without substantiating it.  

It's essentially just anti-government (anti-Tory?) spin since it attempts to reflect negatively on the government without tackling the key part of the debate, *effective alternatives*.

There are always ""alternatives"", the important part of a discussion like this is the consequences of the alternatives and the practicalities.  He can't possibly hope to show that the government is ideological without first showing that there are *equal* or superior alternatives.

&gt; Many countries have higher tax regimes and as shown in the article most deficit reduction programmes historically have used a lower cuts –to- tax ratio.

Many countries have lower tax regimes too and the article doesn't show ""most"" deficit reduction programmes, it shows a small sample from a short time period (with a different global economic situation, which is key) and misses off the most important details.

We live in a world that is becoming ever globalised where the multinational corporations call the shots.  If we raise taxes too high, there's always someone there willing to undercut us, just like Eire has done with its low corporation tax.  Even the Scandinavian social democracies are lurching to the right.

&gt; how much the banking industry should contribute.

The problem with the banks is they can literally just go somewhere else without much trouble and you can bet all your money that there are *major* European nations that would absolutely love to replace the UK as one of the financial capitals.  So it's a very thin tight rope we need to cross here and any changes we make has to squeeze as much out of them as possible while giving *just enough* incentive to stay.

A robust regulatory system is required but there will be consequences for this that I don't think many people appreciate.  The banks will start lending less as they seek to simply avoid risky debt completely.  Remember how everyone used to complain about how the banks wouldn't lend them money?  Well they started lending and ""this"" is the result.

&gt; Ps. You reference Iceland from the economists list but I think you may have misread that as the article lists Ireland.

I bet if you discriminate against Roma nothing will happen to you, but beware, if you say a bad word about the Jobbik footsoldiers the police will show up in your desk and take your computers. 

Media organizations also have to give space in their publications to ""official announcements"", if not they are fined - up to a million Euro (a sum that can kill newspapers). The news media cannot edit these pieces, they have to print/show them as they receive them. In my opinion this part is completely fucked up Russia style. Berlusconi at least has the decency to buy all media organizations to let them do the propaganda.

I even read that TV news pieces will be produced centralized. The journalists doing the work are former right wing radio hosts and editors.

Furthermore, it's not just the media law. It's the restructuring of every state-run organization, whether it is police or the ministries. They are replacing old officials with untrained new ones that are loyal to them.

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_vacation_days_has_obama_taken_so_far

According to the questionable unbiased information source, Politico, ""By Knoller's count, Saturday's golfing outing with Biden was Obama's 39th round of golf since he took office (and his 7th since the start of the oil spill on April 20th)"" which is over 2 times per month. In the last month Knoller has fed information to The Wall Street Journal showing that Obama has already golfed more in 20 months than his predecessor did in his entire two terms of 8 years!

According to Knoller; by the end of August, 2010, Obama will have taken nine vacation trips (48 days). Among the locations were Chicago (twice) and Asheville, N.C., for long weekends; Hawaii, a week and Martha's Vineyard for over two weeks.
In addition, by Knoller's count; the Obamas have enjoyed, at tax payer's expense, 33 gala night events away from the White House.

I think that this cultural diversity leads to localization of power and an inherent unwillingness on the part of EU citizens to concede too much power to Brussels.  Sure, you can view this as something that is 'holding back' the EU from accomplishing grand goals, but I'm of the opinion that the EU currently has struck a wonderful balance between upholding the interests of the continent as a whole and preserving the individual power of the member states and individual citizens.

I think that the gradual concentration of power in Washington over the last 150 years has helped bring great things to the US economically, but I think that democracy has also paid a price in the sense that people feel disconnected from the political process and power structure in faraway Washington DC.

The current economic problems are directly traceable to fractional reserve banking and the issuance of too much shill debt (that is debt that will never be paid back).

How much of that debt was created by illegal immigrants living in the US?  who knows... nobody seems willing or able to do those numbers.  The reality of no-doc loans was that even dead people were issued debt, so, without a doubt, illegal immigrants are a component of fLyingNINJNA shill debt issue.

Here's the funny thing about fractional reserve banking:  while it creates money at the rate of +9 to 1, when debt becomes shill, it also destroys money at the rate of 9 to 1... and it doesn't take much shill debt to completely negate a decade's worth of wealth creation (the current crisis was precipitated by sub-prime loan failures rising from 3%-5% to 10%-15%).  Were 15% of no-doc loans made to illegal immigrants?  Nobody is willing to answer this question.  What percentage of the sub-prime loan failures are directly attributable to illegal immigrants?  Again, nobody wants to look under that rock.

Just to let you know what illegal immigrants actually think of America, let me relate a little story.  I had a friend who lived in the USA illegally (over stayed his student visa by about 10 years).  His peer group consisted primarily of other illegal immigrants.  He indicated that they spent a fair amount of time figuring out ways around the system.  One of the more favourite short circuits involves assuming identities, running up large student loans and then taking the sheepskin back to their country of origin.  Some of his peer group now reside in Europe with an Euro Zone passports/jobs and American degrees and zero student loan debt (and fair number non-hacking high school diplomaed American idiots now have to explain how they couldn't even get into the college they supposedly graduated from).... so, this phenomenon isn't just limited to housing and it's certainly not exclusive to illegal immigrants from South/Central America.

That $40k-$60k worth of debt they made probably ended up creating at least another $250k worth of money... wealth that will need to be destoryed over the next couple of decades.  American wealth... your future.  How many people studied at your school were from abroad?

Personally, the ride is working out just fine for myself and pretty much everyone I know, though that doesn't mean that it works out best for everyone.  There are definitely people being left behind.

Can I ask what you mean by this?  I'm of the opinion that the EU is going exactly where it needs to go - that the current economic power of the EU is the result of decades of work ironing out the bureaucratic kinks and procedural steps that are necessary to standardize an area for trade while leaving most other things alone.

This may seem stupid, but last month the health and safety guy at the company i work for called a meeting.  At the meeting, he showed us some stickers that go on some of the products that the company produces - standard ""hazardous"" stickers that let people know not to dispose of something in a fire or to dump it in a lake.  He then outlined the new stickers that we would be using in 2015, and how these would be phased in across the EU over the next 5 years.

While he was saying this, I was thinking of how thousands of other health and safety guys were probably giving the same speech sometime that month in the Netherlands, and how across the EU there would literally be millions of people at hundreds of thousands of companies involved in making this little change in the appearance of hazard stickers.

The end result of this change will be that a supplier in Romania can sell raw material X to a manufacturer in Denmark, and everyone in that Danish factory will immediately know that the raw material conforms to safety standards Y and Z.  Whatever language barrier might exist is rendered obsolete by standard labeling practices across the entire EU.  Might seem small, but this is going to save both lives and untold hours of wasted time over the years.

There's been an insane amount of work and money poured into standardizing EU infrastructure over the last 40 years, from making sure railway cars and tracks are all the same gauge to stuff like standardizing stickers and labels.

The reason why it's expected to leave a 18% or more tip at restaurants in the U.S. is because not only do servers rely on tips (most are legally paid $2.13 per hour with NO benefits), they usually have to pay a portion of their sales (not tips!) back to the restaurant, who uses it to pay baristas, server assistants, sommeliers, bartenders, and just about any front-of-house staff. While you may say that's unfair (it is), it's a system that's developed over several decades and is unlikely to be changed. Most restaurants fail within a year of opening and no restauranteurs of my acquaintance would readily accept the idea of adding more costs to its overhead. Restaurants in europe (and I've lived and traveled there extensively) typically include the 'service charge' in the amount charged by the restaurant for the food and then the extra 10% or so is exactly that...extra.

I think its how much of that populace of the race you find attractive which is the real question.

There are certainly some very homely looking Asian girls out there, I certainly think so, not all Asians are beautiful and that goes for all races as well. 

As a white bisexual 20 year old male I find a variety of races to be attractive, some more than others and individuals within those races to be more attractive than the rest of their entire race. When it comes to gay relations i almost exclusively only find white males attractive but when it comes to hetero relations I find that certain Asian girls achieve a higher level of attractiveness than most white girls but that I find a larger majority of white girls at any do-able level of attractiveness than that I find attractive in the entire Asian populace. Also I think Asians age more gracefully so when I came to these conclusions I was only counting people of my own age FYI.

I'm sorry my answer is so long and poorly written, its just that the question you asked could be much in depth than just ""are you attracted to this race? Why?""

You misunderstand science and academia.  Most of these people would still be employed, studying climate, or physics, or atmospheric processes, or ocean processes, regardless of whether or not AGW existed.  Most scientists have relatively little to gain from AGW.  There is always something else to study and learn about and AGW is not the magic conspiracy generator that you think it is.

On the other hand, there is a very small group of people making huge amounts of profits from the status quo in the energy industry, and they have a very clear vested interest in avoiding carbon reduction measures.  The conspiracy theories cut both ways.

But back to actual science and facts.

&gt; If C02 is causing the earth to warm, and the explosive growth in China and India has certainly released more an more C02 in to the atmosphere over the last two decades, should not the rise in temperature be linear and consistent? And the solar minimums do not explain the last ten years of temperature data.

Even considering asian growth, the human CO2 contribution is on a steady increase.  You underestimate how much CO2 western countries have been emitting for the last 100 years.  Yes, China and India are changing the fastest, but they are just now catching up to the output of Europe and the US.

The solar cycle does not explain the entirety of global temperature averages.  Climate is forced by many things, with interactions between them.  Solar cycles, volcanic activity, ocean cycles, orbital changes.  All these things are factored in by the various climate models.  However, the extreme solar minimum of the last 10 years has undoubtably had an effect.

Over long time scales the models work and only by factoring in the additional driving force of CO2 is the actual, measured data accurately matched.

&gt; Further that big heat sink we call Oceans should be warming as it is much more difficult to cool, but again, no evidence at all.

Are you sure there is [no](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7198/full/nature07080.html) [evidence](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/pdf/nature09043.pdf) [at](http://www.springerlink.com/content/3384683251573275/) [all](http://icoads.noaa.gov/climar3/c3oral-pdfs/S5O2-Levitus.pdf)?

&gt; I repeat, and you did not address this: None of the existing climate models has allowed for the last two winters. The models thus do not work.

And I'll repeat my point: there are no models that explain the last 40 years *better* than those than include CO2 forcing.  If somebody could produce a *better* model of the last 40 years that did not require the CO2 forcing, the whole climate science world would sit up and take notice, but as of yet, nobody has.

Ergo, the existing models *are the best models we have*.  And they unambiguously tell us the planet is warming, CO2 is a major driving force, and human activity is adding just enough to the natural CO2 cycle to cause the influense of CO2 on climate to increase.",1,True,t3_euxsz,0,False,c1b9y29,

I'm American, have lived here my whole life in three very different parts of the country, and have traveled widely here, as well as in Canada, Japan, and a few places in northwest Europe.

It goes without saying that I am my own person, but at the same time, who I am was vastly influenced by where I grew up - the cultural, social, and political norms of this country.  I absolutely do not agree with everything the government does.  I consider myself a socialist, in fact.  There are very few wars that I support, and even in justifiable wars (of which Afghanistan is probably the only one that comes close since Korea), one has to be extremely vigilant in preventing abuse (as we've seen in Afghanistan, which is really not justifiable given the way it's been conducted).

But a nation is not defined by its borders.  It's defined by its people.  I don't have to support the way this country treated Native Americans, or the way we stole most of the southwest from Mexico, to love the people of this nation.  And I do love the people of this nation.  I don't love the government - sometimes I support elements of it, sometimes I don't, and I certainly never totally trust it.  The fact that I love my own people does not mean that I hate other people.  I think that every nation and every people (however defined) has a right to self-determination; I would argue that the U.S. government sometimes has facilitated that goal and sometimes contradicted it.  But again, a nation is not the government.

I think if you looked at the premise of your post, you'd realize that you're guilty of the same thing you're accusing others of - setting up ""American"" as something unique and special.  The idea that Americans are the only ones who act irresponsibly is frankly just ridiculous.  If you've traveled widely, I'm sure you know this.  If you've studied history, you definitely should know this.  The way that the world political order is set up right now, that is to say, with the U.S. far and away the most powerful country (for a wide variety of reasons), any action the U.S. takes has a disproportionate affect on international affairs, both in actuality and in the imagination.  But wars are started all over the world for all kinds of ridiculous reasons.  That has always been true.  Chances are, that will be true for a while.  That is, in fact, a human thing.  If you have a problem with war, I think you ought to reassess exactly how proud you are to be a human being.  Humans are the subject of suffering, obviously, but they are almost always the source as well.

I mean, look at it this way.  If you have this much of a problem with this many individuals confined to an area that is about 6.5% of the world's total landmass and 5% of the world's total population, do you seriously think that you are going to be lovey-dovey with everyone outside that area?  There are douchebags no matter where you go.

If we made a similar chart about 1/3 of Christians we could just use the US (and onyl those who self-identify as Christian therein) and come up with some bizarre conclusions that would not apply to Christians in the entire European continent (gay rights, should gays be killed according to the bible?, should muslims be killed?, Woman's rights, biblical literalism, supply-side Jesus, etc.).

""The new media law is definitely not consistent with the EU Treaty of Lisbon."" Is this a fact or opinion? Because the law was specifically constructed to only contain what laws of other EU countries contain.

""discriminating against minorities OR majorities""
If you knew happenings in Hungary, you would knew what this is about. There was actually a push in the socialist media to keep Hungarian nationalism limited, which went too far at times. Making fun about Hungary's historical symbols like St Stephen's crown, or the mythic ""turul"" bird. It was called ""magyarkodás"" by them. This behavior of the socialist media was very irritating to a whole lot of people. Partially it did result in rise of Jobbik too. 

""I bet if you discriminate against Roma nothing will happen to you, but beware, if you say a bad word about the Jobbik footsoldiers the police will show up in your desk and take your computers.""
Contrary to the image the socialists are showing the world, Fidesz is the party more sensitive to the situation of Roma. A common disgusting joke among socialist voters is that Orbán himself is Roma, but he is afraid to admit it. You have just no clue, who in hungary is really racist and who is not. As for Jobbik, they deserve whatever they deserve, but contrary to your suggestion, they aren't the governing party, so who the fuck cares about them?

""I even read that TV news pieces will be produced centralized.""
You read it wrong. The state owned 3 TV's will have a common news editorship, they will be required to reduce other redundancies too, and generally conserve funds. But, two of those TV stations have already common news pieces. And, in Hungary there are at least 5 other country-wide TV stations, and countless local stations. Public or commercial, they of course do whatever they want with their news pieces. It is just misleading to say, that ""news pieces will be produces centralized"", when it only applies to state owned TV stations.

""The journalists doing the work are former right wing radio hosts and editors.""
This is partially true. But during the era of socialists, the situation was the same, just then the state TV stations were full of socialist's own journalists. The early-morning ""Napkelte"" political show during the times of socialists was the worst kind of propaganda machine, it was full of lies and biased reporting, it reminded me of pre-1998 times, really. Those journalists who were running the propaganda machine were fired even before the elections, when the socialist's political base broke because of corruption issues.

""And they even pissed off Big Business, which is the most stupid thing you can do in unified Europe. Taxing western companies with billions of Euros, because they are ""big""? No, because they are ""foreign"". /facepalm""
This is not true. The biggest tax is paid by a local Hungarian bank, OTP. Every company pays by its profits, not by any other criteria. Multinational corporations just don't like paying taxes, thats all.

Your quote about the rise of fascism in Hungary is a classical one. It emerges regularly, it is always told by the post-communist socialists. They are afraid about the rise of fascism in Hungary from the time of the fall in communism in 1989. Every time, just every time they fuck themselves up with their corrupt practices, they return to their anti-fascist rhetoric. Its their last hope to prove that they are needed in Hungarian politics. Its their propaganda that you are hearing.

""from my own newspapers in Germany""
The German press is just as biased as the Hungarian. Had the Spiegel ever had a positive article about Hungary, ever? Well maybe when Hungary had a socialist government, probably then, or never.

""this law is dangerous""
This may be true, as i said, give the law half a year. I have lived in a dictatorship, and i can tell when it gets to even resemble it, but this is not it. As for the opposition, the socialists, who would be most affected by censorship, if there would be any censorship, i don't feel any pity for that corrupt bunch. They have 20% of voters support, but they must be owning like 60% of the media.

New Players (lvl 1 - 59)
- Stick to the level capped servers, I would personally avoid bouncy ones so you learn to fly correctly but if you are having real difficulty, go bouncy (you ""bounce of walls"").
- Try the different modes.  The three main modes are COOP, TBD, and Ball.  Coop is cooperative play to get to the map end and appeals to the younger viewers generally (if you have daughters, songs etc).
Ball is similar to soccer.  It is also the most preferred mode by new players.
TBD is team base defence where you protect your base against bomb attacks.  I've played all three, enjoyed all three, but I generally did at different times.

Lvl 60+
- I'd recommend trying the ball servers (Ball normal, Ball bouncy) and chilling there, or football (but this is fun without helping you climb up the skill ceiling that much).  Most new players enjoy ball so thats why I recommend starting there.
- If Ball is not your cup of tea, try TBD (Official #3 Official #1, TBD Bouncy).  Your lives are ore valuable, its more strategic in terms of positioning, and a lot of ball players eventually branch out and come to enjoy TBD.  It's harder at the start because TBD players kill a lot better then ball players so it may be a bit frustrating.

Advoid: Ball Dojo, Ladder, APL - These are the servers with competitive matches and higher skilled players (except Dojo, which is just higher skilled in a more relaxed setting).  Go there after you start winning a lot in regular games and want tougher competition and/or competitive play.  Usually, people from these servers will be around in the other servers form time to time and will talk to you if they think you can come in and play at a reasonable level.  Though if you are dominating regular public games feel free to give it a try

Warning:  Competitive players can be a bit rough on new players.  However, if you are articulate/actually type they will be willing to Shepard you and help you out.  I wouldn't recommend playing in competitive servers until you start dominating the pubbies, read a guide or two (there is a how to ladder guide) and watching a game or two of competitive play (it plays different a decent amount of the time).  Except for Dojo, dojo is more relaxed as it's not ranked (or captains/picked games).

Having said all that, I still enjoy the game at 1500 hours, and am a far way from actually being at the skill ceiling for the planes I play.  There is an active American and European Community (and a few asians), so something for everyone.

TL:DR Sucked 1500 hours out of my life, good fun

The corporatist state is a result of the increase in state power.

&gt;Maybe the north american way of ruling is wrong, but it does not make any government as bad as yours. Travel a bit.

I've been around the block. Some governments may be less irresponsible, but the common denominator among governments is selling promises via the welfare state to buy votes. Politicians make grandiose problems in regards to health care, education, and welfare. The people adore these politicians and idolize them. When the bills come due and it is obvious that the government cannot tax enough to pay for their promises, people get angry.

Awright.  For starters, better bread.  A French loaf is good.  Anything artisanal and whitish - as a rule of thumb, if you're serious about it it should be something that isn't square and isn't pre-sliced.

Mushroom and cheddar is one way to go.  Thyme is a delicate flavor for cheddar, though - I might try rosemary.  Mushrooms also pair well with nutmeg.  A nutmeg grinder is a useful thing to have around - you'd be surprised how many things ""pop"" with a little nutmeg on them (omelets in particular).  For the extra mile, put a splash or two of marsala or sherry in with the mushrooms while they cook - 

...and then try something other than cheddar.  Marsala and cheddar is gonna be gross.  Marsala and gruyere, though - or marsala and havarti, or marsala and jarlsberg...

Finally, try some european process butter.  I'm quite fond of lurpak, kerrygold will do in a pinch.  Either way, salted butter is the way to go on a grilled cheese.

People go to school, get a PHD in English, and the university conveniently forgets to tell them that the vast majority of people that get PHDs in the humanities do not have jobs, nor will having a PHD in the humanities help you get a job.  

The system leading up to a job is one that does not inform or incentivize degrees that will actually land jobs. They make money when you go to school.  They don't really care whether you land a job once you get out, just so long as you pay your tuition.  Yet you have to go to school to get a job.

With the reduced sunlight present in Northern Europe (UV index less than 3, light very rarely in the 270–300 nm range) early settlers likely had to deal with conditions like Rickets, as their bodies were no longer able to perform the chemical photosynthetic reaction required to create vitamin D3, incredibly important in bone growth.

Without a ready source of Vitamin D (fatty fish, liver, milk) the new inhabitants of countries like Finland and Norway would be doomed to die a slow death and see their children malformed (this is why you see so many ancient fishing villages in these areas, and why historically the Nordic peoples were such amazing sailors and fishermen). With these foods being the only way to get vitamin D at those latitudes, their dark skin, rich with a pigment no longer being used to filter UV light, was extraneous -  and, in actuality, harmful: As melanin filters UV light, what chance irradiation that did occur was reduced by this dark pigment. Like many other extraneous / disadvantageous features of man's past (large canines, claws, tails, fur) large amounts of melanin (the pigment that give people their color) became less and less prevalent in future generations.

What task given? The task of selling phones?  Is their motivation the same as yours?  Are you going to RMA the phone?  Will you never buy another Samsung?  The answer to both of those is probably no. 

Samsung just told 10M galaxy S units. This along with the Galaxy Tab this is the closest major competitor to the iphone and ipad, however Apple has the added benefit of having 1 model of phone out on 1 carrier and they notoriously control the entire relationship and envionment of that model for better or worse.

&gt;If they can't figure out how to do that maybe they could try to put together a partnership between google and their chip vendors 

Samsung is the chip vendor, and along with HTC Samsung is THE Google preferred vendor lately.  You might have even noticed the Samsung Nexus S on Tmobile that just came out????

&gt;to contract the talent they need to get the new OS out.

This is one item I relatively agree with, Samsung TV reps I know even acknowledge they need to make progress on the software side, but you know what? Internet@TV is still one of the best proprietary TV widget/application portals on any brand--- not exactly what most people would call ideal but this is evolving.  

&gt;The problem as people are finding is that the support OEMs are being able to offer is lacking. No going to winmo needed to figure this out.

Samsung is a BIG company, they do things with a budget of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars--- they put out the biggest fires and drive GROWTH. While I agree froyo is at the moderate end of customer service issues--- the phones still work great-- it's not as if the phone won't make calls, send texts (anyone tried doing MMS on iphone?), or heh **RECENTLY** basic alarm functionality software bugs, sure GPS has been spotty for something people but 3G triangulation is estentially the same for google maps which is what most people use it for.  

It's also funny you mention winmo, have you used their stuff? Want to talk about buggy?  I hoped my TOUCH PRO 2 would have gotten WINMO7 but it wasn't even discussed nor an option, it just died. 

&gt;When I compare my user experience of my epic with my iphone I am going to think about the keyboard, software flexibility, all sorts of things. Most of those are going to fall into the android camp. The one big thing that apple is able to offer me is unified updates in a timely manner. Sure if you had a 3g you got shafted with ios 4, I didn't have that problem.

You describe unique items for each, and I agree, iOS more polished/Android more open and customizable.  Apple owns your experience and it's no mistake there is 1 version of the most current phone, and 1 carrier in the US currently.  They have hundreds of software people all working on a few items. Now compare that to Samsung/Google/Carriers who all need their 10-200 variable ducks in a row to produce a legitimate patch/update.  

As you said, 3G users got shafted for 4G and does Apple mention 3G? Sometimes, maybe... but still useable right?  Oh except for iOS4 that didnt run on 3G and slowed it down.

&gt;Right now it seems like samsung is dropping the ball on their support, and we aren't even getting to the middle or the end of the life cycle on these devices.

It's not clear that it's completely Samsung's fault given Europe/MiddleEast/Asia has had official updates to froyo but the US hasn't--- is it related to carrier variables? US spectrum? Bloatware? Samsung doesn't like the US?  Etc etc?

So it started with 2.1 and you guys want 2.2, I get it. There has even been a 2.2.1 so you never know what happened between 2.2 -&gt; 2.2.1. Yes 2.3 is out, but only vanilla the same issues that occured with Froyo are bound to occur on 2.3.  Individual challenges aside, software SHOULD accelerate but if its the carriers and not Samsung for example--- it will be even harder and also a selling point to have premium software devs. Sprint tries to be the ""best"" but they seem slightly above average with updates only a few weeks ahead of others at best.

&gt;So in a year and a half when samsung looks over to their beaten and battered understaffed team of people that do their android builds and they have to figure out if they want to continue supporting galaxy devices or the latest thing they just released they will probably make me very sad with their decisions, because they have already proved they aren't acquiring the staff they need to support their current generation of hardware, let alone another 19 months worth of hardware releases.

While the backlash is present in almost every post you read about the 2.1 Android higher end phones--- It has not appeared to have impacted actual sales... infact they continue to grow.  

I believe they know software is their weak point--- how quickly that will change you never know.  If a software programmers get harassed and worked but VPs continue to show phat profits-- you never know where the true value will come.  It's a market force--- if LG, HTC, Blackberry have a better perceived market opinion that will change things fastest--- meet comp.

Until then you're stuck with 2.1 not 2.2 or 2.3

Again, froyo isnt that big of a change to alter the user experience, especially if individual variables cannot be guaranteed. GPS for example, Wifi useage, speed, fundamental features like txt, bluetooth, etc.

Even the sold called superior cooked roms and roots all have bugs depending on your version of the phones. 

GPS, Wifi, lag on home screen paint, bluetooth, etc etc.

So I put it back on 2.1 and everything works.  

These are not phones exploding when they get too hot.

So you can't install apps to SD card and you can't customize the app tray order... People like to say froyo is SOOOO much faster, it isnt, infact it was slower for me on 4 out of 6 versions I used. 
It's a pissing contest...

You've got the BMW 325? Well I have the 525!  525!? I have the 745!

BMW 745?  Isn't that the one with electrical problems? I have a honda accord with 200k miles and no issues.

No one is perfect.  Just be happy it works and if you don't like it--- I'll trade your phone for my old TOUCH PRO 2 with all the accessories ;)

&gt; But I have always been of the opinion that when a text states something, unless it's quite obviously metaphor, then it should be interpreted literally. I'm a dick like that when it comes to holy text, because for hundreds of years people have used some of the crap in those books to justify their bigotry etc.

You're entitled to interpret however you want. Muslims (Sunnis at least) tend to follow the interpretation of Muhammad and his closest companions (who became the first four Caliphs). 

The Qur'an was also revealed over a period of 23 years. So they have as their interpretation, the historical context, Muhammad's sayings, his behavior, and how he enacted every verse into practice. It's almost like a living book (one of Muhammad's wives described him as a walking Qur'an).

It's also been touted from the very beginning to have layers of meanings. If you read through the commentaries, you'll see that. They explain everything they can, from the apparent, to the esoteric and everything inbetween. 

The tradition of preserving this massive amount of knowledge that was literally a way of life is what spurred on the Muslims' development of ""the sciences""... the first of which was the legal and political sciences (fiqh). As the first two generations of Muslims started dying off, the sciences of hadith developed (basically, the science of history). They took their oral tradition of narrating from Muhammad and the first Muslims and compiled it into books with famous scholars devoting entire lifetimes to collecting narrations and sifting through them and classifying them by their veracity. Along side this were economic developments and also military (technological) developments.

There were several principles that were necessary to achieve this.

Honesty. They really believed in their religion, the ones leading the charge in the fields of knowledge anyhow. 

The need to know the truth. They also realized they had to be uncompromising if they were to preserve the essence of their way of life, it was an existential issue.

Meanwhile, the Arabs had been catching up on the works of the Greeks. Theology was coming into its own through fiery debate.

All of this eventually coalesced... the universities, the degrees from the legal sciences, the process of peer review and criticism from the hadith sciences, the needs of governing an expanding state, health/economic/social/military, and of course the injunctions of the religion itself which implored man to seek knowledge wherever they could find it (Muhammad said to seek knowledge even if they had to travel as far as China, they went to Greece instead, although they had plenty of contact with the Chinese and Indians and it was invaluable), as well as the religion's moral imperative to be absolutely honest in the search for truth and accepting the will of God. Richard Feynman delivered [a lecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science) about the need for integrity and utter honesty... an ingredient without which science isn't possible. In this environment the first instances of modern scientific methodology developed among Muslim scientists.

Inspired by their faith, the Muslim world [exploded with geniuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_been_called_%22polymaths%22).

The state of the region (or of the world, even) before Islam and after Islam is clear and a matter of historical record. You can look at it or pretend not to.

If you cut out the way the Muslims interpret the Qur'an, then you kick out the foundation for all of this that later developed. You might be able to see now why Muslims treasure and preserve their religion so much, it's what started *everything*.

Knowledge in Islam was treated almost as sacred (or at least the pursuit and preservation thereof).

You know who else preferred literalist interpretations of the Qur'an? Terrorists. This phenomena developed during the European colonial period. In an effort to undermine the ability of their most hardened political opposition (Islamic scholars/clerics) and make them incapable of fomenting resistance, they spread their ideology of the un-sacredness of knowledge to the Muslim world. As the new ruling elite, they encouraged people to question the knowledgeable Muslims on everything, because now real knowledge rested with the Europeans. The philosophy boils down to this... ""books? what's the big deal about books. anyone can write a book, here... we'll show you and you can write plenty of your own books too!"" nevermind that the books would be filled with utter crap (when was the last time you stepped into a Barnes &amp; Nobles, or Borders, or Chapters to be greeted with a stand displaying Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity's latest book... garbage, utter garbage). The West didn't believe in *knowledge*, they believed in *information*. And with that comes *mis*information and an overload of information (plenty of it useless). This started hundreds of years ago and continues today.

So self-made scholars who didn't know jack shit about *anything* of the Islamic sciences (fiqh, hadith, tafsir, even the art/science of spirituality) started popping up everywhere. An [ex-freemason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abduh) actually founded the Salafi movement, by convincing people they needed to interpret the Qur'an and Hadith literally for themselves in order to emulate the very first Muslims and ignore *everything* that came inbetween. Virtually all Islamic terrorists are from this sect today, which comprises probably 1% or less of the world's Muslims (over 90% still ascribe to Sunni theology, although are straying from it with regards to Islamic law and Islamic politics).

Btw, Abduh's Wikipedia article has been heavily edited by modern day Salafis seeking to cut all ties with their dubious founder. He was actually a sorry excuse for a mason. Last people heard, he had been booted from his lodge because he didn't even believe in a Supreme Creator. /facepalm

He coined the term ""Salafi"" from the Arabic word ""salaf"". And I should mention again, the heavy editing of Wikipedia is absolutely remarkable. The reason that Salafis today wound up being so different from their founders?

Another person popped up in Arabia. Infected by the Western message of ""anyone who can write a book *should* write a book... if you want to be a scholar, you're a scholar!"", Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab from Arabia tried to cleanse the peninsula and Islam itself of what he saw as harmful outside influences (from other Eastern faiths). He was actually nowhere near as extreme as Wahhabis are today, it just developed from the fact such interpretations of Islam are not anchored to anything and can become wildly unpredictable depending on the political climate.

Nowadays, Wahhabism is considered a sect of Salafism. That's what happened. The two movements shared a foundation (the logic that they could ignore the tradition and precedent of over 1200 years of Sunni scholarship and academic work and make up religion as they see fit by interpreting only the superficial layer of meaning literally from the Qur'an and some Hadith).

I mentioned universities and degrees a while earlier. Here's the entire issue of the last 200 years of Islamic history boiled down into one word. [Ijazah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijazah). This article has been a hotbed of debate and editing wars. Offended Westerners heavily edited the original rendition trying to sever any ties between European institutions of learning and the original models.

Want some proof?

Look at this article,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation

Look at the first one in the list.

Then, look at this,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Al-Karaouine (Established: 859 AD)

&gt; The Al Karaouine institution is considered by the Guinness book the oldest continuously operating academic degree-granting university in the world.[2]

Also, the last line of the Ijazah article is crap. The basic status of alim (which goes back to the first generations of Muslims... the plural of alim is 'ulema... scholars) is equivalent to a Bachelor's. In fact, the modern course to become one is... 4 years. Then there's the graduate program, another 4 years (what a coincidence... though it used to take longer especially when outside of a dedicated institution). Then there's the postgraduate... in order to become a *Mufti*, meaning... authorized to issue legal opinions (fatwas)... another 2 years (another coincidence). To become a Mufti requires work on what is essentially a thesis (one of my aunts is doing it... she calls it a thesis... she studies from a traditional madrassah... her 'thesis' fatwa is about the legality of abortion with various congenital disorders... overlapping with her career as a medical doctor). This system goes straight back to the first Muslim scholars of fiqh (law) from the 8th and 9th centuries.

An Ayatollah is a Shi'ite version of a Mufti.

The entire system is dependent on the system of ijazah or authorization. You have to be authorized by a teacher/master of your field before you can authorize anyone else. Ijazahs, all of them, have unbroken chains going back to the first generation of Muslims, Muhammad's companions. The whole ""master and apprentice"" thing.

You wouldn't go to a doctor who didn't have a degree or a license (the ijazah to issue fatawa would be like a license), would you?

So why would you go learn Islam from someone who similarly isn't qualified? Because you've been indoctrinated with the idea that religion is separate from civilization, politics, law, etc. Europe's attempt to defang Islam by secularizing it, so Muslims wouldn't rebel against Western hegemony. After all, it took them over a thousand years of warring to finally bring down the Islamic Caliphate (the Ottoman Empire). Which would not have been possible if they hadn't enlisted the aid of the Wahhabis from Arabia.",1,True,t3_enord,0,False,c1bao01,

Yes. Osama, the man that the US and its media tell us wants to institute a worldwide Islamic ""fascist"" Caliphate (read the Wikipedia article on it, it was more like a capitalist welfare state)... is actually from the ideological movement (Salafism and his associate, Ayman al-Zawahiri is from the Muslim Brotherhood which is on the same Wahhabi-Salafi-""Progressive"" spectrum) and actually from Saudi-Arabia... he's of the people who helped the Allies defeat in WW1 the Ottoman Empire, the Sunni Caliphate that goes back to the first government after Muhammad of Abu Bakr, the very first Caliph.

Is the world making less sense yet? Or more sense?

Needless to say, Osama doesn't have ijazah in anything. I think Al-Qaeda had one guy who had actually been to a madrassah. He quit after 1 year from one in North Africa. Haven't heard what happened to him in the last few years.

Islam is an extremely complicated thing, because even as a *thing*, it's hard to describe. It *is* a way of life or civilization, even if that civilization is almost entirely relegated to books these days.

To become a good Muslim, or even the best, requires hardly any education at all. The best Muslim, the Prophet, was illiterate. It's still a moral/ethical/spiritual philosophy at heart. One that any human can pick up. Any human can pick up the Qur'an, read through it, and understand at least a few layers of meaning right off the bat.

But when it comes to using Islam, and the Qur'an, as a basis for economics, military, politics, governance, etc, including telling other people what to believe... you damn well better know your shit. Meaning, you'd better have done your decade of schooling and earned your ijazah (authorization) to open your mouth. Anyone can become an Islamic scholar (well, intellect and willpower permitting)... it's really really cheap. So there's a huge asterisk next to the name of anyone touting themselves as an authority who hasn't graduated.

So, please. Don't do that. Don't be a ""dick"". People *die* when you do that.

There's also the problem of actually trying to literally interpret a 7th century text that's written in a unique style of classical Arabic when you don't speak Arabic at all and only know English. Meaning, you can't do it. It's like trying to run the US Constitution through Google Translate a few times then making laws based off of it. Even most Arabs today (who don't know any other language) just know enough Arabic to realize that what they hear when they recite the Qur'an is the tip of a giant iceberg of meaning.

Want to know how I know you won't understand the Qur'an, literally, in Arabic even if you began to learn Arabic?

The Qur'an challenges disbelievers to produce even one chapter like it. The shortest chapter in the Qur'an is 3 lines.

&gt; To begin with; the Arabic language and Arab speech are divided into two branches. One of them is rhymed poetry. It is a speech with metre and rhyme, which means every line of it ends upon a definite letter, which is called the 'rhyme'. This rhymed poetry is again divided into metres or what is called as al-Bihar, literally meaning 'The Seas'. This is so called because of the way the poetry moves according to the rhythmic patterns. There are sixteen al-Bihar viz; at-Tawil, al-Bassit, al-Wafir, al-Kamil, ar-Rajs, al-Khafif, al-Hazaj, al-Muttakarib, al-Munsarih, al-Muktatab, al-Muktadarak, al-Madid, al-Mujtath, al-Ramel, al-Khabab and as-Saria'. Each one rhymes differently. For metres of Arabic poetry please see please see Lyall's book Translations Of Ancient Arabian Poetry, Chiefly Pre-Islamic.[1] He discusses al-Kamil, al-Wafir, al-Hajaz, at-Tawil, al-Bassit, al-Khafif and al-Madid briefly.[2]
&gt;
&gt; The other branch of Arabic speech is prose, that is non-metrical speech. The prose may be a rhymed prose. Rhymed prose consists of cola ending on the same rhyme throughout, or of sentences rhymed in pairs. This is called ""rhymed prose"" or saj. Prose may also be straight prose (mursal). In straight prose, the speech goes on and is not divided in cola, but is continued straight through without any divisions, either of rhyme or of anything else. Prose is employed in sermons and prayers and in speeches intended to encourage or frighten the masses.[3] One of the most famous speeches involving saj is that of Hajjaj bin Yusuf in his first deputation in Iraq in post-Islamic and Quss bin Sa'idah in pre-Islamic times.
&gt;
&gt; So, the challenge, as Abdur Rahim Green mentions, is to produce in Arabic , three lines, that do not fall into one of these sixteen al-Bihar, that is not rhyming prose, nor like the speech of soothsayers, and not normal speech, that it should contain at least a comprehensible meaning and rhetoric, i.e. not gobbledygook. Indeed,
&gt;
&gt; *The Qur'an is not verse, but it is rhythmic. The rhythm of some verses resemble the regularity of saj, and both are rhymed, while some verses have a similarity to Rajaz in its vigour and rapidity. But it was recognized by Quraysh critics to belong to neither one nor the other category.[4]*
&gt;
&gt; It is interesting to know that all the pre-Islam and post-Islamic poetry collected by Louis Cheikho falls in the above sixteen metres or al-Bihar.[5]

Good luck.

&gt; I shall ask again: Does the Quran (have passages that) describe a geocentric model of the solar system? Does it say, in black and white, words that give the impression that the earth is at the centre of the universe?

No.

&gt; My point is that the interpretations you described do not exclude the interpretation of the sun orbiting the earth and seeing as I do not accept that divine intervention has ever (or could ever) occur, I conclude that the author meant a path in the sky as an orbit around the earth.

This is irrational and illogical. There's no reason to assume that human beings were not aware of heliocentrism back then. Even the ancient Greeks toyed with the idea.

&gt; I do this because I'm picky and don't have anything to gain from giving a religion the benefit of the doubt. Unlike yourself, it would appear.

You have plenty to gain from not giving it the benefit of the doubt it would seem.

&gt; How terribly useful such an interpretation is. When was that interpretation made, perhaps in the last century or so?

That's actually the literal interpretation (""run their course for the appointed period of time""), meaning that would have been made the moment the first Arab heard the sentence.

&gt; That's worth telling lots of people that now, particularly younger muslims in western countries. As well as a number of clerics in muslim countries.

Why? They're just following European tradition of making shit up as they go along in life.

&gt; Miraculous? Bullshit. In that case the Bible is miraculous too. And every other holy text. Ever.

Lol. See the above. You don't even have the original text of the Bible (how many copies of those are out there?) and even Christians acknowledge that the Bible was written by men, the disciples of Jesus.

As for the Qur'an, here's what one of the Quraysh had to say to their elders after Muhammad suddenly started reciting Qur'an to them,

&gt; The Arabs who were at the pinnacle of their poetry and prose during the time of revelation of the Qur'an could not even produce the smallest surah of its like. The Qur'an's form did not fit into any of the above mentioned categories. It was this that made the Qur'an inimitable, and left the pagan Arabs at a loss as to how they might combat it as Alqama bin cAbd al-Manaf confirmed when he addressed their leaders, the Quraysh:
&gt;
&gt; *Oh Quraish, a new calamity has befallen you. Mohammed was a young man the most liked among you, most truthful in speech, and most trustworthy, until, when you saw gray hairs on his temple, and he brought you his message, you said that he was a sorcerer, but he is not, for we seen such people and their spitting and their knots; you said, a diviner, but we have seen such people and their behavior, and we have heard their rhymes; you said a soothsayer, but he is not a soothsayer, for we have heard their rhymes; and you said a poet, but he is not a poet, for we have heard all kinds of poetry; you said he was possessed, but he is not for we have seen the possessed, and he shows no signs of their gasping and whispering and delirium. Oh men of Quraish, look to your affairs, for by Allah a serious thing has befallen you.*
&gt;
&gt; It is a well known fact that the Qur'an was revealed in seven ahruf (or seven forms) to facilitate greater understanding of it among the Arabs who had different dialects. This was also to challenge them on their own grounds to produce a surah like that of the Qur'an. The challenge became more obvious when none of the seven major tribes could imitate it even in their own dialects as no one could claim that it was difficult to imitate due to it not being in their own dialect.[6]

The people who hated him, wanted to kill him, refused to believe he had come up with any of it himself. Everyone who hates Islam now? Their ideological cousins from the 7th century attributed the Qur'an to sorcery/magic. The result? Everyone from within a 2000 mile radius of ""ground zero"" of this historical incident (one guy reciting one work) is now a Muslim (I'm exaggerating as the shape of the Muslim world isn't a circle and not everyone there is Muslim, obviously). That was humanity's historical reaction to it. They exhausted all other options until they came to the obvious one. That he was telling the truth.",1,True,t3_enord,0,False,c1bao17,

It gets better (I mean, this is really going to annoy you as this goes against your preconceived narrative),

&gt; Hamilton Gibb, an Arabist from the University of Oxford:
&gt;
&gt; Though, to be sure, the question of the literary merit is one not to be judged on a priori grounds but in relation to the genius of Arabic language; and no man in fifteen hundred years has ever played on that deep-toned instrument with such power, such boldness, and such range of emotional effect as Mohammad did.[9]
&gt;
&gt; As a literary monument the Koran thus stands by itself, a production unique to the Arabic literature, having neither forerunners nor successors in its own idiom. Muslims of all ages are united in proclaiming the inimitability not only of its contents but also of its style..... and in forcing the High Arabic idiom into the expression of new ranges of thought the Koran develops a bold and strikingly effective rhetorical prose in which all the resources of syntactical modulation are exploited with great freedom and originality.

.

&gt; The influence of the Koran on the development of Arabic Literature has been incalculable, and exerted in many directions. Its ideas, its language, its rhymes pervade all subsequent literary works in greater or lesser measure. Its specific linguistic features were not emulated, either in the chancery prose of the next century or in the later prose writings, **but it was at least partly due to the flexibility imparted by the Koran to the High Arabic idiom that the former could be so rapidly developed and adjusted to the new needs of the imperial government and an expanding society.**[11]

^ The Qur'an's language itself was necessary in part for the developments and advancements that the Muslims made.

Other non-Muslims who have actually done research on Islam (famous European scholar on Islam, Alfred Guillaume)

&gt; The Quran is one of the world's classics which cannot be translated without grave loss. It has a rhythm of peculiar beauty and a cadence that charms the ear. Many Christian Arabs speak of its style with warm admiration, and most Arabists acknowledge its excellence. When it is read aloud or recited it has an almost hypnotic effect that makes the listener indifferent to its sometimes strange syntax and its **sometimes, to us, repellent content.** It is this quality it possesses of silencing criticism by the sweet music of its language that has given birth to the dogma of its inimitability; indeed it may be affirmed that within the literature of the Arabs, wide and fecund as it is both in poetry and in elevated prose, there is nothing to compare with it.[12]

Even if he doesn't like the content or disagrees with it, he's able to give it the literary credit that it is due.

&gt; Holy text vs. Scientific advances: Guess which one gets altered and reinterpreted? Why do you think that is?

The Qur'an has not been altered. The only reason some parts of it get reinterpreted is due to the fault of the people making the initial interpretations in the first place. It comes down to you rejecting the Qur'an's origin. As Muslims see it, humans don't fully know the meanings of every single verse and as they come upon new knowledge, they reanalyze their interpretations in light of their new knowledge. This is implicit in accepting a divine origin for the Qur'an and your conclusion is implicit in rejecting it so let's not waste time with that.

Also, scientific theories are routinely updated or thrown out altogether. ""aether/ether"" was science once upon a time.

What I would like to bring up is that you assert Muhammad wrote the Qur'an. An impossible assertion to me. The Arabs of the time that he lived amongst were able to witness his comings and goings and realized he was just going home, then emerging with more verses periodically and wasn't secretly getting it from some author or writer somewhere (it wasn't even in written form until later). Later, people even witnessed him suddenly reciting new verses that had just been ""revealed"" to him and could see for themselves he wasn't getting them from somewhere. Muhammad went into his house. Nobody else followed him. Muhammad emerged. Muhammad read some more of the Qur'an. His house was relatively sparse and empty as well, he abandoned it when he fled to Medina after the Meccans' persecution. There's nothing, no other explanation for it. Either you claim an illiterate Arab wrote the work described above or you accept his claims or you refuse to accept his claims but offer none of your own (""I don't know"").

When taking all the historical evidence into account, and after having familiarized one's self with the Qur'an and its language... to say Muhammad authored the Qur'an is sillier than saying God didn't author it. After all, one cannot disprove the existence of God. But one can definitely rule out the possibility of that man coming up with this work. Of course, humans can say or believe in whatever they want to. Gibberish, if they feel like it. So you'll continue to reject it and insist Muhammad somehow came up with it. Despite everyone who actually knew Muhammad, including the Muslims who came afterwards, knowing Muhammad was not capable of such a feat. What is a Muslim? One definition could be, a person who learns all the history there is to learn on Muhammad, comes to realize Muhammad was just a guy... not capable of such a feat. He himself was inspired into transforming from an Arab merchant into this great leader by the message attributed to him.

&gt; I would argue that it wasn't at the time with regards various 'scientific' verses because what it said was ""widely known"" or ""accepted""?

I certainly agree that while there would have been some people at that time who would not have been surprised by a lot of the Qur'an's assertions, to imply that such knowledge was ""widely known"" or ""accepted"" is ridiculous and in flagrant ignorance of history. It's called ""making shit up"". But plenty of widely accepted Western historians exist and any sincere person would turn to them rather than make up their own version of history. Unless they're afraid of the truth.

&gt; I suspect you won't ever agree that some passages could, if taken literally, imply that the sun goes round the earth.

Sure they could. You could interpret almost anything you wanted from any text you wanted. How do you think people justify ridiculous stuff like suicide bombing? That's the nature of language. But what does your interpretation matter? Jack shit. You're just some guy on reddit.

What does the interpretation of Muhammad and the rest of the Muslim community matter? Quite a bit.

&gt; I doubt you'd let a Christian babble on about how certain passages about this or that should be interpreted so it makes their god and Jesus look correct when they were demonstrably wrong...

I would, first, refer to the generally accepted view of those texts by Christians themselves, as that would be the only honest way forward.

If there were any way to demonstrate that Christians were themselves wrong about the book they themselves wrote (well, most of it), then I'd do that next.

By the way, you haven't ""demonstrated"" the incorrectness of the popular interpretation of these verses nor have you demonstrated the correctness of yours. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

&gt; Or are those interpretations the wrong interpretations? Just so we know which interpretations can be scrapped now, even if they were used for years.

Fuck that. Give me specific cases and I'll try to address them (or you can post them in a new submission to /r/Islam because I don't have all the time in the world). You can Google for the rebuttals to all of those as well.

&gt; Please tell me you understand why I'm laughing now. Please oh please.

Yes. Because you're arrogant in your own lack of knowledge. You have **clearly demonstrated** a **complete** lack of knowledge of Islam, the Qur'an, or Islamic history. And you take **pride** in this ignorance and even laugh.

That is sad. So pathetic and sad. More of this new Western phenomenon which values ignorance over knowledge.

&gt; Wot no blasphemy ever?

There's been plenty of blasphemy, but talking about physics isn't considered blasphemy. Blasphemy is like insulting Muhammad.

&gt; I'm not a Christian. Never have been. Hardly anyone in my family is. I find it amusing that you seemed to have assumed I was, though.

No, I just attribute your culture and your values, to their proper roots. European Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church.

&gt; I wonder if Christian scientists ever did the same... I wonder I wonder.

The difference being the Christians in question (oh wait, you haven't mentioned any... more of that talking out of your ass thing) didn't come up with the *scientific method*. Ibn al-Haytham's credit only matters as much as he does, which is to say, quite a bit. If those Christian scientists had done anything worthwhile, theirs would matter too.

&gt; By the way, the interpretation of text that makes the claim that the moon revolves... hhhnrrrhhh not really true. It's tidally locked and the same side always faces earth... But feel free to interpret text how you want it to be interpreted.

Wikipedia,

&gt; The Moon is in synchronous rotation: it rotates about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit the Earth. This results in it nearly always keeping the same face turned towards the Earth. The Moon used to rotate at a faster rate, but early in its history, its rotation slowed and became locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by the Earth.

&gt;As their political power grew, both the Catholic Church and the Islamic Caliphate sought to conquer the entire Mediterranean area, culminating in the First Crusade (1095 B.C.E.). 

This statement is wrong on many levels, the Crusades were not intended to conquer the entire Mediterranean area, and I don't see how the struggle between Western Christendom and the various Muslim powers could be, in any meaningful sense, said to culminate in the First Crusade.

&gt;This political wrestling match, which would eventually spread throughout Europe and Asia, is directly responsible for the true ""Dark Ages"" which stretched though most of the High Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance.

What?  The 12th Century was a time of great intellectual development and creativity, as populations grew by leaps and bounds thanks to new farming methods and greater stability and the political situation in Europe became more settled in the wake of the end of external threats like the Vikings.  The birth of the university also occurred during this period.  In fact, the 12th century is almost universally referred to by historians as a renaissance of its own.

The Swedish central bank, Riksbanken, can influence the finance market in several ways. The most important one is by regulating the interest that other banks have to pay the central bank when they borrow money from the central bank. When the banks in turn borrow money to consumers, the interest rate will usually be the same as the central bank interest rate plus an additional margin based on the perceived risk of the loan plus a profit margin. In effect, the central bank controls the interest rates of most loans made in Sweden. This means they can cool down the economy when it is overheating by increasing the interest rate, and they can stimulate a slow economy by decreasing the interest rate. This is a rather crude instrument to regulate the economy, but still an effective one. 

Other countries have more or less the same system in place. The Euro zone share a single central bank. This means that in situations such as what we have today, where some countries are having a crisis while others are doing ok, the desired interest rates in the different countries of the Euro zone varies, something that the European central bank is simply unable to do.",1,True,t3_evdks,0,False,c1baudx,

I am American.  I am proud, and I love my country.  I am active duty AF.  My first duty station was right here in England.  I've been all over Europe.  My girlfriend is Hungarian.  All of these things have made me more of a patriot and more proud of my country than I was before I left, and there is good reason for that.  Let me finish before you downvote me.

I was thrilled to be in Europe.  Americans are many times too proud and annoyingly cocky about being such, but talk to most Americans about traveling to/living in Europe, and they would be chuffed to bits (thanks, Brits).

I have learned a lot more about myself and my country after coming here.  For the record, I disagree with most of our current conflicts as a military force.  However, I signed and said I'm willing to do something I might not necessarily want to in exchange for a bunch of benefits.  That's not because I couldn't cut it in the ""real world""; I simply didn't want to.  I found a ticket to stop paying $18,000/year for college, and a ticket to see the world.  When my family and friends back home tell me they are proud, I feel a sense of accomplishment.  When my family and friends back home thank me for my service, I wonder how much I am really serving them, per se.  Neither here, nor there.

Back on track.  I saw the attitude of other nations towards Americans first hand.  Good or bad (mostly good, lifelong friends), let's cast them aside.  The way of life is appealing.  Taxes are high as shit, but that's a price I would be willing to pay for my fellow Americans to reduce the cost of school and make sure EVERYONE has health care.

During the World Cup, it was a blast watching America succeed and fucking with some of the Englishmen I work with.  I also enjoyed making fun of my Hungarian girlfriend because we are better than them.  At the same time, I found myself identifying more with my German roots, which made it that much more fun.  Getting shithoused and watching soccer (yeah yeah, football) in the home of the sport was amazing.

I've traveled around and met people who were just as thrilled about meeting me as I was them.  It gave me a great sense of ""the world"" rather than a bunch of nations scattered on this big fucking marble.  The history that enriches these people and their sense of identity with their nations inspired me to see the good in America and what it means to me to be American.

What I love the most about being American is having every single nation to spend time with and every single climate to spend time in.  All nationalities.  The Grand Canyon, the Rocky Mountains, the southwest desert, the great plains, the Hawaiian volcanoes, the lush Californian land, the beautiful forests of the northwest, the winding Appalachian roads, the gorgeous Great Lakes (an area from which I hail), and even the sweaty armpit of the southeast (I love that weather, mind you).  As a military member, I truly will protect my nation from persecution (that probably isn't there anyway).

Letting in more immigrants could lead to several positive outcomes for Japan. It could bolster the anemic residential real estate market, whose poor performance has been a major drag on Japanese consumer confidence. Given the aging issue, more immigrants would reduce the per capita burden of supporting these geezers. 

* While linguistic competence is a fair requirement, the article suggests that Japanese industries apply punitive standards simply to stifle foreigners. In some cases, they are actively paying _ethnic Japanese_ to leave the country, a blatant case of value destruction. Immigrants often work in the medical industry here in Canada and there is no evidence that they are under-qualified versus Canadian peers and no practical reason, aside from xenophobia, that Japan couldn't accept more immigrants.

* Between 1990 and 2008, the Japanese labor force grew by a bit less than 3m. In the same time period, Canada's labor force grew by 4m and the US's by nearly 30m. Japan does have lower unemployment, but there isn't really a clearly ""right"" level of unemployment. Europe does fine with routine double digit unemployment. In Japan's case, low unemployment is less a result of immigration policy than an employment culture which idolizes staying in one job your entire life. Looking at some economic research, it is easily conceivable that more unemployment is a worthwhile tradeoff for laborers searching for jobs they like. 

&gt;When the economy sucks, it's hard to argue that the country needs more people filling out applications for dwindling jobs

Immigrants come with a mouth, too. It's not like all they will do is work and not spend. Given Japan's deflationary environment, a declining population can lead to (reasonable) expectations that assets like real estate will decline and incentivize hoarding yen in low interest savings accounts. Look at these villages in Japan where there are next to zero children, who in their right mind would invest there?

It doesn't matter what we do - throw a trillion dollars at the problem but the reality is that they weren't ready for Western style civilization. They would've created their own version of it and they had their tribal existence of horticulture/pastoralism that was working fine. It's just difficult to imagine b/c we've grown up in the system but it's not easy to adjust to nor should it be.

Also, the demo of Haiti and the DR aren't the same. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Haiti - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic#Demographics and I think that account their differing success rates.

But you just said it would be suboptimal. Are you retracting that claim?

&gt;In all fairness, though, you started out by saying [etc] So the original assertion comes from you, not me.

I never said anything about the _goodness_ or _badness_ of a global government. I never said anything about a global government at all. I simply said that the main point of the EU is to converge policy amongst member states. That is the entire reason it exists, and has been since day one. If it is going to allow member states to make their own divergent policies, then it is a pointless entity.

&gt;As for my reasons for strongly believing that a single unified world government is bad; Monopolies are bad.

Well a representative government is not really the same as a monopoly corporation. Your analysis seems simplistic, and has not really addressed any of the issues regarding the 'fairness' that would arise from having some global congruence in certain areas of the law, particularly labour and tax law.

&gt;They breed corruption, inefficiency and waste.

This is just an emotional statement. We can find examples of corruption, inefficiency and waste in monopolies and populated markets; we can find them in government and we can find them in private enterprise. There is no evidence to suggest that these phenomena are guaranteed to be more pervasive in a monopoly or a competitive organisation; a government department or a multinational corporation.

It would be safer to say this: _lack of accountability_ creates opportunities for corruption, inefficiency and waste. We simply need to ensure that any global government is accountable to each member state, and each member state is in turn accountable to its citizens.

&gt;If there is only one government, there is no competition and the market stagnates.

There would not be one government. There would be one _global_ government, which would sit atop many _regional_ governments, and so forth. The structure could be quite devolved, and I suspect that is the form which states and their citizens would prefer. Sub-global governments would definitely be able to compete for citizens by providing better quality of life subject to some global minimum standards regarding medical care, pension provision, labour regulation and so forth.

&gt;In what way to you feel that saying that a free market thrives on choice is vague?

What is a free market, for starters? I hear the term thrown about a lot on reddit, but I don't think such a thing has ever existed in reality. It is as mythical as a unicorn as far as I am concerned.

Furthermore: as I pointed out, there would still be plenty of scope for regions to compete for citizens. There would just be a new global tax code and labour law, among other things.

&gt;Can you show common, relevant situations where limiting freedom and choice makes the market thrive?

I have asked you to justify your statements and your response has been to ask me to disprove them. How is that going to convince anyone of the veracity of your argument?

&gt;If some countries are rich and some are poor, and if people are completely free to move from one country to another, then people will tend to move and find jobs in richer countries, and thereby improve their standard of living.

So you are suggesting that subsistence farmers in Ethiopia should simply relocate to the United States and then everything will be fine? I'm sure you can see the problems with this idea. There are costs involved with relocation which most of the world's population simply cannot bear, given that they live on a dollar or two a day. This is before we even consider immigration restrictions.

&gt;Lastly, why are you certain that a single government can figure out by itself what the best way to spend tax money on e.g. medical care?

I never made that claim. I think the functions should stay devolved, just like they are in the EU. The global government would simply provide standards and norms, and it would be the responsibility of sub-global governments to implement the functions. The lower the level of the government doing the implementation, the more likely it is to meet the specific needs of that region.

&gt;Doesn't it sound more likely that if different countries try out different strategies, that a conclusion can be drawn significantly quicker?

You are assuming that this would not be possible under a global government. Bear in mind that states would still be able to pass their own laws. It would only be after a law had been passed at a global level that it would apply to all states. Prior to such an occurrence, each state would be able to pursue healthcare in whatever fashion they desired, as is the case in the EU today where there is a big difference between the Swiss, German and British/Swedish/etc approach because the EU itself does not have much to say about the specifics of how healthcare functions should be implemented.",1,True,t3_evdks,0,False,c1bb8rh,

Originally written in USA, because that is the standard way networks work with animations. The scripts were too serious though, and the Kiwi crews refused to work with them, so rewrote them to a more ""Kiwi"" humour. If American Audiences did not like them, why did Zena topple Baywatch as the number one US TV show? Unfortunately, no New Zealand production company could independently make their own show and have a US network buy it. If you want, I could continue.

&gt;What backlash are you talking about?

The East–West Schism in the Christian Church, which would eventually form the Catholic and Orthodox branches, was already a growing political reality by 1000. Aside from the doctrinal differences (which were plenty enough), it was the political disputes that caused the most problems. Specifically, the Church theologians in Rome believed that the Church required a single leader (which would, of course, be the Roman Bishop), while other branches (especially in Greece) argued that all Bishops held the same authority. In fact, Pope Sylvester II (The so-called 'Scientist Pope"" in this book) was *officially* (read:doctrinally) no more powerful than the Bishop in Antioch. However, because Rome was the center of the empire, Roman Bishops (or Popes) held much more political power than their Eastern counterparts.

This all worked **against** Sylvester II, who was actively and enthusiastically working with Eastern teachers and Muslim clerics. He was vilified by his enemies (often referred to as the Sorcerer Pope or some such nonsense) and was expelled along with the Roman Emperor in 1002 (I had to look up that date).

Following Sylvester II was a long string of Popes who were appointed by the ruling families in Rome. They were political pawns and quite useless as religious leaders. The Church in Rome was essentially under the control of the Roman government for the next 50 years (Pope Benedict VIII wasn't even a clergyman when he was installed as Pope, instead was picked because he was from a ruling Roman family. Also, Pope Benedict IX who has the special distinction of being the only man to serve as Pope 3 times... I digress).

&gt;...to culminate in the First Crusade.

You're right, I chose the wrong wording. I might have better said, ""the first major campaign of which was the First Crusade.""

Although, I wholeheartedly dispute the notion that political powers in Europe and Asia weren't trying to control the whole of the Mediterranean (Jerusalem is an eastern Mediterranean city). That's just established fact.

&gt;The 12th Century was a time of great intellectual development and creativity…

While true that the High Middle Ages included some structural advancements, by the 12th Century, the Catholic Church had inescapably fused with the political powers. Money was funneled through the aristocracy almost exclusively, leaving the general populace destitute and floundering.

In fact, in the so-called ""Renaissance"" of the 12th century, universities were created for the express purpose of translating and teaching **previously written** Greek and Eastern writings. Let alone the fact that the universities were exclusive to the ruling classes, the ""Renaissance"" was simply re-instilling the teachings that Sylvester II already knew. Put in modern terms, it would be like finding a dictionary from 1811, then basing your entire educational structure in 2011 on its translation. That sucks.

I know some historians have a soft spot for the 12th century, but it wasn't a time of *advancement,* more a time of *realignment.*

Also, and it feels odd that I must mention it, but the High Middle Ages included constant debilitating outbreaks of every conceivable kind of plague, including the Black Death. The universities were a great place for hiding from rats, but the ""science"" of the time was useless if you were an average citizen.

&gt;Completely and totally untrue.

Actually, not. But I'm not sure to what specifically you're referring. By the end of the ""Dark Ages"" (and I've been putting it in quotes deliberately), there was no separation of the Church and the State (neither codified nor in practice). By the time the true Renaissance rolled around, the Church was actively and enthusiastically stifling scientific advancement. Galileo lived **200 years** after the general beginning of the Renaissance, and look how the Catholic Church treated *his* teachings.

Because the Catholic Church was both the most powerful ecclesiastical organization **and** the most powerful *political* organization, they were committed to controlling as much information as possible. When new information contradicted its teachings, it was outlawed, ignored, or destroyed. Sylvester II was a controversial enough figure during his own lifetime. He would never have been given any kind of position of leadership in the Church of the late Middle ages.

You are mistaking, or you just don't want to understand. Fidesz is not Jobbik. Fidesz is the governing party, Jobbik is a radical opposition party, Jobbik is for segregation, anti-semitism, whatever. Fidesz is the governing center-right party, which promised that there won't be any more economic stresses on the population. Fidesz is not anti-semitic, and is not segregating the Roma. Fidesz was the first, and is right now the only party who has an ethnic Roma representative in the EU parliament. You just have to understand finally, that those are two different parties, even their voter base is different. Actually, the anti-semite Jobbik took more votes away from MSZP (the socialists) than from any other party. 

Since the election promise of Fidesz was that there won't be any austerity measures for the population, they are taxing the corporations. You can argue the viability of that, but if you look at Greece or Romania, you can see what disastrous effect prolonged austerity measures have on morale of the population. People rioting on the streets, while bankers live luxury lives on bonuses. The Hungarian government choose rather to tax those extra-profits, banks and corporations, so the bonuses will be a bit less for them. Yes they make a lot of enemies.

Even the founding fathers did things like build roads, build bridges and created banks in the first 10 congresses of US history.

Moreover, the US, like many Western nations, began creating a welfare state in the 20th century. While the constitutionality of such actions in a US context is debatable (""general welfare"" is in the constitution) the founding fathers did not create ""small government"" in opposition to European welfare states, but European dictatorships. ""Limited government"" in the 18th century was not government without a welfare state, but government that did not abuse its power and harm its own citizens.

Minarchism is thus a *radical new ideology*, while a welfare state has *been around for over century*.

So when conservatives begin to espouse minarchism and thus oppose any form of government program not related to law enforcement, military and legal system, they are promoting a system of government that not even Ronald Reagan believed in.

So from my pov, minarchists are radical. Centre-right conservatives (of which there are none) should provide an alternative form of conservatism that still sees room for important government programs.

&gt;They were political pawns and quite useless as religious leaders. 

That's ridiculous.  Was Urban II an imporant religious leader?

&gt;The Church in Rome was essentially under the control of the Roman government for the next 50 years

Really?  that's odd, because all the contemporary documents talk about liberating the Holy Land, which is why most of the crusaders packed up and went home once they captured Jerusalem.  I have no doubt that the leaders of the various powers in the 12th century would have been happy to control the entire Mediterranean (who wouldn't), but they were well aware that such a control would be effectively impossible.  

&gt;While true that the High Middle Ages included some structural advancements, by the 12th Century, the Catholic Church had inescapably fused with the political powers. 

Um, that had happened by the fourth century.  The idea of a distinction between the religious sphere and the political sphere is an entirely modern idea.  Moreover, the Church regularly found itself in conflict with the dominant political powers, most notable during the Investiture Controversy.  I'd argue that the period in question actually saw the rising independence of the Church from the (to use an anachronistic term) states of the period, from the height of their unity in the Carolingian empire.

&gt;In fact, in the so-called ""Renaissance"" of the 12th century, universities were created for the express purpose of translating and teaching previously written Greek and Eastern writings.

That's not what the university was created for, and universities generally emerged after the 12th century.  The Renaissance of the 12th century was generally centered around cathedral schools such as Chartres, and occurred prior to the re-introduction of Aristotelian texts.  The most important texts were platonic, and had been in circulation for centuries.

&gt;I know some historians have a soft spot for the 12th century, but it wasn't a time of advancement, more a time of realignment.

So, improvement in farming methods, developments in philosophy and theology, the beginnings of the emergence of nations, the increased urbanization of Europe, the development of trade networks that stretched far into the east, and, the creation of the university, were all simply ""realignments"" not advancements?

&gt;Also, and it feels odd that I must mention it, but the High Middle Ages included constant debilitating outbreaks of every conceivable kind of plague, including the Black Death. The universities were a great place for hiding from rats, but the ""science"" of the time was useless if you were an average citizen.

Is your point that because the people of the 12th century hadn't developed the germ theory of disease and penicillin that it was a dark age and no intellectual development was going on?  You are aware that plagues have been a perennial problem in human history, especially as people become more urbanized and trade networks develop, such as they did during the period in question?

&gt;there was no separation of the Church and the State 

There was also no internet or modern nation states.  Weird, it's almost like those things developed later in human history.

&gt;By the time the true Renaissance rolled around, the Church was actively and enthusiastically stifling scientific advancement. 

Really? give examples.

&gt;Galileo lived 200 years after the general beginning of the Renaissance, and look how the Catholic Church treated his teachings.

I didn't downvote you I haven't been online since 8 am.  

&gt;Not every ""ghetto"" is identical and not every race sticks to the stereotypes you seem to be so fond of.



Where did I ever make that statement?  


&gt;Get off your high-horse, you're not The King of The Ghetto. In fact, you seem like a self-righteous kid who is hating on someone just because they had a different experience than you.


I'm not on a high horse and I certaintly don't consider myself King of the Ghetto, or anything else considering I am a girl.  If there was any ounce of evidence that the dude experienced those things, I would take it and say shit happens.   The major tip off that he probably hasn't spent much time in American ghettos (especially considering most redditors haven't) might be the fact that he spells color as colour so I'm assuming he's European or Austailian.  If I'm wrong I stand corrected.    Shit I cross my 7's so who knows.  And I'm happy for him to point out specifics.  But he didn't.  he made a very general statement that is largely untrue.

&gt;PS- your edit said ""downvote me all you want, this is the truth"". Are you aware that the topic you're speaking on is an entirely subjective one? There is no ""truth"" when speaking about how we all grew up differently (in the ghetto, in a mansion, it doesn't matter- every situation is unique), so I have no idea what you were referring to there.



What about my statement was subjective?  I spoke about my personal experiences saying ""where I lived"" and ""when this happened this also happened"".  The only place I didn't was when I said ""you'll find in the ghetto this"".  That was general and it might be a very very different experience in different cities.  but this has been my general experience in multiple places


&gt;My question to you: how is your post any more ""truthful"" than the one you were replying to? Why did you have to be such a condescending prick, especially whilst talking about something such as ""the ghetto"".


Again he made a very general statement and at least I was talking about things that came from my experience.  I also said the way he presents it is bullshit.  His post made it sound as though because you are white v. black in the ghetto you are very disadvantaged in comparison.  Both groups have access to different benefits sometimes.  No, a white person won't be able to apply for a minority scholarship.  But a black person also doesn't have the extra ""kick"" in an application of saying ""I'm a white person who grew up in the ghetto"".  It gives college applications, etc. an interesting angle.

I'd love to know about these other benefits.  Mainly the reason I responded the way I did is because I'm sick of hearing this over and over and over again usually coming from people who have very little experience with the life they are talking about.  I could be totally wrong about the dude, and if I am I apologize and would love to hear his personal experiences",0,True,t3_evbtn,0,False,c1bbjh3,

short answer to your actual question:  no it does not.   sex is important in a relationship and marrying someone without such a key ingredient is a foolish thing to do.  it's like you've only had half a relationship and then once you're married, you add the other half and expect it to be ok.  some people it works out for and others it does not.  why take the chance of having to deal with that plus the normal ups and downs of any relationship when you don't have to?",3,True,t3_evni2,0,False,c1bbjow,

You cannot learn lab procedures from a  book. You simply cannot.

I'm not assuming, I *know*.

I mean, if you want to do some kindergarten level ""experiments"" by all means... teach yourself, but big boy toys are *expensive*


&gt; Don't assume you can't get experience without universities. A lot of the best self-taught people build their own materials, similar to how Wozniak built the PC - every circuit built by him. Just like Tesla built much of his own stuff, etc.

See? You're funny. You're taking decades old technology and comparing it to *the present*. Could you build a thermal cycler? Can you build an electron microscope?

I'm well familiar with making my own materials for field science - but even making those were expensive and had to be done with grants..not to mention development time.

&gt; I expect modern European colleges to have more lab testing. I already said this.. For chemistry, I agree lab work is important, **however I'm not sold on the idea that physics ""labs"" are super important.**

Yea, that LHC sure isn't important at all.

Fidesz Member of Parliament, Oszkár Molnár said: ""I love Hungary, I love Hungarians, and I prefer Hungarian interests to global financial capital, or Jewish capital, if you like, which wants to devour the whole world, but especially Hungary."" He claimed that the language of instruction in Jerusalem schools was Hungarian, and said they were ""learning the language of their future homeland."" His party at the time, Fidesz, did not denounce his statement but simply said it was ""embarrassing."" Adding that he would not even consider ousting Molnar from his party or parliamentary faction, as the remark ""did not violate the party's bylaws.""[4] He also said that pregnant Roma women deliberately try to induce birth defects so they can give birth to ""fools to receive higher family subsidies. I have checked this and it’s true; they hit their bellies with a rubber hammer so that they’ll give birth to handicapped kids.""

This may not be the official party position, because they would lose ALL credibility in Europe if they said that out loud, but still... that is pretty fucking crazy. And I seriously dispute that Fidesz is merely center-right. Compared to French, German and British center-rights parties (UMP, CDU, Torys) these guys are pretty much the definition of right-wing, whereas jobbik is far beyond the realm of being ""wing"".
To have an ethnic Roma representative doesn't free you from anything. There is a secret segregation going on (that's only secret in the sense that nobody is really upset about it in Europe). Granted, that started before they took power, but they are not changing it, right? Their rethoric concerning Roma is harsh, even harsher than Sarkozys, as they are following the talking points that jobbik and the hungarian guard created about the Roma. Criminals? Correct me if I'm wrong. That's what I got out of the coverage about the election campaign last year.

Concerning austerity measures: YES, I agree! I absolutely agree with that. Don't let the population pay the price when big business fucked it up. I really have no problem at all with that. It's totally unclear if this will cost you jobs, but okay, it's worth a try. --- As long as these measures are not based on the world view of someone like that Molnar. And I still have my doubts about that.

EDIT: And I wanted to say thank you for talking this out with me. I can imagine that it is frustrating to explain things to a guy who is sitting two thousand kilometers away acting as if he would know shit about your country.

&gt;Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan. 

&gt;(namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.)

Planning to bomb civilian areas with foreknowledge that you will thereby kill large numbers of civilians is a war crime. 

It's ironic that this law was enacted principally for the prosecution of Nazis in their mistreatment of Jewish people in WW2. The crime committed by Nazis in WW2 is principally the same crime here conspiring to be committed by Jewish people in Nazi like behavior.
