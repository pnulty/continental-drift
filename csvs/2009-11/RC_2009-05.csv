Not according to the [Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031). Iran is ranked 166th out of 173 countries in the latest index; only China, Vietnam, Cuba, Burma, Turkmenistan, North Korea, and Eritrea have less media freedom.

By comparison, Israel is ranked 46th within its own territory. It does have a problem in the Occupied Territories, where it ranks 149th, but even that's better than Iran. I think it really speaks poorly of Iran that in spite of all the repression involved in Israel's occupation of the Palestinians, Israel still does a better job respecting press freedom in the Palestinian Territories than Iran does in its own territory.

From the [Reporters Without Borders 2008 Iran Annual Report](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=25431):

&gt; Iran’s leaders still accuse the independent media of being in the pay of the United States or the European Union, which has resulted in long prison terms for journalists from a cowed and complicit judiciary. Reporters based in Teheran and Kurdistan were targeted in 2007, with dozens of arrests, convictions and closures of newspapers.

&gt; ...

&gt; More than 50 journalists were prosecuted in 2007 and the independent and opposition media were targets of the usual financial and bureaucratic harassment. The ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, which is responsible for the media, ordered at least four publications to shut down permanently. A dozen papers, including the well-known Shargh and Madaresseh, were temporarily closed pending a court decision and news websites were also targeted. Iran has the biggest number of threatened cyber-dissidents in the Middle East and dozens of websites are shut down each year.

From the [Reporters Without Borders 2008 Israel Annual Report](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=25434):

I am married to Sir Gerald White who worked with British Judicial Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2005. We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of £4 Million (Four Million Pounds sterling) with one Finance/Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 4 months due to a rare form of cancer of the pancreas. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.Hence, the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty. I would not be allowed to take any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,doctor's instructions and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Europe.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I implore you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation.Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth.Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose.Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein.

&gt;The Spanish flu caused an unusual number of deaths because it may have caused a cytokine storm in the body.[7][8] (The recent epidemic of bird flu, also an Influenza A virus, had a similar effect.)[9] The Spanish flu virus infected lung cells, leading to overstimulation of the immune system via release of cytokines into the lung tissue. This leads to extensive leukocyte migration towards the lungs, causing destruction of lung tissue and secretion of liquid into the organ. This makes it difficult for the patient to breathe. **In contrast to other pandemics, which mostly kill the old and the very young, the 1918 pandemic killed unusual numbers of young adults, which may have been due to their healthy immune systems being able to mount a very strong and damaging response to the infection.[5]**

http://1918.pandemicflu.gov/the_pandemic/01.htm

&gt;In 1918, the Public Health Service had just begun to require state and local health departments to provide them with reports about diseases in their communities. The problem? Influenza wasn’t a reportable disease.

&gt;But in early March of 1918, officials in Haskell County in Kansas sent a worrisome report to the Public Health Service. Although these officials knew that influenza was not a reportable disease, they wanted the federal government to know that “18 cases of influenza of a severe type” had been reported there.

&gt;By May, reports of severe influenza trickled in from Europe. **Young soldiers, men in the prime of life, were becoming ill in large numbers. Most of these men recovered quickly but some developed a secondary pneumonia of “a most virulent and deadly type.”** (Emphasis mine)

If you click on the Age-specific death rates for the 1918 flu pandemic compared to a normal year of the flu, you'll notice that there is a major spike in the deaths of people from the age of 10 to about 40, whereas such a thing doesn't happen during normal flu seasons.

Here's what you haven't gripped yet: 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/AntigenicShift_HiRes.png

Antigenic shift is a way that viruses recombine their DNA with other viruses or cells to form new strains. This doesn't usually do anything, but viruses can have a lucky mutation that significantly increases the mortality rate, and like the 1918 flu pandemic, even though the first wave might seem mild and nothing to worry about, a mutation into a more severe form in the coming months could be the tipping point.

http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17025-deadly-new-flu-virus-in-us-and-mexico-may-go-pandemic.html

&gt;Ironically, after years of concern about H5N1 bird flu, the new flu causing concern is a pig virus, of a family known as H1N1.

&gt;Flu viruses are named after the two main proteins on their surfaces, abbreviated H and N. They are also differentiated by what animal they usually infect. **The H in the new virus comes from pigs, but some of its other genes come from bird and human flu viruses, a mixture that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls ""very unusual"".**

Also, from a 2005 article:

&gt;Scientists reconstruct 1918 flu virus for potential future pandemic

&gt;LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5 (Xinhua)-- Scientists have partially reconstructed for the first time the Spanish flu virus that killed 20 to 50 million people worldwide in year 1918, and discovered why the virus could be so lethal.

&gt;This finding, appearing in the Oct. 7 issue of the journal Science, will provide essential information for flu drug and vaccine research, and help contain a potential flu pandemic in the future, experts said on Wednesday.

&gt;**The Spanish flu virus is more closely related to avian flu viruses than other human flu viruses. Scientists have predicted that it is only a matter of time before an avian flu outbreak occurs in humans and develops into a global pandemic.** ",True,t1_c098w7d,3,c098wez,1425962803,1241161784,t1_c098wez,0,True,t3_8grc2,t5_mouw

Tanaiste Concludes Successful Enterprise Ireland Mission to Saudi Arabia and Qatar
Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary Coughlan TD, today (Thursday 30th April 2009), concluded the Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission to Saudi Arabia and Qatar by opening the new Qatar Head Office of the Kentz Group and holding a series of high level meetings at the Qatari Science and Technology Park, the Ministry of Municipalities (Public Works), and Qatari Diar Real Estate and Investment Company. The week long Mission visited Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Doha in Qatar.
The 64 companies on the Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission participated in c. 1,500 one-to-one and sectoral group meetings with existing and potential customers. The majority of these were first time introductions particularly in the engineering, project management and environmental services sectors related to the construction industry and many of the Irish companies were called back for follow-on meetings. A number of companies and organisations made announcements of agreements reached during the mission including the PM Group, Tetco-Voxpilot, Norkom Technologies and the Institutes of Technology in Athlone, Galway-Mayo, and Waterford.
Speaking at the end of the Trade Mission the Tanaiste said: ""The Gulf region is a vibrant part of the world with substantial opportunities for our internationally traded services companies. The Governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are investing heavily in future proofing their economies in areas like physical infrastructure, the environment and communications. And they are open to working with overseas companies and consortia that can contribute to the realisation of their ambitious plans. The proposition put forward by our companies is value added expertise, products and services, with built-in flexibility and, above all, value for money. The clear message to global markets is Ireland is open for business and Irish companies are coming to talk to you about how they can contribute to your success"".
According to Frank Ryan, Chief Executive Officer, Enterprise Ireland: ""Our client companies continue to demonstrate an unstinting commitment to the development of new market opportunities for their international growth while consolidating and deepening their relationships with existing customers in their more established markets. For many of the companies on this Trade Mission it is a first step and a major milestone in what will be a long term investment in their future success here.

The initial philosophy major was simply because ""declare a major"" day came and I had to pick something.  I was taking some eastern religions and greek and roman philosophy classes at the time, along with a formal logic class and some public speaking, so it was a plausible narrative.

I'm a big fan of some of Cicero's stuff, although I admit it's been nearly a decade since I sat down to read any of it.  I'm a firm believer that society has a duty to the individual and the individual has a duty to society, joint and several.  That may be how I ended up switching to polysci.  I had dreams of becoming a politician or a teacher or a lawyer. 

Philosophy seemed too abstract and polysci seemed like a better foundation for what I wanted to do so I switched.  My main focuses there were on urban education and political dynamics, constitutional law and the american/european political process along with a bit of study on how stuff gets done in India.

At the time, the Maastrict Treaty had just been signed, the SPD was running Germany and the Bill Clinton/Republican Revolution fiasco had completely stalled the US political system and school shootings seemed like a daily occurrence.  There was a lot to think about.

All that was really interesting, but still seemed too abstract to spend the rest of my life working on.  As much as I enjoy arguing here, I can turn off the computer.  You can't really turn off politics or a teaching career.

I have been to Europe. I was born in Germany, and I can tell you my family on that side of the sea doesn't live nearly the lavish life style we get to afford here. The tax rate is so high people have a tendency to do under the table work. My uncle for example paints houses on the side and makes a shit ton doing it because half his check didn't go to the government. A single plot suburban style house is approaching the millionaire range, something almost every American can get far cheaper. 

Your main complaint lodged at republicans seems to be the idea that they redistribute wealth into the hands of the wealthy. The democrats are going to redistribute wealth too. 

Here is the problem. Wealth redistribution is not a neutral activity. If the poor receive the fruits of others labor in the form of welfare, society as a whole becomes less productive, these people lose incentive to work and in most cases they stop looking for employment all together. If we soak the rich, they hide their money or flee the country in favor of a government that isn't going to steal from them. As a result the tax burden will fall more on the middle class. 

This country has been so divided by these political parties its sickening. The result is that we both lose. In my personal opinion, democrat and republican parties both have terrible policies, policies that benefit those in power. We align ourselves with a democrat because we are liberal, or with a republican because we are conservative, but rarely do you hear of conservative democrats. People are making their choices not based on the policies but on their personal feelings about other topics that most the time shouldn't even be discussed. For example gay marriage. It shouldn't be a polarized political issue because government shouldn't be involved in people getting married. That's a freedom that should be left to the people.

Again, we need not tarry on our devotion to this principle. Furthermore, ""Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.""

These rights are indeed granted in the United States in the sense that no law explicitly denies them. Rather, social and political arrangements, some legal, some rooted in vast discrepancies of private power, prevent these rights from being exercised. Labor's political victories in the mid-30s sent a chill through the business community, which saw its dominance over social and political life threatened as the U.S. was dragged into the modern world. A strong counteroffensive, delayed briefly by the war, reversed these gains. By the 1980s, the US was well off the international spectrum once again, to the extent that the International Labor Organization, which rarely has an unkind word for its paymasters, took up an AFL-CIO complaint about the use of strikebreakers and recommended that the U.S. act to conform to international standards. Apart from South Africa, no other industrial country tolerates these methods to ensure that the Universal Declaration will remain empty words.

Firing of strikers is only a minor element of the array of devices that have been deployed to deny labor rights, a campaign in which the mass media have played a shameful role. The effects are vividly seen in North Carolina, which ""boasts of having the lowest unionization rate in the country,"" Toronto Star reporter Linda Diebel observes in a study of ""right-to-work laws"" -- Newspeak for ""effectively impossible to organize laws"" -- and other measures to improve the investment climate (June 6, 1993). The issue is of great concern to Canada, which is watching jobs flee to southern states of the U.S. as wages are driven down by policies designed to convert the rich countries themselves into two-tiered societies on the Third World model, with islands of extreme wealth and privilege in a growing sea of misery. The average manufacturing wage in North Carolina is well below Canada's, Diebel reports, while ""health and safety provisions are bare-bones and are under continuous assault.""

Much like the Third World, North Carolina advertises ""low taxes, lax regulations, minimal worker compensation and cheap, productive workers."" In their anti-union passion, North Carolina business leaders campaigned to prevent United Aircraft from setting up a repair operation, because, as the Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported, ""the arrival of thousands of unionized workers would damage North Carolina's status as one of the nation's least unionized states and possibly blunt the state's efforts to attract other companies looking for low-cost labor."" A union district manager observes that ""It's very difficult to go on strike in North Carolina. You'd be better off in Eastern Europe. There is no protection for striking workers whatsoever.""

So much for Article 23.

The U.S. and the West generally have forged a concept of human rights that dismisses the social and economic provisions of the Universal Declaration as mere rhetoric. Henry Shue observes that abstract liberal theory, which assumes the subsistence problem to have been met, excludes ""no fewer"" than 1 billion people -- actually far more (Basic Rights, 1980, p. 183). The ""dirty dozen"" make a different selection, and are justly condemned for denying the universality of certain rights. Given the overwhelming dominance of the West in every domain, including control over the norms of Political Correctness, the Western concept of ""what counts"" prevails. Representatives of Venezuela, not one of the ""dirty dozen,"" observed that ""the proposals tabled by the countries of the South, such as the right to development, the effects of the foreign debt, the war on poverty, child protection and the defense of indigenous communities, had provoked strong opposition from the North"" (IPS, June 4, 1993), though they fall under the Universal Declaration.

The selective eye of the West picks out just those rights that benefit the rich and powerful: Freedom of speech is of great value to those who can use it to achieve their ends, confident that unwanted thought will be marginalized and the mass of the population left effectively voiceless. For similar reasons, the privileged insist upon political rights. The social and economic rights of the Universal Declaration are peripheral concerns for those whose wealth and privilege guarantees them these amenities, and who profit from the denial of the rights to others. Accordingly, the West adamantly rejects the universality of the Universal Declaration. For the poor and suffering, all of these rights are values to be treasured, but they scarcely enter the debate, or commentary on it.

These crucially important facts are not completely suppressed. Thus Sciolino notes that the Administration will ""press for Senate ratification of four treaties -- to eliminate racial discrimination and discrimination against women, to protect the economic rights of the poor and to codify basic human rights and duties."" The comment tacitly concedes that the U.S. does not observe the Universal Declaration. Note that mere ratification of treaties, even if achieved, would still fall short of the action required to ensure that ""basic human rights"" are protected, in accord with the Universal Declaration.

Adequate press coverage would have gone further, noting the repeated refusal of the United States to accept UN human rights covenants. Thus the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Political Rights, among others, was submitted to Congress for ratification with the express stipulation that it would be ""non self-executing,"" that is, unenforceable in the U.S., so that ratification ""would have only symbolic and not legal significance"" (Wronka). The U.S. Senate made the same stipulation in considering the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ""in part so as not to invalidate the Supreme Court decision"" that permits corporal punishment in schools (Wronka).

Let's have a further look at Warren Christopher, the gallant defender of the universality of human rights. Sciolino reports that he condemned ""the world's aggressors and those who encourage the spread of arms."" It is too much to ask an American intellectual to consider how Washington ranks among ""the world's aggressors"" -- say, in the period from the attack against South Vietnam over 30 years ago to Panama, in celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. But who is the world's leading arms merchant, by a huge margin? How can one write these words, without cringing?

And how can a reporter blandly refer to Christopher's work ""promoting human rights"" under the Carter Administration? Recall that Haitians were then fleeing from the terror of Washington's friend Baby Doc, hence unqualified for political asylum and barred from our shores, deported, and harshly treated (if they did not die at sea). Or recall 1978, when the spokesman for the ""dirty dozen,"" Indonesia, was running out of arms in its attack against East Timor, then approaching truly genocidal levels -- so that the Carter Administration had to rush new armaments to its bloodthirsty friend. Or 1979, when the Administration sought desperately to keep Somoza's National Guard in power after it had slaughtered some 40,000 civilians, finally evacuating commanders in planes disguised with Red Cross markings (a war crime) and reconstituting them as a terrorist force on the border under the direction of Argentine neo-Nazis. Or take Iran, where the Administration sought to foist useless high-tech arms on another favored torturer, assuring the Shah that there would be ""no linkage"" between arms sales and human rights. Or Wilmington North Carolina, where prison terms of 282 years were imposed on Ben Chavis and other civil rights activists in a fraud that was an international scandal, but the Administration declared itself unable to utter a word.

Needless to say, we cannot dream of the day when someone in the media might discover the studies by Edward Herman and Latin American scholar Lars Schoultz that demonstrate the close correlation between U.S. aid and torture, running right through the Carter years, including military aid and independent of need, studies that would be pointless to undertake as Jeane Kirkpatrick, George Shultz, Elliott Abrams and the rest of that merry crew took the reins.

&gt;&gt;Wow, if you think the illegality of prostitution is barbaric (and not even in all states I might add) (and it's a law susceptible to change by popular pressure), I can't imagine that you think of acid baths for adultery. Do you honestly draw a moral equivalency between the two?

What you fail to see is that one thing is against the law the other is a bizarro crime done by religious nutjobs. One is state law mandated by a theocratic state (the US) and the other is pure religious nutjobbery. 

&gt;The US is a theocracy

&gt;&gt;Bold claim. Sensationalistic. We have no national church. We follow no one religion. We have the bill of rights, not the ten commandments enshrined in our courthouses. Several of our founding fathers detested the religion you claim inspires this country. Please be serious.

The US started out as a secular state. I'll grant you that. That's why we have legal documents like the Bill of Rights and Constitution. But those documents are rarely followed by our law and courts. For example, when was the last time Congress declared war? If near 100% of our elected representatives being self-identified Christians isn't a theocracy, then what is? YOU please be serious. 

&gt;&gt;As for freedom of speech, there is no such thing. Even in the US, there are limits.

&gt;As to my knowledge we've never outlawed criticism, satire, mockery, or general disrespect. Let's be honest here, that's what we're talking about with this anti-defamation stuff. If you think having exceptions to freedom of speech constitutes a complete dismissal of it, then at least admit that there is a right to freely criticize people, and that, at least, we've tried to uphold and they're trying to destroy.

I'm not sure why you're trying to change the discussion to ""criticism"". Freedom of speech and freedom of criticism are different things. When it comes to ""criticism"" the US media fails time and again. ""The Daily Show"" is basically built around this fact. And before you tell me The Daily Show proves free criticism is alive and well in the US, the only reason they can do what they do is because it's a ""comedy"" show on a comedy network, ostensibly spinning trivial yuks. 

&gt;&gt;Is changing speech laws in favor of a political group somehow indicative of that group gathering political power? Yes. Is this something we should be afraid of? Obviously not since religious fundamentalists have had their way in the US for many decades and it seems to be working out.

&gt;They haven't, thank god. We Americans, for all of our faults, have the good sense to be terrified of a mad pentecostal woman in our highest office. We have had the sense to keep religion out of schools, for a few decades now. Divorce is legal, adultery is unpunishable, barely anyone in our damn country even knows the ten commandments. We are a far cry from fundamentalist rule (to put it mildly).

&gt;Things would not have just 'worked out' in America if people were okay with fundamentalist Christianity. Imagine required church attendance, religion classes in public schools, national prayer times throughout the country, disenfranchisement of opposing religions, etc. That is a theocracy. That is what happens when fundamentalists get their way. And good thing we've had the good sense to oppose it.

Not sure what US you're living in, but it's tough to get good jobs, promotions, political offices, etc, unless you're a self-identified Christian. That's why almost all politicians proclaim their religiosity. 

&gt;It's so trite at this point, but if you don't see the difference, move to the Middle East and find out.

Here's where you're very wrong. Making a judgment about the peoples and cultures of the middle east based on religious fundamentalists is like judging the peoples and cultures of the US based on a chapter of the KKK. 

I sincerely hope that you stop being so closed minded. I hope that the rest of the country opens their eyes and stops feeding the military industrial complex. Giving the powers that be support to bomb these countries does nothing for the common man. 

The US media wants you to hate and revile what you perceive as backward religious zealots. Ironic since most of the US is backward religious zealots. The controversy in Europe over depictions of Muhammad was the expression of a marginalized minority group that had had enough. It wasn't the rise of religious fanaticism - yet the media wants you to believe that. They craft ""news"" that plays to your gut. 

There is a way the media can play to your emotions bypassing your intellect. Almost everything you've written about Islam and the middle east is propaganda that plays directly to the emotions. Significantly, you outline a ominous threat to the western world from Islam. Yet, there is no evidence. There are criminals and religious fundamentalists in every nation.

Within Europe I don't think that the police getting away with things is very common, nor is it perceived to be (although there are issues with some excessive legislation and the police using that to the limit, something rather different than the abuse we see in other places).

The main difference would seem to be how police disciplinary issues and complaints are dealt with.  In most places it is an independent body and the courts, in the US it seems to be either the police themselves or a less than impartial local prosecutors office.

I don't think that police getting away with carrying out abuse as blatantly as we see from the US is universal (I don't see all that much from Canada either though... local media would presumably be more active in reporting on it than international media) although where you give a group some power over others there will always be some abuses.

1. Buying up the bonds of a spending country by a saving country protects the currency of the saving country.  China keeps the cost of its products low by buying US bonds.  

2. The US has a HUGE discretionary overhead that it can reduce substantially: military expenditures.  To do this, it has to turn over military security to other nations.  Obama may be hinting at this with his 'treat Europeans as equals.'  

3. The regulations that will help prevent currency manipulations discussed above are in the works.  I think the US has a great deal of influence in establishing the regulations.  So, part of the regulation may be in preventing China (aside from their need increase in the strength of their currency) from 'dumping' US bonds.

4. Obama seems to acknowledge the competition with China will ultimately result in a 'better' US.  Perhaps this is a hint at his belief that once China's currency is traded at its real value, the US will have no trouble selling products in China.

5. Inflation in the US always reduces the cost of the outstanding debt.  I am not sure about this, but in theory China not purchasing US debt may drive up bond yields which could in turn drive up inflation.  

6. China plans to reign in their US bond purchases but are constrained by the above.  Also, their purchases of commodities have driven up their prices which affects the prices of their products - although this would presumably affect the prices of all products in the world.

Can you declare bankruptcy? Edit: apparently not, student loans are broken law too, as is post-secondary funding in the US. Europe uber alles. There's still hardship provisions. 

But again: what part do you not get:

DURING the marriage, there is no obligation to work. Both, one, or neither spouses can work. It's their option. 

AFTER the marriage, according to your view, the spouse that WAS working *is now forced to*, while for the other, it's optional.

How is it conscionable that divorce imposes greater obligations than the marriage itself?

Edit2: another difference between student loans and spousal support, is that student loan companies are businesses that make profits by investing funds in the education of young people, that they expect to profit from by charging interest. They also anticipate a portion of defaults and delinquency that they account for.

Fannie Mae isn't facing starvation or homelessness if you become an artist, and if you take a career that a $100k loan pays for, then you'll likely be able to afford to pay it: meaning you're continuing to enjoy the benefits of the original loan (your education and high income), so you are maintaining the mutually beneficial relationship.

&gt;The fact that I may or may not have gotten something from that loan is irrelevant to your argument

No it's not. Marriage is not a fee for service, nor a loan. It's an ongoing mutual exchange *for the duration of the marriage.* When the marriage ends, then there should be no further obligation for mutual support.

Edit3: If this were Dickensian London in the 19th Century, I would absolutely sympathize with the view that because there's all these old misers tossing their helpless wives out into the gutters to be preyed upon by scoundrels, that the courts must intervene for their protection.

But this isn't the 19th century, and women are not helpless waifs, defenseless against the world without someone to constantly provide for them. And neither are men. 

If a divorced spouse has the means and opportunity to provide for themselves, then it's up to them to do so, rather than expecting to be provided for as if they were still married.

&gt;The courts, as I understand it, do not simply look at what you might be able to earn, but at your past employment history and current economic circumstances.

So if the alimony-receiving spouse COULD work, but chooses not to, they can keep receiving alimony; but if the alimony-paying spouse chooses not to, they face prison.

Not so. Your continued replies to my posts are proof that you care enough about what I think to attempt to refute me.

&gt; look, i graduated with a degree in english. i worked as an editor for a legal firm for 4 years after graduating. i am intimately familiar with proscriptive and prescriptive grammar, and my vocabulary is vast.

I can only make judgements on what you have written. 

&gt; i fell in love with e.e. cummings in the 8th grade, and i have chosen not to use capitalization in any situation where it is not required, because i prefer it. i like the way it looks.

So you choose to slavishly imitate someone else. Why not adopt a scheme of your own invention which would at least have the novelty of originality? How about capitalizing every second word, or words that begin with the same letter as the current day of the week?

&gt; i'm also 38 years old, so lecturing me about ""adult"" discourse will get you nowhere, especially considering that you referred to someone who has valid concerns regarding privacy and the intrusive nature of a multinational corporation as a foaming lunatic. that's very mature.

As I said above, I can only judge by the words. The second half of your sentence demonstrates my point admirably. I called Buiter a foaming lunatic for his assertion that Google street view is a database for paedophiles, not, as you now try to claim, for raising privacy concerns. Either you misunderstood what I wrote, or you are trying to twist my words in order to extricate yourself from the hole you've dug.

&gt; by including those links, i was hoping to disabuse you of the notion that ""intellectual property law"" does not exist, as though it were some invention of the media, or of non-professionals.

I have never claimed it to be the invention of the media or non-professionals, whatever that might mean. Here is what I wrote:

""There is no such thing as intellectual property law, although certain individuals, whose profit is made through the confusion of others, politicians and lawyers, would have you think otherwise""

Nothing you've linked to in any way contradicts what I wrote.

Did you read the article I linked to, the one by Richard Stallman? No? Well, here is another piece written by a noted expert in the field, Mark A Lemley, which explains the problems associated with the term ""intellectual property"". It makes  similar points to those made by Stallman but has the virtue of being short enough to be quoted here in its entirety.

""Talking about patents, copyrights, and trademarks as just another
species of property is very much in vogue. The rhetoric and economic theory of real property are increasingly dominating the discourse and conclusions of the very different world of intellectual property. The shift begins with simple rhetoric—talking about intellectual property rights as aspects of a
broader system of property. But its implications go far beyond that. The temptation to move from rhetoric to rationale seems almost irresistible. Courts and commentators adopt—explicitly or implicitly—the economic logic of real property in the context of intellectual property cases. They then make a subconscious move, one that the economic theory of property does not justify: they jump from the idea that intellectual property is property to
the idea that the IP owner is entitled to capture the full social value of her right. This leads them to an almost obsessive preoccupation with identifying and rooting out that great evil of the modern economic world—free riding""

This is a paragraph taken from this extract:

http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf

&gt; is a list of law firms who identify themselves as practicing intellectual property law. it makes no difference if intellectual property law is the umbrella definition under which are classified all 3 of the fields you mention. it still exists.

Indeed? Then perhaps you should visit the websites of some of those firms. Note how each lists their partners and that area of law, either copyright, or patent, or trademark, that they specialise in. This is because one cannot be an intellectual property lawyer, there is no such field of law. The term groups together a number of disparate and unrelated fields of law and those firms who claim to practise intellectual property law must employ different lawyers for each of these separate fields. Occasionally one will find a lawyer expert in two of the fields, but this is rare. You will not find someone expert in all of them. Thus, to describe a lawyer as an intellectual property lawyer is to say nothing useful about him at all. It only tells you that he has specialised in one of a number of unrelated fields of law. 

It is analogous to announcing the creation of a new field of medicine, let us call it ""upper-body medicine"", which includes dentistry, concerned with teeth, brain surgery, concerned with the brain, ophthalmology, concerned with eyes, and otolaryngology, concerned with the ear, nose and throat. We might now describe someone as an upper-body doctor, but what does that tell us about the knowledge and practise of this person? Nothing much! The skills and knowledge required for each field are so different that our lumping them together has bred confusion, not clarity. My example is frivolous, for it's hard to imagine any serious attempt to lump these things together, but in the field of so called intellectual property law there is a reason, a sinister reason, why such a grouping together is done. That reason is ably explained in that paragraph above by Mark A Lemley.

&gt; people, including pedophiles, may not be using google streetview as a database, as such, but they certainly are scouring it for lurid images, and i can easily imagine some random nut who sees a child on street view and subsequently develops a psychopathic fixation on that child, whose probable location on this planet is available for all to see.

And your evidence for this is? You seriously imagine that paedophiles are scouring Google street view hoping to come upon potential victims instead of simply heading for their nearest beach, or swimming pool, or park? People can order so-called naturist documentary dvds on the internet which feature naked people of all ages. These are legal in most European countries. With the ready availability of such things as this, why would paedophiles need to spend an enormous amount of time searching Google in the small hope of coming across something lurid?

&gt; that's a small danger, and buiter overstated his case, but he's hardly a lunatic for suggesting this possibility.

It is a danger on a par with being hit by a meteorite, and as worthy of attention. Buiter did not simply overstate his case, nor did he merely suggest a possibility. Here is what he wrote:

""The cameras record details of residents’ lives, including pictures of drunk people throwing up, people in intimate clinches with persons with whom they are not officially affiliated, small children playing in a yard, with or without adult supervision, etc. etc.  A wonderful database for voyeurs, peeping toms and would-be child molesters.""

He asserts that it is so, and offers no evidence or reasoning for his claim. This is not the language of someone merely concerned with privacy, it is the language of someone with a deep and bitter grudge lashing out vindictively at the object of his ire.

http://www.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/01/Student%20lawsuit%20-%20final%20ruling.pdf

Page 8: ""Thus, Corbett’s in-class opinions on various social or political issues not 
touching upon religion do not violate the Establishment Clause, regardless of 
whether those of a particular religious faith might disagree with or find his 
statements offensive.  Therefore, any of Corbett’s statements which do not touch 
upon or mention religion satisfy the Lemon test and do not violate the 
Establishment Clause. ""

I recommend reading through the ruling. The judge is in fact incredibly tolerant towards Corbett, finding that in most cases, his statements were either secular in nature or permissible within their context of discussion.

""Similarly, it appears that Corbett’s referral to religion as “irrational” had the primary effect of demonstrating how religion can be used as a manipulative tool.12  (See Farnan’s Ex. A, p. 24.)  It is not improper for an AP European History teacher to discuss how religion can intersect with social and political choices.""

and

""These statements cannot be reasonably construed as primarily disapproving of 
religion.  Corbett explicitly states that he is not drawing a causal connection but 
merely pointing out a correlation.  The statement that there is a correlation between church attendance and crime rates is an interesting sociological fact appropriate for a college level discussion and seems to only suggest disapproval of religion by way of speculation or inference.""

Onto pages 26-28 he discusses Corbett's discussion of religious belief about the Sun &amp; Earth, versus our scientific understanding. So even though he's directly confronting traditional Christian beliefs, the judge finds that these statements had merit in a classroom for the sake of discussion of history.

In fact, it looks like the plaintiff's lawyers exaggerated just how good this ruling was for them. They won, partially, on only a single statement. The school was absolved, and the rest of the statements were ruled as non-infringing.

Whoever above made antagonistic statements against this judge is clearly ignorant. This judge has thought this matter through carefully, displayed his reasoning very clearly, and erred very much on the side of free academic discussion, only finding that Corbett stepped over the line once, when he said of creationist beliefs that they are ""religious, superstitious nonsense.""

I’d dispute that, depending on what kind of Zionism you are talking about. It may well be a political thing, but it has roots and justifications in religion.

It is important to note that while things may start one way, they change over time.

Further, the strong adherence to the notion of Zionism is religious in the non-theological sense.

&gt;The idea was to cooperate and live side by side in peace with the natives of the land. But the natives had other plans.

There are things called consultation and consideration. If the natives (I’m glad to see that some accept that the Palestinians were native to the regions - this seems to be commonly denied) did not want people to come, people should not have come - nowadays we hold immigration regulation to be a fundamental state right (this is obviously confused by the nature of Palestine as a protectorate, but still the people should constitute a state).

I honestly don’t know. The ‘solution’ that was taken though just shifted it in time, place and people and did not actually resolve a problem of persecution of a people. In addition to that, notion was done to help the Roma, just as persecuted (and still are - most Eastern Europeans express desires similar to those expressed regarding the Jews at the beginning of last century) and yet without patron, and so without the kind of protection given to the Jews. I don’t mean this to be a justification for not helping the Jews, I just don’t think the question is wildly useful.

You know. I get really bored of legalistic arguments about statehood when talking to people about this issue - a paraphrase of Dr Johnson is warranted: Legalism is the last bastion of the scoundrel. You will note that I made a point that the region was not a state to avoid going there. there were however people who lived there - their wishes should have been considered, they were not.

(I’m aware that you are providing context, but I just get bored of that claim - there was no state in Australia when whites arrived here either, it doesn’t make it morally right to have taken their land).
&gt;I don't think that people in 1880 considered a bunch of tribesman (the natives) living in a land to be a state, or to have a ""right"" against immigration.

This I can agree with. It is thematic of the whole situation: European paternalism, which continues today.

&gt;I don't think the Zionist solution shifted the problem to another people. Various other historical misfortunes are the reason some Palestinians are persecuted.

It has contributed.

To address your counter examples, I’ll respond with questions:

A. Would Israel relinquish all of the pre 1967 lands?

B. Why should they have accepted immigrants? Personally I agree that it probably would have been a good idea, but resident always look on immigrants with suspicion that they will take over, whether this was always going to happen, we will never know.

C. Because of the land breakdown and the necessary appropriation of lands from the Palestinians, that I really think, was never going to be a possibility? My personal view is that a single state is the only option in the long run. Unfortunately this isn’t an option either.

I take your point that “So I don't think Zionism inevitably resulted in oppression,” but given the extremely nationalist (verging on fascist - I don’t use this term glibly) nature of Zionism in the early-mid period of the last century, I think it was pretty likely.

&gt;The oppression is a result of Palestinian and Israeli policy mistakes and have little to do with Zionism.

Only if you neglect to accept that without a Zionist displacement of the Palestinians these policies would have no effect, and the afore mentioned nationalist mentality associated with Zionism.

George Antonius, 1938

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation.

To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

the Zionist put alot of thought into transferring Palestinian from the land, The zionists first thought that the native would welcome them as civilizers of the barbaric land.
They imagined a grateful population, then large amounts of money enabled them to buy up land and create work away from the land they wanted, moving population out of the area they wanted. 
There where riots by the local Palestinians in 1936-39. The British killed 1000's and killed, jailed or exiled the leadership.

I strongly contend that the oppression of the Palestinians is nowhere near the persecution suffered by the Jews.

If the English had prohibited Jews from entering Palestine -- many of those that did enter would have had to stay in Europe where they would not only be persecuted *horribly* (Far worse than any persecution known by any Palestinian), but also genocided.  So would the English really be doing the world a favor if they had prevented Jewish escape into Israel?

Note that those Jews had nowhere to go, even the US had closed its doors to Jewish immigration.

&gt; the belief of entitlement

Zionism is not about entitlement.  Immigrating and setting up a state somewhere necessarily means some natives might be offended -- but its a lesser evil than persecution.

&gt; Can any reasonable person not see that as being viewed as being unfair and also not see that the people who were dispossessed might take it badly.

  I even preempted that response.  You're dismissing the ICC's ability to hold people accountable does not detract from the definition of apartheid.  You've moved from not being apartheid to not be held accountable by the higher ethical standard.

&gt;Also, Israel could also have been referred to the ICC at any time through the Security Council. Since this has not happened, it means that the members of the security council agree that Israel is not guilty of any crimes made up by the ICC.

You know quite well that the US uses its veto on the security council as Israeli wipe-out.  Again - you're back to saying 'what about these other guys', an argument of misdirection.

&gt;Apartheid's definition was already changed by the ICC. The fact that the two largest economies in the world do not recognise the court does not lend any credence to the court.

No - legally defined by the court to recognise apartheid as a crime.  But argument of fallacy #2 is that a large economy = right.  A big checkbook does not mean you can't be guilty of oppression.  Check out the deeds of the British empire in the 19th century. Again, you move further from arguing that what Israel is doing is right to what Israel does it can get away with so it must be justifiable.  The two do not correlate.

&gt;The boycotts and disinvestment campaign was a joke in South Africa. 

Oh noes...it brought an awful lot of international pressure onto the South African government.  You see when elected governments see that the electorate are polarized on something they too act.  You might have noticed that effect when Israel broke the ceasefire and invaded Gaza.

Spin it how you like - boycott came, apartheid ended.

&gt;On a question for boycotts – you are being a hypocrite if you try to boycott Israeli products: Because you use Saudi or Equatorial Guinea oil (which are some of the worst regimes in existence). I wonder why it is fashionable for kids to have campaigns against Israel, but not against Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, DRC, Angola, China or Viet Nam? All of those are de facto dictatorships.

You don't know what I do and do not do.  You have, once again, tried to shift condemnation of the Israeli regime onto another regime by saying, 'look over there'.  Crying relativity doesn't mean that what is happening in Israel is not apartheid, and what they are doing is not ethnic cleansing.  

It is and they are.

&gt;You may even get a reverse boycott (people buying Israeli product because they feel that Israel is unfairly boycotted).

Yeah 'cos you don't buy Israel at the moment.  Sure you do.  Not exclusively Israel but you're clearly not boycotting.  However the boycott works by getting people who would otherwise have bought not doing so.  You can try to compensate by buying more but we both know the boycott works and it creates a deficit because there's far more people who won't buy as opposed to those who can buy more on principle.

Also - you must be aware that the popular support is not with Israel's behaviour.  She's having a PR nightmare.

THE BOYCOTT IS WORKING!

[""**Israeli exports hit by European boycotts after attacks on Gaza**""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/03/israel-gaza-attacks-boycotts-food-industry)

&gt;[on planning permission] Did they apply? Why didn't they take it to court. Also, did they apply for Israeli citizenship (there are a lot of people in Jerusalem who did not bother to apply for citizenship).

Apparently so - well according to Israeli human rights groups like B'Tselem and Bimkom.  B'tselem goes further [and says this](http://www.btselem.org/english/Jerusalem/Discriminating_Policy.asp),

      ""The Jerusalem Municipality enforces the building laws on Palestinians much more
      stringently than on the Jewish population, even though the number of
      violations is much higher in the Jewish neighborhoods."" 

Gee - who'da thunk.  More violations by those annexing East Jerusalem (something else against international law) but less accountability.  Back to apartheid.

&gt;If you continue building a structure when there is a demolition order, it will be destroyed.

Only B'Tselem notices that it will be destroyed if you're not Jewish....

&gt;There is a good reason for this! Arab Israeli citizens are free from conscription (while Israeli citizens are not). That is the only difference in laws between Israeli and Arabs.
I would say not being subject to conscription or mandatory military service (and losing a year of your life) is a huge advantage!

Only difference?  Piffle when one notes that Arabs can only build in 13% of annexed East Jerusalem and that Jewish permits granted for building outweigh Arab permits - according to Israeli humanitarian groups.

On the military service thing - don't sweat it, most Israelis scratched around for any and all reason to get out of military service.  It's becoming a real problem for the IDF.  Israelis of good conscience refuse to be part of ethnic cleansing and what they see as military expansionism.  Thanks for bringing it up though and giving me the opportunity to sing praise for the likes of [Yesh Gvul!](http://www.yeshgvul.org/about_e.asp)  Those peaceful Israeli guys, the humanitarians, rock.  

&gt;So? There are the same restrictions for USA citizens (you cannot visit Cuba).

Back to look over there as an argument as to why it isn't apartheid in Israel.  But thank-you, the situation is quite different to the one you falsely compare.  Point is that in modern Israel, if you are Jewish, there are places you can go that you cannot if you are an Arab.

&gt;This law apply equally to Arab and Jewish citizen alike. There are numerous countries with the same type of laws.

and this was the response you gave to a middle-east journalist who also has the insight of having reported from apartheid South Africa.  You might wish to say that there is equality but here is what he says on it once again so that it is not whitewashed:

     ""This violation of rights is directed against Arab citizens of Israel. As a result,   
      therefore, the law is a violation of the right of Arab citizens in Israel to equality.""

&gt;This law in Israel is probably to prevent Chain migration. This can be a large problem in a society that allows polygamy.

So you accept that it is geared towards a specific polygamous sample.  A law geared against Arabs.  Apartheid.

&gt;[Born and lived in Israel but not Jewish - deported.]  That is a lie. Citizens of Israel (both Arab, Jewish or other) have equal rights and are not deported.

Amnesty International joined the ranks describing the law as discriminatory:

[""A law permitting such blatant racial discrimination, on grounds of ethnicity or nationality, would clearly violate international human rights law and treaties which Israel has ratified and pledged to uphold,""](http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/066/2003/en/ef602f34-d6ac-11dd-ab95-a13b602c0642/mde150662003en.html)

&gt;The demolition orders are given before construction but ignored:

Oh you miss the point, [here is the link again](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1211872828552&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull), that of all planning permission 94% is rejected.  Thousands of homes for Jewish people are built, Arabs in annexed East Jerusalem (people who have lived there their whole lives) are restricted to 13% of the territory and even then, despite massive short-fallings in accommodation and mass overcrowding, 94% get planning permits turned down.

&gt;It is the right of any sovereign nation to decide whom they will allow to become citizens. To become a citizen of Britain, Australia or the USA for example is impossible for 99% of the world's population.

Only now you are applying it to annexed territory - which breaks another international law and the Geneva convention. Only what is allowed in and what is sent out is based on ethnicity.  You might wish to claim sovereignty but now you're claiming a sovereign right to apartheid.  Sorry, that's what Israel is having a PR nightmare.  People of good conscience don't agree.  Neither does international law.

&gt;Your defence is to attack Israel with half truths and make bad comparisons to another country (apartheid South Africa). You then exercise your hypocracy by holding Israel to different standards than other countries.

You don't know what standards I hold other countries to.  We're talking about Israel - you just wish to try and point elsewhere and say 'what about them?'  The comparisons I  make are to international law.   It is you that is trying to say that apartheid is a foreign word and make that it only belongs in South Africa.  Well you might for if apartheid can only exist in South Africa then it can't be in Israel.  Only the world has moved on and in not wanting to see a similar regime made it an international ruling, defining it.  There is a crime of apartheid and South Africa need not come into it any longer.  

Israel is practicing apartheid.  Humanitarian groups see it.  Israeli humanitarian groups see it.  Those that have seen it elsewhere recognise it now in Israel too.  

&gt;Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.

[Lebanon](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html#Govt)?  [The Republic of Iran](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#Govt)?  Not that they're perfect (but then clearly neither is Israel with its apartheid, ethnic cleansing and fascists like Lieberman in the cabinet) but they are democracies.  But that is not relevant and more 'look at what else is going on elsewhere' to detract from what is going on in Israel.  Namely, apartheid.

There is an old saying: Correlation does not mean causation. Just because Apartheid ended, did not mean that the boycotts worked. You can see it economically (the value of South African exports did not decrease).

&gt; you know quite well that the US uses its veto on the security council as Israeli wipe-out.

Yes. They do this because they feel that what is happening in Israel is not a crime. So a government democratically elected in a country with over 300 million people do not feel what Israel is doing is a crime.

&gt; ou have, once again, tried to shift condemnation of the Israeli regime onto another regime by saying, 'look over there'.

No. **I have just shown you what a hypocrite you are**. You are probably sitting at home in your Che Guevera T-Shirt and your Nike shoes made in Vietnam and typing how bad Israel is.

&gt; However the boycott works by getting people who would otherwise have bought not doing so.

As soon as there is a feeling that Israel is boycotted, Israeli diaspora will ramp up aid efforts to Israel. *Israel is one of those countries with a larger diaspora than its population!*.

&gt; Also - you must be aware that the popular support is not with Israel's behaviour. She's having a PR nightmare.

You are self delusional. There is not one major leader of the world who is calling for sanctions, boycotts or disinvestment. Most normal people (i.e. not 20 year old kids) have an extremely positive view of Israel.

&gt; THE BOYCOTT IS WORKING!

You are self delusional. The Israeli economy grew by 4.2% in 2008. That is faster than most western countries (in spite of global financial turmoil in 2008). During 2006 (Hezbolla) it grew. 

The economy may slightly decline this year – but that is because of the global financial problems.


&gt; More violations by those annexing East Jerusalem (something else against international law) but less accountability. Back to apartheid.


Why don't they take the planning commission to court? Israel has an excellent and independent judiciary (unlike all the other paradises in the middle east). 

 &gt; Israelis of good conscience refuse to be part of ethnic cleansing and what they see as military expansionism.

That is a self delusional lie. The Israeli military had no problems with any call-up. Here is a quote from WP:

&gt; Virtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis, but experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, Second Lebanon War in 2006) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally achieve recruitment rates above those considered fully-manned. 

The Israeli military also get volunteers from abroad.

What is more telling is that more conservative parties were voted for in the elections. This shows that there is no widespread opposition in Israel to the governments' policies. 

&gt; So you accept that it is geared towards a specific polygamous sample. 

You know that most countries have laws against polygamy? Israel allow it except for migration purposes.

&gt; Amnesty International joined the ranks describing the law as discriminatory:

Amnesty International is a [joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amnesty_International#Israel).

&gt; Only now you are applying it to annexed territory

The state of Israel is recognised by most countries around the world. They are a sovereign country in every sense of the word.

&gt; Only what is allowed in and what is sent out is based on ethnicity.

A sovereign country can decide who it allows to immigrate. A good example is Japan's policies which are geared to keep Japan homogeneous.

&gt; Neither does international law.


Uhm... you know that “international law” is actually a bunch of treaties between sovereign nations? 

&gt; Only the world has moved on and in not wanting to see a similar regime made it an international ruling, defining it.

That world does not include either the USA, Israel or China. None of those countries are subject to the made up laws.

&gt; Humanitarian groups see it. Israeli humanitarian groups see it.


No major European country or the USA sees it.

&gt; Lebanon? The Republic of Iran? Not that they're perfect 


You are self delusional. Zimbabwe also goes through the motions of elections -but that does not mean that it is a democracy. 

The best way to see this is to look at a [democracy index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index). Here is the points for Israel, Iran and Lebanon:

Iran 2.83 

Lebanon 5.62 

Israel 7.48 

Lebanon is a bit higher because it is only 50% Muslim. The index describes Iran as an 'Authoritarian regime' and Lebanon as a 'Hybrid regime'. 

So, claiming that Lebanon or Iran are democracies is again self-delusion and double standards on your part. 

&gt; but they are democracies.


Nope. Not according to several analysis. Israel is the most free country in the Middle East. Lets compare press freedom (compiled by reporters without borders in 2008, higher number is worse). Here is the ranking:

46  Israel  8.83 

66  Lebanon 14.00 

166  Iran 80.33 

Your favourite country Iran is almost at the bottom (even below the other Middle East shitholes).

I think this is the last post – at this point I am only entertaining your delusions and hypocrisy.

zedstream,1,WTF,0,0,False,,,,"It's not part of any stereotype I'm aware of, except maybe the one where it's inspiring when the congregation sings at a black church service. I base my assertion on the fact that *Sweet Chariot* has the blue note and is a traditional spiritual, whereas *Amazing Grace* has an annoying melody and a point of view that I don't associate with black church service. Pardon me for thinking the black community, in general, would know the lyrics to a beautiful spiritual from the African American tradition over those of a gloomy song written by a white man of limited musical talent.

I use Wikipedia because, well, it's easy and remarkably reliable. Note that the articles say nothing about the songs' respective standings in the black community and I referenced them for background material. To imply I use Wikipedia ""religiously"" is an ad hominem and does nothing to make your case.

If I'm wrong about *Sweet Chariot*, I can accept that and I thank you pointing out my error. Really.

I agree that *Amazing Grace* is more widely known. The fact is, I think *Sweet Chariot* is a beautiful song and if you read my last two sentences, you'll see that I'm declaring my preference for black gospel music. I don't attend church much, but I like how black services are a celebration. Often, white church service can be so dull and prosecutorial.

Anyway, the African American contribution to music is immeasurable. In Blue Grass (real Appalachian hill music, not so much the 60s folk music), I love how you can hear the blending of Anglo folk music and African rhythms and chords. Elizabeth Laprelle comes to mind. And, yeah, she's a white girl from Appalachia.

If you've ever listened to King Crimson, you notice they mix African syncopation and multi rhythms with European chordal structures (they mention Bela Bartok). They're also heavily influenced by [Gamelan music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan).

Interestingly I couldn't find any examples from The New York Times, at least not of a quotation appearing in a headline.  I did find theatre / movie / book reviews that used quotation marks for a title, but that's a different thing.  (And those all used single quotes again.)

From this, I'm going to have to guess two things:

* It's some sort of typographical convention to use single quotes rather than double quotes in headlines.  It seems to be essentially universal.  Maybe with really large type (as would be used in a headline), the double quotes just look bad, or take up too much space, or are too distracting to the eye.
* Curiously, in several examples, the quoted words that appeared in the headline did not appear anywhere in the body of the article.  You would expect that if 2 or 3 words are quoted in the headline, you'd be able to find the full quotation in the article, but sometimes you can't.  I can think of two explanations of this.  One is that newspapers like to pepper headlines with quotes because they think it makes their coverage look better, because it looks like they are giving you information directly from the source.  The other possibly explanation is maybe that their own editorial standards require them to put anything in quotation marks if the phrase came from the original, as a way of giving proper credit.  I could easily see either one of these being true.  :-)",True,t1_c099l6r,1,c099y7d,1425963385,1241274486,t1_c099y7d,0,False,t3_8h1zk,t5_mouw

The economic prosperity you speak of was a disaster for many millions of people. US delegates would go to these countries and convince (ie. I've got a pocket full of cash in one pocket and a bullet in the other - which do you want?)them to accept loans from the IMF and World Bank to create massive projects that benefit US companies.  When the countries ask how can they afford to pay the loans back, the answer is to cut back on any social net.

Gee, if memory serves, the invasion of Iraq was due to ties with AlQueda and WMD's.  Both of which have been proven to be overt lies.  Then the story changed to one of 'freeing' an oppressed people.  The UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix insisted there were no WMD's and the US ignored him and tried to fabricate 'evidence'. Yup, it's true Hussein did oppress and the US should know since they put him in power and allowed him to rule till his value to them ran out.

Interesting.  It has been since revealed that Hussein told the US that he was going to invade Kuwait long before he did.  He didn't get any negative feedback and went ahead. The response of the US was at best disingenuous.

But it is not only that which I am talking about – it is the fact that there aren't that many people truly succeeding in life. In a socialised world, it is as if your decisions doesn't really matter. There are no people truly succeeding or failing. 

In many countries, you have to work extremely hard to succeed – and competition to get ahead is immense. Maybe that is also a reason why the USA's university system is so much better – because people truly compete (if you compare economy size, Germany and France's university system is not that good when compared to the USA).

Anyways, these are just some thoughts open to debate.

For one, it's not realistic or plausible to imagine women go around checking out dude's packages right off the bat, unless you are talking about a european beach setting. 

For another thing, wallet thickness is just as asinine. Someone with a thick wallet could just as easily have a bunch of five dollar bills or a collection of a dozen credit cards, all maxed out, as to actually be well off. As a matter of fact, I'd argue people with lots of credit cards are statistically more likely to be deeply in debt than people with just one or two. When your credit is good and your income is high, the banks don't mind giving you a $15-$20K credit line, or even higher in some cases. So why would you have tons of cards unless you're a wannabe (or a moron)? 

Last but not least, there's a reason why men are attracted to body parts first and foremost while girls are much more subtle and general in what turns them on. It's because men are looking for fertility markers above all. This is why a guy could have sex at the drop of a hat with a great looking chick he knows nothing about. Dumb as a box of hammers, works as a checkout girl at wal-mart, who cares? If she's hot, she's hot.

Women, on the other hand, have a much more abstract set of needs because their primary orientation is towards security. A guy could technically sow his wild oats with hundreds of women whereas pregnancy (and the need for protection) are much more commitment oriented. This is why women's attraction cues are likely to be more subtle and abstract, and also why, like it or not, studies have shown that women have more orgasms with successful men. 

In a quick scan a woman will thus be far more likely to look for cues that suggest ""success"" or at least some compatible hint of it, which spans a whole host of things: physical appearance, clothing, body mass, attitude, demeanor, and even more abstract stuff like job, social status, and what not. Barring some confluence of signals along these lines, a woman generally won't take interest in a guy until she has ""gotten to know him"" enough to pick up on other cues of fitness as a mate: personality, desirable traits, and so on. This also fits with studies that show physical attractiveness, i.e. ""hotness"" rates as much more important on the male checklist than the female checklist. Notice how women can be turned on almost wholly by a guy's general social station and personality profile, where, again, on average, guys just don't give a crap about that stuff in comparison to the physical goods. It's basic sociobiology.

 Roma, - Ormai è certo: Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia si è candidato per rappresentare l’Italia, nelle file dell’Udc, alle prossime elezioni europee. Antonello De Pierro, presidente dell’Italia dei Diritti commenta: “Non finisco mai di stupirmi di fronte a certe candidature. Proporre Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia per rappresentare l’Italia al Parlamento Europeo denota da parte dell’Udc una scarsa predisposizione alla democrazia repubblicana e una sorta di nostalgico rigurgito monarchico”.
Nostalgia monarchica che negli ultimi anni ha avuto un escalation non indifferente. Inizialmente il dibattito era se i Savoia potessero o meno mettere piede sul suolo nazionale, ma a quanto pare si è andati ben oltre, come sottolinea l’esponente di spicco dell’Italia dei Diritti che dichiara: “A volte pur non volendo alcuni nostri politici riescono a smettere l’impeccabile vestito retorico e demagogico per mettere a nudo la loro vera natura. Se dopo tanti anni è stato proprio un governo di centro destra sostenuto dalla stessa Udc a riabilitare la permanenza sul territorio nazionale dei discendenti di casa Savoia, che non mi sembra abbiano fatto mai nulla per contribuire al miglioramento del corpo sociale della nazione, ma hanno semplicemente vissuto di luce riflessa, vuol dire che la storia non ci ha insegnato assolutamente nulla. E’ stato all’epoca uno dei tanti attacchi berlusconiani alla Carta costituzionale in contrasto netto con la logica costituente dei padri fondatori”.
Prosegue con un auspicio il leader dell’Italia dei Diritti: “Invito semplicemente tutti gli italiani di buon senso e sostenitori dei sacrosanti valori democratici a informarsi, e non certo dagli organi ufficiali ben addomesticati dal potere politico e addestrati alla mistificazione delle notizie, sull’infinità di nefandezze perpetrate ai danni degli italiani da parte del sistema monarchico anche dopo l’unità d’Italia”.
Antonello De Pierro conclude e dichiara: “Senza dilungarmi troppo cito una vicenda drammatica ed emblematica che è quella di Giovanni Passannante. La gravità di questa candidatura è che non solo ai Savoia è stato permesso di tornare sul territorio nazionale, ma addirittura ora gli si consente anche di partecipare alla vita istituzionale. Mi auguro che gli italiani non si facciano ingannare e boicottino con decisione nelle urne quello che è un chiaro segnale di nuova apertura verso un avvento monarchico. Confido nel buon senso di Pier Ferdinando Casini per un’immediata marcia indietro”.

Ummmm... you clearly have been drinking the propaganda kool-aid. It is *very* clear that Georgia started the conflict. Since you're in need of a history lesson, I'll oblige, but only briefly.

Georgia and the rebellious S. Ossetians have been fighting back and forth since SO's assertion of independence. Small attacks and skirmishes were sporadic. Russian peace-keepers were sent there to prevent either side from doing anything really stupid, but they didn't have to worry much about the SO militias. Georgia's president, thinking that he could get into NATO faster if he was engaged in combat with Russia, decided to set the whole thing in motion. He built up his forces, which the SO's and Russians saw happening. The SO's tried a preemptive strike but failed to do anything. Then, Georgia launched their assault, kicking it off with a huge artillery barrage of SO's capital, reportedly killing thousands of civilians (obvious outcome, must have been deliberate). Georgian forces also attacked said peace-keepers and easily advanced into SO. What they *didn't* know was just how prepared Russia was to intervene. Russian forces came down and basically obliterated Georgia's entire military. How they didn't see that coming is a testament to Sakhashvili's idiocy. Russia played it perfectly. 

Why does any of this even matter? Because the US never quit playing the Cold War game. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US has been able to expand their empire into East Europe. They have also been expanding NATO into former Soviet territories in an effort to encircle Russia and dominate them. That's why we supplied and trained the Georgian military.

It is indeed! But in real life, the [difference in productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita_per_hour) isn't very big. Here are the GDP(PPP)/hour of the same countries you listed:


&gt;2 	United States 35.90

&gt;4 	France 35.09

&gt;9 	United Kingdom 31.27

&gt;14 	Germany 29.69

&gt;15 	Italy 29.22

As you can see here, a French worker and an American worker contribute about **the same** to GDP per hour. The French just prefer to go on vacation while the Americans prefer to work extra. You cannot say that the American system produces better workers, it just indoctrinates people into working more hours. The French have the same opportunity to obtain monetary wealth as the Americans, but people _choose_ to work less; in effect, **""buying""** time off (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws). In my opinion, it's all in how you measure these things.

Which leads me to my next point: GDP is not the end all measure of prosperity; it's an _indicator_ of prosperity. The USA is highly commercialised compared to many European countries, so more purchases take place, inflating the GDP. For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services.

 Roma, - Ormai è certo: Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia si è candidato per rappresentare l’Italia, nelle file dell’Udc, alle prossime elezioni europee. Antonello De Pierro, presidente dell’Italia dei Diritti commenta: “Non finisco mai di stupirmi di fronte a certe candidature. Proporre Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia per rappresentare l’Italia al Parlamento Europeo denota da parte dell’Udc una scarsa predisposizione alla democrazia repubblicana e una sorta di nostalgico rigurgito monarchico”.
Nostalgia monarchica che negli ultimi anni ha avuto un escalation non indifferente. Inizialmente il dibattito era se i Savoia potessero o meno mettere piede sul suolo nazionale, ma a quanto pare si è andati ben oltre, come sottolinea l’esponente di spicco dell’Italia dei Diritti che dichiara: “A volte pur non volendo alcuni nostri politici riescono a smettere l’impeccabile vestito retorico e demagogico per mettere a nudo la loro vera natura. Se dopo tanti anni è stato proprio un governo di centro destra sostenuto dalla stessa Udc a riabilitare la permanenza sul territorio nazionale dei discendenti di casa Savoia, che non mi sembra abbiano fatto mai nulla per contribuire al miglioramento del corpo sociale della nazione, ma hanno semplicemente vissuto di luce riflessa, vuol dire che la storia non ci ha insegnato assolutamente nulla. E’ stato all’epoca uno dei tanti attacchi berlusconiani alla Carta costituzionale in contrasto netto con la logica costituente dei padri fondatori”.
Prosegue con un auspicio il leader dell’Italia dei Diritti: “Invito semplicemente tutti gli italiani di buon senso e sostenitori dei sacrosanti valori democratici a informarsi, e non certo dagli organi ufficiali ben addomesticati dal potere politico e addestrati alla mistificazione delle notizie, sull’infinità di nefandezze perpetrate ai danni degli italiani da parte del sistema monarchico anche dopo l’unità d’Italia”.
Antonello De Pierro conclude e dichiara: “Senza dilungarmi troppo cito una vicenda drammatica ed emblematica che è quella di Giovanni Passannante. La gravità di questa candidatura è che non solo ai Savoia è stato permesso di tornare sul territorio nazionale, ma addirittura ora gli si consente anche di partecipare alla vita istituzionale. Mi auguro che gli italiani non si facciano ingannare e boicottino con decisione nelle urne quello che è un chiaro segnale di nuova apertura verso un avvento monarchico. Confido nel buon senso di Pier Ferdinando Casini per un’immediata marcia indietro”.

I have a lot of trouble with this idea that with digital IP, there is somehow no exchange of goods.  When you go to a movie or buy a DVD, what you're paying for isn't the data, it's the effort that has gone towards organizing and presenting that data.  That effort exists independent of the zeroes and ones, and when you digitally pirate media, it's that effort that is being stolen.  That's why theft is occurring even though nothing tangible was taken from the owner as it would be if, say, I stole your car.  The transfer of goods from the movie to the downloaders is the value of that organization - the entertainment they put together - and it happens every time you watch the movie.

Traditional theft law doesn't really apply, in such a case, which is why we have IP law in the modern age.  And what media piracy as of late has taught us is that our laws governing digital IP - or the business models related to it - are also becoming inapplicable and need an update.

The difference in productivity between the USA and UK/Italy is however still fairly large (almost 20%). Also, the people in the USA are not forced to work more.

&gt; (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws). 

The labour laws are pretty bad for French business (including small business). They have a saying about that: hiring someone is worse than marrying someone.

The USA is also full of smaller businesses (contrary to popular belief). It would be interesting to see what the number of small business owners per capita is when France is compared with the USA.

There is still another problem I have  – people in Europe are less likely to change jobs or to quit and enter the labour force at a later time (e.g. to raise children or care for an elderly person). Because of the more restrictive laws in Europe, voluntary job mobility is lower than in the USA. It would be interesting to see a statistical comparison between the two.

&gt; For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services. 

That may be true – but it would be reflected in the spending patterns of the money earner (the creation of wealth would somehow reflect in the GDP). A bigger problem for Italy (specifically) and for Europe in general is its population collapse. To say it simply: Italian stay-home mamas aren't producing children.

It is easy to dismiss a population decline with saying there are already too much people. But an ageing and a declining population can have catastrophic economic and social effects. A newsweek article of a few years ago said a contributing factor is specifically on the difficulty of women to re-enter the labour market after having a child (can't find it now – here is another one related to the topic: http://www.newsweek.com/id/47915).

&gt; Now, if you couple this with the income inequality of European countries, you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise better off than their counterparts across the Atlantic.

It would be interesting to see the income inequality normalized w.r.t. the GDP per capita (since that of the US is higher).

The comparison (IMHO) between Europe and the USA is difficult and complicated. No doubt the USA can be improved (less defence spending and subsidies) but just throwing the USA system into the water (as some suggest) and adopting a European one can't be a good thing.

I assure you that it's not so.  I can assert this with authority, since I have both gone to movies and bought DVDs fairly recently, and I can confidently report that I was not paying for their effort.  If it took them no effort at all to produce the movie or DVD, I wouldn't care a whit.  If the movie had fallen from the sky into the lap of the executive producer, and all that was left to do was distribute, it wouldn't change what I'm willing to pay for it.

&gt; Traditional theft law doesn't really apply, in such a case, which is why we have IP law in the modern age.

I agree with the former, but I would say that copyright and patent law was just one of those ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" mistakes that people make.  Of course, for many decades now, a process analogous to regulatory capture has resulted in more and more strict law.  We're now in or rapidly approaching a time (as you no doubt are aware, since you're here) when there will be no way at all to control what happens with information you've given someone else.  There might eventually be some effective way to control other people's information, but I can't see how it could happen without essentially removing control over our own computers, and I think (I hope!) that it's too late to close pandora's box.

Maternity leave I think it's obvious that women would take more often than men. :o)

I think women take more time off than men once they've had children largely because of socialized roles (""provider"" and ""nurturer""). Men who are unemployed tend to take fewer hours when they do go back to work because they want to spend more time with their children.

[From the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html?sec=&amp;pagewanted=print):

&gt;A division of the pharmaceutical company Bayer sold millions of dollars of blood-clotting medicine for hemophiliacs -- medicine that carried a high risk of transmitting AIDS -- to Asia and Latin America in the mid-1980's while selling a new, safer product in the West, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.

&gt;The Bayer unit, Cutter Biological, introduced its safer medicine in late February 1984 as evidence mounted that the earlier version was infecting hemophiliacs with H.I.V. Yet for over a year, the company continued to sell the old medicine overseas, prompting a United States regulator to accuse Cutter of breaking its promise to stop selling the product.

&gt;By continuing to sell the old version of the life-saving medicine, the records show, Cutter officials were trying to avoid being stuck with large stores of a product that was proving increasingly unmarketable in the United States and Europe.

&gt;Yet even after it began selling the new product, the company kept making the old medicine for several months more. A telex from Cutter to a distributor suggests one reason behind that decision, too: the company had several fixed-price contracts and believed that the old product would be cheaper to produce.

&gt;Nearly two decades later, the precise human toll of these marketing decisions is difficult, if not impossible, to document. Many patient records are now unavailable, and because an AIDS test was not developed until later in the epidemic, it is difficult to pinpoint when foreign hemophiliacs were infected with H.I.V. -- before Cutter began selling its safer medicine or afterward.



Bayer is responsible for causing people to become infected with HIV. They had the responsibility to give people the safe products they had that wouldn't spread this virus, but they went ahead and used a product which they knew would kill people, because the CDC had already warned in March of 1983 that the blood products spread AIDS, but after that date Bayer and other companies continued to export these unsafe blood products while they were perfectly capable of exporting safe ones.
 
[And there's reason to believe they spread this disease on purpose:](http://www.hemophilia-litigation.com/)
&gt;It is believed that three of these companies, Alpha, Baxter and Cutter, recruited and paid donors from high risk populations, including prisoners, intravenous drug users, and blood centers with predominantly homosexual donors, to obtain blood plasma used for the production of Factor VIII and IX. Plaintiffs allege that these companies failed to exclude donors, as mandated by federal law, with a history of viral hepatitis. Such testing could have substantially reduced the likelihood of plasma containing HIV and/or HCV entering plasma pools.

yeahright,4,AskReddit,0,0,False,,,,"I was a public school teacher for a year.  Math and science.  

Pros:  If you're able to organize your time, the hours are good.  We worked 8-hour days, including a planning period, with weekends off.  Vacation and sick time accumulate at fantastic rates, plus 2 months off in the summer.  Unused sick time eventually converts to retirement days (5 unused sick days is like a week of actual working).  Also, some of the other teachers are great people.  I met my best friend there.

Cons: Paperwork.  Retarded amounts.  I had to fill out forms for kids with ADD, forms about testing, forms about my performance, forms about my peers' performances, forms about the school's performance, forms about supplies, forms about attendance, everything.  I especially hated the daily written lesson plans - ""teach trigonometric identities"" was not nearly enough; I had to have specific plans for introducing, teaching, reinforcing, remediating, adjusting for varied learning styles, etc.  For every class, for every day.

Another con was some of the other teachers.  Don't get me wrong; I liked (almost all of) them personally, but some things just drove me nuts.  The English teacher across the hall from me was constantly complaining that she put her heart and soul into preparing this meaningful journaling exercise and her kids didn't react at all ""like she wanted""... Meanwhile, one of her A students submitted a page-and-a-half extra credit paper to me on Isaac Newton.  Bad enough that it was only one paragraph, but it was also only 2 sentences.  ""...and then he went to college but soon he became a teacher or professor or whatever they called them back then and even though no one showed up to his classes he thought he ought to teach anyhow so he really did teach anyhow even when no one showed up and sometimes..."" I wanted to tell the teacher to get over herself; forget ""reaching"" them and maybe change their lives by teaching them to friggin' punctuate instead.  Also, at least weekly someone had to complain about the horrible salary and how much more they'd make in the private sector.  (Given your degree in medieval European history, who could doubt it?)  One day, just for fun, I said, ""Hello?  We signed up for a low-paying job.  We weren't tricked into poverty; we volunteered for it.""  One woman - the aforementioned English teacher - actually said, ""Well, no one told ME it was a low-paying job!""  Learning to do research is evidently not a part of the English teaching curriculum.  

While most teachers were fairly intelligent, there are a few seriously stupid people in that field, and often these people are in administration.  Granted, I have had to work with/for a few seriously stupid people in a number of other fields so avoiding teaching won't save you from this.  

Yes, the pay is low.  I knew this when I signed up, having come from a professional, relatively high-paying career, but needing better hours for family reasons.  On the other hand, like most fields, education pays a lot more if you move into management.  Assistant principals, principals, superintendents are all pretty well compensated.   

Back to Pros - The actual teaching part, I loved.  LOVED.  There was a feeling of accomplishment from knowing that my kids passed the year-end tests.  Knowing I'd be off all summer was great.  Teacher workdays - awesome.  If you made up the hours on other days (and filled out a form documenting it), you didn't have to show up.  Medical and dental plan - excellent.  I had the free time needed to get my family stuff taken care of.  I never entered the building on a weekend, although I occasionally stayed into the evening to finish something up or make up a workday.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat, but I was a ""lateral entry"" teacher (applied math, not math education, degree) and frankly there's a ton of paperwork and other stuff necessary to meet the requirements for renewing the provisional license (i. e., 17 pointless grad-level classes that WOULD require my summers and nights and weekends to be filled up).

There is nothing in your comment that refutes my claim. Rather it is a justification of expropriation based on previous history of this by Europeans against the Jews. Hardly a morally sound position to argue from.

There is however good evidence that if Jews have an ancestral tie to the Middle East, which I am very happy to accept given the extensive historical work in this area, then Palestinians have a similar tie. [Y chromosomal haplotype analysis of Jewish and other populations](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769.full) shows a close affinity between Palestinians and Jews in their genetic inheritance, indicating that these two populations are relatively branches of the same founding population.

A more detailed analysis of [Y haplotypes and mitochondrial inheritance](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297\(07\)60694-6) shows that European Jews, consistent with Jewish matrilineal inheritance, are descended from a limited number of Jewish women. The paternal inheritance is more complicated, with significant input from the local European populations (this is consistent with the data from the previous paper, which shows that the Ashkenazi haplotypes are more closely associated with Europeans than are other Jewish or Middle Eastern groups).

Think about it seriously: From that point on, the Pope became a powerful position, and Christianity remained the religion of the state and usually forced on their subjects.  Eventually (I believe it was) Charlemagne combined the role of Pope and Emperor. When the Roman Empire finally fell, the European royalty remained tied to the Roman Catholic church. Some countries links weakened; in the case of England, they switched to protestantism but still kept Christianity as state religion. As far as the US's predominantly Christian population, the Church of England is the basis for the traditional religion of a great majority of the colonial settlers. It was Constantine's endorsement of Christianity that tied it to government even to this day, about 1700 years later. (BTW it was around that time they switched the sabbath from Saturday to Sunday when the Sun God used to be worshiped, chose Dec. 25 for Christmas which is associated with the winter solstice, and chose the spring equinox for Easter which is when Ostara was celebrated, among other things, all to satiate pagans and ease them into Christianity, being at least allowed to celebrate their traditional holidays.) So you see, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation if Constantine had not done what he did. Perhaps another would have done the same thing, we will never know, but perhaps no one would have. If Christianity had not become popular, neither would Islam, and the world as we know it would be different. Maybe we'd all be pagan. No specific question here, just want your take on it.

Without Ramstein AB, that region of Germany would be one of the poorest in the country (even when compared with former East Germany).  These countries are free to evict the US any time they chose.  For example, Kyrgyzstan is kicking the US out of Manas AB after securing a large aid package from Russia.

Countries that are our allies typically don't mind having US bases in their countries if there is a benefit to it.  The Europeans refused to act in the Balkans until the US took the lead.  It was a lot easier to do with US resources already in the area.  Ramstein C-130s airlifted African Union troops to Sudan to serve as Peacekeepers, something that couldn't happen without that base.

I've heard the same argument made about democracy, as well - which is why the entire ""let's liberate Iraq and democracy will automatically flourish"" story was always a bit suspect.  At any rate, I've been wondering for a while now if the same isn't also possibly true of what we historically have called communism.

Most of the communist countries we've watched collapse were Eastern European - perhaps China just doesn't have much in common with them culturally.

So essentially that means that paternal definitions lose all meaning. If we allow a transition from paternal inheritance to maternal inheritance (the genetics support your contention here by the way - the European Jews show only a limited number, 615, mitochondrial haplotypes, still quite a lot - there were only about 30 Maori haplotypes, concording perfectly with the clans), then when can entirely shift from a genetic entitlement to a cultural entitlement.

My favoured interpretation is that Ishmael and Jacob would have been leaders rather than genetic parents of the tribes. I’m probably not suggesting anything novel in that.

&gt;Actually, its not just about heritage, its officially about Torah too.

OK, so we base it on the  cultural heritage - as for the point above. You’re probably aware by now that I’m not convinced by this since it’s based on potentially biased accounts. But I obviously can’t refute it.

&gt;No, they do not, the vast majority of them are not the descendants of the few who settled in since the Islamic period some 1k+ years ago though plenty of intershagging makes it all very ambiguous. This is ignorance of the highest order and isn't even up for debate. Family names, accents and even family accounts tell the story of immigration over 100 to 200 years give or take.

That denies those that have and the significance of the 100-200 years you admit.

&gt;Well, that's your thought for the day, you may change your mind if you owned a house and got locked up for 12 years giving a squatter enough time to claim adverse possession.

But as you’ve indicated, you (your family) relinquished rights to land in Poland since you left it. Leaving a very long time ago, more than several life times, I would have though is just a little different to a 12 year absence.

&gt;we have that here 99.9% of the time

Peace is not just the absence of war, and I wonder if peaceful Palestinians (not using that rhetorically, but to indicate Palestinians that have no violent motives and just wish to get on with their lives) feel that they have peace when they are held up at checkpoints or prevented from living with their families or working where they previously did.

          restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin
          which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the
          recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights
          and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any
          other field of public life. '

From there it is just a case of defining '[ethnic](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ethnic)'.

        Of or relating to a sizable group of people sharing a common and distinctive
        racial, national, RELIGIOUS, linguistic, or cultural heritage.

But choose your own dictionary; they all seem to include religion.

&gt;But yeah - almost all Muslim countries 

...back to you saying 'but look over there' when it comes to criticising Israel's apartheid.

&gt;So? Several democratic countries with problems are labelled as flawed democracies. Democratic South Africa is labelled as a flawed democracy.

Yeah and they're coming out from having apartheid.  Of course they do appear higher in your democracy index link than apartheid Israel.

&gt;The biggest democracy is also labelled as a “Flawed democracy”. (India has over 700 million voters).

...and a continuation of the 'look elsewhere' argument when addressing Israel's apartheid.

&gt;The list doesn't say that Israel is more flawed than Brazil, Poland or Romania.

...and more still...

&gt;Here you start foaming around the mouth. This is never a good sign – you should get tested for Rabies.

...that's it?  Ethnic cleansing and apartheid as attested by the world's humanitarian groups, including Israel's own, and your response is to call them rabid.  The white elephant is that when it comes to crimes indicative of apartheid you can only respond with this or 'but...but...other bad stuff happens in the world too. Look!'

&gt;You mentioned Iran as an example of a democratic Muslim country. Too bad for you it is a pathetic dictatorship (like Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc...)

Only when you came up with the apartheid defense of 'but Israel is the Middle East's only democracy'.  It's not - we might not like them or we might aspire to more, but there are other Republics in the Middle East, a republic being a form of democracy.  That you call them rotten, call them dictatorships (which clearly they are not) as comparison as to how Israel should not be criticised is telling.  Your defense to Israel's ethnic cleansing and apartheid is to refer to other regimes that you consider Israel aren't as bad as.  

Israel has apartheid.  Boycott has worked before and will work again.

Yes creationist is what I fear the most, especially when hidden out of sight and paid for by state funds. The problem at the moment in most of europe everyone are focused on muslims, and that gives some free room for creationist and radical christians to come out. And normal blue eyed christians can ""hide"" publicly, where as must muslim don't have this opportunity and since many danes really hate muslim believes, its easier than ever to recruit. (we got some nationalistic drums banging but they are not using christianity yet and this is a important point). Im not saying this is happening, but it could or the possibility are there.

Our muslim population isn't that big and I don't see many girls wearing a head scarf anymore, 10-15 years ago it was much more common, but less so today. They are very moderate and would say that islam plays a little role.

Thats why my focus is where it is.

about language and this is perhaps a difficult issue to discuss, since US and Europe are so different in its culture &amp; structure.

You might be right, but on the other hand I do have to point out a big difference and that is when your fed. gov. says: *jump* then everyone disagrees on the issue in between states. This level isn't something we feel very much (EU have yet to show its teeth). You have to imagine if your state made laws like the fed. gov. did and then perhaps you would have good sense how this works.

I can see your point that people just learn one language and keep in their social group and then never gets integrated. Surely it can happen, but I think its more or less impossible in Scandinavian. Since our politicians are all over this and tries many different solution to break this stuff up. I think that in 10-15 years we don't have this problem at all, since I constantly see second generation middle eastern people totally integrated.

Of course you read about all the weird stories from Britain, but its a special case and can't be compared to what's happening in germany or scandinavia. France on the other hand have a huge problem, from what I can gather. Scandinavia/germany can't be compared to the netherlands, belgium, britain or france because it isn't yet a melting pot from all kinds of cultures.

This also explains why Im not scared of muslims where I live, actually Im not scared of it at all, because they have no power what so ever.

Check out what Dr Arthur Pape did on the subject in Australia (essentially,  he sued the Civil Aviation Authority there and won,  since they couldn't produce any valid scientific evidence or study that could justify the discrimination made against color blind folks in aviation);  no more restriction in Australia. The FAA in USA maintains the 'color vision standard' -- but make it pretty easy to get a waiver (basically they give you a list of acceptable alternative tests,  and if you get one of them right,  once,  you are good to go;  failing that,  you can go for the practical 'light gun test' which I eventually passed;  the key is to be able to practice with an actual light gun beforehand);   in Europe,  before the whole JAR thing,  some countries made it possible,  with restrictions,  e.g.,  no night flying,  some not;  I don't really know how it works in these post JAR days;  I mean,  I keep renewing my JAR medical certificate because I had been 'grand fathered in',  not sure if I could get an initial medical if I were to start today; the military however set all sort of limitations justified or not,  because they can.

In practical terms,  there is really no problem flying with being ''color blind'';  for years I have flown with a 'no night flying' restriction;  once I got the waiver,  I went ahead and started flying at night,  and quite frankly I can spot things just as well as other pilots (who are all color blind at night incidentally,  as everybody is...) if not better.  

Again,  read the arguments presented by Dr Pape on the subject;  mainly,  there isn't any situation in aviation,  where colors is your only source of information.

Gotcha - I take it you're just going to pass on the whole de Clerk- Mandela thing of them saying sanctions worked and crippled the apartheid economy :)

&gt;Inflation to this day is very high in South Africa. The biggest cause of inflation is oil prices.

Doesn't change the fact that during apartheid it sky rocketed when oil not so much and that they had to pass laws to keep foreign investors from drawing out their money in anything but Rand.  

BOYCOTT WORKED AGAINST APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA; IT'S ALREADY STARTING TO WORK IN ISRAEL.  

(I mean man did you see all those protests in Europe, the Unions are now voting, ministers are speaking out and Israeli exporters are already speaking out.  Kudos to the Israeli humanitarian groups though - at least they know they're not alone, like Mandela said.)

&gt;NOT ISREAL, CHINA OR THE USA RECOGNISES THE STATUTE OF ROME.  That means that it is not applicable to Israel, the USA or China.

Actually you don't need to be a signatory for the ICC to investigate such a crime - nor does not being a signatory mean that it is not apartheid, only that you want to make it less likely to be caught and to break down the diplomacy to culpability.

&gt;A lot of protests are done by Arabs abroad.

Harder for you to ethnically cleanse/silence them over there isn't it?  But don't play it down...people who joined the protests came from all cross sections.  British Jews joined in too to condemn Israel's behaviour.  Not just [your writers and your c-list celebs](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/03/gaza-israel-protest-shoes-london) either but prominent members of the British Jewish community [were keen to speak out and condemn the Israeli regime's actions](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/11/gaza-israel-letter-british-jews).

       ""There can be no alternative to a negotiated solution,"" said Beecham. 
       ""Israel should be demonstrating, along  with the Palestinian Authority, that there
       are economic and political benefits to be gained from peaceful engagement rather than
       violent confrontation.""

Negotiated solution.  Not really what you'd call breaking a ceasefire, apartheid and ethnic cleansing and the killing of innocent men, women and children - some with chemical weapons.  

&gt;Also – we have seen protests in London against capitalism with the G8. These protests was fairly large – but 99% of people few those who protested as nutcases.

Actually with the G8 you have all sorts of people protesting their own thing; environment, 3rd world debt, war, foreign policies, all sorts of political perspectives.  A LOT of people sympathise with a lot of those things.  Of course some are more passionate than others but meh....

...are you saying that the march to protest Israel's actions was other than a march to protest Israel's actions?  Wouldn't the carbon emission protesters realise that their message was being misrepresented.  

LOL - no, you believe that hundreds of thousands of people turning onto the streets of Europe's capitals to protest is not a sign of grievance if you wish. 

&gt;This just shows how positive view of Israel foreign governments and people have. Would people support giving money to Israel if it wasn't popular among the electorate?

Puurleeaaase tell me you don't genuinely believe that.  You really do need to get out of Tel Aviv more.  Fuck...you have a computer.  Walk about a bit on the intertubes. EVEN ISRAELIS ARE PROTESTING ON BEHALF OF THE PALESTINIANS AND ARABS AGAINST ISRAEL.  Israeli soldiers are throwing down their guns and saying - ""no I'm not doing it no more.""

But I'll give you a hand, the BBC did a World Poll:

http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/views_on_countriesregions_bt/325.php?nid=&amp;id=&amp;pnt=325&amp;lb=btvoc

          Israel is viewed quite negatively in the world...just 17 percent have a positive
          view, the least positive rating for any country evaluated. In 23 countries the
          most common view is negative, with only two leaning towards a positive view and
          two divided.

          Unsurprisingly, the most negative views of Israel are found in the predominantly
          Muslim countries in the Middle East, with very large majorities in Lebanon (85%),
          Egypt (78%), Turkey (76%), and the UAE (73%) having negative views.

          Large majorities also have negative views in Europe, including Germany (77%),
          Greece (68%) and France (66%). Indonesia (71%), Australia (68%) and South
          Korea (62%) are the most negative countries in the Asia/Pacific region.
          Brazilians (72%) are the most negative in Latin America.

          The two countries that tend to view Israel positively do so in modest numbers.
          Forty-five percent of Nigerians and 41 percent of Americans have positive views of
          Israel's influence in the world, while nearly one-third in each country has
          negative views. 

I'd love it if Israel were the most popular, most humanitarian, most peaceful country in the world - as it is considered the LEAST POPULAR!  The closest in the doldrums being  Iran!  You know Iran - that one Israel wants to attack.  That's what the world thinks of Israel.  Don't get too upset - they just need to stop acting like assholes and you need to stop trying to cover for them and be proud enough to criticise!

&gt;Uhm.. You selecct an article from 2007. Here is an newer article:

Strange that - you seem to think that despite Israel having national service, despite Israelis being prepared to go to prison to avoid serving, despite veterans writing letters of protest saying they will not take part in Israel's offensives...

...you seem to think that Israel having to recruit from overseas is a positive.  LOL.  That second perspective is a bitch innit?

&gt;It is funny for me that you admire cowards who dodge military service. I think it speaks much about you.

Ahh..it's that second perspective again.  See when someone in authority tells you to do something that is clearly wrong I think it takes a far braver person of strong conviction to do what is right and to question that authority.  Of course there are a good number of veterans who have already served in wars that they felt justifiable who have since signed their names to letters saying ['this we will not do'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/dec/03/israel).  Surely their valor in battle has already been proven.  [

How would you know - lol, you think Israel is really popular all over the place.  First of all there's only 13.2 million in the world.  As it is in the West we saw European Jews lining up with other Europeans to condemn Israel's actions in massive protests.

Which leads us conveniently to point 3 which you missed.

**Judaism ≠ Israel**

Judaism is great. I mean admittedly I'm only as Jewish as I am Muslim and I'm only as Muslim as I am Druid.  You get the idea.  If someone wants to be Jewish then good luck to them and I hear the holidays are great.  But being Jewish does not mean you are Israeli and even being Israeli doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't criticise the apartheid system existing in Israel or the ethnic cleansing it carries out.  Almost 2/3rds of Jewish people choose not to live in Israel and plenty of Israelis choose to speak out against the crimes; the apartheid, the ethnic cleansing, and the attempt to hide them. [People are waking up to this](http://www.alternet.org/story/62618/)...more and more appear all the time.  Not just the humanitarians like the highly admirable B'Tselem and the people of strong moral fiber at Yesh Gvul, but like those American Jews linked in that last link titled ""For American Jews, Dissent Against Israel Has Become Mainstream"" who don't think that ongoing war or oppression is either right
or justified.

Point 4, I said, *""The Israel Manufacturers Association has already reported exporters are being hit by the boycott.""*  To which you ask,

 ""Yeah? Is that due to economic curcumstances or a boycott?""

Well, I did provide the link and it did say in it but I suppose I could do the work for you.  Jpost, headline: **Exporters suffer anti-Israel boycotts** 

             ""In addition to the problems and difficulties arising from the global economic
             crisis, 21 percent of local exporters report that they are facing problems

You are naïve. Jews are generally a very close knit group – where ever they are in the world. Several Jews live abroad but go back home for a few years. A network of synagogues keeps Jews connected – and most Jewish people know other Jewish people in the are (it is not like other minorities that disperse and completely integrates).

&gt; Almost 2/3rds of Jewish people choose not to live in Israel 

Not completely. You fail to understand how the Jewish diaspora came into existence. Jews were dispersed out of Israel by the Romans. They lived mostly Europe and still kept their own identity and close connections of each other. In the 30ies a lot of Jews fled Germany and got scattered around the world – they started lives elsewhere. 

Only after Germany was defeated and Britain gave Israel to the Jews is it when Israel was created (i.e. the Jews were already dispersed throughout the world).

You would probably not know this – but it is not as easy for the Jews (or anyone else) to leave successful businesses and lives and go to Israel: but this does not mean that they do not support the state of Israel.

Outbreaks were widespread and killed people who hadn't even had contact with Europeans at that point. If you recall, the Plymouth colony was founded nearby the ruins of a native village which had been completely wiped out by smallpox years before the pilgrims landed. Only one member of the tribe was alive in 1620... and that was Squanto... and he died only a couple years later of, guess what -- smallpox. 

This is not to say that biological warfare wasn't unfairly used against natives -- it was and this is dispicable. However, by the time that this had begun, the vast majority of native peoples had already been killed off in the previous centuries due to these widespread outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases. 

Keep in mind, this is also one of the main reasons why native peoples were conquered with little resistance. Since the natives had been so wiped out by the spread of disease in the first centuries after contact with Europeans, as the Europeans made contact with other groups as they ventured deeper within the continent, their populations were very sparse and were greatly outnumbered by Europeans. So this made it especially easy for Europeans to wipe out native populations further.

I'm not excusing the Europeans and their descendants here. They did nothing to help the natives, and everything to hurt them... but you also have to realize that far more natives were killed off by the spread of disease than by anything else.

The Dutch don’t do such things on their own. They believe they should be handled by the system. To an American, that’s a lack of individual initiative.”

so today, when political movements take off and invoke religion to appeal to the masses, part of it is backlashing against the europeans - that we can't treat our women the way europeans do because that's exactly what they tried to make us do 200 years ago.. we have to be different and assert a political / religious unique identity, whether or not it is a good idea or even a religious one... it just has to be visibily different from the west.

The biggest piece of advice any volunteer will give you is to be flexible. The application/screening process will take months, or sometimes over a year. Mine took almost two years by the time I got my medical taken care of. You will have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy

When I went to an information session before signing up, the guy explained there were three things you can be fussy about: where you go, what you do, and when you go. You can usually afford to be fussy about one of those things, but getting fussier than that will either delay the process while they try to find something that suits you, or it may tell the Corps that you are not a flexible enough person to survive/thrive in a third world setting. I really wanted Eastern Europe, but made clear that at that point in my career, I have to be in computer tech, or I would need to wait until I had a career solid enough for me to put on hold for a few years. I ended up in computer tech in the Sahara instead. 

And you will need to be flexible. There were times that I had to wait days to find a car from my village to the city (and this  city of about 30,000 was the largest for a few hundred miles in any direction), waiting hours in line at the bank (and I mean literal hours not that whiny ""I've been waiting here forever"" that most people here give you after five minutes) having to wait for hours because your taxi driver feels like driving off even further to the middle of nowhere to visit a friend for lunch. Plus you will be surrounded by people who just don't get our western snippity punctuality, our ways of doing business and so on. You will have to adapt a lot to keep from going insane, but don't forget who you are. Part of the deal of Peace Corps is that you are introducing others to what Americans are like.

The reason service is two years is that it takes a long time to adjust and integrate into your new home. The idea is that you will spend most of the first year making contacts, learning how your host society functions, learning the language and so on. Then after 6 months or so, you find out what your community really needs from you, what you can do for a project, and get things moving. You will be given an assignment after training, but in many cases that is more of a guideline than a contract. You can quit at any time. This isn't the army. But you should be prepared to make the full commitment.

As a vehemently opposed Socialist, I really don't understand why you crawled out of your /r/Libertarian pit to speak to me on /r/Socialism.

&gt;requires government but for one reason only: To remove the force and coercion from personal relationships

The existence of the state (Parliament, Judiciary, Military, Police in the case of Capitalist ""Democracies"") is solely on the basis of imposing, through force, the will of one class on all others. Without the protection of *private ownership law* Capitalism cannot function. Individual rights have been proven to be flushed down the toilet at a moments notice - not only by Governments, but also by Capitalists.

Consider work place rights. At a moment's notice (literally) workers can be fired, can have that pay docked or wages cut, can have their hours cut. Often they're overworked, lose lunchbreaks and ""Smoko"" breaks etc. It is my individual right to work *less* than eight hours a day (as it is only necessary to work more than that under *capitalism*), with above standard working conditions, with a decent return for the investment of my labor. That does not happen. Don't wax individual rights to me when the Class you fully support bashes and distorts any notion of ""rights"" at its convenience.

But you did hit the nail on the head, at least from a Marxist Socialist's perspective. The creation of Socialism is indeed to *impose through force the will of working people on their former capitalist rulers and state beauracracies.*

Actually, Capitalism exists because of a natural progression from Feudalism. With the birth of guildsmen, petty shop owners, the transition from peasant to merchant and so on. Capitalism exists because the societies that birthed each of its basic building blocks were class societies with rulers and and exploited peoples. Capitalism, like them, is no different. Let's take a peek back at 1917 - 1920s. Capitalism exists because it *forcefully* and successfully put down revolutions through Europe. Bosses locking out workers after docking their pay. Governments sending standing armies to fire on protesting workers, Bosses literally sabotaging factories that had been appropriated by communities of workers because the Boss was to sell it off after being unable to turn a profit.

It is not the case where the majority birthed Capitalism of their own will. It is the case as it was with Feudal society - it is imposed, and forcefully subjected those who would be exploited to brutal repression to concrete itself.

Anyway, I could rant on all day I guess, but I really, really didn't want to reply the first time let alone rabble on forever.

Fuck me you're slow on the uptake....

&gt;Here is a quote from the study of the efficacy of the sanctions:

No link or attribution unlike de Klark calling apartheid economoy failed or Mandela calling for civil unrest at any point the boycott weakens to further put off investors...or that the oil was flat, gold was up but the Rand's inflation still shot out.  How about [something from the chairman of anti-apartheid committee](http://www.anc.org.za/un/pr/pr0222-78.html)?

*""The Special Committee would lay particular stress on the full implementation of the arms embargo against South Africa and the institution of economic sanctions, particularly with respect to investments and loans, and the supply of petroleum and petroleum products.""*

Economic sanctions...he likes 'em.

&gt;Not only that – apartheid South Africa supplied arms and resources to Israel (the steel for the Merkava tank comes from South Africa). So what? The USA also did business with South Africa!

So you are familiar with the concept that receiving arms from one country does not mean the people of that country support it - unless you are arguing openly now that Israel supported apartheid.

I like how you talk about South African steel used in tanks as if trade agreements with an apartheid state is okey-dokey.  Israel got a lot more than tank steel.  It got its Uranium from there too.

&gt;Israel continued to work with South Africa until the early 1990ies 

In response to Boycotting aparheid had stopped it before....LOL!!!

Are you really going to argue that boycott doesn't work because Israel was able to keep supporting apartheid in South Africa long after everybody else.  You really can't keep track of two things at once, can you?

&gt;Have you visited either South Africa or Palestine? (answer it please) I get the feeling that I am the only one in this conversation who have lived in Israel and South Africa.

COURSE YOU HAVE BUDDY!  Course you have...conversation goes bad for you and you stomp your little feet and cry but I've been there.  Well heads up - I've been in both :)

&gt;Your buddies Hamas broke the ceasefire.

My buddies?  Is that where you want to go - that if somebody disagrees with supporting Israel's apartheid and ethnic cleansing then they must be in bed with Hamas.

But Hamas didn't break the ceasefire.  The Israeli government sanctioned air strikes and a land incursion on November 4th - Israeli intelligence later admitted that they had no evidence to say that Hamas paramilitaries had fired any rockets.  Not one.  [Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev got quite flustered when he realised that we knew what he knew.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfFMZ7Y-s_c)

&gt;Or the public got sick of Palestinian rockets and decided something should be done.

The ceasefire was working.  Hamas for the first time had even been rounding up and arresting paramilitaries outside Hamas coming into Gaza.   The public knew nothing of the November 4th escalation - that was a board meeting.  Rockets came after that.  Maybe now you'll start to question what it is you are supporting.  Doubt it though.

&gt;[That made Lieberman, a fascist, a kingmaker to the Israeli regime.]  Your nativity shows up here again. Joe Lieberman is an American Democratic senator of Jewish descent.
Shimon Perez is the President of Israel. Since it is up to the President to nominate the prime minister (and select the parties who will form the cabinet), he is described as a “Kingmaker”. Perez is also a moderate in Israeli politics (he is a member of the more moderate Kadima party while Netanyahu is a member of the more conservative Likud party).


AU CONTRAIRE - IT IS CLEAR YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN ISRAEL.  I SAID LIEBERMAN....

...


[**AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN**](http://www.google.com/search?q=avigdor+lieberman+kingmaker&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3RNFA_enFR281FR281)

And since it is clear you've never heard of him you won't know about the new cabinet, the policies that have been spoken about, the platform, Yisrael Beiteinu.  I love it that you went ahead and said, ""This really shows how naïve you are about Israel and Israeli politics"" when you clearly don't have a clue.

&gt;Just because I do not currently live in Israel does not mean I have not in the past. I also have business dealings there. Have you ever been to Israel or South Africa? Even just on holiday?

So when apartheid and ethnic cleansing arises you wish people to bow down to your argument because you expect them to believe that you guy-from-internet once had 'business dealings'.  Seriously.  Lame.

&gt;Do you know how big fuckload of people have dual passports? If people wants to come from abroad and serve in the military they can do so!

Which makes it even more hysterical when  people living there are doing everything they can to get out of it ([well one in four!](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/888399.html)) because Israeli people are realising what Israel is doing is wrong.  And then you have people who won't serve in either combat units or in the OT.

&gt;I have showed you that the suicide rate in the IDF is lower than in most European countries! Can't you read dickweed?

With a serious spike with those in the first year and where are the most suicides from???  

Fact of the matter is if someone joins the IDF the chances of them taking their own life in the first year is not only the most likely way they'll die - the chances of it happening go radically UP!

&gt;No – cities breed a lot of cowards – they try not to serve because they are scared of fighting. I have seen some funny things. I saw a guy who shot his hand because he was too scared to do military service

Internet guy once saw something.  Well, *that* makes it real!  I'd have thought shooting one's hand is something you'd do in private...

Still brave people who go toe to toe with the organised authoritarian masses to tell them that what they're doing is wrong.  Major Kudos if you'll excuse the pun.

&gt;You are quoting an anti-draft site who is quoting an anonymous draft dodger who have never been in the military about military statistics. How would he know what the suicide rate among draftees is if he is not in the military?

Because he's seen kids he knew come home that way.  Cos Israelis have developed this miraculous communication system they call  'talking'?  Because the IDF had to stop releasing figures?

&gt;Even if the suicide rate is higher for first years – that would mean that other service men become magically extremely happy

Or that they became extremely desensitized, extremely broken or simply refused (WHICH A LOT DO!)

&gt;So, in your next post answer these questions for me:

Okey-dokey Internet guy.

&gt;1.Have you ever been in Israel?

Bits of it.

&gt;2.Have you ever been in South Africa?

Done that.

&gt;3.Why do you think a democratic senator from Connecticut, USA is the president of Israel?

I don't, I think AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN is the Deputy Prime Minsiter of Israel, Minister for Foreign Affairs and founder of [Yisrael Beiteinu](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1061910.html) and because he came 3rd in the election but held the power of coalition to either first or second place he was dubbed by the media a [Kingmaker](http://www.google.com/search?q=avigdor%20lieberman%20kingmaker&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;tab=nw).

&gt;4.  How old are you? (i'm betting below 18)

Internet guy starts creeping me out...

&gt;5.  Have you ever had a statistics course of any kind?

Yes

&gt;6.Do you know how an average is calculated?

Y'up, I also know what negative skew is γ=μ/σ and that something is not right in the land of Israel.  Kids joining up to the IDF see something that makes them tell other kids not to join, something that makes suicide the number one killer.

My point is this. 
The brave little Israel myth is bullshit. They are the powerful well connected outsiders. They have taken over the land of an entirely innocent population of date growers and goat herders. The suffering of the jews was alleviated by bringing about the suffering of this innocent population. That is wrong yet has been disguised by reams of self denial and bullshit.

two quotes for you to ponder. 

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

And this one really nails it considering the date.

“The wealthy, crowded, progressive Jewish state will lie in the plains and on the seacoasts of Palestine. Around it, in the hills and the uplands, stretching far and wide into the illimitable deserts the war-like Arabs of Syria, of Transjordania, of Arabia, backed by the armed forces of Iraq, offer the ceaseless menace of war. To maintain itself the Jewish state will be armed to the teeth and must bring in every able-bodied man to strengthen its army. But how long will this process be allowed to continue by the great Arab populations in Iraq and Palestine? Can it be expected that the Arabs would stand by impassively and watch the building up with Jewish world capital and resources of a Jewish army equipped with the most deadly weapons of war until it was strong enough not to be afraid of them? And if ever the Jewish army reached that point, who can be sure that cramped within their narrow limits it would not plunge out into the new, undeveloped lands that lie around them.” Winston Churchill 1937

If the Pope could marry, he certainly could be tempted to really provide for his offspring, deriving a tiny part of these riches to them. See the Renaissance Popes for more info on that. I mean, celibacy works. In general, all that the Catholic church does work. They are survivalists. They have to be, to have survived two thousand years. They will adapt to the times, but the core of the system will remain, because it's based on the human nature, and that doesn't change.

And, anyway, before criticizing the Church, which certainly has done its share of terrible things, I'd like to point that, IMO, without it, the Western Civilization would very likely be still in the Somalia stages of development. The Church, in the Middle Ages in Europe, preserved Roman and Greek knowledge, gave a meritocratic path for intelligent people that was different from the fighter path, but lead also to power and riches. Also, the much-maligned sexual taboos, helped delay matrimony and so allow for richer and better educated couples. When you marry your daughters at fourteen, bad economical things happen, as the Arab countries can attest (they were more developed than the European countries, in the Middle Ages, you know. The Chinese were too, but they also stagnated). The Church de-facto dropped their objections to lending with interest when it was clear that it worked (again survivalism, and again a thing that still holds back the Muslim civilization). The virgin Mary cult slowly empowered women, and women empowerment is the most important step to civilization (check a ranking of countries' quality of life, and another of women participation in public-economic life, and you'll see a clear correlation)

There are much more examples of how the Catholic Church was one of the leading forces is getting us out of the feudal system, and into something that works a bit better. Now don't get me wrong, all the God stuff was just for the masses, as the Church bishops could probably tell you at any time in its history. But I'm all for the Church. Even now, can you tell what makes a country successful, and other a failure? The Church, or rather the shared culture that it enforced and is still setting a referent to, is part of that, and a positive one. I wouldn't just, you know, abolish it, even if I could.

Of course, in those countries, even an unemployed person gets access to health care and higher education and other basic services that aren't available to many *employed* Americans.

As for the British going abroad for medical treatment: at least they have the choice. Many Americans simply *cannot* get the medical care they need. And, even if they can, whenever studies have been done, Americans spend more on health care for worse results than the British.

Mind you, the complaints the british have about NHS (MRSA, long waiting lines for essential surgery) apply equally to most americans - MRSA is a major problem in US hospitals, and unless you happen to be wealthy enough to be able to make arrangements at an expensive hospital, it can take a long time to get a major operation done - if you can get it at all.

But I note you bring up Britain, rather than, say, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemborg, Malta, the Netherlands,  Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, or Switzerland. I wonder why that is.

ETA: I found unemployment rates for the EU up to March of 2008; the highest rate I found at that time was Slovakia, with 9.8%. Of course, the EU doesn't use the bullshit American 'unemployment rate' definition which was implemented in 1967, but actually counts all the people between, I believe, 15 and 75, who are unemployed.

Incidentally, if you look at the true unemployment measures in the US (the U-5 or U-6, rather than the U-3), in March 2008, the US either had 5.9% unemployment (if you don't count those working part-time who want full-time work), or 9.1% (if you count those working part-time because they cannot find full-time work).

As of March of this year, the highest rate in the EU I can find is Spain at 17.4%, compared to the US's 8.8% (using the stricter definition) to 13.5% (including those working part-time unwillingly). Of course, the EU as a whole only had an unemployment rate of 8.3% in March. And if you compare EU countries to US states... the U-3 (official unemployment rate) for Michigan in March 2009 was 12.6%. Assuming the U-5 and U-3 rates in Michigan are related by about the same proportions as they are nationally, that translates to a 14.5% or more unemployment rate - not much better than Spain's.",True,t1_c09bds5,3,c09bfr3,1425964330,1241446119,t1_c09bfr3,0,True,t3_8hkj1,t5_2cneq

si1kyfish,7,atheism,0,0,False,,,,"HOWEVER, OSC makes some okay points too.

(1) &lt;i&gt;They raise the false claim that religions have caused all kinds of evil in the world. But this merely shows that they are willing to speak without physical evidence, because history shows, not that religion causes wars and persecutions, but rather that humans are prone to war and persecution, and then invoke whatever excuse their belief system provides them to justify their actions.&lt;/i&gt;

Black is the new pink. Sex is the new black. And statehood is the new religion. True story. Before there were no nations as we think of them (not as long ago as you think-- 500 yrs max [before that, in most of Western Europe, it was simply allegiance to a King as a matter of divine lineage-- religion]), there were clans and religious affiliations. Tribes are always fighting. When statehood become the new fad, wars continued, the inhumanity followed. Those religious wars are not a matter of incompatible belief but rather, clans' natural desire to dominate.

Now, to be fair, the Romans coined, ""To rule, divide,"" and that happens in the states, on the topic of religion. But if it weren't for religion, our elected leaders would find another strategy to divide and rule. (When we all get together and bash religious extremists, we are complicit in this corruption.)

(2) &lt;i&gt;In fact, one could, with far more merit, argue that religious faith tempers the actions of believers, and that the evils done by nominally Christian societies were done only by those who deviated from the norms and teachings of their faith.&lt;/i&gt;

I was going to wait to the end to divulge, but I will now: I am neither religious nor atheistic or agnostic. Call me a humanist, I don't care. That's the point, I don't care. I don't even think about it save in human terms.  But truly, I grew up United Methodist outside Philly. The preacher kept to the administratively assigned texts each Sunday, but sometimes declared that he didn't care for a passage and told us why for an hour, and then opened it up to discussion. A church that asked us to think! The preacher was a professor at a nearby university on topics like the compatibility of faith and science.

These churches are out there. I don't go to them, want nothing to do with any steeples. But, point in fact: these churches are out there in numbers you don't know. OSC might not belong to one, however, his point is valid because attacking the speaker of an argument in order to attack the argument is, of itself, an Ad Hominem logical fallacy. So, whether OSC is a dick or not (I certainly think he is), this is true. There are lots of Christians out there that are Christ-like too. You won't find them on CNN or Reddit, but OSC has a point here, whether he knows it or not.

(3) &lt;i&gt;Intolerant, rigid, closed-minded atheism offers no visible improvements over intolerant, rigid, closed-minded religion. &lt;/i&gt;

I have never seen, on Reddit, a post that praises a faith-motivated effort towards charity, generosity, sacrifice, love for a stranger.

On the other hand, you don't find much of that on the news.

Okay, done with the balancing act. It is itself a logical fallacy to assert that OSC's article lacks valuable points because OSC is OSC. On the other hand, I find that lots of us Redditors believe that every church is taking turns with the eight year old girls in the graveyard out back. This is what they want you to believe. And if you do, you are dividing our society just the way they want you too. Accept that faithful folk might not be ign'ant hicks. They might just want to believe.

The conception of the nation itself is defined by Anderson (1991) as “an imagined political community--and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.”  In many cases, including Denmark, this community is brought together by a common culture, language, and territory and thus is in a way an ethnic identity.  A state, on the other hand, is commonly understood as “a legal and physical entity that operates within a fixed and populated territory, has authority over that territory, is legally and politically independent, and is recognized by its people and by other states” (McCormick, 2004).   The relationship between nation and state has been evaluated in two different models.  In the first model, called the French model the state and the nation are understood to be fused together, in a mutually constitutive relationship.  The corresponding national identity is also understood as “Western” national identity, or political civic national identity.  Many restraints are implied in this model, especially for European integration. In particular, integration has to be articulated as non- threatening to the bond between the nation and the state, since people in these contexts can see a threat to the state as a threat to the nation, and a threat to the nation is highly unfavorable. The other constellation, the German constellation, constructs the state and the nation differently; their relationship is much less dependent.  Therefore, the state and the nation can coexist separately.  What is also significant to the German constellation is that the nation emphasizes culture, language, and blood, described as a Kulturnation, rather than a nation based on political means.   For the German constellation, European integration does not have the constraints that the French constellation does, since that close connection between nation and state does not exist, and they are thought to be two separate entities (Hansen &amp; Wæver).",True,t3_8hphw,6,c09bgm1,1425964341,1241448413,t1_c09bgm1,0,False,t3_8hphw,t5_2qh1i

Gaabo,6,reddit.com,0,0,False,,,,"I will be shot by finnish reditors, but anyhow i'll take a shot too in this. :P Let me tell about the dark side of this luxury:

1. Finland have been sentenced in 74 violations for  human rights (mostly freedom of speech violations) in last 15y by ECHR (European Court for Human Rights). Sweden = 22, Iceland = 6 etc.

2. Only your ""wrong"" smell (read looks, wrong face etc) is a reason enough to do a home search by the police (at least 2 times this year is reported nationally)

3. Mandatory military service up to 12 months for all male citizen under 30y of age.

4. Total amount of taxes are easily up to 70-80% of your income. Unless one is filthy rich, then you can pass under 50%. 

5. All corporations etc. have to pay taxes to the church. No exceptions.

6. If you have been baptized to a church you have to pay taxes to it until you have reached the age of 18. It doesn't matter whether you are a member of the church or not. 

7. It is legal in Finland to bribe political parties as much as any one pleases. No control what so ever. If one candidate receives more than 1700EUR in one transaction he has to report it. Needless to say how much a seat in a conference with that candidate costs.

8. All institutions (private, corporate, public) have right to monitor all Internet activity for their users / clients if they please (and pay fee to the government) by law.

9. If you are not a ""productive member"" of society, public heath care doesn't concern you. Most weakest members of the society have to pay their medicines upfront from their sub 300EUR monthly government aid, what practically renders the whole class of people outside of the health care system. Unless you are immediate danger to die.

10. judicial system is only for you if you meet one of two conditions: 1) matter is between two private citizens or 2) you have money to pay for a lawyer. ""Public lawyers"" do not bite the hand who feeds them. I know one case for a fact when a police dog was send to bite a man in purpose, resulting that half of his ear was bitten off when he was on the ground handcuffed and was held down by officers. No charges. Many witnesses. 

11. Government upholds actively private and public cartels and monopolies. For example, there are 2 importers of daily goods that holds more than 90% of markets. Those to importers gets best marketplaces, best deals and most of their projects are subsidized by government, so no one else has very little change of success. That goes for operators too.

12. Free education really means free classes. You still have to pay for your living, books, tools etc. you need in a school (except primary school). So basically you need a job or as our government wants it, to take a “fairly cheap” debt from private banks. So after high-school and university it is not uncommon to have 40 000 EUR of debt. And that is just one way Finnish government subsidizes banks. 

13. Finnish people are blind as bats when it comes to their freedoms and submissive.  Most of them doesn't know what is to be free, nor understand. They have been slaves for so many decades that they do not actually even want to know. They are just happy to live out their lives in their little bubble. Everything that jeopardies that is promptly attacked and silenced.  It is a taboo to talk about freedoms. In my opinion is that so,  because last wars are so close by (civil and WW2).  So it is preferred that everyone just STFU and row that boat. 


For the end: Finland is de facto a fascists state.  Wikipedia:”Fascism is a radical and authoritarian nationalist political ideology. Fascism is also a corporatist economic ideology” Only difference is, that political parties comes with different spices. Some are bit green, some bit red, but they are all the same. There is not a one single thing you can do in this country unless the almighty government doesn't approve. Not to build a house, you cannot even own the land. You have a “license” to own a land, but government can and will take it from you (or abuse it), if it pleases corporations or itself.  There is not a real political, economical nor religious freedom. 

There is only two good thing about Finland, 1) that the people are mostly nice. They are blind as bats when it comes to their freedoms and submissive, but nice altogether.  2) Nature is mostly clean.

Meanwhile:

**UN report:** 22% of Palestinian children under five are suffering from malnutrition—a three-fold increase from 2000. * 9.3% suffer acute malnutrition—an eight-fold increase from 2000. 15.6% suffer acute anemia, which can lead to permanent impairment of physical and mental development. Food consumption has fallen 30% per capita; 60% of Palestinian households now live in acute poverty; and 50% are dependent on international food aid.

**British Medical Journal:** A 2004 field study published in the British Medical Journal reported that, in the previous four years, ""Two-thirds of the 621 children . . . killed [by the Israelis] at checkpoints . . . on the way to school, in their homes, died from small arms fire, directed in over half the cases to the head, neck and chest - the sniper's wound."" A quarter of Palestinian infants under the age of five are acutely or chronically malnourished. The Israeli wall ""will isolate 97 primary health clinics and 11 hospitals from the populations they serve.""

**USAid Report:** The report, by the US Agency for International Development, showed more than one-fifth of young Palestinian children are malnourished. This is more than a threefold increase since the last study two years ago. The plight of children under 5 years of age was particularly alarming. Twenty-two percent of Palestinian children under age 5 were malnourished, up from seven percent in an agency survey two years ago. Of that number, nine percent suffered from acute malnutrition—resulting from poor nutrition over the short term—and 13 percent suffered from chronic malnutrition—longer-term deficiencies that can result in stunted growth. About 20 percent of children under 5 had some form of anaemia.

**The Red Cross Report:** The Israeli blockade of Gaza has led to a steady rise in chronic malnutrition among the 1.5 million people living in the strip, according to a leaked report from the Red Cross. It chronicles the ""devastating"" effect of the siege that Israel imposed after Hamas seized control in June 2007 and notes that the dramatic fall in living standards has triggered a shift in diet that will damage the long-term health of those living in Gaza and has led to alarming deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and vitamin D.

**European Union Report:** The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: ""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"". The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that “in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”

**Israels attitude.** ""The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet,"" jokes Dov Weisglass, Olmert adviser.

What they're actually doing here is vaguely inspired by Joseph Greenberg.

This map doesn't accept Greenberg's theory - it says ""American Indian (several families)"" rather than Amerind - but it still uses Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, and Other American Indian as categories.

However, there's an additional element at play - the fact that when problems arise in a marriage, there's not nearly as much incentive to work things out if there are other people to fuck.

So yes, I've seen plenty of swinging and/or polyamorous relationships work. However, I've yet to see one that had any sort of longevity - in my experiences, once polyamory is introduced, the longest I could expect to see a relationship last would be about a year, and that's being generous.

Regarding your comment about the Europeans, TheDentite, you also have to acknowledge the complex social and religious influences at play. Marrying for love is a relatively new phenomenon - in medieval Europe it was primarily a social and economic alliance between families. Married couples for the most part did not have any option of divorce. So, given those social constraints, of course it made sense to have lovers on the side. 

But today, in modern American society, the assumption is that you marry for Love (regardless of the particular reality of a situation), which holds a whole boatload of subconscious expectations in a relationship, including that the person you marry is the One. And I can't say this clearly enough - even if everything is above board, even if its been talked out, permissions have been granted, and everyone is happily fucking their brains out - you lose that perception (whether real or not) of her being your One and she being yours. 

I'm not saying this is right, or that polyamory / swinging is wrong. But in my experience, very few relationships can expect any sort of longevity without monogamy. Certainly, from my standpoint, despite the fact that permission has been given, I love my wife far too much to risk hurting or losing her for a quick fuck.

Plus, she's totally cool with my expressions of sexuality, including porn &amp; fantasies, so there's no real sexual repression in our marriage that needs an outlet with another person (PS to women reading this - seriously, if you're cool about what gets him off and include yourself in it, there will be little reason for him to stray).

&gt;working poverty

Yes, we have more ""working poverty.""  That is the reason we have less insured people.  Alcoholism, high cholesterol, obesity, murder rates... they are all correlated with poverty.  Maybe our efforts should be on defeating these issues which *medical care does not address.*  Providing health insurance to everyone doesn't suddenly make obesity go away or murder rates go down.

&gt;So which European nation banned alcohol? food?

None have, I merely stated that to defeat those issues in the United States we would have to stop the medical causes of the health problems which is beyond the scope of universal health insurance.

&gt; Fairness?

Yes, you are worried an awful lot about fairness.  Not everyone is covered by health insurance in the United States because we still have the semblance of a free-market health care system.  So because a free-market system that has been invaded by government over-regulation and mandates and a culture of hyper-litigation, we should throw it all out for a ""universal health care"" system which reduces the quality of medical care, rations it to the point of near-eugenics, and stagnates the economies and innovation of the host countries.  Have you noticed that even sleeping Europe is starting to wake up to its demographic and economic demise and trying to become *more* free market?  Do you notice that unemployment rates in the larger European countries that employ the welfare-state mentality are perpetually at 10%, and higher among immigrants?  Do you notice that *no* country of our size has ever sustained a health care system of that type unless it had totalitarian control?  Britain is one of the larger European countries and suffers from the most rationing and the most out-of-control health care cost-cutting.

Affirmative action and political correctness aren't the same thing. Political correctness is why people say African-American instead of black, shouldn't refer to the 9-11 hijackers as Arab or Muslim, [why some Christians have been ordered to remove crosses from their necks or be fired](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410299/Christian-BA-employee-legal-action-suspension-wearing-cross.html), it's happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, it's why thought can be a crime particularly in Europe, why people actually suggest calling illegal aliens in America ""undocumented workers"" as an example. It's essentially a self-segregating behavior when certain groups are removed from the whole lest they offend 10 people.

&gt;Her assigned texts didn't excuse her from dealing with people because of their sexuality. They just said in extreme circumstances referral could be a last resort. It was her first resort.

Her first resort was to consult with her instructor, as per the guidelines she is expected to follow and as the book states. Refer to 235-236 of Knowing Your Values a attached to the PDF towards the end. It's a specific addressing of why this student was expelled from her program verifying that in fact nearly half of councilors have to make referrals when it comes to sexuality. In fact referrals are taught and suggested as an option for irreconcilable differences in general. In fact this is from the ACA code itself:

&gt;A.11.b. Inability to Assist Clients
If counselors determine an inability
to be of professional assistance to
clients, they avoid entering or con-
tinuing counseling relationships.
Counselors are knowledgeable about
culturally and clinically appropriate
referral resources and suggest these
alternatives. If clients decline the sug-
gested referrals, counselors should
discontinue the relationship

That would be fair enough. But advertising herself as a proper councellor when she stands firmly against the available science in the field, is just false advertising. It makes the degree worthless. I can see why the university doesn't like it.

So you are suggesting a Christian with traditional Christian values shouldn't be allowed to achieve certain degrees? There are laws protecting that. There are state and federal laws protecting that as well and to say she shouldn't be allowed to practice seems to imply that at least 40% of counselors shouldn't be allowed to be counselors since that is a statistic cited in the book specifically for this issue. The ACA code does go into further detail on these types of things. See section D2A, A9B as well as earlier noted references that relate to referrals. And no counseling isn't a science and really neither is psychology in the sit down and talk sense of the word as opposed to psychology which studies human behavior.

For the same reason it was OK to tell crusaders in the 12th century you can't live here anymore.  It's the nature of war.  The side that starts the war is in the wrong and has to pay the price, in this case not getting to keep stolen land no matter how many kids they had there.

In any case, bfd regarding the 750,000 palestinians who fled or were forced to flee. The same number of Jews were forced to flee Muslim lands. In your words, the Jews were ethnically cleansed also.

Why can't the Palestinians fight to get their land back then?  Not everyone from that era is dead yet.  

&gt;Native Americans didn't get citizenship until 1924, roughly 300 years after we started taking their land at gun-point. Israel's only had 60 years. So I'm not buying this distinction between the colonization of the new world from the Israeli action.

It's a despicable position to take to say that the crimes of Europeans against Native Americans justify the crimes of Israel against the Palestinians.  

&gt;I think my point still stands. People are guilty of the crimes they commit, but not their parents. If you've lived in Israel your entire life, that's your home, whether you are Jew or Muslim. No one should have the right to take your shit. And if you stole someone else's shit, it's not yours.

My own position is my class position. I am a member of the *working class* it is in my *objective material interests* for the working class to smash its lording minority. What other position is there?

&gt;Just because morality is ""subjective"" (I guess by that you mean it's a value not held by ""objects""?) that doesn't mean it's automatically ""always changing"" or ""flawed"".

Umm, yes it does, actually. Subjective is variable, differing from point of view to point of view, objective is an absolute. For example: ""A berry can be eaten."" is an objective truth - we know factually that it can be consumed. However, ""The berry tastes good."" is a subjective matter. It is not the same depending on your point of view of what tastes good.

Morality is like saying that because you think the berry tastes good it must be good. That is why it is flawed.

""I think all people are equal, therefore they must be."" is a flawed approach to the question. At that level, all you're doing is arguing with personal views against other personal views instead of pointing out objective facts and reasoning.

&gt;What is there to substantiate your assertion that it's always changing or flawed? You just threw it out there without supporting this claim in any way.

Anthropological, Sociological, Political, Philosophical and cultural development, study and so on all proves this without me having to do an utterly stupid thing like cite sources. Only an idiot would claim ""Proof or its not true"" on the above. The proof has already been detailed and is readily available for *anyone to look at without being spoon fed.* If you havn't been paying attention, that is not my problem. But you should know that by making that sort of statement you're showing your own understanding of the world around you for what it actually is: uninformed, malnourished and backward.

&gt;Forgive me for thinking of this sentence as altogether nonsensical. 

Judging from the this comment so far, I wouldn't be surprised if nothing I say made sense to you.

&gt;Are you against ideology now? Do you think everybody on the planet doesn't have an ideology?

Not at all. I am against using Ideology as a *concrete* foundation for any political analysis. You cannot use your *personal views* to justify *everything you say* especially on the topic of *human liberation*. Well, that's wrong, you can, but your approach is inherently lagged and will likely get no further than cult followings. Marxism did not spawn the greatest labor movements in history because it said, ""We just think working people deserve more."" 

I've never said that I do not have personal morals. In fact - I have said that specifically. I have morals and certain ideas which I hold myself to at all times. But I do not use those as the basis for my political arguments. Those morals help me connect easier to likeminded individuals, but I will always use the analytical, objective tools of Marxism, of working class uprising, to wage the real arguments against the Capitalist system, and why it will inevitably crumble, and why it is in the interests of all wage-slaves to take power consciously, instead of waiting until Capitalism takes us down with the ship.

Oh and - you're completely wrong about Capitalists not caring about morality. It is by enforcing a sense of morality on the rest of us that they can continue doing what they do. One need only look to Ghandi or the Catholic church to see just how damaging their sense of morality can be for us.

There is no universal right and wrong. And right and wrong's definitions have changed over the centuries of human development. Again - ideological argument - cannot be substantiated and is, frankly, idealist at best. It will bare no weight when trying to prop up working people against an exploitative and oppressive system.

&gt;The cause of these inequalities lies in the fact that immorality exists.

A neo-liberal argument. Yes, young Capitalist padawan~ Defend the system! But I'm going to ignore your last words on that morality *crap*. You have no class analysis, so your only answer to what we face is that we have to get rid of the immoral. Your answer will disillusion you in future with its ultimate failure.

&gt;Before socialism can exist, keitopop, you have to turn everyone in society into socialists.

... That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That is an impossible task, and again, has no class analysis. The subjective element of agreeing with Socialism is a part of it, but it is not the fundamental point which will birth Socialism. On the contrary - it will be the objective class struggle itself that positions workers in opposition to Capitalism - the only alternatives are to either progress collectively and to create an opposed system to capitalism, or regress. No doubt, Socialism is that progression.

&gt;Capitalists don't demand socialism. Social democracy constitutes a cultural shift in values toward socialist ones.

As I've said before, I prefer any concession to workers than I do liberal Capitalism. However, I am under no illusions of what Social Democracy is. It is not a closer step to Socialism. It is merely concession to workers to keep ruling classes afloat. And when they feel they can, they will attack those concessions (as they have in europe recently which sparked mass protests and general strikes).

My issue with you is that you care for working people only so far as your Capitalist system will allow you to. And that is truly, truly sad.

Rest assured, every time you try to assert the wonders of Social Democracy, I and others will be around to smash your knees apart and bring you down. 

&gt;I don't support socialism just because all the cool kids are doing it.

You support Social Democracy because you don't have the guts to take a real stand against Capitalism, because you do not have the objective analysis of the working class, because you do not have an understanding of the history, because you see no potential in the working class itself to lay hold of society for its own benefit, and because you'd rather be comfortably numb than struggling against the oppressive, exploitative system.

If workers' revolted tomorrow, and had the power to smash Capitalism and the state, you'd be the one on the podium telling them to return to work and vote instead - just like every degenerate Social Democrat before you.

It would be, if anyone was actually saying it. YOU are the one who says its morally justifiable to blame children, grand children, and great-grand children for the sins of their ancestors, not me. That logic is insanely impossible to defend. It promotes bullshit worldviews of ""us"" versus ""them"". It promotes religious and racial justification for killing. It promotes all kinds of horrible, horrible shit. 

The entire point of bringing up North America is because, under your logic, you are guilty of the same crimes. YOU are the one saying someone has the right to remove people from homes they have lived in for their entire lives because of the sin of their great grand parents. I think that logic is bogus.

This entire conversation got started because I asked you how much time needs to pass, how many generations, that is, before the crime of the forceful land grab is forgiven to the children? Do the native americans have a right to your home? Please try to explain to me how the native Americans do not have a right to your home, under your logic.

My solution is the only rational solution. You do not blame ""a people"" (EITHER PEOPLE) for the crimes of their parents, grand parents, or ancestors. Doing so is ammoral and unjustifiable. It leads to the segmentation of a people along societal lines where both sides have the right to kill anyone on the other side they want, after all, they are all guilty of the crimes of their grand parents.

So, really. Just fuck off with your Arab propaganda -- or tell us why you really have your tongue up Arab rectums - I don't buy your ""peace and justice"" crap for a moment.

As is typical with your ilk, you've completely neglected what to do with 2 million Jews displaced from Europe and Muslim countries and all you worry about is Muslims. Have you bothered to look up the massacres of Jews in all the Arab countries and why they fled? Maybe _you_ could learn something.

But the Arabs are going to win this one by massive population expansion - and once they get more than 50% of the vote in Israel, Jews will be second class citizens and killed and you'll be gloating.

Water generators exist, and have existed, **FOR 2,000 FUCKING YEARS!!!!!** 

&gt; Collecting water from the air has been a practice for some 2,000 years, in the form of ""air wells"" in Middle Eastern deserts, and later in Europe. Around the 1400s, we see water-collecting Dew Ponds, and later the Fog Fences, which have for hundreds of years have been used in Europe to collect clean water from the air. In the early 1970s, Melvin Littrell began producing water from the air with a system that did not need a compressor. Through this development, the creation of the first real Atmospheric Water Generator was produced. In 1990, Littrell patented the system's technology as an AWG or atmospheric water generator.

&gt; They are available in various sizes and styles, ranging from domestic systems that produce 32 oz. a day to all-electronic units producing 75 liters per day with compressors, and finally to commercial applications that can produce from **35,000 to 109,000 gallons of water each day.**

My argument has nothing to do with why people would want one of these devices or who wants to live in the desert. You said it was impossible to generate unlimited water, which I suppose is true, nobody wants to collect all the worlds water though so who cares? The point of these machines is to produce water for everyday needs and it does this, you extract the water drink it and it goes back into the system.

Many news sources repeated the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) statement that Ahmadinejad had demanded that ""Israel must be wiped off the map"",[5][6] an English idiom which means to ""cause a place to stop existing"",[7] or to ""obliterate totally"",[8] or ""destroy completely"".[9]

Ahmadinejad's phrase was "" بايد از صفحه روزگار محو شود "" according to the text published on the President's Office's website, and was a quote of Ayatollah Khomeini.[10]

According to Juan Cole, a University of Michigan Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, Ahmadinejad's statement should be translated as:

    The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods) must [vanish from] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad).[11]

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translates the phrase similarly, as ""be eliminated from the pages of history.""[12]

According to Cole, ""Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to 'wipe Israel off the map' because no such idiom exists in Persian"". Instead, ""He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse.""[13]

On June 2, 2006 The Guardian columnist and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele published an article based on this line of reasoning.[14]

Sources within the Iranian government have also denied that Ahmadinejad issued any sort of threat.[15][16][17] On 20 February 2006, Iran's foreign minister denied that Tehran wanted to see Israel ""wiped off the map,"" saying Ahmadinejad had been misunderstood. ""Nobody can remove a country from the map. This is a misunderstanding in Europe of what our president mentioned,"" Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference, speaking in English, after addressing the European Parliament. ""How is it possible to remove a country from the map? He is talking about the regime. We do not recognize legally this regime,"" he said.[18][19][20]

Shiraz Dossa, a professor of Political Science at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada who presented a paper at the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust conference in Iran, believes the text is a mistranslation.[21]

    Ahmadinejad was quoting the Ayatollah Khomeini in the specific speech under discussion: what he said was that ""the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time."" No state action is envisaged in this lament; it denotes a spiritual wish, whereas the erroneous translation—""wipe Israel off the map""—suggests a military threat. There is a huge chasm between the correct and the incorrect translations. The notion that Iran can ""wipe out"" U.S.-backed, nuclear-armed Israel is ludicrous.[22][23][24]

In a June 11, 2006 analysis of the translation controversy, New York Times deputy foreign editor and Israeli resident Ethan Bronner argued that Ahmadinejad had called for Israel to be wiped off the map. After noting the objections of critics such as Cole and Steele, Bronner stated:

    But translators in Tehran who work for the president's office and the foreign ministry disagree with them. All official translations of Mr. Ahmadinejad's statement, including a description of it on his website, refer to wiping Israel away. Sohrab Mahdavi, one of Iran’s most prominent translators, and Siamak Namazi, managing director of a Tehran consulting firm, who is bilingual, both say “wipe off” or “wipe away” is more accurate than ""vanish"" because the Persian verb is active and transitive.

Bronner continued: ""..it is hard to argue that, from Israel's point of view, Mr. Ahmadinejad poses no threat. Still, it is true that he has never specifically threatened war against Israel. So did Iran's president call for Israel to be 'wiped off the map'? It certainly seems so. Did that amount to a call for war? That remains an open question.""[13] This elicited a further response from Jonathan Steele, who took issue with the use of the word ""map"" instead of the phrase ""wipe out"" and criticized this Wikipedia entry (as it was on June 14, 2006) for misrepresenting Ethan Bronner.[25]",True,t1_c09ccmk,1,c09cjod,1425964848,1241541550,t1_c09cjod,0,False,t3_8hvmc,t5_6

Nevertheless, that's what happened.  I certainly wouldn't argue that it made sense to do so.  The Church itself had no doctrines about cosmology, so it couldn't very well offer them as explanations.  What it had instead was a body of received theory, based first of all on Aristotelian physics and secondly on the Ptolemaic model.  You can argue all you want about whether or not they were justified in preferring that model because of its perceived compatibility with Catholic doctrine, but the fact remains that the explanations came from outside of the religious tradition and the religion itself made no attempts to present an explanatory cosmology.

Explain to me how bloodletting had anything to do with religion and I'll see about addressing it.  As for diseases being caused by demons, one thing that it's necessary to understand is that, even without the Christian religion in support of the idea, the medieval cosmological scheme provided a scientific rationale for the existence of demons.  Again drawing from Aristotelian philosophy, life was assumed to stretch in a system of gradations symbolized by the Great Chain of Being.  Each link in the chain was a gradation of sophistication liminal to the stages above and below it.  Aristotelian philosophy in fact predicts the existence of demons, and a philosopher of the Middle Ages would have accepted that predicted existence in much the same way that chemists of the last century accepted the existence of elements not yet found but predicted by the periodic table.

There is, so far as I can tell, no scriptural basis for assigning demons as the cause of disease, even though you may be able to point to specific instances of demons mentioned in the Bible.  The notion that diseases were caused by demons seems, rather, to have descended not only to medieval Europe, but also to the medieval Levant, through the influence of Greek philosophy.",True,t1_c09ckqk,1,c09cmnr,1425964887,1241546755,t1_c09cmnr,0,False,t3_8hum4,t5_2qh39

Tradeweeks.co.uk is currently Europe’s largest wholesaler of timeshare re-sales to the trade and the company warns Timeshare consumers that the following legislation, as proclaimed by the European Parliament, that all reputable companies have now ceased the practice of “Cold Line” sales which are involved in the use of OPC (Off Premises Canvassers, more commonly referred to as “Street Touts”) that has caused a large number of the former OPC’s to open the so called “Re-sale Companies”.

Identifying Bogus Companies

The specific objective of Tradeweeks.co.uk is to protect the general public to be victims of these bogus companies that are often NOT properly constituted and these companies often use merchant facilities (facilities to take your credit card over the phone) from other establishments which vary from pet shops to bars.

“Modus Operandi” that they use to trap Timeshare Consumers
We have no doubt that in future you will be called by these companies who will attempt by all means in convincing you that they have a “real” buyer at who offers a very inflated price. They will then ask you to send them around £1,000.00, as giving some convincing argument, as payment for the “taxation fee” before the sale goes through. Once you paid this fee, you will not hear anything from them for quite some time and they will not contact you for a certain period. Eventually, you will then try to contact them and you will be told, “We are sorry but the sale fell through because of the credit crunch and that the purchasing consumer has failed to pass finance”. At this point, you will have no other options to choose from. Finally, you will be in a situation, wherein, they will be presenting you a list, until you are willing to sell for a very, very little or at worst and more likely it will be, the last time you will be hearing from them.

Our Advice

At this point, Tradeweeks.co.uk has been receiving numerous calls, emails and visitors who are seeking advice and help from our company if they can still survive from this awful experience from those companies. Our Consultants wanted to help these Timeshare owners in the best effort as we can. To avoid the increase of Timeshare owners to be victims of these bogus companies, we have the responsibility to inform all Timeshare owners to be more cautious enough and to remember these three IMPORTANT TIPS:
 
1.	Never pay an upfront fee, especially not over the phone
2.	Never believe anyone who gives you an unsolicited telephone call to say they have already sold your timeshare
3.	Never believe an offer that is anywhere near the price you purchased your timeshare for, this just does not happen
In case you are currently in that awful situation or have been transacting with those companies and needs further consultation you can refer to the author’s information so we can guide you out from it.

The Re-sale agents who charge timeshare owners to register their timeshare for sale usually at the price they paid for it or in some cases even more then claim to take a percentage of the sale arranged by them between a current timeshare owner and a perspective client are rife in Europe, Trade Weeks questions their validity and cannot understand the logic of a business we don’t believe exists!

Trade Weeks.co.uk concede that there are many timeshare marketers selling weeks directly to the public and doing a very good job, Mr Simon Mullish of Trade Weeks said “We know they exist we supply most of them with stock, they do a great job of marketing through, usually print advertising and are a great benefit to the consumer as they are able to sell at much lower prices because of their low marketing costs”

However Trade Weeks questions the validity of the re-sale agent with the two following points

1.	Timeshare is not usually purchased it is SOLD to a client in an extensive face to face presentation usually on a resort or in an office, there are exceptions to this statement, there are educated timeshare owners who look to purchase a specific week, they are the consumers who will reply to timeshare marketers who advertise LOW COST weeks (Usually less than 40% of the retails price) in the press, we estimate this market to be less than 3% of the total market.

2.	Why would any company with the ability to sell Timeshare at the retail price wish to do that on behalf of a consumer and take a percentage of the sale for example 20%, when they could buy the same stock from Trade Weeks at less than 10% of the retail price and keep 90% versus 20% from the consumer, even taking into account the amount they are paid to register the clients this does not make logical sense

Trade Weeks suggests that these business’s only exist to take registration fees, that is the focus of their business and we can only deduce from the facts that it is impossible to sell a timeshare week on behalf of a consumer at retail price!

Trade Weeks warns timeshare owners to exercise extreme caution when dealing with companies who charge upfront fees and that claim to have a buyer for their week at anything above wholesale prices, as to us it sounds too good to be true and when it sounds too good to be true it usually is!

eaturbrainz,5,worldnews,0,0,False,,,,"I'm just going to go ahead and write my own commentary here.  This article clearly shows that Khaled Meshaal is a devious, clever man, and knows quite well how to play the game of international diplomacy.  He says:

&gt;“I promise the American administration and the international community that we will be part of the solution, period,” the leader, Khaled Meshal, said during a five-hour interview with The New York Times spread over two days in his home office here in the Syrian capital. 

Then he goes on to say:

&gt;""There is only one enemy in the region, and that is Israel.”

He is reaching out to President Obama and the new administration in America, and to Europe, but if you ask him for a concrete proposal you get the same old, same old:

&gt;On the two-state solution sought by the Americans, he said: “We are with a state on the 1967 borders, based on a long-term truce. This includes East Jerusalem, the dismantling of settlements and the right of return of the Palestinian refugees.” Asked what “long-term” meant, he said 10 years.

So what he wants is a Palestinian state in the 1967 territories (OK, fine), including East Jerusalem (unpleasant but negotiable), with the dismantling of settlements (making ""Palestine"" a Jew-free country), and the return of ""Palestinian refugees"" into Israel (which would make Israel an Arab-majority state).  This is what Israel should give him, and in exchange he offers a 10-year truce in the jihad of extermination against Israel.

To translate, he wants a Jew-free Palestinian state with a demographic Arab advantage inside Israel - forcing the Israelis to either become a true apartheid or an Arab state themselves - in exchange not for peace but for a break in the war of extermination.  There is a reason people refer to this proposal as the 1.5 state solution: it results in a Jew-free Palestinian state and an Arab-majority Israel, with Jews no longer actually having any greater independence than as a national minority in another people's country.

The Hamas proposal then, is as it has always been: ""*Give us all that we want peacefully, or we shall take it by force!*""",True,t3_8i1n3,5,c09cp7b,1425964989,1241551204,t1_c09cp7b,0,True,t3_8i1n3,t5_2qh13

&gt;Charges that Chávez has “militarized” the Venezuelan government (New York Times, 9/17/06) have their origins in an early Chávez government program. In 1999, when a recession left Venezuela short of money to fund poverty programs, Chávez implemented “Plan Bolívar 2000,” under which the underutilized military was ordered to construct housing, build roads and carry out mass vaccination drives—hardly what one imagines upon hearing warnings of government militarization.

This is one example of dozens from that article.

The media in the US is profoundly anti-Chavez, for the exact same reasons the US media was so profoundly uncritical of the Iraq War.  They take their cues from the White House.  The soak up whatever shit comes out of the executive branch's mouth, and print it without question.  Doesn't matter whether it's about aluminum cylinders and Iraq's transcontinental, chemical weapon armed UAVs, or Chavez's destruction of democratic institutions and nationalizing of, well, everything, supposedly.

Hopefully, you calm yourself down, take a new look at this information, and realize that you have been played for a sucker by a government that has funneled millions of dollars into Venezuela's opposition parties, and a sycophantic media that is little more than a cheerleader for political interference.

Only in those cases?  I suppose the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were made by Flat-Earthers.  Nazi science was actually a step ahead of the rest of Europe in many regards -- they were a full generation ahead of us in researching the effects of alcohol and tobacco use and would likely have split that atom before us if we hadn't lured away their most prominent physicists.  Even American supporters of science like Rockefellar could take a scientific principle like Darwinian evolution and endorse it as justification for the exploitation of the lower class.

Science simply doesn't come with intrinsic safeguards against immoral use.  No belief does.

&gt; Science changes based upon new evidence, religion tends to resist change.

Stock answer; not really sure what it has to do with this particular issue.  Care to elaborate?

&gt; It would be easy for the religions of today to repeat the same errors of the dark ages...

I've talked about this ad nauseam on reddit.  Religion wasn't responsible for the Dark Ages in Europe.  The collapse of Rome, and the resulting famines that resulting in successive waves of barbarian invasion, caused the Dark Ages.  If anything, the Catholic Church was one of the few institutions that actively worked to lessen the severity of the resulting chaos -- cf., for example, [the Peace and Truce of God][1].

&gt; So, yeah, I've just given you a rational argument as to why belief with scientific basis and supporting evidence should be held in higher regards than religious belief.

I'd say your argument suffers from some serious bias confirmation.  On the one hand, you ignore the ways in which science really has lent itself to misuse, or qualify them by saying that the people turning them to immoral ends simply aren't scientific enough.  On the other, you misrepresent religious history, making it appear bleaker than it actually is or misattributing responsibility to religion that really should fall on other causal factors.

At any rate, I don't think reference to historical cases will suffice in this case.  What you need is a categorical argument that will explain *why* religion should be more susceptible to misuse than other forms of belief.

The mechanical nature of the penis is completely destroyed. In that sense, half of its function is destroyed.

&gt;  4) In my (limited) awareness, FGM is usually mutilation, the removal of whole parts. Circumcision is more like removing part of a part.

But the foreskin contains tens of thousands of specialized fine-touch receptor nerves, the specialized ridged band, a much more developed frenulum (which is sometimes removed, but otherwise diminished).

I don't think you can really argue that it's just a part of a part like an earlobe or something.

Also, most forms of female circumcision are fairly benign, like a prick of the clitoris or a trimming of the labia. ---these are still wildly illegal.

&gt;  5) The motive for FGM is hating/oppressing women (take away their feeling so they behave) or carving them up for twisted cosmetic purposes; for circumcision Jews and some Christians believe it's necessary religious practice.

I believe that you're wrong.

Firstly, most female circumcision is done for the exact same reasons as male circumcision: Purity, cleanliness, a sign of womanhood, and to look like one's mother or other woman (cosmetic). In fact, women are the major supporters of female circumcision in those cultures.

Secondly, Muslims believe it is a religious practice, and they cite the teachings of Muslim authorities. Also, there have been a number of Jewish authorities over the centuries, who wrote that circumcision has always been meant to curb a man's sexual pleasure and desire.

Thirdly, the Christian bible *explicitly* states that circumcision is completely unnecessary. Paul makes a big deal about how circumcision is no longer required by their god.

&gt; But there really is a vast difference of scope between these two issues, even if the principles are similar.

There may be a vast scope of difference between the the worst kind of FGM and the common kind of MGM, but this is still mutilation and a violation of human rights. How disrespectful is it to cut up someone else's penis?

&gt; You'll do your cause more good if you drop the alarmist tone, IMO.

I guess you'd be surprised to talk to any European about this subject. They are almost always alarmed that Americans perform circumcision, because they think it's something that only Jews and Muslims do.

Instead, the Scriptures, the Apostolic Tradition and teachings of the Church support a geocentric cosmology vis-à-vis a heliocentric one.""

&gt; Actually, it could be read either way. Casting out demons to cure sickness v. casting out demons and curing sickness. Either way, medieval Christians weren't using Young's Literal Translation.

Actually, no it cannot. The logical construction of the sentence precludes it.

""he gave to them power over unclean spirits, so as to be casting them out, and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.""

power over unclean spirits is one clause. The descriptions of that power follow in the other two clauses ""so as to be casting them out"" and ""to be healing every sickness, and every malady."" In order for your interpretation to be valid, it would have to be phrased ""he gave to them power, over unclean spirits so as to be casting them out; and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.""


But you're right. In medieval times, they weren't using Young's Literal Translation. Instead, for most of that time, they were using the Vulgate Bible, which was a more-or-less-literal translation from the Greek (which was what the new testament was written in) into Latin. For most of the medieval period, only Latin scholars (usually members of the clergy) read the bible at all - everyone else learned about the bible from them.

Besides, you can look up that passage in the vulgate bible, and translate it into English. It reads pretty much word-for-word identical to Young's Literal Translation.

And no, I don't have to connect jack or shit from any scriptural basis to religious tradition. In fact, when you get right down to it, it's almost irrelevant, because for the entire period from about 500 CE to 1500 CE, there WAS NO western civilization outside the church, practically speaking.

&gt;It’s funny how this is such a controversial issue in the US.

&gt;I’m American, and was living in the US when I was pregnant with my first child. I found the idea of cutting off any part of my baby rather upsetting, but my husband was adamant about the baby being circ’d if it was a boy. **In fact, he didn’t even want to discuss it, and would get very tense when I brought it up, which is completely out of character.** Fortunately (in my opinion!), our first child was a girl. By the time I got pregnant again we had moved overseas and were spending most of our time with Europeans. For them, it’s not a controversial issue at all. In fact, many were shocked when I brought it up… they had no idea that anyone circumcised routinely and for other than religious reasons. They were baffled as to why we would even consider it.

&gt;So, having realized that routine circumcision was just an odd American cultural tradition, my husband was open to discussion the second time around, and eventually agreed not to have our son circumcised when he was born. Hurray!

&gt; The mechanical nature of the penis is completely destroyed. In that sense, half of its function is destroyed.

I'm not saying your point here is wrong, but to say that half its function is destroyed shows a little misunderstanding about what the *function* of these things are. I don't have *half* a son, even though I'm circumcised. Still works fine for passing on genes.

So, I'm missing some nerves - quite a few of them. I can believe that, it makes sense. But here's the thing. Sex is *really* fun. I'd be all for it being more fun, if I could go back in time and talk to my parents, but I don't think the difference would be *that* great. There's no way to know, to be sure, but mine is evidently still full of quite a few nerves that work pretty well. And, if I could only go back in time once, I should probably try to stop Hitler or something.

If FGM is usually pretty benign, that's news to me, but I'll believe you. So from an equality perspective, that's one of your strong points.

&gt; exact same reasons

I was shocked, *shocked* in talking to my wife's OB, who brought up circumcision, to find out the typical reason is that people want their son to look like them. Astoundingly retarded (there's that word again), but that seems to be most people's primary reason. It certainly isn't purity, sometimes a contributing factor is cleanliness (although that goes away with education), and I don't think it's a sign of manhood in anyone's eyes that I know of.

&gt; Muslims believe it is a religious practice

[citation needed] but I don't have one either. I've never heard it argued from the Koran or their other texts, but I'm not Muslim. So, I doubt it, but possibly.

&gt; Thirdly

I'm completely with you here. Let's point that out to the Christians - it's in Galatians 3, I believe. But they *think* it is, so until we point it out, they're doing it.

&gt; this is still mutilation

I suppose it would have to fit the dictionary definition of mutilation, but every time you call it that, one person will stop listening to you.

Here's the reasons I didn't circumcise my son:
* I spent about 2 days angry with my parents when I first heard all these mutilated penis claims.
* I think permanent body modifications should be decided by adults (earings, tattoos - why the HECK have I ever seen a baby with pierced ears?) so if he wants it done someday (I can't imagine why) he can, but he forever has the option to keep it undone
* Insurance didn't cover it. And I think it costs a few hundred.

&gt;In the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916, Britain and France proposed to divide the Middle East between them into spheres of influence, with ""Palestine"" as an international enclave.(Pappé 1994, p. 3)

&gt;After Sykes-Picot, the British made two conflicting promises regarding the territory it was expecting to acquire.[5] Britain had promised the local Arabs, through Lawrence, independence for a united Arab country covering most of the Arab Middle East in exchange for their support; and in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 had promised to create and foster a Jewish national home in Palestine. The British had, in the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence, previously promised the Hashemite family lordship over most land in the region in return for their support.

And later,
&gt;When the British insisted on preventing immigration of Jewish Holocaust survivors to Palestine following World War II, the Jewish community began to wage an uprising and guerrilla war. This warfare and United States pressure to end the anti-immigration policy led to the establishment of The Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946. It was a joint British and American attempt to agree on a policy regarding the admission of Jews to Palestine. In April, the Committee reported that its members had arrived at a unanimous decision. The Committee approved the American condition of the immediate acceptance of 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe into Palestine. It also recommended that there be no Arab, and no Jewish State. The report explained that in order to dispose, once and for all, of the exclusive claims of Jews and Arabs to Palestine, we regard it as essential that a clear statement of principle should be made that Jew shall not dominate Arab and Arab shall not dominate Jew in Palestine.

Now, in the West, food is - mostly - produced by the free market, although as a libertarian I'd be the first to note that there is a lot of regulatory control over food production (ask any farmer, slaughterhouse owner, food retailer, etc) and a lot of subsidies, such as under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. But by and large, the process by which we get our fruit, veg, meat and carbs is via capitalism. This seems to work tolerably well. It could work a heck of a lot better, of course, but in general, you don't see people, even the very poor, starving in the streets as happened under communism in Russia (1930s) or Mao's China (1950s, 60s), or see the sort of state-induced disasters in Zimbabwe, etc. So clearly, something as basic as food seems to work best when left to the market.

Food is a predictable, small, regular expense.  Health care is often an unpredictable, large, emergency expense, and is therefore best dealt with through insurance programs.

blackstar9000,2,religion,0,0,False,,,,"It's a survey of theories put forward by anthropologists, along with discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.  Frazer was a major influence on classical anthropology of religion, so he has a place of honor in the book.  Since you're having trouble laying hands on a copy, I'll quote some of the relevant material.

&gt; [p. 15] We should, I think, realize what was the intention of many of these scholars if we are to understand their theoretical constructions.  They sought, and found, in primitive religions a weapon which could, they thought, be used with deadly effect against Christianity.  If primitive religion could be explained away as an intellectual aberration, as a mirage induced by emotional stress, or by its social function, it was implied that the higher religions could be discredited and disposed of in the same way.  This intention is scarcely concealed in some cases -- Frazer, King, and Clodd, for example.

&gt; [pp 27-29] Frazer is, I suppose, the best-known name in anthropology, and we owe much to him and to Spencer and Tylor.  The whole of *The Golden Bough*, a work of immense industry and erudition, is devoted to primitive superstitions.  But it cannot be said that he added much of value to Tylor's theory of religion; rather than he introduced some confusion in the form of two new suppositions, the one pseudo-historical and the other psychological.  According to him, mankind everywhere, and sooner or later, passes through three stages of intellectual development, from magic to religion, and from religion to science, a scheme he may have taken over from Comte's phases, the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive, though the correspondence is far from an exact one. [...] Eventually, says Frazer, the shrewder intelligences probably discovered that magic did not really achieve its ends, but, still being unable to overcome their difficulties by empirical means and to face their crises through a refined philosophy, they fell into another illusion, that there were spiritual beings who could aid them.  In course of time the shrewder intelligences saw that spirits were equally bogus, an enlightenment which heralded the dawn of experimental science.  The arguments in support of this thesis were, to say the least, trivial, and it was ethnologically most vulnerable.  In particular, the conclusions based on Australian data were wide of the mark, and, since the Australians were introduced into the argument to show that the simpler the culture, the more the magic and the less the religion, it is pertinent to note that hunting and collecting peoples, including many Australian tribes, have animistic and theistic beliefs and cults.  It is also evident that the variety, and therefore volume, of magic in their cultures is likely to be less, as indeed it is, than in cultures technologically more advanced; there cannot, for instance, be agricultural magic or magic of iron-working in the absence of cultivated plants and of metals.  No one accepts Frazer's theory of stages today.

By this last sentence, Evans-Pritchard of course means no one in the field of anthropology.  Lay persons are significantly behind state-of-the art when it comes to anthropology, and I've seen the theories of Tylor and Frazer repeated practically verbatim in authors like Dennett and Harris -- that is, in authors who share the Victorian anthropologist's disdain for contemporary organized religion but who haven't kept current on anthropological studies of religion.

The bit about agriculture and iron-working, incidentally, echoes the work of Mircea Eliade, the prominent historian of religion.  In his work in *The Sacred and the Profane* and in *The Forge and the Crucible* he notes that the cultures which produce myths of explanation are almost invariably the cultures that already understand the fundamentals of the natural objects contained in those myths.  For example, in the latter book:

&gt; [p. 34] When we talk of the 'sexualization' of the vegetable world it is necessary to be clear as to the precise meaning of the term.  It is not a question of the actual phenomenon of the fertilization of plants but of a qualitative 'morphological' classification, which is the culmination and expression of mystical sympathy with the world.  It is the idea of life which, projected onto the cosmos, sexualizes it.  It is not a matter of making objective or scientific observations but of arriving at an appraisal of the world around us in terms of life, and in terms of anthropocosmic destiny, embracing sexuality, fecundity, death and rebirth.  Not that men in primitive societies were incapable of objectively observing the life of plants.  The proof of this is the discovery of the artificial fertilization and grafting of date trees and fig trees in Mesopotamia.  These processes had long been known, for at least two paragraphs of the Hammurabi Code legislate on this point.  This practical knowledge was afterwards handed down to the Hebrews and the Arabs.  But the artificial fertilization of fruit trees was not looked upon as a horticultural technique, efficient in itself, but as a ritual ...""

Evans-Pritchard picks up that theme as well.  Tylor and Frazer isolated the early stages of religion (animism for Tylor; the magical and spiritual stages for Frazer) as eras of confusion, in which primitive societies symbolic action for empirical and could not readily distinguish magical and mechanical causation.  The technical skill of primitive man belies all this -- nearly all modern domesticated plants were cultivated before the advent of ancient Greek science, and metallurgy was already in practice by 3000 BCE.  That indicates a high level of instrumental skill, even if it lacks anything as rigorous as modern scientific method.

What Evans-Pritchard and Eliade both recognize in their respective fields is a distinctly religious way of dividing experience into overlapping domains, called by Eliade the Sacred and the Profane.  What is seen under one aspect in the Profane takes on a different cast in the Sacred.  Thus a stone placed in the fork of tree (Evans-Pritchard's example) is seen as an efficacious way to slow the descent of the sun only so long as it's circumscribed in ritual; in any other context it's just a stone.  The religious significance given to metal during ritual in non-operative outside of the ritual -- in the realm of the Profane the metal is an inert substance, subject to the same tendencies we'd expect of any inanimate object.  Paul Veyne, in his book *Did The Greeks Believe In Their Myths?* arrives at similar conclusions in the specific example of Greek myth, and by a different route.

This explanation has run long, I realize, so I'll close with another quotation from Evans-Pritchard discussing classical authors like Tylor and Frazer:

&gt; [pp 5-6] Anthropology was still in its infancy -- it has hardly yet grown up.  Till recently it has been the happy hunting ground of men of letters and has been speculative and philosophical in a rather old-fashioned way.  If psychology can be said to have taken the first steps towards scientific autonomy round about 1860 and not to have rid itself of the trammels of its philosophical past till forty or fifty years later, social anthropology, which took its first steps about the same time, has yet more recently shed similar encumbrances.

&gt; It is a remarkable fact that none of the anthropologists whose theories about primitive religion have been most influential had ever been near a primitive people.  It is as though a chemist had never thought it necessary to enter a laboratory.  They had consequently to rely for their information on what European explorers, missionaries, administrators, and traders told them.  Now, I want to make it clear that this evidence is highly suspect.  I do not say that it was fabricated, though sometimes it was; and such famous travellers as Livingstone, Schweinfurth, and Palgrave were given to gross carelessness.  But much of it was false and almost all of it was unreliable and, by modern standards of professional research, casual, superficial, out of perspective, out of context; and to some extent this was true even of the earlier professional anthropologists.  I say with the greatest deliberation about early descriptions of the simpler peoples' ideas and behaviour, and even more of the interpretations of them put forward, that statements cannot be taken at their face value and should not be accepted without critical examination of their sources and without weighty corroborative evidence.

The first of those Pope wasn't canonized until 1605, more than 60 years after the death of Copernicus.  That means geocentrism wasn't made an official doctrine of Catholicism until more than a generation after the Church had already given its initial support to the heliocentric model.  As I argued above, the Church only set itself against the scientific arguments when it perceived them as the basis for challenges to specifically religious and moral orthodoxy.  So if you're hoping to call those doctrines in as support for the argument that religion is an attempt at explanation, I'm afraid the actual chronology of events leads in the wrong direction.  Rather than supporting your thesis, they point instead to Catholicism's 1600 year lack of interest in astronomical explanations.  The better explanation is that the Church caught on to ways in which Protestant agitators could make a partisan issue of the Copernican model, and declared against it in order to ward off the seduction of its congregation away from Catholicism.

As for your quotation from Young's Literal, your use of a semicolon to separate the two clauses *is* clearer, yes, but that doesn't really change my position on the matter.  Semicolons didn't gain wide usage until the sixteenth century, so an argument from absence would be, in this case, anachronistic.  Beyond which, the sentence as it read *can* grammatically be interpreted as I suggested.  If you don't agree, I suggest taking it to a professional to parsing.

&gt; In fact, when you get right down to it, it's almost irrelevant, because for the entire period from about 500 CE to 1500 CE, there WAS NO western civilization outside the church, practically speaking.

You're wrong about that.  There was, for one thing, a strong feudal strain with heavy roots in Germanic paganism.  This was the point of origin for most of the chivalric and romantic traditions of the era.  Paganism itself survived in the form of folk traditions, of which the Church's constant opposition was evidence.  The Church was continually having to lend its weight against heresies as well, and many of these incorporated older pagan or extra-European traditions.  Spain was, for the nearly the whole of that period, Moorish, and some cultural exchange persisted despite the hostility.  Starting in 1000 CE military engagements in the Middle East brought European culture into contact with Islamic culture -- resulting in exchanges that would eventually re-introduce Europe to classical Greek Platonism and kick start the Renaissance.  Contact with the Byzantine Empire was ongoing, and the Fourth Crusade would further complicate that relationship by paving the way for the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople.  Marco Polo was importing Chinese and Indian culture by the early 14th century.

1) Teachers are a very large group. To educate any number of children, you will always need an army of teachers within society. Among these teachers, there will be the usual bell curve of (a) awful (b) average (c) awesome teachers. 

2) Teacher evaluation is one of the hardest things to enforce and determine. Teachers are not directly responsible for the abilities of the students they are in charge of. Too many variables are in play. At the same time, teachers can make a difference in the outcome, but not all outcomes can be ""measured"". Tests are not an accurate measure of education. 

3) Teacher evaluation is the responsibility of principals. They, principals, are usually under fire from three fronts : administration from above with unrealistic goals and government pressure, parents who are just plain irrational on the whole and biased, and teachers who resent arbitrary administration and often weak leadership. 

4) There is no proof that certification leads to better teaching. Educational faculties are notorious for being ideologically bent towards unproven and unprovable educational theories. Teaching is not a science, it's an art and an ability that someone either has or will never acquire. 

**The fundamental issue at hand is not the quality of teachers, but basic societal questions:** 

a) What is education for ? The individual or society. Are we to strive for happy self centred children, or cogs that are selected for a streamed system that benefits the wider societal needs

b) What is education about? Process or knowledge, or what combination of those two aspects of learning? 

As a product of the European system and having worked in the North American system, may I state that the European model is knowledge based, and the North American system is process based.

Cultural traditions are not the same as civilization. While it can be argued that civilization can exist without writing, it is, at best, a gray area. By most definitions of 'civilization', the church was the only entity which met the criteria in Europe for most of the middle ages. And when it comes to preserving the knowledge of the Greek philosophers, that knowledge was preserved only by those who could read, or those who learned from those who could read. Without the continuity provided by successive generations of readers, that knowledge disappears - as evidenced by all of the greek writing which had been lost because Europe had no remaining copies of the texts until they obtained them from the Muslims. And throughout the middle ages, for practically the entire time, almost all of the literate individuals in Europe were members of the clergy. Even if, at some early point, it could be reasonably argued that the preserved elements of Greek philosophy were seperate from religious doctrine, certainly by the late middle ages, there can be no doubt that they were one and the same.",True,t1_c09d491,1,c09d5d7,1425965257,1241585551,t1_c09d5d7,0,True,t3_8hum4,t5_2qh39
IConrad,1,atheism,0,0,False,,,,"Well, I wasn't referring to you specifically with that.  I seem to have a 'fanbase'.

That being said -- let me first preface all of this by saying that in all likelihood Corporatism is less of a serviceable economic model than is Socialism.  

Okay -- moving on:

Despite the bloat and lack of streamline, it is actually arguable that the US system provides a greater degree of extended lifespan than does the European system.  This argument comes from what happens when you adjust both the EU and the US's longevities for so-called ""lifestyle adjustment"" -- Americans, ""lifestyle adjusted"", live longer than do Europeans.  And this only gets worse when you consider how much more prevalent violence and violent crime is, per capita, in the US.  Healthcare systems can't really do much about how often we pop a cap in each other's faces -- yet they are judged by a metric which is affected by exactly this.  (Do  not get me started on the outright fascism that is the FDA, by the way.)

When it comes to the educational systems of the world, I am only left struck by the fact that at the very least for those of us in the US, socialized education is an absolute, abysmal failure.  Private schools charge ~1/3rd the same amount, and reliably produce a superior quality of education.  I am not certain -- I have never seen data for it -- but I am fairly confident that //this// particular trend would also hold true for Europe.  (I use Europe v. the US, by the way, as the sole real-world examples of ""all-other-things-equal"" socialism v. non-socialism. [I won't call it capitalism. Capitalism is what happens when people w/ money lend it to those who don't have it but could make more. That's not an economic system -- but it is a mechanism for the decentralization of wealth. Which obviously doesn't happen much in the US nowadays.])

One of the things that is also very often touted as an example of the 'success' of socialized nations is the higher worker productivity despite longer vacation times.  And once again, we find that there is a very important factor which is excluded.  I'll put it to you this way:

Something can cost one of the following:
* $1.00
* $2.00
* $3.00
* $4.00
* $5.00
* $6.00

What's the average of these prices?  $3.50  So -- who's getting the better deal? Obviously the people who purchase it for the lower amounts.  Now, what happens when we knock off the highest number?  The average price falls to $3.00, obviously.

What does all this have to do with anything?  Simple:  When you pay someone more, all other things being equal, you need to get more work out of him.  Ergo; the higher the minimum threshold for entry into the workforce, the more you must get out of those people.  It is those individuals whom (much like what happened when they raised the minimum wage here in my state of AZ -- it eliminated the work-rehabilitation program for the mentally impaired altogether) are least able to produce whom are eliminated from the workforce.  That drives the average per worker up... even though it reduces the number of workers.  One can only wonder how many people might have otherwise come to be productive workers whom have been excluded thanks to **mandatory** minimum wages -- as opposed to something more flexible, such as a standard of openness or fairness.  (Say, **requiring** employee salaries/positions to be posted openly after a company reaches a certain size. Disclosure and sunlight are the enemies of social injustice, after all -- and totally compatible w/ a 'free market'.)

On a highly similar note, it is also worth noting that the unions of the world are only favorable to the **average** worker whom is already in the industry in question.  It actively works *against* the entry into said industry by those not in the field; it also arbitrarily restrains the exceptional worker.  This hurts overall productivity and frankly is unacceptable in any market where employment is highly fungible (which would have the tendency to cause employees to be more sought-after -- and thus able to negotiate higher salaries.)

That being said; it is also worth mentioning that if the failures of ""capitalism"" are to be ""held to task"" in any conversation like this one -- and that is wholly fair! -- so too must the failures of socialism be held.  It is a little-recognized fact nowadays that the majority of those governments in South Africa where the worst of the depredations and poverty are occuring are also very much so Socialist governments.  I will ***not*** include the Soviet Union's collapse in this discussion (It is my opinion this had more to do with military adventurism in the middle east than anything else...) but I *will* include the actions of South American governments.

What I *will* also consider is the history of the nation of China.  It is quite clear that those endeavors for our world's most populous nations that were attempted under the auspice of socialized equality were also the most ruinous.  The ""Great Leap Forward"" was possibly one of the greatest politically-motivated events of needless mass deaths that have ever occurred in the modern era.

For all of the failures of 'capitalism', there has never been a time under its auspices when people starved to death by the millions while there was food in plenty just a few hundred miles away -- except when Socialist (corrupt as they may be) governments get in the way.

And none of this, mind you, takes into account the increasingly aging workforces of the socialized nations of the world ... and the economic implications of what is coming in twenty to forty years when there simply **aren't** enough new workers for the workforce to continue. 

It always amazes me, for example, how invariably people object to the fact that welfare as it is currently done is nothing more than a ponzi scheme... despite the fact that we routinely discuss the number of workers per retiree.

They then said that they would accept Israel and that they had moved away from their charter on conception.

They then asked for a ceasefire.

They got turned down - that was December 2007.

Israel accepted.

What followed was a first for the region.  Not only did rockets coming from Gaza drop off the chart - non Hamas paramilitaries who tried to attack Israel from Gaza were rounded up and arrested by Hamas officials.  At no point did Israel hold up its end of the ceasefire bargain but Hamas, you don't have to like them - I certainly don't, did hold up their end of the bargain.  Israeli intelligence itself admitted that at no point did Hamas launch any rockets until Israel launched an air and ground incursion on November 4th 2008.

So the dilemma is a false one.  Hamas, for all their nasty traits, were policing a peace as a democratically elected body.  Even on the eve of the Israeli attack the Hamas leadership reiterated their willingness to accept Israel under 1967 borders.

The solution is that Israel should stop manufacturing escalation and conflict to further its ethnic cleansing.

Well yes, but with respect that's like telling people there's no point in bailing out a boat whose bottom is swimming in water, because ""if the boat works properly then there's nothing to fear"". ;-)

The problem is that - although the steps are as yet small and hesitant, *the direction we're going in is wrong*.

Any time you give up additional rights or power to a government it's hard to get it back again, short of a revolution.  That given, handing *any* additional power or rights to a government *unnecessarily* is clearly short-sighted and dangerous.

If a compelling case could be made for ID cards then I'd be all ears.  Unfortunately not one good argument has been put forward by the government as to why they're necessary that hasn't subsequently proven to be false, disingenuous or a flat-out lie.

So we've got a government gradually encroaching on its citizens' civil liberties and privacy, for no good reason it'll own up to, which has made a habit of obfuscating and misleading the public about the reasons for it.

To be fair, nobody expects Brown to declare martial law or institute curfews tomorrow.  However, the direction the Labour party has been taking us in is the one that *ends* with a functional police state.  We're only a little way down the road, but it's the *wrong damn road*. ;-)

And why are people complaining now?  Because the farther you go down that road, the harder it *is* to complain - already we're effectively banned from protesting outside the Houses of Parliament, the police appear to have an institutional policy of turning a blind eye towards violence towards (even non-violent) protesters, the government and police are trying to paint camera or mobile phone usage as suspect or potentially criminal, and the police and government *in defiance of the law* illegally stored 800,000 DNA samples from known innocent people, and only deleted them (again, *assuming* there were no backups) when effectively *ordered* to by the EU.

It's like the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Put one straw on, and nobody cares.  Put several straws on in a row *when proven necessary*, and nobody minds too much.

But *continually* putting straws on *for no reason* is a really bad idea, because eventually the camel's back will break, and then you're in real trouble, with no way to get out of it.

The government is repeatedly adding extra, unnecessary straws to the camel's back.

People like sife and Panama24 are pointing out that this habit is a bad idea, and you're saying ""It's only *one little straw* - relax!"".

&gt; I won't be carrying mine on me at all times. They can't arrest everyone for it.

False assumption: that everyone else won't be doing it.

Back in the day the idea of a policeman confiscating your camera and destroying your pictures for taking photographs in a public place would have been unheard-of.  Now it's a common (if unofficial) policy.

Back in the day, the idea of the government setting up a database covering every citizen in the land would have sounded like something thought-up by the [Stasi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi).  Now people are seriously arguing it's ""not important"", and calling people who object ""paranoid"".

If things continue the way they are then only ""paranoid"" people won't carry their ID with them - just like only ""scrubby protester types"" want to protest outside the Houses of Parliament, and only ""criminals with something to hide"" want personal privacy, and only ""suspected terrorists"" take photos of public events in a public place.

TL;DR: It's a common misconception that people are objecting to ID cards, CCTV or trivial infringements of their liberty.

Actually - although those things are annoying or mildly worrying - what most people are really motivated by is the creeping and unnecessary one-way reduction of our rights gradually ratcheting us closer to a police state.

Georgia recently attacked an autonomous region within its borders that, like it or not, included large numbers of Russian Citizens.

Georgia was resupplied by the US whilst at war with Russia (Georgian troops and US provided equipment were delivered to Georgia with US logistical support).

Now, with Georgia having (rightly or wrongly) a rather anti Russian  government, sat on Russia's border, is moving closer to an organisation whose role is to defend against an organisation that no longer exists, but is still a consistent threat to Russia.  

Russia is right to feel threatened, it is being threatened, its interests are being challenged, offensive military systems and troops are being moved closer to its borders.

In the same way as the US sees Iran as a threat (for far less reason) Russia sees NATO as a threat, moving NATO closer to Russia and acting in concert with regime with anti-Russian aims increases that threat.

Its not stupid, it is realistic.

If Russia signed a treaty with Mexico and then carried out exercises on the Mexico US border, the US would feel justifiably threatened (even though Russia hasn't been making the same kind of offensive moves against the US as the US has been making against Russia - Russia hasn't been able to...).

A threat is something perceived by the person being threatened, Russia can and will interpret these actions as unfriendly, and it can do so justifiably.

I see. In retrospect, I phrased that very poorly. You are, of course, correct, that there were folk traditions found in many regions of Europe.  I was referring to cultural and philosophical traditions which were found *throughout* Europe. While witchcraft was, under certain church leaders, deemed heretical to believe in, this was far from universal, and, in fact, is in direct contradiction to the bible ('suffer not a witch to live'). Why, Louis the Pious, a Holy Roman Emperor, crowned by Pope Steven IV, set the penalty for witchcraft (not the heresy of believing witchcraft) as death. And that was in the 840s, after the council of Leptinnes.

Of course, in another century or so, the church would come to be far more worried about heretics (infighting, power struggles) than non-Christians, since essentially all of western Europe had been converted to Christianity.

&gt; The High Middle Ages were actually characterized by European incursions into other regions, and it's during that period when Europe was exposed to elements of Greek and Arabic philosophy that had never been amalgamated into Church doctrine.

Having followed Darkfall's progress since they announced the project years ago, having played beta and release, being part of a well-known PvP/PK guild, and being aware of what Darkfall failed to deliver, a 2 out of 10 is a pretty kind score.

Good thing I didn't say that, then. I said 'almost exclusively'. I included that qualifier for a reason. It is true that many people had a very limited degree of proficiency in reading and/or writing. However, even those proficient in reading and writing generally were limited to reading or writing one or perhaps two languages (their native language and Latin), neither of which would contain a translation of the works of the Greek philosophers which would be available to them (if such a translation existed at all, it remained in the possession of the church). This, of course, stopped being true after the spread of the movable type printing press, but that was very late in the middle ages, and consequently, irrelevant to this discussion.

Yes, there were some pockets of higher literacy, but then the question arises as to what access they had to the texts.

Religion, or religious people in general are not humble, why would you expect atheism to be any different?  In both cases, humans are involved, with all the variety that entails.

&gt; again you are nitpicking and searching desperately for an argument.

This is an immature statement.  Claiming such things doesn't make them so.  Stick to the subject under discussion - if you have a valid argument, your points will make that clear.

*My* point is that your claim of humility as a characteristic of ""true religious"" people, that is somehow more prevalent than it is among atheists, 
 has no basis in fact.  You have yet to attempt to address that point, and instead have been attempting to avoid facing it, so I have to assume you're conceding the point.

It is not nitpicking to point out that the basic premise of your position is false.  It undermines everything you're saying.

For example, the example you raise of some atheists wanting old people to die is certainly not one of humble atheists, there's no question about that.  
But how does this relate to your point?  There are plenty of religious people who are equally aggressive.  These are properties of humans, not of presence or absence of beliefs.  This is the basic fallacy underlying your position - you're assuming some sort of connection that you've made no case for.

&gt; Think about that for just a moment and re-question why people won't trust atheism.

The notion of ""trusting atheism"" is nonsensical.  ""Atheism"" is a word that means lack of belief in deities.  You're making an invalid connection between that position and the behavior of the multitude of individuals who hold it.

&gt; You can not, as a subreddit, claim that xtianity is the cause of all war...

The subreddit does not claim that.  Some individuals in it might, although I think you're exaggerating.

Another problem with your position is that you're talking to a group of diverse people as though they were some sort of unified movement.  They're not.  Atheism is not a replacement movement for religion.

&gt; what you do possess... intelligence.

As atheism grows, there's no reason to expect that the intelligence of atheists will be much greater on average amongst atheists than theists.  This is yet another manifestation of a flaw in your basic position.

&gt; Unfortunately atheists are not humble enough to use it correctly, remaining second rate.

This is another unfounded generalization.  A large proportion of scientists are atheists, for example.  A large proportion of people in many European countries, particularly Scandivanian countries, are atheist.  Are they all ""second rate""?

You need to think your position through more clearly, remove the unwarranted generalizations and connections, and if you find you have any remaining case worth making, make it more precisely.

No it didn't. The fact that Georgia acted as the aggressor and that the initial, contrary position that both the media and politicians stated was incorrect has been acknowledged by both the Media and the politicians concerned (at least in Europe).

&gt;so that's why NATO supported Georgia, because Russians where looting and killing everyone on their route...

No they weren't, as I said, both senior NATO officials and EU politicians have reiterated this, claims made by Georgia that Russia attacked and that Russia committed war crimes have both been shown to be false (claims that Georgia committed war-crimes and killed civilians also appear to be over stated).

&gt;So, Russia likes it or not, Georgia is going to have training on their own territory and let those Russian fear it, nobody cares.

I don't really care what Russia does or doesn't do to Georgia, it is fairly clear that Russia could, if it wanted destroy Georgia, but at a price to its reputation and relationships with the west.  What I am concerned about is NATO embroiling itself in Georgia and Russia's games and brinkmanship.

&gt;Georgians are right - Russians wrong.

In both cases they are acting in their own self interest, Russia is acting rationally, Georgia is acting in a dangerous manner, especially in trying to draw in NATO and the EU.  Neither party can claim or be seen as being right.

&gt;So it's stupid. And no matter how one country interprets actions on 3rd country territory - it can't be in any way justified

Yes it can.  Russia's interests in the region are threatened (rightly or wrongly) as such Russia is being threatened.  This is a bad thing for anyone except possibly some Georgian nationalists.  This situation needs to be dealt with sensibly, not through posturing.

Yes there is. Even the US ambassador in Moscow has stated that Georgia initiated the conflict.

&gt;it's Georgia's territory and it's Georgia's own business!

Internal matters, rightly or wrongly are generally only the business of the country in which they occur.  In this case the attack was internal, but targets included Russian peace keepers legitimately in the country and Russian nationals.  That makes it Russia's business too.

&gt;If Russia is so concerned about their citizens, why don't they defend their citizens in Palestine?

Because they can't and don't want to interfere in what is an American area of interest.

&gt;As for ""shown false"" you're simply lying my friend, because there was no such case, on contrary - soon Russia will have to pay for war crimes.

The 'crimes' that Georgia claimed Russia carried out have been determined to be false.  The BBC has gone on to *""suggests Georgia used indiscriminate force, and may have targeted civilians.""*  not to mention that *""Witnesses said tanks had fired on an apartment block, and civilians were shot at as they fled the fighting. ""*.  The matter was taken up with the Georgian government by the British Foreign Office.

&gt;Soon Russia will have to pay for war crimes

Even if Russia had committed war crimes this is rather unlikely. Given Russia's position on the UN security council it would be almost impossible to make Russia 'pay', even an economic sanctions would be impossible given EU dependence on Russian energy exports.  I should add that it is extremely unlikely that Russia committed the kind of organised war-crimes claimed (although I don't doubt that some Russian troops acted improperly at some point, it would almost be unusual if they didn't).

&gt;it's just Russia's ambitions and not ""safety case"" or ""justified claim"" PERIOD.

No, it is the fact that Russia faces an aggressive neighbour who has already attacked Russian forces once in the hope of getting western support, who is now looking to join an organisation that has consistently acted in an aggressive manner and may require just that kind of response.

This is not about empire (apart from possibly an American one) it is about influence, but more importantly it is about trying to maintain peace and stability, not at any cost, but by trying to avoid aggressive action where it isn't required.

Do your answers change if they smoked?  What about if they did rock climbing?  Do you do a liver transplant to someone who is likely to die 6 months later anyway?  

These are really hard questions and all healthcare systems have to address them.  Unfortunately people don't want to.  It is trivial to have no waiting lists, immediate surgery and the best diagnostic equipment but that always comes at a price.  Different countries have picked different points.  For example the UK spends about half what other countries do, and does a pretty good job for the majority of the population.  Other European countries spend more but come closer to 100% of the population.  (In the UK dental and eye stuff are not covered, regular diseases and trauma are treated just fine, more esoteric ones may take longer to diagnose and treat.)

There is also usually a private health system as well for those prepared to pay.  You'll get better rooms, quicker appointments etc - see [BUPA](http://www.bupa.co.uk/about/html/what_we_do/index.html) in the UK.  One Canadian province did try to outlaw any private care hoping the private money would then flow to publicly funded facilities.

Instances to the contrary are cases of misdiagnosis, not conflation.  The one clear exception that you've given so far is that of Arnaldus de Villanova, who used trepanation as a means of letting evil spirits escape, but go check out [his wiki page][1].  Looks like he was heavily influenced by Arabic medicine and would have been censured by the Pope had he not died en route.

The Kalmar link does say that, ""Sometimes, illness was seen as an evil spirit or demon which had taken possession of the body"", but doesn't connect those beliefs with the Church or with Christian doctrine.  All and all, not a very well cited page anyway.

The contemporary clinical psychology link is interesting because it points to the ""evil spirits"" theory as a reaction to contemporary upheavals, not a doctrine drawn from religion.  The book's first dated and cited example actually takes place 34 years *after* the period it describes as the Middle Ages.  The only date listed, in fact, that doesn't fall outside that range is for Aquinas, who *didn't* profess the supernatural conflation.

On the other hand, you can look at the description [here][2] of a 12th century manuscript on medical practice.  You can also check out the essay entitled [Challenging the Eye of the Newt Image of Medieval Medicine][3] which addresses the whole range of misconceptions and distortion about medieval medical practice.

Most clear references to the demon/disease conflation in Europe that I've seen date, it turns out, from the 16th century and later, which would be consistent with the theory that the actually derived from sources outside of Christian religion, namely through contact with the Middle East and the renascence of Greek scholarship.

&gt;On that first day in office, by executive order I would: 

&gt;∙ ""Pardon everyone who had been convicted on a federal, non-violent drug charge, order their immediate release, reunite them with their families, and restore all their civil rights. (Anyone convicted of using violence against someone else in a drug case would not qualify as ""non-violent."") 

&gt;∙ Pardon everyone who had been convicted on any federal gun-control charge, tax-evasion charge, or any other victimless crime, order their immediate release, and restore all their civil rights. 

&gt;∙ I would empty the prisons of those who haven't harmed anyone else and make room for the violent criminals who are currently getting out on plea bargains and early release. 
Following the issuance of the pardons: 

&gt;∙ I would announce a policy to penalize, dismiss, or even prosecute any federal employee who violated the Bill of Rights by treating you as guilty until proven innocent, by searching or seizing your property without due process of law, by treating you as a servant, or in any other way violating your rights as a sovereign American citizen. 

&gt;∙ I would immediately order that no federal asset forfeiture could occur unless the property's owner had been convicted by full due process. And I would initiate steps to make restitution to anyone whose property had been impounded, frozen, or seized by the federal government without a legal conviction. (Over 80 percent of such seizures occur when no one has even been charged with a crime.) 

&gt;∙ As commander in chief of the Armed Forces, I would immediately remove all American troops from foreign soil. Europe and Asia can pay for their own defense, and they can risk their own lives in their eternal squabbles. This would save billions of dollars a year in taxes, but -- more important -- it would make sure your sons and daughters never fight or die in someone else's war. 

&gt;∙ I would order everyone in the executive branch to stop harassing smokers, tobacco companies, successful computer companies, gun owners, gun manufacturers, alternative medicine suppliers, religious groups (whether respected or labeled as ""cults""), investment companies, health-care providers, businessmen, or anyone else who's conducting his affairs peaceably. 

&gt;∙ I would end federal affirmative action, federal quotas, set-asides, preferential treatments, and other discriminatory practices of the federal government. Any previous president could have done this with a stroke of the pen. Do you wonder why none of them did? 

&gt;And then I would break for lunch.

Representative democracy means that the people elect their representatives. This is true for the US, too. The opposite would be direct democracy, where the people decides everything. While the latter is more true to the term 'democracy', it requires everyone to invest as much time in politics as the politicians do - and most people have no interest in such.

One of the attributes that makes Sweden (and most other European countries) different from the US is that it is a parliamentarian democracy, that means the government is not directly elected by the people, but by the parliament (which in turn is directly elected by the people). This has the nice benefit of weakening the government and, paradoxically, turns out to give more control to the opposition and thus represent more of the population better at once. Theoretically, mind you.

But much more important than the form of democracy is the mode of election. On the one side you have proportional representation (taken to the extreme this would be direct democracy, because one vote = one representative), and on the other you have a ""winner takes it all"" system. The US tends to the latter, most Western European contries to the former (but most stay somewhere in the middle, because of an election threshold to overcome (4% in Sweden, 5% in Germany, 10% in Turkey and so on)).",True,t1_c09de5v,1,c09ea0y,1425965991,1241692838,t1_c09ea0y,0,False,t3_8iamo,t5_2qh13

I look at my grandpa, a immigrant Dutch farmer whose whole family decided to get the hell out of Europe after world war II. Hard to the bone, had 8 children with my grandma who he was married to his entire adult life. Both extremely hard working and by extension passed that on to my dad and uncles and aunts who got off the farm as fast as they possibly could and started building up from the lower gradually over time into the middle class. 

But all my aunts and uncles resented having to work so hard as children/youths so they were very liberal and secular in their parenting(well... as much as Dutch tempers would allow).

Now it's hard to say I'm not the softest of the bunch. I'm much more polite although not quite as obedient. I have a much harder time dealing with criticism though, especially implied criticism. 

I think todays parenting styles makes a lot of sense when you look at the pattern, my parents raised me trying to help me avoid the things that made them miserable, but I managed to find other things to be miserable about and I'll most likely raise my children to avoid the things that have made my generation miserable which is self-esteem. But it's becoming clear that a whole new crop of problems is going to spring up from this parenting style as well.

Among other things, I was going to add that multi-lingualism is not necessarily a sign of intelligence and that (although most Americans might not believe it) it is possible to be a dumbass in two or more languages.  Since America is so mono-lingual, we often equate speaking multiple languages with being intellectually superior.  I'm definitely not saying it's bad to speak more than one language but in most cases, it's about exposure to multiple languages.  I'm convinced that virtually everyone could speak 2, 3 or more languages if they were immersed in an environment where it's necessary.

I mean, what's the best way to learn a language?  Move to the place where it's spoken.

Also, it's not like the Europeans all love each other.  Sure, they all share the same currency and they have their EU but it's not like they speak each others' languages because they like each other, it's because they need to be able to understand each other.  For example, how else could you run a business that operates in Spain, Italy, France and Germany?  Of course, you could use English but you'd probably want to know at least a little bit of the languages spoken by your customers/partners.

Also, the fact that you can communicate with so many people in the US with just one language is a blessing as much as it is a curse.  It's convenient to have a universal language.  The fact that it's also a language a chunk of the rest of the world knows is also a plus for us.

Yes, you can (and will, I'm sure) make the counter argument along the lines of ... what if the parents are abusing the child?  By what morality are you evaluating abuse?  General society?  It goes back to the same arguments earlier about parental rights.  And the argument has been heard in courts with parents who refuse medical treatment for their child.  To me the dangers of having someone else think they have the right to decide what is best for my child are greater than the dangers of a few parents not taking care of their children.  Besides, those same ""forces"" that want to ""protect"" the child seem to be the same ""forces"" that want to make abortion readily available - where's the logic in that? I've got to feed a child who has been born, but it's okay to kill it before it comes out of the womb?

Anytime ""society"", especially in the form of gov't authority, takes power away from the individual, we all lose freedom.  It amazes me that some of those who scream the loudest for ""freedom"" actually espouse policies that take away genuine freedom ... they take away our economic ability with taxes, they take away our decision making with onerous laws, etc.

Imagine, if you will, a dominate Christian society where you were shunned, ostracized, physically hurt, thrown in jail, etc. because you did things, or believed things, that weren't ""Christian"".  Not too hard because those societies existed in Europe, and to some degree the US, in the past.  Was it ""right"" for those societies to do what they did?  Your gut tells you ""no"" but every single argument you make says not only was it okay for them to do it, it was the ""right"" thing to do at the time.

Christians at the time believed they were ""right"" in forcing their beliefs on others.  They were ""wrong"" because the Bible never tells us to make someone else believe (besides, you can't ""make"" anyone believe anything).  They were acting in a pragmatic, heavy-handed manner, much like the socialistic societies of today that force their view of what life should be like on the rest of us.

Genuine freedom means I let you make your choices and you live with the consequences, and you let me make my choices and live with my consequences.  Unfortunately, both sides have shown a willingness to cram their beliefs down the throat of the other.  Unfortunately for me, I live in an age when secular thought is beginning to dominate and it will have no qualms about using power (political, economic, military) to force it's view on others.

The Bible is clear that you will reap what you sow, and the fact that ""Christians"" did this very thing for centuries means we're getting our consequences now ... just don't pretend it's ""right"" because it's not.

We can keep arguing over denying a man food and shelter (I say if he works, he'll have it.  You say give it him and maybe he'll work.), but the bottom line for both of us is that our approach to dealing with issues follows naturally from whether we believe God exists or not.  If He does, then people are individually responsible and my view flows naturally.  If He doesn't, then the best we have is each other, and your view flows naturally.

I'm simply irritated by Right wingers like the BNP here in the UK using their 'barbarians at the gates' talk to scare people into voting for their racist policies. This article appears to be more of the same claptrap.

On why I did not like the article:

&gt;it is a problem when free western countries continue to entertain and allow many Muslims to immigrate but do not expect them to integrate.

There is certainly a problem with integration. I was born into a Muslim family here in Britain and have since left the faith. I become irate whenever every Muslim is characterised as a potential wife-beater and homosexual murderer. However, when the Danish cartoon controversy was going on my siblings and I never expressed strong views on the topic. It wasn’t important enough for us to really care. Not all Muslims want to get out and burn effigies. 

In fact the issue of integration bugs me too. Why are these people not integrating? I think it is the fault of both those who are immigrating and society here. Both have jointly failed to make any real attempt at creating a British-… identity like say, in the States where you can be American-Arab, American-Irish etc. 

&gt;This seems to be reassuring. But would these agnostic and unpracticing Muslims, if push came to shove, die for Islam or for France? My guess is they would, most likely, die for Islam. 

As for pointless hypothetical war situations, how do these help? I don’t like this idea that every Muslim is a part of some fifth column that will rise up and push aside Western civilisation. This is what Ms. Ali appears to be saying here. It reminds me that if the shit hits the fan (it won’t) that we may have to round up all the Muslims like the States did with the Japanese 65 years ago.     

&gt;Today, in the name of Islam, synagogues are vandalised. 

In the name of Islam? I’m not sure how many of these people speak for a religion of 1.5 billion people made up of those from differing colours, creeds, interpretations and ideologies. 
&gt;There are open denials of the Holocaust. 

Holocaust deniers are largely ignored because they’re a fringe of crazies. 

&gt;There is an active network of Muslim organisations lobbying to curtail 

And Israel shouldn't be curtailed?

&gt;or even get rid of Israel. 

Is this even a possibility? Again, the crazies are ignored. 

&gt;There are incidents of Jews being harassed, beaten, even killed. 

Are they not investigated by the authorities? Are these cases treated different from any other violent crime? Or are they ignored because it might piss off the Muslims?

&gt;All this is met with grim silence and rationalisations that it's not really anti-Semitic but anti-Israel. 

I don’t know of any publications that have rationalised violent acts in Europe as being anti-Israel like it was ok.  

&gt; Even if they were asked to make the final sacrifice, many a post-modern lily-livered European would escape into an obscure mesh of conscientious objection. All that Islam has to do is walk into the vacuum.

I down voted the article because I think it stinks of fear mongering. However, I do appreciate your fears on the integration of some who come to either one of our islands. But I think the debate should take place in a more grounded manner without scare stories about how the Muslims will push over our pansy, liberal, innocent civilisation.

Independent international veterinarians and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts concluded that the suggestions by anti-sealing groups that many seals are skinned alive are not true. In fact, EFSA said in its 2007 report that “it is incorrect to conclude that 42% of the seals in the sample were skinned alive.”

&gt;Sometimes a seal may appear to be moving after it has been killed; however seals show muscle activity (referred to as a ‘swimming reflex’) even after death. This reflex gives the false impression that the animal is still alive– similar to the reflex in chickens.

&gt;Recent changes to the Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) will enhance the humaneness of the annual seal hunt. These changes include the three-step process (stunning, checking, and bleeding the seals); and require sealers to verify death and animals being bled for a minimum of one minute prior to skinning.

First off, much of their sources are from EWEA, which is literally an industry group of wind manufacturers:

&gt;The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) is the voice of the wind industry, actively promoting the utilisation of wind power in Europe and worldwide.    
...    
&gt;It now has over 550 members from over 50 countries including manufacturers with a 90% share of the global wind power market, plus component suppliers, research institutes, national wind and renewables associations, developers, contractors, electricity providers, finance and insurance companies and consultants. This combined strength makes EWEA the world’s largest and most powerful wind energy network. 

http://www.ewea.org/index.php?id=6

Incredible! The balls! Take rosy data on the oil industry from Exxon, and you're a shill. Take coal propganda straight from a coal company PR spokesperson, and that's unacceptable. But take the wind industry's ""wind power is cheap and effective!"" spin straight from the fucking wind industry lobbyists, and oh, that's *business as usual* at the fucking oil drum. FUCK YOU LYING SHIT TURDS.

Moving on: the graph of wind generation they have (""from wikipedia"") is a cherry-picked lie. It is clearly chosen to hide and obfuscate the intermittency of wind. Take a look at a much longer time interval, and you see how bullshit it is, e.g.

(UK)    
http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c4/page_32.shtml

or

(Denmark)    
http://books.google.com/books?id=IBCJNmvWWMQC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0

There are week-long intervals without wind! And the second graph is fucking *offshore turbines*!

And what about their ""intermittency is not an issue"" spin?

&gt;In the case of wind, the cost of the service (which a wind producer needs to pay to the grid operator in order to be able to provide its service, which is the same of kWh) is estimated at 2-4 EUR/MWh, i.e. 5% or less of the cost of wind.

And that absurdly rosy figure was, as expected, taken straight from EWEA industry spin doctors. Smooth.

Reality is, no one knows what it would cost to have a majority wind-powered grid, because *no one's ever succeeded at doing it*. With capacity factors in the [20-30%](http://lightbucket.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/the-capacity-factor-of-wind-power/) range, it's pretty much a given you'll need 1-1 matching with backup reserve power (natural gas or hydro); and where hydropower is not enough (and this would usually be the case), natural gas power running 60%+ of the time is, well, very expensive. And not really that clean other. Even by their own (highly suspect) figures on this page, natural gas is clearly very expensive. And when you have both gas and wind alternating back and forth, each spending half the time idling... well fuck that.

However, this could be an indicator: the world's most intensive wind market, Denmark (~20% wind), has *by far* the highest electricity prices in the developed world - US 38c/kWh: (pdf p.45)

http://www.iea.org/Textbase/publications/free_new_Desc.asp?PUBS_ID=1199

Here's a description of how this is handled. At its peak the wind turbines produce far more than 20% of Danish electric grid - I think more than half; but they also spend days at a time with almost none (even though these are ""reliable"" offshore turbines); it averages out to 20%. So they have massive transmission cables across the North Sea, from which they import/export power using hydropower dams for load balancing. (The other Scandinavian countries are some of the most intense hydro-power economies in the world - ~100% for Norway, and ~50% for Sweden IIRC).

The first problem I see with your comment is the 'free-markets, NOW' part.  As I slowly realize the ideals of libertarianism, I think the worst thing we can do is attempt to make the switch cold turkey, and I know Ron Paul addresses that in his most recent book--calling for a definite 'transitional' period.  Our current economic policies in place have created massive cartels that basically dominate us entirely; to give them free reign now would be the equivalent of suicide or voluntarily enslavement, more like.

&gt;just pigs who use the free market to line their wallets, only to abandon it in a second once they fuck up, as this bailout has shown.

Yeah, but bailouts wouldn't occur under a free market, and neither would companies be able to get too big to fail.  Government intervention in the market is what creates these massive multi-national entities without consciences.  These entities already use their power to influence the government to enslave us, I just have to know why it will be 'lessened' under socialist ideology.  It seems like bail-outs would be more frequent, worse, and legitimized at the same time, which worries me greatly.  

Thanks for your writing, I don't disagree with all of it, or the tone, and I appreciate the convo.  I'm definitely intrigued by both sides.  Lately, however, with our eroding civil liberties under the guise of the government caring about us and trying to protect us, socialism seems to inevitably lead to authoritarianism, as governments continue to consolidate power like they *always* do.  I realize the European model has been successful thus far, but I'm suspect, especially with the creation of the EU, that they'll be worse off--UK style--than us soon.  The future will tell.

If you remember, the Boarder States were slave states that actually fought *with* the Union and were not subject to the Emancipation Proclamation as that simply stated that slaves in rebellious states were now free, even though that effectively did nothing. Anyway, the Boarder States fought for the Union while keeping slavery until just after the war.

The whole argument about the Confederate flag equating to slavery is completely wrong because 1) the war only became about slavery in 1863 when Lincoln adopted the abolitionist movement to try and gain political support for continuing the war, which he was losing rather badly. 2) The flag in question is the Confederate *battle* flag; more specifically the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, which was later adopted by all Confederate units. It symbolizes the fighting and sacrifice, not any political ideology. Most men who fought and died under it had no connection to slavery. Poor whites in the South actually lost jobs to slaves so most of them probably hated it. They fought for states rights, plain and simple. 3) the 13 colonies fought for their own political freedom while retaining slavery for at least a few more years in northern states. It is very probable that, had the Confederacy succeeded in breaking away from the US that they would have had to have given up slavery in order to maintain trade and relations with western Europe. Slavery what their main reason for *not* officially helping the South during the war.

&gt; ""In addition, thanks to the new transparency requirements, consumers will be informed – even before signing a contract — about the nature of the service to which they are subscribing, including traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality, as well as any other limitations (such as bandwidth caps or available connection speed),"" the Commission said.

&gt; The Commission specifically referred to these new rules as being designed to promote ""net neutrality"" and ""net freedoms"" for European citizens. The idea of net neutrality, or the equality of services on the internet, has traditionally been seen as an American issue, due to more limited competition in the US ISP market.

&gt; Recognizing internet access as a fundamental right, the Commission said that ""any measures taken regarding access to or use of services and applications through electronic communications networks must respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens, including in relation to privacy, freedom of expression and access to information and education, as well as due process"".

&gt; The final word in any disputes regarding internet access must rest with a judicial authority, the Commission added.

If you search around, you can probably find some good deals. 

If you have more money and time, I also recommend going to Europe. I've been to London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, Milan, and Venice. London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Rome were all super cool.

blackstar9000,1,atheism,0,0,False,,,,"Mmhmm.  The article is about section 2c of the survey, which focuses specifically on European Muslims.  If that isn't what you were criticizing, then you've seriously confused the issue by making the primary link to an article that's specifically about the findings in that section.

Beyond which, I'm not exactly sure what part you think atheism should have in this.  This isn't a census; not being represented on it doesn't imply that you've been marginalized.  It's reasonable to limit the scope of some surveys so as to compass a particular range of inquiry.  It sounds like your real beef isn't with the article, or with the survey per se, but with The Coexist Foundation for not including atheists in their scope of inquiry.

But why should it?  The Coexist Foundation is a organization dedicated to promoting peaceful relations between Jews, Christians and Muslims.  If it excludes atheists from that group, that's probably because atheists aren't a prominent part of the conflicts that motivate their inquiry, and wouldn't, at any rate, be covered by the CF's methodology, which involved stressing the common traditions that bind Jews, Christians and Muslims.  In other words, it's a foundation dedicated to the problem of *interfaith* conflict, and specifically dealing with conflicts within the Abrahamic tradition, which is why not only atheism but also Buddhism, Shintoism and Hinduism are left out of the findings.

Going back to the actual [report][1](PDF) itself, it's specific focus is, again, on Muslims.  Scan through it.  Muslims are the only religious group mentioned throughout most of it; the only group they're compared against is the general ""public"" of corresponding regions.  You'll be hard pressed to find specific mention of any other religious group in the report.

This isn't bias.

Can you imagine if some artist today made a protest song against Israel?

Human beings react differently to trauma. And oddly the abused child of a raging lunatic often becomes one and repeats the process. . .

I think if any person spent a few days researching the history of Israel it would become clear what has happened to the ""group mind"" of the state.
 ~Sidebar: a recent best seller in Israel that rocked the country was based on some strong evidence that the Palestinians are the actual ancient people of Judea, that most stayed and converted to Islam after the Saracen invasion and that modern Jews are mostly European converts to the religion and were never from the Middle East.

The brutal truth is that Israel has taken on many characteristics of the Nazis. In no way am I saying they are Nazi Germany but having a culture in which it is socially acceptable to have soldiers print and wear t-shirts mocking the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza leans more towards Nazi Germany than many would like to admit.

What is unnerving is when the race card is pulled when this is brought up. Or, how many jewish people feel that any condemnation of the state of Israel is masked antisemitism. I am African (enough already, if it is ok for my neighbor to sya he is Italian--even though if I asked him Di dove sei? he would stare at me blankly and calls sauce gravy--I am African, not black) and would find it hard to defend the actions of Idi Amin just because our genes are similar. 

I think that Israel should either go through a partition or hold far and open elections.

After that, it was just a matter of finding cheap hostels to stay in and cheap food to eat. Italy, was for a honeymoon so it was more expensive as we chose to stay in nicer hotels but that was still only around 3500 for both my wife and I for about a week. My parents took me to Yosemite and Yellowstone so I don't know how much it cost but I'm sure it pretty cheap. Anyway, I guess I've gotten to do some cool things but I'd rather you stop envying me.

Oh no, I didn't say or mean to say that Democracy was a repudiation of religion at all... I said it was a repudiation of having a government run by the church. It was a transfer of power from kings and emperors who ruled by god's will or who were even considered to be (semi)gods in some cases, to a system run by the people. That's why democracy is different and special. Why would your opinion matter as a citizen when you're ruled by a king who is part god? Clearly it wouldn't, and your rights in such a society would be drastically less than in ours.

The First Amendment only mentions religion to say ""[Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment)"". This was a response to some states establishing official state religions. The clause protects the free exercise of religion, and prohibits congress from favoring one religion over another. Obviously that was done to protect the people who would end up in the minority because they might not be members of the official religion. And it was done because of our experience with the European systems of government.

Slave states had no problem joining the Union and the Union had no problem with slaveholding members.  The emancipation proclamation came well over a year later.

The North and South had opposing interests regarding economic relations between the US and Europe.  The South was primarily agrarian and wanted low barriers to trade in order to sell more raw materials to Europe, while the North wanted protectionist measures to prevent the undercutting of their domestic market with cheaper European manufactured goods.  Europeans also had an interest in opposing protectionism both for the reasons that the South did and the reasons that the North didn't.  Britain and France engaged in political manipulation leading up to the war and threatened entrance on behalf of the Confederacy during it.

Buchanan, the president previous to Lincoln, under whom secessions began said quite accurately that: ""the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union"" was not among the ""enumerated powers granted to Congress"".

There are more, but check out the Origins of the Civil War wiki.  Insofar as slavery was a central cause, it was with regards to the status of new states, not existing ones.

Further, its important to understand that opposition to slavery was based as thoroughly on economic grounds (it depressed the wages of whites who were forced to compete with free labor; look into the Free Soil Party) as any others.  Advocating equality was considered radical anywhere and there was no perception of inborn equality.

Lincoln once joked in a speech that he neither advocated the right of blacks and whites to marry, nor would he consider it himself (that was the punchline).  He also said ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it; if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; if I could save the union by freeing some slaves and not others, I would do that.

""Slavery"" is a neat, tidy  and politically convenient explanation for the war that totally misrepresents the complexity of the circumstances as well as the motives of both sides..

Oh, and lastly, other states supporting slavery does not impart on the Congress the power to retain them in the Union by force.

The US isn't like the EU, with regards to out of state visitors. Someone from Montana could be visiting California, however he's still American, while a tourist in your country would more likely be out of state, with completely different standards/culture/etc.



It's not all perfect across borders, though, and the little state traditions will be picked up.

For example: Americans find picking noses disgusting. All 50 states share the same belief. Lets say peeing in a dark corner in Denmark is acceptable, so the Dane might go ahead with peeing in a corner in the Netherlands, not knowing the customs, even as far as not caring.



What kinds of crime happen near your border? Smugglers? The US states don't even have border posts, just signs across the highway welcoming you into the state.

Alternatively, you can examine the ways in which Dawkins fails to address the substantial bodies of work in the fields of history, sociology, philosophy, and psychology investigating religious phenomena, opting instead for oversimplifications or outright dismissals; you can use this to explore a cultural trend of intellectual imperialism in which the ""hard"" sciences are viewed as being inherently more valid than humanities or social sciences.

Nonesense! I keep track of all my gaming expenses, hardware as well as software.  I invest 300,- in gaming every 4 years, when I buy a new computer, and 100,- more after 2 years for a new graphics card (Thats $ as well as EUR, since both hardware and software is usually much more expensive in Europe).

That's 100,- per year for hardware. And the only reason you come to a higher price is because you add the price for the whole pc to the calculation!  Seriously, that's complete nonesense. Do you count your TV and the rent to your flat into console gaming cost? 

I used to have a PS2, did not play any games on the PC for 4 years, and I still had to pay 500,- every 4 years to get a new PC (By the way: I do not have a TV or a high-fi system. I have a PC instead).

Then, xbox live membership is another 60 Euro/$80 each year just to play games with people.

Then, software costs. Here is my data for 2008/09 (in Euro): 

* Avg price/game: 12.89
* Median price/game: 5
* Most expensive game: 49.9
* cheapest game: 2.5

Now, you can buy older games for consoles as well, but because the console market is regulated, there is less competition. The result is that the prices are higher, and there are no bargain deals like on the PC. On PC, a good 2 year old game with good reviews can be bought for $5. Games that sell well for $45 are expected to come with a very good multi year service, including lots of content at no additional costs. On the console, you even have to pay for maps.

I like PCs for many reasons, but the most honest reason why I'm using them is because gaming is dead cheap. And I'm proud to be a cheap ass gamer.

&gt;A lot of people I know have a strong aversion to &gt;taking a step backwards in terms of graphics, but I &gt;think the industry as a whole would benefit from it.


I don't have an aversion against that step backward, and I agree that this step is necessary.  What I'm saying is that most PC gaming companies are already on board.

killerstorm,0,Economics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt; Our bankers aren't on strike, but they are certainly being paid by the state. They just threaten economic doom instead of striking.

they were not paid, they recieved loans or sold part of their business.

also, we are apeaking about European Union, afair they had much less bailouts there.

&gt; Assuming the economy continues to worsen, and it will, then the government defaulting on payments is extremely likely.

you should distinguish debts denominated in national currency and debts denominated in something else. 

it is extremely unlikely for a country to default on their national currency debts, as they can create any amount of it at will.

it is another thing when they have to pay with some other currency or commodities, as they have real value.

Weimar Republic payed reparations denominated in gold, therefore they had huge payment deficit and eventually had to default.

rather than just looking on debts, you should look on payment and trade balance -- that is what can cause default and high inflation. if you produce little but buy a lot, you have a problem: first, national currency will get devalued, then it can cause a default. note that it is self-regulating system: overconsumption causes national currency devaluation, which curbs consumption (people can buy less stuff for same money) and props up exports, as they become relatively cheaper.

EU has somewhat negative trade balance, but it is rather low relative to GDP (largest in the word, by the way). by no means it can cause _hyper_inflation, that would require major destruction of european economy. and slight deficit is not a problem at all -- if it goes too far, euro will get slightly devalued, they'll have more exports and less imports, and balance will be restored.

&gt; I'm not sure what you meant by ""they can demand it back"" anyway - we are the borrowers not the lenders.

there is no ""we"". there is a central bank which lends money. and there is a treasury that borrows money. what treasury does is mostly irrelevant to discussion, as it is central bank who manages money supply.

modern central banks have lots of tools how they can affect money supply -- from selling papers, to rising reserve requirements, to just stopping refinancing so banks will have to return money after term ends. they essentially can do whatever they want with money.

&gt; If fighting inflation was as simple as ""take the money back"" then inflation never would have been a problem to any nation throughout history.

inflation itself is never a root problem, in modern history, at least. the root problem can be a lack of economic growth, budget deficit, negative trade balance etc. inflation is more like a solution how to go through hard times. central bank can choose to curb inflation, but consequences might be bank failures and further economic slowdown.

In the next few months there will be enormous pressure on the entity.  The EU will stall negotiations for tighter union, Arab countries will stand united with the USA demanding the broad acceptance of the Arab peace plan (which actually just re-iterates the UN resolutions) and the USA hopefully will be crewel to be kind to Israel - and ignore Iran until they have an agreement with the Pals.

Expect Israel to pull every old trick out of the book - Must recognise Israel as a Jewish state, ALL violence from the Pals must stop before we do anything, halt to building except 'natural' expansion etc etc.

These are all tired devices designed to appeal to people who want Israel to keep all the Pals land.  The new US administration is not stuffed with idiots anymore.  They know that ultimately without a comprehensive peace in the ME someone else but Israel will get a nuke - then the real terror will start.  

It is just not possible to keep the Nuclear genie in the bottle for ever and Obama knows it.  The current situation where gang of five are allowed these weapons and other are not is wholly unjustifiable.  Being British I am too well aware how comforting it feels to know that if anyone fucks with us we can destroy them – but I now totally support getting rid of them and I vote we do it unilaterally. If the rest of the five are not prepared to do it too then I see no reason why we should stop anyone having them – it’s an indefensible position to maintain.

Back to the entity, once its made clear that the world expects them to give back the stolen lands and will not take no for an answer I believe we should off some of the following carrots to it:

. Membership of NATO
. Membership of the EU
. Move our Embassies to West Jerusalem
. Contributions towards a fund to compensate the settlers and the Pals who had their homes and land stolen in the ethnic cleansing.
. Full recognition from all belligerent counties in the ME

But there are down sides too:

1.	They cannot control the water supply – it needs joint control.
2.	They have to get out of the West Bank, Gaza, Golan and East J. – maybe a small land swap to be agreed between the two.
3.	A full declaration of their Nuclear arsenal, sign the NNPT , regular inspections and an agreement to get rid of them all within 25 years.
4.	Reduction in the size of their Armed forces to a reasonable non threatening defensive level within 25 years.
5.	No control of Pal. Air space or electromagnetic spectrum. No right to enter Palestine without prior agreement. 
6.	No ambiguous binding UN resolution enshrining the agreement into internation law.
7.	Sign up to monitoring by the UN.


But the biggest carrot for the new Israel will be the ability to live knowing that you can get on with building your lives without violence and in security.

And on a personal level I will then stop my family boycott of Israel and willingly buy their goods.

eltower,3,wikipedia,0,0,False,,,,"**tl;dr:**

**You can get around with either of (or both) French and German.**

It depends on where you're going to live. Most people here speak at least two of the four official languages, which are

- German
- French
- Italian
- Romantsch

The last one is a minority language spoken by 20,000 people near the Austrian border, don't bother about it.

Italian is only spoken in the Italian part (which has the best food).

French is spoken in the French part but there's bits where it overlaps.

German is spoken in the German bits which are the largest except, again, where it overlaps with French.

If you're going to live in Switzerland there's only really a few places I can imagine you would have any reason to go (unless you're Tina Turner or Phil Collins and you want to 'live' in remote villages for tax purposes).

Zürich is the biggest city by far, with a modest 300'000 inhabitants. The main language is German, and it's a must. You can get around in English fairly well but you really need to speak German. Zürich is a financial nerve centre of Switzerland and of Europe too. It houses the world renowned ETHZ Polytechnic University which has produced 20 Nobel laureates, including Albert Einstein. The food is German though, something to consider (because German food is an acquired taste).

The other major city is Geneva, on the other end of Switzerland. The main language is French and you can't get around without it but because it's such an international city (it headquarters the UN and loads of banks with a lot of shady people running about) many, many people speak English. Since it's also the headquarters (again, for tax purposes) for European companies or European branches of multinational companies, there's a lot of bustling movement and English spoken generally. It has 120,000 inhabitants (get used to small cities, Switzerland as a country has a mere 5 million inhabitants).

As for me, I live in Lausanne, where I study in the EPFL, the ETHZ's sister university (they're the two Federal Polytechnic Universities). It's marginally smaller than Geneva and it's less bustling. It's the HQ for the International Olympic Committee and life basically goes on in French. The EPFL has undergraduate courses entirely in French with some Master courses in English, so there's a lot of international life as well, but French is the functional language.

Living in Switzerland depends on where you're from. You're good to go if you're Swiss (except for having to keep an automatic rifle in your household at all times and having to renew your military service every year).

If you're from the EU, like me, you need to apply yearly for one of a myriad of residence permits but because Switzerland is a Schengen country now, with an EU passport (even with a Romanian and Bulgarian one now), you can travel with very little restrictions and living is not a hassle.

I am currently unaware of the situation for non-EU nationals but you can imagine that living in CH as a Burundian national is many-fold harder than living here as a US citizen, for instance. For what it's worth, there's a sizeable refugee population in the country, which creates a really bizarre immigrant ethnic mixup. 

In practical terms, the most spoken languages are German and French and with either of those two or both you can survive anywhere. In order of number of speakers, the languages in Switzerland are:

- German
- French
- Italian
- English
- Serbo-Croatian
- Albanian
- Turkish

[deleted],11,politics,0,0,False,,,,"somalia is an example of chaos, not a political philosophy--its just a bunch of war lords vying for power. the situation there is far closer to that of europe in the middle ages than to anarchism (the closest thing to anarchism right now is the amish).


and the problems in somalia don't derive from statelessness, they derive from selfishness-- everyone is out for themselves and only themselves. and when everyone is out for themselves, and where there isn't one person (or group) that is clearly dominant, which can impose order, you always in up in a chaotic situation of ""might making right,"" until such time as a person or group succeeds in consolidating power. 


even if somalia had a government right now, it would only make a difference if the government was the strongest party, otherwise, somalia would still look pretty much the way it does now.


i honestly believe that if libertarians got their wish, the result would be somalia-like every time, no matter where it occured, because libetarianism is hyper-individualistic and inherently selfish. hyper-individualism, without any constraining authority, inevitably leads to situations where those who are able, do whatever they can get away with; and the weak have no recourse and no protection, unless they submit and ally themselves to the strong--ironically, leading to a feudal system, where only the strong have liberty.


both libertarianism and anarchism are profoundly concerned with personal autonomy. the difference is that libertarian autonomy is founded on individualism and anarchistic autonomy is founded on collectivism. 

individualistic autonomy starts from the premise that not only are you entitled to do whatever you want to, no one else is entitled to encumber your doing so, unless it effects them. it then moves to its second premise, which is patently false, that all people are equally able to exercise and defend their own autonomy. and thus it results in power struggles in which each person is fighting to exercise his or her autonomy against everyone else. the strong prosper and the weak suffer.

collectivistic autonomy starts from the same  premise that you are entitled to do whatever you want to, and that no one else is entitled to encumber your doing so unless it effects them. but it then moves to its second premise, which is the exact opposite of the libertarian's--that the ability of people to exercise and defend their own autonomy is not equal, so everyone's autonomy is limited by the outcome their actions would have on the other members of the community and the community as a whole (and even on the future generations of the community). if your own sense of solidarity, morality, and fairness are not enough to get you to exercise your autonomy justly, then the community will defend itself and those you are bullying, against you. as the amish show, there is no need for a state or codified punishment for this to work--in the case of the amish, in extreme cases, the offensive person is merely asked to leave the community(with the understanding that he or she is welcome back whenever he or she decides to quite being a nuisance).


since in most situations, the exercise of autonomy has only a trivial impact on other people, in anarchist communities, which deeply value the autonomy of their members, collective limitations on autonomy would be serious decisions that would also be viewed in light of their effect on the health and well-being of the community; they would not be undertaken lightly.


its important to acknowledge that there is no situation in which a person can have perfect autonomy. even if he or she is the only person on earth, his or her autonomy is still constrained by the environment, the laws of physics, and his or her own imagination and ability.

""The Cynics of Ancient Greece were originators of anarchism;[2] the philosopher Zeno of Citium, in opposition to Plato, argued that reason should replace authority in guiding human affairs. In China, the Taoist sage Lao Zi (Lao Tzu) developed a philosophy of ""non-rule"" in the Tao Te Ching and many Taoists in return lived an anarchist lifestyle. In 300 CE, Bao Jingyan explicitly argued that there should be neither lords nor subjects.[3]

There were a variety of anarchistic religious movements in Europe during the Middle Ages, including the Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit, the Klompdraggers, the Hussites, Adamites and the early Anabaptists.[4] Prior to Leo Tolstoy, Christian anarchism found one of its most articulate exponents in Gerrard Winstanley, who was part of the Diggers movement in England during the English Civil War. Drawing on the Scriptures, Winstanley argued that ""the blessings of the earth"" should ""be common to all... and none Lord over others.""[2]""

CaspianX2,2,AskReddit,0,0,False,,,,"As I understand it, memes propagate and change much like genes propagate and change, and there's a similar notion of ""survival of the fittest"". It also has a similar kind of specialization depending on the environment.

For example, genetically ""black people"" and ""white people"" are merely subsets of ""people"", where people living in a warmer environment evolved to have a darker skin tone than those living in a colder climate.

By the same right, an ""internet meme"" is a subset of ""meme"", and a ""Reddit meme"" is a subset of ""internet meme"". A meme like ""Thrust"" has grown to fit within the Reddit community and primarily the Reddit community, and it is currently just as poorly equipped to survive as a meme in the ""real world"" as an ostrich would be able to survive in Antarctica - even though other birds have evolved to suit that environment, ostriches have evolved to fit a different environment.

Meanwhile, a meme like ""Rickroll"", which originated within the 4chan environment, not only prospered in that environment but was adaptable enough to suit other environments as well, and thus transformed from a ""4chan meme"" to an ""internet meme"", and even in some areas to a more general ""meme"" (being how it was used in the Thanksgiving Day Parade).

So ""Rickroll"" in its adaptability as a meme is just as prevalent as, say, rats or cockroaches in a genetic sense, in that it may have evolved in a localized area, but was so successful that it quickly spread to other environments as well, and is now nearly universal.

So in other words, memes are *exactly* like genes, and a ""Reddit meme"" is just a specific form of meme, just like a ""primate gene"" is a more specific form of gene.

Edit: I just realized, in that last paragraph, the analogy would probably be more accurate if I compared ""Reddit meme"" to ""Africa gene"" or ""European gene"" (instead of ""primate gene"") as ""Reddit meme"" refers to the place where the meme flourishes, not the type of meme it is.",True,t1_c09exwq,2,c09fggk,1425966700,1241802795,t1_c09fggk,0,True,t3_8ip7w,t5_2qh1i

He had a fear that his works, were they to abandon representation completely, would be dismissed as decorative--this idea that came with the embrace of ""primitive"" arts in Europe, like the arts of Africa, etc--and he never took that big step. The abstract expressionists, especially Pollock, were incredibly influenced by Kandinsky, and a lot of Pollock's earlier works resemble his: Apparently abstracted compositions that actually hide a figurative narrative. One example I can think of is his work, ""Pasiphae."" But then he abandoned that for a completely abstract art, and he finished art, in a sense.

There are two things going on in this movie: 

On the surface, it's a high speed chase film. The main character spends a majority of the movie running for his life; the guys chasing him are trying to fuckin' kill him.

Actually, we don't have regular border patrols within the EU either. The problem with drug tourism from the Dutch point of view is actually not that foreigners own drugs which are prohibited once they return home, or a cultural difference in manners.

The problems arise due to differences in jurisdiction and the major difference in the legality of weed.

A city of 100k easily gets 100k drug tourists a month, which frequently cause all kinds of minor problems like vandalism/littering/traffic violations, and are hard to prosecute across national borders. Even though only a small percentage causes problems, the numbers quickly add up. The numbers get significantly compared to other cities. Result: locals are pissed.

Criminals are attracted to the border cities, since the tourists create a large market for coke, cocaine, and high volumes of weed (not legal here), as well. Causing all kinds of problems as well.

The neighbouring countries cooperate only partially, but since they do not like our drug policy, a proper solution is unobtainable.

Much of these problems can be solved by making the full weed chain (production, transportation) legal, since that would eliminate the need for criminals to supply the coffeeshops. But the tourism won't go away until neighbouring countries make weed legal. And thus there will always be increased crime attracted to that tourism, along the border.

This crime is a result of our drug policy (and those of the neighbouring countries, but they're harder to influence). Of course, we pro-weed guys claim it is better than the alternative, which generates a lot more crime. But people on local and national level might not agree, and politicians will be sensitive to their plight. You will still have a lot of people who do not like marijuana, do not use it, or do not care about it to fight for it to stay legal. And a constant push from other countries to stop behaving so immoral. Those countries have to defend their own policies, after all.

Of course, these problems may well not occur within California. The US has a more violent and infamous crime history, much of it already linked to drugs. The reduction in crime through legalisation of weed may be quite visible.

[deleted],2,politics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt;FWIW though I tend to have a pretty expansive view of what a capitalist society is, and it runs the gamut from Hong Kong to Sweden, as generally speaking the ownership of the means or production in all these societies is owned by the individual, and the individual (to varying percents) reaps the reward to their own labor

i think maybe you are confusing ""private ownership"" with ""individual ownership."" what you describe-- individuals owning the means of production and reaping the benefits thereof--is actually much closer to socialism than i think you intend...

all of the countries you mention are capitalist, but not because individuals own the means of production and reap the rewards individually, but because capital and the means of production are privately and exclusively owned by capitalists, who are the ones  exclusively reaping the rewards of labor.

just because you are paid for your work, does not mean that you are ""reaping its reward;"" it's almost guaranteed that you are not. wages in capitalist countries are inherently unjust when viewed by any form of objective criteria; some capitalist countries just tolerate more unjust wages than others.

&gt;While the USSR is certainly not the Marxian idea of socialism, in many ways it illustrates the problem of trying to have a mass revolution where one converts the ownership of the means of production away from individuals.

well, not really; it represents the problem of trying to not only maintain a capitalist production ethos (i.e. creating surplus commodities for as many markets as you can) without the tools of capitalism, while trying to beat capitalism at its own game without those same tools too. i don't like capitalism at all, but i admit, it is extremely successful at achieving its goals (it was sheer stupidity for the USSR to try to emulate it and beat its at it own game).

it also represents the problem that the anarchists pointed out a century ago, that you cannot expect a stateless, egalitarian society to emerge from an hierarchical state structure. the best you can hope to achieve from an hierarchical state structure is an kinder, gentler hierarchical state structure...


&gt;Part of the problem though when dealing with socialists, is that they tend to critique an actual society (US, Europe etc), yet tend to deny that any ""true"" Socialist state exists, preventing real criticism of socialism in practice.

but other than with groups like the amish, where has socialism existed?

tevoul,1,gaming,0,0,False,,,,"&gt; I invest 300,- in gaming every 4 years, when I buy a new computer, and 100,- more after 2 years for a new graphics card

How exactly do you get the $300 figure? You already said that you are removing the price of ""the whole PC"", so which parts are you counting and which parts are you not counting?

&gt; ...the only reason you come to a higher price is because you add the price for the whole pc to the calculation! Seriously, that's complete nonesense.

Not really if you realize that if you aren't doing anything resource intensive computers will last you much, much longer than if you are trying to game on them. To reinforce that fact I have two examples. I have a computer in my home that is still in use today that is only used for web browsing and very basic computer needs. This covers at least 80% of what non-gamers use their computers for. It cost roughly $600 total and was purchased in 1999, or 10 years ago. Only in the past couple years has it finally reached the point where it can't do EVERYTHING non-gamers usually do on their computers (I know this because up until two years ago, my father was using this computer as his primary computer). He is a software engineer, so he uses it for email, web browsing, writing code, taxes, etc. By far more than the ""average"" non gamer. $600 every 8 years is far less than I expect you pay for your base PC before ""gaming hardware needs"".

The second example is my laptop. I bought it 4 years ago for $200 (I got it on sale). It has done everything I could ever hope it to do besides gaming, I use it for email, web browsing, mobile computing, took notes in class with it, you name it. It still works great, and I still use it on a daily basis for everything I need a computer for besides gaming. It has lasted 4 years at a cost of $200. Tell me with a straight face that your base PC before gaming accessories costs you $200.

I agree that you probably have to subtract out the cost of some computer you would have if you weren't a gamer, but assuming that you would replace the CPU/RAM/mobo as often as you would with a gaming machine is pure nonsense.

&gt; Do you count your TV and the rent to your flat into console gaming cost?

If I intentionally bought that $3000 42"" high def TV instead of that $1000 32"" plasma screen just so I can play games in high def, yeah I totally would include the $2000 difference in the cost of gaming.

Don't get me wrong, there are some reasons you would need a faster computer other than gaming. If you did audio/video editing, 3d rendering for a job, etc. You could also WANT a faster computer just because its more responsive and loads things a bit faster, but honestly you do not need to spend much money to get a computer to load web browsers fast. My current desktop is 5 years old, still using a single core processor and DDR1 RAM. Whole thing cost me a grand total of $800, and it was designed as a gaming machine. It can still run games today (assuming the devs don't get lazy and refuse to put in compatability for ""old"" video cards) and runs non-gaming programs like a dream. I won't need to upgrade or throw out this machine for non-gaming purposes for years to come.

&gt; did not play any games on the PC for 4 years, and I still had to pay 500,- every 4 years to get a new PC (By the way: I do not have a TV or a high-fi system. I have a PC instead).

I can guarantee you that if you take care of your computer and can optimize it (which should be essential to any PC gamer) you don't need to shell out $500 every 4 years just to keep a web browser going and to enable effective TV replacement. A traditional thing to do is to take your 4-6 year old gaming machine after you replace it and turn it into a DVR. Computers don't need to be fast or advanced to play video. Even my old Pentium III 866 Mhz computer with a voodoo3 graphics card and 128 mb of SDRAM can do that.

Getting to your average software costs, if that is the case then you have to be buying almost exclusively bargain bin or Europe is the Mecca of gaming cheapness and I need to get my ass over there instantly if not sooner. I dunno what average prices for you are, but in America $50-$60 for a new game and $20-$30 for a game that is older than 3 or 4 years. The only time games are below $20 is if they are indie games or if they are used copies of unpopular games found at the gamestop bargain bin. If you are playing nothing but bargain bin games the kudos to you, I think older games were better anyway. 1997-2002 gaming kicked ass, and recent games are way worse than them in my opinion. Sadly, this is not the opinion of the gaming community as a whole (no matter how much we want it to be so) and even if it were, we are comparing modern gaming for both PCs and consoles. If you were buying past generation games for PC anyway, you'd have to compare it to the N64 or PS1 (or MAYBE PS2, but we already all know that the PS2 was so far the greatest console ever made. I'll still take a PC over it for everything except RPGs).

&gt; On PC, a good 2 year old game with good reviews can be bought for $5.

What games? Name one! The closest thing I can think of to that is Painkiller, which is older than 2 years, did NOT get great reviews at the time, and that's WHY it is cheap. It bombed at the time, didn't sell well, and later on people realized it was a better game than that.

Even Half-Life 2 with none of the addons or mods costs $20 from steam. I think you would be hard pressed to find Half-Life 2 anywhere in a store, and even if you did I doubt it would be any cheaper.

Yes, gaming on the PC CAN be cheaper than on consoles, but you have to limit yourself to specific types of games that run on lower end machines and/or are old/independently developed. I am not trying to bash these types of games, indie games have been pushing out a lot of very good games and I would love to see more of that happen, but in order to fair analysis you can't limit yourself to those games for PC and compare it to the big name $50-60 console games. That would make it an apples to oranges comparison.

&gt; I don't have an aversion against that step backward, and I agree that this step is necessary. What I'm saying is that most PC gaming companies are already on board.

Then stop arguing with me, go out and shout it to the gaming community!

That aside, I disagree when you say that MOST PC gaming companies are already on board. I think some are, and they are the smart ones. I think a lot of them aren't, because they live off sales of an overhyped game due to shiny graphics. I do think the last year or so more companies have started to come on board, but we are a long way off from most.

[His name was Khatami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatami) and, whilst you'd struggle to go as far that he was a libertarian (which he'd struggle to be as Iran's Republic is an Islamic Republic) he's definitely indicative of similar reform.  Not to mean that as derogatory but, just as America has a constitution that's *supposed* to limit what a government can do, so to was the Iranian constitution set up - only they have it so that the Republic must remain Islamic.  That's not to say they can't hold Islam to different interpretations, as many do, but essentially it was to stop another [Operation Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ajax), where the CIA and MI6 conducted a coup removing the fledgling Iranian democracy and imposed the Shah in 1953, from happening again.

Khatami studied in Europe and held the European model as something to aspire to - he was hugely popular amongst the younger electorate.  He still is.  He was responsible for freeing up much of the media and attempted to reach normal relations with the US - to the point of agreeing to give up on nuclear energy programs and to start sharing intelligence.  When the EU3 asked them to suspend enrichment whilst they drew up an agreement - this they did under Khatami.  The IAEA, and now US intelligence, believes this, with high confidence, to have been so.   Unfortunately Dick Cheney's office took the call, [as CNN reported](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC4WEcBDq2A) - and, after they got the cold shoulder (not from the UK, France &amp; Germany), with Khatami having served his maximum 2 consecutive terms, Iranians elected somebody who wouldn't be so concessionary.  That's how Ahmadinejad came to power.

Khatami is still around.  He has numerous allies amongst the conservatives, one of his close allies is other former president Rafsanjani who recently became appointed chair of the Assembly of Experts - a big thing in Iran (the Assembly of Experts is the only office that can remove the Supreme Leader).  Rafsanjani is an opponent of Ahmadinejad too but still never-the-less conservative.

Khatami has previously hinted that he might run in Iran's election but also said that if another prominent reformist were to put themselves forward then he would not compete against them.",True,t1_c09fjiw,3,c09fqho,1425966831,1241820612,t1_c09fqho,0,True,t3_8iyqr,t5_2qh13

&gt;The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms.  This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. ... Besides the advantage of being armed, ... the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. ... [The governments of Europe] are afraid to trust the people with arms. ... Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors.

&gt; A government that does not trust it's law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms is itself unworthy of trust.

&gt; The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. 

&gt; Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.

________________________________


PLAYBOY: What kind of films do you consider perverted?

WAYNE: Oh, Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy—that kind of thing. Wouldn't you say that the wonderful love of those two men in Midnight Cowboy, a story about two fags, qualifies? But don't get me wrong. As far as a man and a woman is concerned, I'm awfully happy there's a thing called sex. It's an extra something God gave us. I see no reason why it shouldn't be in pictures. Healthy, lusty sex is wonderful.

[...]

WAYNE: With a lot of blacks, there's quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can't all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don't believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.

[...]

PLAYBOY: For years American Indians have played an important—if subordinate—role in your Westerns. Do you feel any empathy with them?

WAYNE: I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that's what you're asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.

[...]

PLAYBOY: Why do you favor an all-out war [in Vietnam]?

WAYNE: I figure if we're going to send even one man to die, we ought to be in an all-out conflict. If you fight, you fight to win. And the domino theory is something to be reckoned with, too, both in Europe and in Asia. Look at what happened in Czechoslovakia and what's happened all through the Balkans. At some point we have to stop communism. So we might as well stop it right now in Vietnam.

[...]

PLAYBOY: Was the Motion Picture Alliance formed to blacklist Communists and Communist sympathizers?

WAYNE: Our organization was just a group of motion-picture people on the right side, not leftists and not Commies. I was the president for a couple of years. There was no blacklist at that time, as some people said. That was a lot of horseshit. Later on, when Congress passed some laws making it possible to take a stand against these people, we were asked about Communists in the industry. So we gave them the facts as we knew them. That's all. The only thing our side did that was anywhere near blacklisting was just running a lot of people out of the business.

PLAYBOY: That sounds a good deal worse than blacklisting. Why couldn't you permit all points of view to be expressed freely on the screen?

WAYNE: Because it's been proven that communism is foreign to the American way of life.

[...]

PLAYBOY: Many people argue that alcohol may be a more dangerous health hazard than marijuana. Would you agree?

WAYNE: There's been no top authority saying what marijuana does to you. I really don't know that much about it. I tried it once, but it didn't do anything to me. The kids say it makes them think they're going 30 miles an hour when they're going 80. If that's true, marijuana use should definitely be stopped.

PLAYBOY: Have you had any other experience with illegal drugs?

WAYNE: When I went to Hong Kong, I tried opium once, as a clinical thing. I heard it didn't make you sick the first time, and Jesus, it just didn't affect me one way or the other, either. So I'm not a very good judge of how debasing it is.

PLAYBOY: Do you think such drugs are debasing?

WAYNE: It's like water against a cliff. Each wave deteriorates it a little more. I'm quite sure that's the same thing that happens to human beings when they get hooked on drugs. What bothers me more is society's attitude toward drugs. We allowed all the hippies to stay together in Haight-Ashbury and turn it into a dirty, filthy, unattractive place. We allow the glorifying of drugs in our business—like in Easy Rider, where the guy says. ""Jesus, don't you smoke pot?""—as if smoking pot is the same as chewing Bull Durham.

PLAYBOY: You chew tobacco, don't you?

WAYNE: I learned to do that in college. During football season, when we couldn't smoke, we always used to chew.

People in cities still need other people, I think when you have a LOT of people you can't be friendly to everybody so social groups tend to form around activities, such as cultural events, political activities, and the like. Peo;

Straight of the bat: I'm European so I might see it working in a different way than over in the states.  Admittedly a sales tax or a value-added tax, if done badly can put a spanner in the works.  If done right it makes more sense - in both times of recession and prosperity; depression or boom.

**1)  It's damn easy to collect.**  Every country that heavily relies on income tax spends a small fortune appropriating it. The Grace Commission for Reagan in the 80s came back with the revelation that when it comes to income tax: 

&gt;[With two-thirds of everyone's personal income taxes wasted or not collected, 100 percent of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the Federal debt and by Federal Government contributions to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their Government.](http://www.uhuh.com/taxstuff/gracecom.htm#IRSWasted)

A sales tax is easier to track because you're only tracking businesses.  A retail business needs to apply for a VAT or sales tax number before they can open their doors.  They also need to issue a receipt (as people who they sell to maybe able to claim back the tax if they themselves are in business).  People want a tax number, the shop has to have one - and when they apply for one you know where to send the tax inspectors.

**2) It is fair if it is done right.**  People of lower incomes spend a higher percentage of their income so on first inspection it looks like it hits the people you don't want to hit.  

In Europe they do the simple procedure of not charging tax on essential non-luxury items that can push a small budget over e.g.  children's clothes - you don't pay sales tax on them because they realise that you can't send your kids out to work, you have to provide for them and clothe them and they keep growing.  You just don't tax inexpensive fruit and vegetables or basic cleaning products either.  Tax local produce less.  Rich folk don't stop spending money just because something goes up by 30% if they still have it - especially if they're not being taxed on 40% of their income.
Ferrari and Porsche dealerships will still sell cars - people who can afford a $150,000 car may just find that now it costs closer to $200k.  

**3)  A sales tax puts people back in charge.**  It encourages responsible saving and purchasing.  As it stands they take much of a pay packet before you've even decided how to use it.  Income tax- whumph, you're money is gone.  Sales Tax means you can save to go to college, to buy a house, to set yourself up in business, to buy a car, to go on holiday much easier.  You'll still spend your money, you'll just be able to invest it properly rather than getting piecemeal amounts that make saving up for big things more difficult.  

**4)   Sales tax is an ethical way of encouraging domestic job markets and fair trade overseas.**  Sales tax can be proportioned to the economic, political and ecological expense of the product.  If it is a product that is good or better than the alternatives for the environment - make it cheaper and make part of the tax from less ethical ones go towards green projects, and so on and so forth...you can look at every product and work out what it costs and not just the dollar price.

&gt;If everything didn't hinge on that then holocaust denial would be like saying the earth is flat.

That is utter nonsense. The countries of Europe did not make Holocaust denial illegal to protect Israel. They passed those laws when there was no Israel. Your position, like that of the deniers, is both factually wrong and morally reprehensible. You are standing with the Holocaust deniers simply because you don't like Israel. 

&gt;Instead holocaust denial continues to grow and become more and more accepted as just some conspiracy, the more it's watered down with people who want to censor open discussion on it the more self assurance and power the deniers get.

Bullshit. This is like creationism, not flat Earth. There has been plenty of ""open discussion"" of the topic, the evidence is in and clear. There is no valid **historical** issue here. But since you have political sympathy with the deniers you will help them.

I suppose you could bring your PC but you generally wouldn't have much in the way of internet access; I'm often asked by crew members if they can use my cellphone (with a calling card) to call home.  They probably can use people familiar with computers, most ships have a number of computers on them.  There are many unskilled jobs, and if you see another position on the ship you like (engineer or something), your company or union can help you get trained in that sort of thing.

The crews are generally older dudes who have been at it awhile, not that many younger people (though European ships tend to have a younger crew, since they offer good educational benefits for a few years of sailing).  Women are very rare but I do see them on ships from time to time.

Busy work is scraping and painting, cleaning, shoveling snow and salting and that sort of thing, but most of your time will be spent tightening and moving around lashing gear.  Lashing gear are the bars and turnbuckles used to lock the containers into the deck of the ship, and dealing with that stuff will probably be the most physically demanding part of the job.

So these poor brainwashed Jewish kids aren't the least bit genocidal, they're not calling for the killing of all Arabs, just a few of them.

Yessum!

&gt;No, you don't. You are standing up for attacking one group for their speech and forgiving Holocaust deniers on free speech grounds. That was why you stepped into this discussion.

..

&gt;Denying something happened.. and calling for the death of all people of a certain ethnicity.


&gt;I can see how that works...

..

&gt;What in the world are you taking about? Are you now saying that Holocaust denial is an acceptable position because some people (I have no idea who, but it is your strawman) have turned it into a "" a one size fits all rebuttal for all arguments""?


Pretty much, it's used as justification for the creation of Israel, is often referred to as what happens when anti-semetism becomes popular, etc, etc. Sorry for the straw man argument but honestly the argument that holocaust denial is the same thing as calling for genocide is quite ridiculous.


&gt;That is utter nonsense. The countries of Europe did not make Holocaust denial illegal to protect Israel. They passed those laws when there was no Israel.

Oh that's right, I forgot, holocaust denial is a crime in Europe. I wonder if denying any other genocides is illegal in Europe? I can deny the darfur genocide that is presently ongoing, I can deny Armenian genocide but I cannot deny Hitlers genocide. How very emotionally created and politically kept.


&gt;Bullshit. This is like creationism, not flat Earth. **There has been plenty of ""open discussion"" of the topic**, the evidence is in and clear.

No there hasn't, especially in Europe, you know why? Because Holocaust denial is a crime in Europe.


&gt;There is no valid historical issue here. But since you have political sympathy with the deniers you will help them.

It is not about validity, it's about free speech and hypocrisy, it's about the political nature of history and how the holocaust is no longer a factual reality but rather an emotional one.

And for the record I don't have political sympathy for skinheads and I'm not a fan of trying to prove I'm right using raw emotion, in fact I condemn it. Holocaust deniers don't help my agenda at all (in fact they hurt it) but I'd rather see them freely deny the holocaust than be thrown in jail for it. Holocaust deniers cannot forever be cast aside as lunatics, in the end people will start warming up to their views in the ways I've detailed in my previous comments and it won't be a pretty day because of its implications.

Given if the Nazis had their way I'd probably never have been born I find that to be quite hilarious.

LordVoldemort,6,WTF,0,0,False,,,,"Sigh...

**Keep in mind that these are men making a decision for themselves; this does not lend support to neonatal or childhood circumcision without medical cause.**

**STDs are not a matter of child care**; therefore, even if this were true it should have no bearing on deciding to circumcise a child; most people start having sex nearly 2 decades after birth [at the age of 17 years](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_ATSRH.html).

Ever since the UN's studies on HIV in *third-world Africa*, HIV/AIDS has replaced the ridiculous UTI scare-tactic for promoting circumcision. However, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the UN's studies attempt to suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of HIV infection, the UN still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.

In fact, [one meta-study of those UN](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract) studies suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of HIV infection. In conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:

&gt; Male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male HIV infections. **Its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.**

Even the authors of the [original study say so](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29882368/):

&gt;  However, it must be emphasized that protection was only partial, and it is critical to promote the practice of safe sex

(BTW, some variation of that article has been appearing since 2007; someone's trying a little too hard in my opinion; also, I've heard that some of the researches are Jewish, so not exactly unbiased).

Also, [consider research](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Role-of-Circumcision-in-Reducing-HIV-Risk-Still-Unclear-27082-1/) that shows circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting HIV for gay men. Then consider [a study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in astonishingly unsafe sexual practices.

Clearly behavior is the determining factor.

**Furthermore, the U.S. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, Israel), and [yet the U.S. HIV incidence rate is something like 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/).**

More to the point, [these studies provide no biological theory](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29882368/)---they are strictly statistical analyses (fraught with a number of confounding variables):

&gt; Why circumcision **may** reduce the risk of infection is not entirely known. But researchers **think** cells in the foreskin of the penis may be susceptible to HPV and the herpes virus.

In fact, [a study of the U.S. military](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102282676.html) concludes:

&gt; After adjustment for demographic and behavioral risk factors lack of circumcision was not found to be a risk factor for HIV (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.7) or STI (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.52, 2.26). The odds of HIV infection were 2.6 higher for irregular condom users, 5 times as high for those reporting STI, 6.2 times higher for those reporting anal sex, 2.8-3.2 times higher for those with 2-7+ partners, nearly 3 times higher for Blacks, and 3.5 times as high for men who were single or divorced/separated. Conclusions: **Although there may be other medical or cultural reasons for male circumcision, it is not associated with HIV or STI prevention in this U. S. military population.**

In other words, behavior is what is important.

Consider an [*Israeli* report](http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar03feb-11.pdf) that devotes an entire page discussing the relationship between circumcision and cervical cancer (that is, HPV). They reference numerous studies that show no connection between circumcision and rates of cervical cancer. Their conclusion in this section is:

&gt; Although the dispute over the association of circumcision and cervical cancer in various populations is still ongoing [23,24], there seems to be no hard evidence that circumcision prevents its occurence in Jewish women, and it is no longer considered to play a protective role.

Their conclusion:

&gt; While ritual circumcision is still practiced widely, today only a minority of Jewish women observes the laws of Niddah [sexual laws]. Sexual habits have also changed considerably, becoming far less stringent. In spite of these trends of the last four to five decades, the population-based incidence of of cervical cancer in Israeli Jewish women has not increased and remains very low... it seems that there may be indeed something in ""race.""

In other words, Jewish women are protected by culture and maybe even genes---but certainly not circumcision.

Also, [according to this](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/circumcision.htm):

&gt;  Circumcised men are more at risk from penile warts than uncircumcised men, and the risk of developing penile cancer is now almost equal in the two groups. Therefore, routine circumcision cannot be recommended to prevent penile cancer.

Consider that no medical institution in the world endorses neonatal circumcision beyond the notion that it *may* have benefits. In fact, **none** of the following medical societies or associations advocate infant circumcision (they point out that there are no prophylactic or therapeutic reasons that justify the surgery on healthy boys):

* American Academy of Pediatrics
* American Medical Association
* Pediatric Urologists Association
* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
* National Institutes of Health
* American Cancer Society
* Canadian Pediatric Society
* Canadian Medical Association
* Australian Medical Societies (any)
* European Medical Societies (any)

Consider [what Finland's Central Union for Child Welfare had to say in 2003](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/finland2003/):

&gt; The Central Union for Child Welfare considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person.

&gt; Circumcision intervenes in the sexual integrity of a male child causing a permanent change in organisms and has consequences pertaining to both health and quality of life.

&gt; The circumcision of girls is rightly considered as inhuman mutilation of the genitals and is punished abuse. Also boys must be guaranteed a similar protection by law.

&gt; According to the opinion of the Central Union for Child Welfare in Finland nobody has the right, on behalf of the child, to consent to operation, violating the bodily integrity of the child, if it is not done to treat an illness. According to the Child Welfare Act the child has a right to special protection. The Child Custody and Right of Access Act bans the subduing and humiliation of a child.

I think even the staunchest Israel supporters realize the 'right of return' concept is ridiculous and one which is only bought by people who already agree with them.

&gt;And since you oppose the existence of Israel you are open to a ""re-examination"" of the Holocaust.

No I'm not opposed to the existence of Israel.

&gt;They are the ""same"" only in that both are examples of speech where the content is deplorable

Think of it this way: What is the result of free speech if its carried out to its fullest in real life: In one case it's that the holocaust will be removed from the history books, in the other it's that there would be a killing of people of a certain ethnicity.

I won't say you're so pro-Israel that you don't see how obvious it is, instead I'm just going to call you out on your hypocrisy, calling me out on a straw man argument then using one against me.

&gt;The ""Zionists"" fault, right?

Ever bodies fault who allowed it to be like this.

&gt;Not in the U.S., yet no actual credible history asserts it did not occur. Why should there be some ""open"" discussion on a position with no factual support? Oh, that's right, because you don't like Israel you are willing to line up, at the least, with Holocaust deniers.

Even in the US open discussion has never been really allowed. People have even tried to take asylum in the US because they'd be put in prison in Europe. I can talk about creationism all I want without being deported from the US, why can't I have another wacky theory?

Since the discussion is limited, especially in Europe, there is a lot of contradictions going on historically which historians themselves are probably afraid to correct because they fear imprisonment.

I can't remember names but a historian in German was put in prison for saying the Auchwitz gas chamber was re-built after World War 2, he was put in Prison because that is apparently holocaust denial. In fact one of the people who wanted to testify in his favor, [Dr. Franciszek Piper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciszek_Piper),  was not allowed by the judge.

Another issue when actual open discussion is banned, of course I have no problem with people calling for the death of Jews being thrown in prison as that is a different thing entirely.

&gt;Yet you came here to defend them. Because attacking Israel is always the first priority for you.

I came here to defend free speech, I've never defended holocaust deniers.

&gt;You are quite specifically against the free speech of ""Kill the Arabs"" and for the free speech of ""the Holocaust is a hoax set up to justify Israel"". That was why you stepped in here.

&gt;Denying something happened.. and calling for the death of all people of a certain ethnicity.

can you please address how they are the same? I'm curious about your reasoning to say that holocaust denial is as deplorable as the calling of mass murder.

The SUV fad never occurred in Europe because there was never a consumer demand for it.  Why?  Because gas there costs $7 to $10 / gallon.  Because many of the roads are not designed for vehicles as large as SUVs.  Because Europeans don't have a ""bigger is better"" mindset, and are willing to pay $25K+ for smaller cars.  Etc.

If not a triple incision is almost always successful and is still less invasive than circumcision.  However, like I said, some doctors are just circumcision happy.  

I countered with studies of several hundred to several thousand. That one woman is just the most relevant information I could come up with as she actually was exposed to western ideas.  There are hundred of women here who do not mind being circumcised in the slightest.  http://www.fgmnetwork.org/authors/Lightfoot-klein/sexualexperience.htm  Of course there are also many who resent it, but there are also many males who resent being circumcised here.

""I noticed that you delicately chose to decline to comment on that one.""

Yes I did on my post below.  

""Not only has FGM not removed her sexual desire, but she talks about how it has made orgasm almost impossible. Not slightly less sensitive but impossible.""

Now who is using a sample size of one.  I just posted an article from fgmnetwork where 90% of women admitted to having orgasms despite it being cultural taboo.  

As far as your ""accident""  I don't even want to know.  

The point of the foreskin restoration is they are mostly men who had no choice in their circumcision status and are left with a very difficult solution that only solves a small part of the problem.  If the decision was left to them there would hardly be anyone doing that.  Shouldn't we at least let the guys make the call?

Again you mention Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  She is VERY outspoken against male circumcision.  She even said that in many cases it is the same thing or WORSE!

There certainly is the argument. I don't think a libertarian nation would be precluded necessarily from jumping in to WWII. Certainly not after Pearl Harbor, in the case of the US specifically.

I hope I didn't imply ""save the world"". It does sound so corny. I think the comparisons to the run up to WWII is comparable here, and can be made without someone saying Godwin. Let's say the arguments are that simple. We could appease Bin Laden, to use the 1930's buzzword, and ""he"" would stand down, or at least begin to preach victory and no further need for bloodshed. The counter argument before WWII was that Hitler was both too dangerous militarily to the very lives of those he opposed, and it was morally wrong to allow his legal sanctions on Jews, gypsies, etc.

Terrorism in large instances can be equivocally the same I think, for all intents and purposes, guerrilla v. conventional arguments aside. The arguments against the injustice of rule in states like Iraq and Afghanistan is the counter argument now. That and that the various rouge nations can't be allowed to pose a threat to the allied NATO nations, either through terrorism or WMDs.

You seem sincere in your question, so here is some sincere advice from someone squarely in your target demographic:

Do something dramatic (and expensive to Best Buy's bottom line) to try and earn some trust from key consumers.  Best buy is in a vicious cycle of ripping off customers, which attracts customers who have no problem ripping off Best Buy.  You reap what you sow and Best Buy has been sowing some serious crap over the years.

Study the most effective electronics sales models around the world and one-up them.

[deleted],3,AskReddit,0,0,False,,,,"Alright, I've been drinking it for a couple of years now.  In recent years you had to sort of go ""around"" import regulations by getting it delivered via courier from Europe (I am in the US), generally in my case French absinthes by way of the UK.  The cost of shipping was almost the cost of the absinthe itself.

Un Empile Sapin - http://www.eabsinthe.com/p156/Un-Emile-Sapin-Absinthe-68abv-70cl/product_info.html

And Verte de Fougerolles - http://www.absinthe-dealer.com/absinthe/absinthe-from-france/verte-de-fougerolles-absinthe.html

The big deal was that the much hyped thujone turned out not to be as concentrated in old absinthe as was suspected, and the EU legalized manufacture provided those thujone levels were under a certain level - it has never been established that thujone has anything to do with psychoactive effects.  This is a kind of urban legend or misconception.    The US has opened for business as well, thanks to the efforts of Kubler, which I'll get to in a second.  (Brands that market themselves on the basis of high thujone content tend not to be quality brands.  They're cashing in on baseless hype.)

So, if you trip balls while drinking absinthe, someone spiked it with something.  If you find yourself having an odd kind of lucid energetic drunk where you feel like talking, writing, or playing chess, as opposed to a sloppy falling down kind of buzz, you're in ""the zone.""  It's quite pleasant, and no doubt it has the kind of hoity toity reputation it does owing to the quality of the buzz.  Make no mistake, however, this is an alcohol buzz, not a psychedelic one.

Do not set your absinthe on fire.  This makes absinthe fans cry (you're just burning the alcohol off and fouling the herbal oils).  The classic ice-water-dripped-over-sugar-cube-on-absinthe-spoon method is the best, 4:1 or 5:1 (I prefer 4 parts water to 1 part absinthe).  The water should be as cold as possible, with the ice somehow strained from the pouring vessel (I use a crappy plastic watter bottle for this - very gauche).  I have read that sugar cubes in the modern US are 1/2 the size of traditional or European ones - either ones they use now in Europe or 100 years ago, not sure which - so I use two standard run-of-the mill sugar cubes.  This works well.  Remember, absinthe is potent, alcohol wise, so don't be squeamish about the dilution.

There is no need to dress goth.  There is a misconception that you must be a goth or gay or both to drink absinthe.  This is not true.  I'm a slovenly computer geek who wears flannel and jeans and I have survived absinthe.

Note to people wanting to try absinthe: There is in fact a decent absinthe available now domestically in the United States, generally from $40-$50 per bottle.  This is Kubler, a Swiss absinthe:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler_Absinthe

I was able to buy this in the supermarket - a Fry's - just outside of Tucson, Arizona, so if they have it way down here, you can probably find it in a decent liquor store near you. 10 years ago, a Swiss farmhouse ""la bleue"" absinthe would run you almost $300 a bottle, although at the time these were bootleg absinthes made and exported/imported under the radar.  So it's nice to have a pretty good Swiss absinthe widely available now.

Kubler is not the best absinthe but it is a decent entry level absinthe (compare to the Glenlivet for those wanting to try single malt scotch) and recommended.  In fact, I recommend anyone wanting to try absinthe start here before paying $100 a bottle for the Jade/Ted Breaux absinthes.  The qualities you want in absinthe roughly approximate the scotch market: you're looking for artisinal quality, here.

http://www.bestabsinthe.com/

If you like it, then maybe you'll want to spend more.

Absinthe should be somewhat sweet prepared in the manner described above but should finish with a bitter herbal bite (nibble is a better word; it is not in any sense harsh), led by, but not completely dominated by, anise.

Absinthes sold with *any* gimmick whatsoever - be it a rock star pushing it, or hints that it is psychoactive, or that it can summon the forces of darkness, should be avoided.

General sentiment among enthusiasts seems to be that French and Swiss absinthes are among the best, with Czech absinthes as substandard, but I've never tried Czech absinthes so I can't say.  You may find ""Hill's"" absinthe, common in the UK.  This is said to be an atrocity, but, again, that's just what I read.

For myself, I find two glasses prepared in the traditional manner is just right.  Any more and I risk fouling my stomach.

Recommend having food on hand for consumption within an hour or so of having the absinthe.

EDIT: This video describes preparation well, although I will tell you that drop-by-drop louching will become excruciating after awhile.  I do what might be called a very slow drizzle.  It takes about 90 seconds to get the water into the absinthe, and the effect is largely the same:

Without the Roman empire there Christianity (several hundred years later) would not have been so widespread under Constantine, there wouldn't be Christians in the middle east due to the Eastern Roman empire/Byzantia and arguably, the chances of crusades would be reduced.

There are several pivotal moments, but the wars with Carthage turned Rome from a minor power to a world leader.

mantra,7,technology,0,0,False,,,,"It depends.  The body handling this is the ITU (International Telecommunications Union).  This article is pretty good in terms of an overview of legal structures and definitions.

http://www.trp.hku.hk/e_learning/spectrum/section1.html

The allocates can and often do differ at an ITU region level (there are 3 regions) and sometimes at a national level (though this is rare).  The above link has a ""Hong Kong"" spectrum allocation chart.  If you compare it an FCC US spectrum allocation, you'll see much is the same (especially in the far-propagatin low frequency sections) but there are also differences.  Some are ITU-region dependent but some are specifically HK-unique.

The world-wide allocations of transworld propagating frequencies are not even uniform.  The US has always had more amateur radio (ham) bands than the rest of the world so there are some frequencies shortwave radio that are commercially allocated for Europe but ""shared, accepting interference"" for ham radio.

The biggest issue in allocation is interference (or its avoidance). Part of this is technology: analog modulation schemes have relatively low thresholds for interference (SSB is the worst, then AM, then FM and last being CW [morse code]).  Digital modulation generally has error correction, and can use spread spectrum techniques which reduce sensitivity to interference.

Perfect immunity to interference is a physical impossibility and not all services using spectrum are valued the same for interference. Military uses are generally held superior to commercial users which are held superior to amateur uses.  Similarly there is a power and structure hiearachy as well.  And finally there are different causes, effects and risks for interference depending on a numebr of factors.

The primary technical factor to interference is propagation: some frequencies only travels short distances at a given power level while others only need a whisper and can go around the world several times.  

The latter are shortwaves (3 MHz - 30 MHz).  Most of the ITU justification for existence was from back in the day before satellites when most international telecoms were *only* sea cable or shortwave radio.  Satellites didn't really take over until well into the 1970s (I remember TV still mentioned ""by satellite"" into the 1980s as it was something really novel"".

Others like UHF and Microwaves, only go a short distance - this feature is used expressly for cellular telephone where the design itself relies on poor propagation defining cell boundaries.  802.11 standards are relatively unregulated because of similar propagation limits combined with modulation schemes (spread spectrum) that are more inherently interference resistant even with multiple occupancy on the same frequencies.

The second factor is power levels.  Put enough power into any EM signal and it will go as far you can afford power - it might fry everything in its path but at some frequencies a little power goes a long way.  The shortwave above, for instance.

100-200 MHz is low VHF which has propagation distances in between shortwave and microwave.  You don't get the ionospheric reflections that enable shortwave to go all around the world but you do get diffraction effects that enable propagation beyond the visible horizon.  FM radio is 88 MHz to 108 (in the western hemisphere).  In Europe you'll find the FM band spans a slightly different range of frequencies.  This is one of the region-different allocations.

BTW you learn all this stuff (technical and legal) to get various levels of ham radio license.  

http://www.arrl.org/

Before the internet, ham radio was the closest approximation to ""people power"" communication that existed.  Getting a ham license was more or less the same as getting at connection to the internet.  The internet is more egalitarian - in radio the crazies were mostly relegated to CB bands while ham radio had much of the decorum and erudition of the arpanet and pre-commercial internet.

And foreign aid has been forthcoming because each 'aid donor' is intent on securing its own strategic interests in the Indian Ocean region - and this is true, whether the aid donor is the US, the EU,  India or China.

[All our major allies spy on us](http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_cr/s920624-spy.htm):

&gt; Our competitors--even our closest allies--do not always play by the rules. Indicative of this is the alarming rate at which foreign governments are spying on U.S. businesses and economic interests. According to the Director of Central Intelligence, Bob Gates, at least 20 nations from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America are involved in intelligence activities that are detrimental to our economic interests.

&gt; Some of the specific cases are shocking. According to a recent New York Times article by Peter Schweizer, ""between 1987 and 1989, French intelligence planted moles in several U.S. companies, including IBM. In the fall of 1991, a French intelligence team attempted to steal 'stealth' technology from Lockheed."" Other accounts report that French intelligence units conduct 10 to 15 break-ins every day at large hotels in Paris to copy documents that belong to businessmen, journalists, and diplomats. According to other accounts, the French have been hiding listening devices on Air France flights in order to pick up useful economic information from business travelers.

&gt; The French are not alone among our friends who spy on us. Two months ago, rocket scientist Ronald Hoffman began serving a prison sentence for selling strategic defense initiative and rocketry technology for more than $700,000 to four Japanese companies. According to Schweizer, these four companies have vowed to capture 20 percent of the aerospace market by the year 2000.

&gt; And in 1991, IBM lost several important European bids after company officials discovered that German intelligence had been eavesdropping on its telecommunications and passing stolen information on to German companies.

&gt; These crimes by our friends not only betray our friendship; they cost America jobs. According to IBM Vice President Marshall Phelps, IBM has suffered losses in the billions as a result of espionage being carried out against the company. Foreign intelligence agents are draining our country of its ideas like sap from a tree. For a country that professes to be a fountainhead of scientific knowledge, nothing could be more damaging. 

[And we spy on them, too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON#Controversy):

&gt; Some critics claim the system is also being used for large-scale commercial theft, international economic espionage and invasion of privacy. British journalist Duncan Campbell and New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager asserted in the 1990s that the United States was exploiting ECHELON traffic for industrial espionage, rather than military and diplomatic purposes.[9] Examples alleged by the journalists include the gear-less wind turbine technology designed by the German firm Enercon[10][11] and the speech technology developed by the Belgian firm Lernout &amp; Hauspie.[12] An article in the Baltimore Sun reported in 1995 that European aerospace company Airbus lost a $6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia in 1994 after the NSA reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract.[13][14]

&gt; In 2001, the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System recommended to the European Parliament that citizens of member states routinely use cryptography in their communications to protect their privacy.[4]

They held a rally at my high school once, in a part of New Zealand with a fairly typical Maori and Polynesian population, but not a single brown face did I see in the audience.""

*""...high school...""*? - Do you mean secondary school? Isn't that called ""college"" in New Zealand?

*""Cold""* is a perception of the observer, rather than a character quality of the person being described.

*""Business owners""*  Yes, of course - the right wing in all english speaking nations caters to business owners. Their proposition is that by creating a better environment for trade and business - they create a higher standard of living for everybody in that country; and there is a lot of truth in that. It is true that ""the best things in life are free"" - but a lot of important things in life are the result of trading our goods and services. Do you disagree?

*""...not a single brown face...""* That's troubling. A political party which forms a government needs to be catering to the interests and concerns and approaches to life of the entire scope of the citizenry of that country. However, from what I've heard, the Maori party has formed a reasonably secure alliance with National (snubbing Labour, and the chance to gain power through being part of an opposition coalition?). From reading John Key's face as he has spoken about that agreement with the Maori party - I see nothing but constructive attitudes in him, there.

&gt; ""National could only give a damn about business-owners. National, in times of crisis, never fails to immediately go running to the business associations asking what they, as a government, can do to protect New Zealand's ""best interests"". ""

And one of the best propositions I've seen in recent weeks, has been this nine-day working fortnight proposition. In contrast, both republican and democratic administrations in the usa have been hocking the future of our country across the Pacific, by tossing billions at their cronies in the banking and auto industries. As a program, the nine-day fortnight proposal is very small - almost nonexistent. But as an idea, it sets an excellent precedent. We, in ethnically european nations would be wise to adopt a lighter work ethic. We become time-starved, as a people; and time, of course, is the thing which life is made of. I remember one day I saw [a humourous video featuring Bill Gates](http://www.break.com/index/bill-gates-last-day-of-work.html) which showed his staff what he was going to do with all his time after he retired. And what I saw in that presentation, was a person who may be one of the richest people in the world, but who, over most of his life, would have had no time at all to pursue all of his many aspirations. I thought it quite sad, actually.


&gt; If you talk to a typical Nat-voter, you will typically find that either they or their dad (they always get it from their fathers) ran a business at some point, and have a strange complex whereby they believe that they were the only ones doing any work for the country.

I agree that some of the most important contributions to society are those things which do not net someone monetary return. That's been the story of the last few years of my life, actually. However, it's also true, that to make a fair and egalitarian society, we have to provide a way forward for people who do those kinds of things to also make a reasonable living for themselves. Right wing parties tend to want to help others to help themselves, whereas left wing parties tend to offer handouts. Both approaches are important. But I'll tell you that poor people in the Usa, at least, tend to appreciate assistance in moving forward in their lives, more than the situation where they are stuck in a continual state of having to rely on the dole. Getting on your feet is a long term solution, and with it comes with a lot more personal dignity.


This all being said, I have to qualify what I've said with the admission that I have never actually been to New Zealand. However, in recent months, I've been diligently studying your nation through your mass media offerings on the internet.  What I've learned about your country makes me want to immigrate to it.

Not in the least. Capitalism is still a long time coming in most such places. Third world areas that have been introduced to capitalism have flourished.

China suffered under crushing poverty for most of the 20th century, but when Deng Xiaoping opened the country up to capitalism they flourished.

Get out of the city center (the Centruum) and explore. We discovered some the best places by talking to locals and vagrants. One guy came up asking if we could spare any change so he could buy some food for his scruffy-looking dog. I gave him five pounds and pointed us in the direction of a small, but very chill working-class coffee shop in the south-western part of the city. The best way to tell if a shop is cool: there are people chilling there, reading, talking, typing away on their laptops. If there's no place to sit inside, or the only people there are tourists standing at the counter, you're in the wrong spot.

Pro Tip One: Rent a bike. The city is completely flat, and you can cover ground much more quickly with wheels.

Pro Tip Two: If you want to take home some ""souvenirs"", buy hash. Mash it as flat as you can, wrap it up as airtight as you can, and tape it to the bottom of your foot. Put on some rank, dirty socks and then your equally dirty shoes. Leave the country by boat, since their screening process is much more lax and it's cheaper, anyway. Empty your pockets and person of anything that may even remotely contain metal, as most European countries are big fans of the full-body pat-down if you set off the metal detectors. If security is having a bad day and searching people ahead of you, go to the bathroom and ditch it. Then travel to at least one other European destination before heading back home.

erulabs,1,Economics,0,0,False,,,,"In point of fact, a 'traditional' common law system actually exists in the Constitutional United States of America. It exists currently (See [Amendment 7 of the U.S. Constitution](http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/whuscons/whuscons.htm#7th-amend)). The law of the land states that the 'seat of the government' (10 square miles) is the territory of the 'Federal Government of the United States' - if you live there, you live in Maritime law, under direct Admiralty to the Federal Government. However, if you do not live there, you are not under Maritime law, but rather under Common law, or otherwise called 'God's Law'.

Living under 'Common Law' means _only_ what the U.S. Constitution states is _law_. If you sign a contract with the federal government (which you do if you get a drivers license, S.S. card, etc) then you can surrender those rights, but otherwise, you are protected.

What all this means is that, among many other things, I am not obligated by the law of the land to, for instance, pay taxes to the Fed. I have signed _no_ contract in which I pledge to pay any tax - and it is _certainly_ not specified in the Constitution.

Anyways, the idea behind the movement is exactly the same as it was 300 years ago. There exists a 'naturally imbued' set of 'inalienable rights', such as private property, the right to bear arms, the right to travel freely, the freedom to speak and publish, the right to sign contracts with fellow men, and the right to have such contracts (public and private) ordained and enforced under the law.

We Common Law Americans (as we like to fashion ourselves) believe that we do not need a complex, corporate, and commercial merchant law in our everyday lives. Rather, we believe in the power of the Constitution, and that we, as the American People, have the right and responsibility to protect ourselves from foreign interests (the Federal Government, being literally a foreign state, is a 'foreign interest').

Another core tenant of Common Law is self-representation. Trials would be set to an even keel if people had to defend themselves (of course, lawyers could still give council, but just not a defence).

Anyways, I suggest you read:

Then budget.  Figure out how much money you can save per month, then take how much it costs to go to wherever and figure out approximately how long it will take to save for the trip.  

Same thing with days off.  Figure out time it takes to get there, how many days it will take to see what you want and figure out how to make your days off work.  Maybe that means one year you don't spend a week visiting your family.  Maybe they can come visit you instead.  Etc.

You don't have to go to Moscow, or Europe even. Find some place that sounds interesting to you and figure out how to make it happen.

Conventional wisdom on reddit seems to be out of touch with reality.  This is a pretty good list average priced midsize (read family) sedans with 4 cylinder gasoline engines and automatic transmissions.  And they ALL make around 25mpg give or take.  And many of these cars are probably a little smaller than most Americans WANT - and Americans would typically WANT the 6 cyl engine if they can afford it.  And this is still one of the largest segments of the market.  These are the cars that Americans are buying and driving (if they were buying cars :)) Incidentally the Toyota Camry was the best selling car in this segment last year (21/31/25) to the tune of about 400,000 units.  Sales of ALL hybrids - totalling around 310,000 units (http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2009/01/hybrids-finish-2008-in-the-dumps-with-prices-weakened-and-sales-down.html) last year still haven't come close (though definitely increasing).  These are the cars that automakers make and that people are buying.

3. In the world of Star Trek, aptitude and ability are the determinants of individual progress. Assuming Kirk was technically a graduate of officer training, and given his aforementioned exceptional test scores and demonstrated abilities, Pike was well within his rights to put the most effective people in the most effective positions. Uhura was the most qualified linguist on the ship, and she immediately replaced the officer that had been previously assigned. Kirk may very well have been the most qualified command candidate on the ship, especially given his extensive knowledge about the current enemy.

In a world where ability is the prime motivator, there is no reason to strip them of their ranks, since they are clearly an exceptionally qualified team to run the bridge.

I agree with what you are saying.  I don't know any Israelis, so I don't really know if they are racist or not.  But I do know that Israel was founded as a homeland for the Jewish people (race) who practice the Jewish faith (religion).  

Perhaps it's possible to have a government who's founding principals are to embrace a specific people with a specific religion that also treats everyone else as if they are part of the club, but it sounds a bit like an oxymoron to me.  I mean, what would that look like?  ""We welcome everyone, but especially these ones?""

I hope you are correct.  Israel, with all of it's wealth and influence throughout the world, has risen to be a major force on earth.  It's power appears to stretch through the dual-passports that it's citizens have;  American politicians such as Lieberman are also Israeli, so Israel has citizens that are politicians in powerful nations.  The same holds true for the countries in Europe, for Russia and everywhere else that I know in the world.

If they (the powerful of Israel) are racist sycophants, like some like to argue, we are all in one big heap of a mess.

Personally, I would like to see Israel drop all this Jewish homeland crap and adopt a Constitution like we have in the U.S.    What other nation in the world is allowed to invoke such ethnic and religious purity principals?   Isn't this one of the reasons that the west looks suspiciously at the Muslim nations, where religion oppresses it's citizens?

Nonsense.  The term ""Islamism"" is perfectly concrete and carries none of the neocon baggage that the made up, and self contradictory term ""Islamofascism"" does.

Further, Islamism, quite unlike Fascism, is not a nationalist movement.  That's kind of a big difference.  Its more of a pan-Islamic (or, rather, pan-Arabic) thing that doesn't care one bit about any extant nation.  Read the translations of Bin Ladin's speeches, for example, and you'll find not even a hint of nationalism.

Which is why equating Islamism with Fascism is a very bad idea.  It isn't Fascism, and trying to force it into the mold of Fascism will only screw up your perceptions and possibly blind you to effective modes of combating it.

There's also the minor detail of your bizarre pairing of Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Shia and Sunni don't get along well, and the pan-Arabism of Islamism clashes rather violently with the fact that most Iranians aren't Arabs.

There's an argument to be made that it would be beneficial to Western interests to encourage a new Caliphate to form simply because it would immediately be plunged into bloody civil war between the Shia and the Sunni, with Iran emerging as the inevitable enemy of the Caliphate.  I don't take that position, but a persuasive argument can be made for it.

Leave the made up, inaccurate, and frankly poorly thought out, term to the Limbaughs and Coulters of the world.  If you want to seriously talk about the problems of the middle east its best not to buy into their false terminology.

&gt;What would that do? If Islamists gain political power in Pakistan, they control nukes.

My ""make it a condition of the US pulling out"" meant ""the US takes control of the nukes before pulling out, that is, before the Islamist forces take over if they're going to"".

&gt;Realistically, if anyone is going to do anything about it, it would be America. That is tragedy here. Nobody else would do anything to prevent fanatics gaining nuclear weapons.

Nonsense on two fronts.  In the first place, while I'm aware of the myth of an impotent and demasculanized Europe being the lapdog of Islamist forces is popular on the American right, it doesn't accurately describe reality.

The threat of Soviet nukes in Islamist hands, for example, has prompted several European nations to help fund Russian (and other former Soviet governments) in securing those nukes.  Prior to Bush's withdrawl from several key deals, the US was a major player in that task, but thanks to the tireless efforts of GWB that's no longer the case.

A central part of the Scandinavian legal tradition is that the courts on some levels are presided over by one or more ""professional"" judges with legal training and one or more ""lay judges"".

It's not a jury in the US or UK sense (Norway at least have juries *too* at some levels in the legal system - I don't know about Sweden), as they deliberate *together* with the judge, and they decide both matters of law *and* matters of guilt (where in jury trials in the form used in most countries with legal systems based on common law, the judge decides matters of law and the jury matters of guilt), though the professional judge(s) tend to have rights to overrule the lay judges in extreme cases of failure to follow the law in deciding the case.

This distinction is important, because the professional judges to a large extent have ""the upper hand"", and so it can *not* be assumed that a case with lay judges / co-judges is equivalent to a jury trial - it is *not*. In a US style jury trial the judge does not get to hear and influence the deliberations, while in a Scandinavian style trial with lay judges the professional judge has the advantage of formal legal training, and a biased professional judge could to a large extent push the lay judges around by referring to the law.

First of all you will never ever get the yield you could potentially get from an HID, but there are quite a few benefits.


Benefits for detection evasion:
- Virtually no heat footprint
- You can grow in the worlds smallest spaces (Fixtures take up 2 inches, no heat)
- Less power consumption, you can grow 20 plant SOG under three 45 watt fixtures


Benefits for your wallet:
- Less power consumption.
- Less cooling investment.
- You don't ever have to replace them.


Downsides:
- Yield.  The maximum you're going to get is about 3/4 of what you could get with an HID.
- Documentation.  There really is not that much you can find on LED growing.


I agree with mikec23 about the internodal spacing, however you can get CRAZY small spacing just by moving the LED fixture lower, you don't necessarily have to buy an HID.  The guy I know uses 45 watt LED fixtures (http://www.shop.sunshine-systems.com/product.sc?productId=10) and can get nodes less than 1mm apart depending on how close you bring the LEDs.  LEDs hardly generate heat, so do not be afraid to bring your fixture down... Although I must say you will probably want nodes bigger than 1mm, having tiny spacing is great after your clones have rooted, because you can force the plants to be bushier later on in life.  However to really get enough energy from LEDs your going to have to keep them at most 30cm away from the canopy.

After looking through your setups I think you should probably try SOG of SCROG.  The problem with LED's is that they work best when the light emission beam angle is very small. If your going to build your own like you have, make sure you keep the angle under 45 degrees per bulb. I recommend between 15 and 30 degrees, and just getting more bulbs of lower intensity, because collectively they will be stronger.  The rule of thumb here is the smaller the degrees and the closer the bulbs are together, the higher the intensity over the area.  Higher intensity will lead to smaller nodes. In your setup, you grew a few plants at a medium height, therefore only the tops are getting good lighting.  With a SOG or SCROG setup, you can put your lights close and get more yield because essentially all of your top leaves (which are the only ones that matter in SOG) will be getting tons of light.  Close lights will make plenty of nodes, which in turn will give you plenty of bud-sites, which is a good thing even if your only expecting small amounts from each of them.

Because LED's are easier to use on SOG or SCROG, its naturally more designed for indica growth.  However a properly managed sativa SCROG would work if you kept the nodes short and used a few less plants.  It looks like your broad leaved plants did much better on your setup, which sort of validates my point.  A lot of people recommend putting LED's on the side if you're going to grow tall sativas, otherwise the light simply won't penetrate low enough because of the tiny light emission beam angle.  

Blue &amp; Red spectrum targeting DOES work very well.  Just make sure your LED's are the right wavelengths. Your plants need both types of chlorophyl, thats why you usually see double the red LEDs (also blue LEDs technically are more intense) http://i44.tinypic.com/107kjo6.jpg

Go Hydro or Aero... Especially since yield is a concern, soil just isn't going to cut it for LEDs.  As much as it sucks to maintain one, you will be much more likely to reach that 3/4 of an HID yield with hydroponics or aeroponics.  The guy I know uses aeroponics which you can build with a few pieces of PVC, a tupperware bin and a water-pump.",True,t3_8jgoe,3,c09hqow,1425968024,1242067624,t1_c09hqow,0,True,t3_8jgoe,t5_2qhhn

I wonder who these ""consultants"" really are? By threatening shipping they threaten the oil supply routes to the world. Germany, Japan, and many other countries have to respond militarily in order to protect the oil shipping route through the Suez. 

...and this is the kicker...these ""pirates"" are nothing more than part of plan to bottle up the resources in the middle east and central asia, diverting their flow to Israel away from Russia and China. A great defensive circle around the grand prize.

Other parts of the puzzle (circle): because we now have a ""missle shield"" threatenng Russia and Iran, strategically stationed in eastern Europe...NGO color-coded ""revolutions"" in Poland and the Ukraine, which can block NG flows to western Europe; the attack on south Ossetia, the so-called ""war on terror"" inflaming all of muslim, oil-rich middle east and central asia; Israel about to bomb Iran any second, closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz (Iranian oil); with Pakistan now being torn apart; with India, hoping to get water and oil from Kashmir and central asia, being subjected to a false-flag attack in Mumbai, and now facing nuclear war with the patsy Pakistan and its ally China...all of this basically threatens to cut the oil and NG pipelines off to the world, China and Russia, not to mention creating the potential for destroying the world (except for Israel).

Indeed, this is a miraculous chain of ""circumstances"". It is an amazing coincidence, because if things get real bad, if the oil and NG does get bottled up by these miraculous circumstances, we SURE are lucky Israel is just sitting there, waiting, to get all of that blocked oil and NG gas flowing to its terminal in Haifa, as it is the only viable route remaining:

Do you believe this because it's God's truth, or because it helps you sleep at night?

Sure, an ""age of accountability"" sounds nice, but the fact is still that they haven't explicitly accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. If there are gray areas with children, there can be gray areas with adults as well.

The point I wanted to make that saying that putting the onus on a software company to guarantee that their system won't ""harm"" doesn't seem like a workable system to me. It isn't logically possible to give a guarantee for general purpose software on a general purpose machine.

fxj's point does stand, however. It is like in the medical industry where even though you cannot prove things safe, you are still screwed even if you had no way of knowing that a bad outcome would happen.

I personally think that it will have a chilling effect on software distribution and development in the EU. It will also increase software costs in the EU. And it also may kill free software development in the EU. 

The GPL says ""THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW."" So depending on how the final law is worded, it may prevent GPLed code from being copied or used in the EU zone!

I really don't understand a lot of people's comments here. Of course I know that you can prove that certain pieces of software will terminate given certain inputs. But them saying silly things like ""you can simply check all of the states"" misses the point. The fact is that modern software systems are so complex that no feasible system exists or can exist to check it. If it were possible, someone would have already done it. Even OpenBSD, which I feel is the OS closest to this goal, has failed to find all bugs in a few cases (and more likely exist in the code).

And I'm definitely for better security, more stable systems, and fewer bugs. But simply making a legal demand for something that cannot happen is foolish at best and economically disastrous at worst.

Christianity, possibly. If the one and only Son of God became human, died, and was resurrected in order to save humans from sin, and if other sentient beings other than humans exist, then one of the following must be true:

* Alien sins are dealt with in some other way.
* Jesus is making the rounds, showing up on each planet as one of the locals, then being executed for their sins. Not a very appealing option, but conceivable.
* There are other ""one and only"" Sons of God who are doing for those aliens what Jesus did for us.
* Humans are representative of other sentient races, such that Jesus dying as a human also atoned for the sins of aliens. They just don't know about it yet.

The committee's leader, Amin al-Husseini, relocated abroad and his organization continued to serve in exile as the Arab Palestinians' internationally recognized leadership. (As an aside, notice that this is very similar to what occurred years later when Yasser Arafat's PLO became the Arab Palestinians' leadership-in-exile.)

&gt; On September 26, 1937, the British district commissioner of Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, was assassinated in Nazareth. This caused Britain to take action the following day including the outlawing of the Arab Higher Committee and the arrest of several of its members. Amin al-Husayni managed to escape arrest and went into exile.

&gt; By mid-1946, when the committee moved to Cairo due to Amin al-Husayni's exile from the British Mandate for Palestine and then from Europe (he had spent the war trying to get aid for the Palestinian cause from Hitler), membership had dwindled to just Jamal al-Husayni (acting chairperson), Husayn al-Khalidi (secretary), Ahmad Hilmi Pasha and Emile al-Ghury.[1] But at the beginning of 1947 the AHC was expanded to include the four remaining core members plus Hasan Abu Sa'ud, Izhak Darwish al-Husayni, Izzat Darwaza, Rafiq al-Tamimi and Mu'in al-Madi. This restructuring of the AHC to include additional supporters of Amin al-Husayni was seen as a bid to increase his political power (Khalaf, 1991, p. 129-130).

Also, you should check out [the official UN record of the meeting of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Palestine on October 18, 1947](http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/85255db800470aa485255d8b004e349a/ff894bc0a67066ad85256935006dc65f/$FILE/gapal21.pdf). It clearly demonstrates that in 1947, the UN recognized the Arab Higher Committee as the official representative of the Palestinian Arabs, essentially the Arab counterpart to the Jewish Agency. The Higher Committee's vice president Jamal Husseini addressed the committee on the Arabs's behalf; the Jewish Agency's former president Chaim Weizmann spoke on the Jews' behalf.

""It's a planet, replied God, ""and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance"".

""Balance?"" inquired Michael, still confused.

God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth.

""For example, Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while Southern Europe is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot.""

""Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people"" God continued, pointing to different countries. ""And over there, I call this place America.

North America will be rich and powerful and cold, while South America will be poor, and hot and friendly. And the little spot in the middle is Central America which is a Hot spot. Can you see the balance?""

""Yes"" said the Archangel, impressed by Gods work, then he pointed to a smallish land mass and asked, ""What's that one?""

""Ah"" said God. ""That's New Zealand, the most glorious place on Earth. There are beautiful mountains, forests, rivers, streams and an exquisite coast line. 

The people are good looking, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found traveling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.

When Las Vegas was incorporated as a city on March 16, 1911 the city was only 18 square miles and had about 800 residents.
Today Las Vegas is 84 square miles in area and is home to over 500,000 people, while Clark County's population is approaching two million.
Many Casino's have restaurants that offer specials that aren't listed anywhere on the menu. You have to know about them and ask about them by name to receive them.
A good example of this is the ""steak dinner"" at Ellis Island. You get a complete meal for only $4.95 but only if you remember to ask for it by name.
A lot of people are wary about how casino comp cards work. Casino's offer them to determine who they're going to give their best comps to. The more you lose the more you get. They do this to try to keep the big spenders loyal to the casino they're at and generally not for any other purposes(e.g. selling mailing lists). If you play a slot machine or other electronic gaming device you insert the card in the designated slot and it tabulates points based on how much you lose at the machine. To earn points at table games you give your card to the dealer when you sit down. A floor supervisor or pit clerk will come by, get the card and then swipe it at a computer terminal. The player is listed in the computer until they leave the table. Occasionally the amount the player is betting at a given time will be updated to allow the computer to more accurately award points.
The city is home to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. It's classified in the Doctoral/Research University-Intensive category by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. UNLV is home to 27,000 students and is rapidly growing. It currently offers about 200 degree programs.

Voltage into your service panel is actually 240 volts between line 1 and line 2 with a transformer center tap neutral that is halfway between each leg of 240V.  So you get 120V neutral to line 1, and another 120V neutral to line 1.  If your stove uses 240V, it's wired L1 to L2.

The neutral is bonded to the service ground for safety reasons in the US (although in Europe it is not, ostentatiously for the same safety reasons).  Remember that (except for plastic double insulated tools that lack a ground pin on the plug) the metal case of the tool/stove/toaster/whatever is grounded through the green wire.  

The thinking in the US is that if the hot wire  shorts to the grounded metal case of the toaster or drill or whatever, a short will develop to the neutral leg by following the green ground wire to ground, then to the neutral where they are joined at the service ground in the panel.  This blows the circuit breaker and opens the faulty circuit, calling attention to the failure.

Not only was there the [First Anglo-Afghan war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Afghan_War).  There was also the [Second](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War) and [Third](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Afghan_War).

It was the British drawn border problem, or Durand Line, that rekindled post WW2 when Pakistan declared its independence in 1947 from what was then British India.  

The Durand Line cut straight through the Pashtun people.  Second largest ethnicity in Pakistan's military: the Pashtun.  The Taliban?  Predominantly Pashtun.

I bought a 7,600-lb Dodge Cummins-powered P/U (2WD) with 120k on it. Next to no maintenance and zero repairs. 19 mpg city (documented) with 6-speed manual (no, you don't want to be behind me in traffic: slow to get moving [granny gear first] and, as all miles are traveled at 17-1900 rpm I'm at 33 mph in a 40 mph zone. Takes a while to stop one of these, so I'm not in Fifth (Direct) until the local speed limit is 50 [maybe 45 if sight lines are unambiguous, traffic light and access low]; and I don't stop for traffic lights, I gear down. No, not hypermiling); and the ability to carry 2500-lbs in the bed and/or a 12,000-lb trailer.

My cost of ownership is at 57 cpm (cents per mile) lower than my buying a new Prius and keeping it five-years/60k. It has business uses for me, so the tax deduction is helpful and lowers the cpm further. Highway mileage is 22+ at 66 mph.

I could change to a vehicle made here and imported to Europe: the Chrysler 300/Dodge Charger with M-B Bluetec engine (476 Ft/Lbs TQ) and using a trailer or two as a pickup substitute.

Panama24,7,worldnews,0,0,False,,,,"Regarding their failure to comply to safeguard obligations the IAEA report is from 2003.  A couple of things happened since then...

President Khatami had met with the EU-3 about normalisation of relations.  They asked him to suspend nuclear enrichment whilst they were in talks.  This, all evidence shows (including US intelligence), actually happened.  Iran stopped its nuclear program.  Khatami was offering to sign in the additional protocols and to stop Iran's nuclear fuel program.  In return, international recognition of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Whilst France, Germany, the UK and Iran were all able to reach agreement they needed the US to come on side.  They never did.

The IAEA report you provided is dated November 2003, [the Paris Agreement](http://www.ambafrance-ir.org/article.php3?id_article=549) which meant that Iran suspended its nuclear fuel program and it came into effect, after over a year in talks with the EU-3, in November 2004.

After the moderate Khatami served his maximum of two consecutive terms as Iranian President the conservative Ahmadinejad came to power.  In the first month into his presidency he announced that Iran's right to enrich was not being recognised, that Khatami's talks with the US had come to nothing, and that Iran would restart its nuclear development program (Khatami having frozen it for talks).

The IAEA moved into action.

Iran said that it would comply and the IAEA listed several grievances they had with establishing the nature of Iran's program.  They dubbed this the ['work plan'](http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/iran_negotiator.html), an on going investigation which would set goals to establishing the nature of Iran's program.  

The IAEA said in 2008 that Iran has been conforming with this work plan and that ['good progress'](http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2008/iranreport0208.html) was being made.

When Iran restarted its program it began to conform to the NPT.  It continues to do so.

&gt;Personally, I'd love it if Israel had signed the NPT and was facing the same kind of flack that Iran has seen, but they're apples and oranges, because one didn't opt-in.

Not opting into the NPT does not mean that the international community can do, nor should do, nothing.  Not signing into the NPT and evidence of an ongoing nuclear program, let alone a nuclear weapons program, is actually a sign that the international community SHOULD do something because that state is causing nuclear proliferation; weakening and undermining the NPT. There's a very good reason why the IAEA was formed and why the NPT was written.  Why would anyone stay in or sign up in future?

Israel not signing the NPT is the nuclear threat.  We're now expected to ignore the nuclear threat because they won't sign???  

They are apples and oranges.  Being in compliance with the NPT which recognises the right to enrich is reason to not act.  Not signing and developing both nuclear energy and weapons is reason to!",True,t1_c09iemy,7,c09ifg7,1425968487,1242135198,t1_c09ifg7,0,True,t3_8jqya,t5_2qh13

I was involved in the investigation into the NE power failure a few years ago, very lightly involved, but it was very telling how strongly connected everything is and how cascading failures can happen.

The real issue we will face is not 'can we power ourselves' but 'can we choose to live how we want where we want.' For example, where I live there is an infinite supply of water, a very good supply of hydro energy, superb wind, okay solar, reasonable growing conditions. So not bad overall, could be made sustainable if we take the issues seriously. 

But take the situation in the midwest - they could be sustainable if they would accept much lower crop yields, but then their economy would suffer. They use way too much water which they don't have, they have drained the aquifer, and so on. So... 

Similarly we can't sustain large populations in Las Vegas reasonably. Las Vegas is subsidized by gambling, which is subsidized by cheap travel. Get rid of the cheap travel and Vegas dries up and blows away.

So yes, intelligent grid is the way to go, but would require some rethinking of where people live. I for one am against state control of where people live. Stopping subsidizing people to live in some areas, paying the true cost of resources, would help a lot.

For example, if you triple the cost of gas in the US (not unreasonable, look at the EU) then where will people choose to live? What will happen to air travel (would likely go back to 1950's levels). And so on. All of this isn't imposing choices, it is stopping state subsidies (implicit or explicit).

10. Salman Rushdie
Salman Rushdie is probably best known for his book The Satanic Verses, which led to a 20-year Fatwa issued by the Iranian Ayatollah in 1989. Originally from a Shi’ite Muslim background, nevertheless Rushdie has gone on record to denounce religious intolerance, and to express his own atheist beliefs. In an interview he reportedly said: “I don't think there is a need for an entity like God in my life."" He also famously asserted that as a teenager, he demonstrated his rejection of religion by eating a ham sandwich, and waited in vain for the thunderbolt from heaven.

9. Germaine Greer
Self-described as a “Catholic atheist” Germaine Greer is most famous for her feminist book, The Female Eunuch. However, while she is widely regarded for her formidable intellect and her cogent arguments, she is less well known for her opinions on faith and religion. On the program Millennial Pope, it is claimed that she said religious music was a human cry toward a presence that was “just not there,” as well as expressing reservations about accepting a God who allowed such terrible suffering to take place in the world. The argument about a God who allows suffering to be incongruent with religious doctrine is well known, but not from the mouth of Germaine Greer.

8. Ricky Gervais
As one of the most celebrated comic talents of his generation, Ricky Gervais is well known for his myriad creative projects, such as The Office, Extras and an episode of The Simpsons which he wrote and starred in. However, despite the many interviews he has done, his religious beliefs are less well known. “I remember the day I became an atheist,” Gervais said in an interview with the Sunday Times. Gervais has never been afraid of expressing his opinions, and if asked, seems inclined to offer an honest answer. His views on religion are perhaps not surprising for a man who looks at the world with such a critical eye.

7. John Malkovich
With two Oscar nominations to his credit, and having appeared in numerous blockbuster films, as well as some of the most bizarre films ever made (Being John Malkovich, anyone?) John Malkovich is not a man who appears comfortable simply going along with the crowd. This carries over into his views on religion. He once said, “I grew tired of religion some time not long after birth… I don’t believe in something I can’t have absolutely no evidence of for millenniums.” A typically forthright opinion, but not one Malkovich is particularly well known for.

6. Napoleon Bonaparte
You would be hard-pressed to meet many people who have never heard of Napoleon Bonaparte. One of the greatest military leaders the world has ever seen, and responsible in large part for some of the most dramatic political upheavals in European history, his religious views are far less well known. Perhaps it won’t come as a surprise that as a son of the French Revolution, which placed significant emphasis on separating religion from the state, Napoleon was not a man who was enamored by the idea of God. He is credited as having said, “All religions have been made by men,” suggesting that he was pragmatic, and an atheist.

5. Lance Armstrong
Lance Armstrong is unquestionably one of the greatest athletes the world has ever seen. Winner of an unprecedented seven Tour de France races, Armstrong is synonymous with sporting achievement and determination. He is almost equally famous for overcoming testicular cancer, and is feted for his charitable work as well as his sporting endeavors. His religious beliefs have, quite naturally, been far less prominent than these other aspects of his life, but he is not afraid of telling people what he thinks. He expressed it succinctly thus: “If there was a God, I’d still have both nuts.”

4. Barack Obama Sr.
Most famous for being a certain someone’s father, Barack Obama Sr. has only really attracted interest in light of his son’s historic achievement of becoming the first non-white President of the United States. Originally from Kenya, Obama Sr. was born into a Muslim family. By the time he moved to the USA to study economics, it appeared that he had turned away from religion, and had become an avowed atheist. The new President claimed that by the time his parents met, his father saw religion as mere superstition.

3. Warren Buffet
Having been at the very top of the rich lists over the last few years, Warren Buffett is a man with an extremely high profile. As a business man he is almost legendary, as a philanthropist he has done great work and perhaps he does not feel any need to advertise his religious views. It does seem likely that he is an atheist, if these words from Roger Lowenstein are anything to go by: “He did not subscribe to his family’s religion. Even at a young age [Buffet] was too mathematical, too logical, to make the leap of faith. He adopted his father’s ethical underpinnings, but not his belief in an unseen divinity.”

2. Benjamin Franklin
One of the most famous men in American history, and regarded as the most intelligent of those who signed the Declaration of Independence, Franklin is a surprise addition to this list. Living in an age where religion played a far more prominent role in every day life, Franklin strongly rejected notions of religion -- in particular Christianity -- as unintelligible. Theodore Parker, who studied Franklin’s religious views, stated that, “Franklin had no religion at all. It would be an insult to say that he believed in the popular theology of his time, or of ours. I find not a line from his pen indicating any such belief.”

1. Euhemerus
A worthy winner of this top 10 list of unknown atheists, simply because of all these candidates, he is the least well known, and yet in some ways is the most important atheist who has ever lived. Euhemerus was a Greek scholar in the 4th century B.C. who lends his name to an interpretation of mythology and religion. He argued that Gods were actually great tribal chiefs and warriors, who over time had been imbued with supernatural powers. This was particularly applicable to polytheistic religions, such as that of ancient Greece, but nonetheless is evidence of a man expressing doubts about religion millennia before it became fashionable.

James Madison:

""Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a contrary operation.  During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial.  What has been its fruits?  More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution."" - ""A Memorial and Remonstrance"", 1785 

""The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries."" -1803 letter objecting use of gov. land for churches

""As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation.  But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?""  -letter to F.A. Van der Kamp, Dec. 27, 1816 

""I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved-- the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!""  -letter to Thomas Jefferson

""History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose.""  - to Baron von Humboldt, 1813 

""Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the Common Law.""  -letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper, 1814 

""Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship,  that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' *thus building a wall of separation between church and State.*""  -letter to Danbury Baptist Association, CT; ""The Complete Jefferson"" by Saul K.

(1744-1812) Meyer Amschel Rothschild:
Meyer Amschel Rothschild helped invent modern banking by introducing concepts such as diversification, rapid communication, confidentiality and high volume. The superlatively discreet foreign-exchange banker diversified from the very beginning, selling antiques and procuring loans. Remarkably, Rothschild was willing to cut into his own profits in order to secure future business.
And, earlier than most, he understood that time and information meant money, and he pulled out all the stops to remain in constant contact with associates across Europe. That network came in handy when he helped finance England's war effort during the Napoleonic Wars. Rothschild institutionalized his bank with a far-sighted will that ensured the continuation of his business. Considered a founding father of international finance, his banking empire--thanks to his five sons--had expanded to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples at the time of his death.

You're misrepresenting (or misunderstanding) the argument. An Islamist citizen of a western democracy certainly has the right to speak his mind and say that law should be based on Sharia (at least in America). Somebody else might come along and call him out for the idiot that is. That's just citizens engaging in free speech, and that's not what I mean by 'debate'.

Take this 'debate'. I am arguing with you that things like free speech should not be up to a vote. You disagree.

The power to vote on whether or not I have the right to speak my mind shouldn't belong to the government (elected or otherwise). Even if the majority decides not to deprive others of their right to speech, they shouldn't have that power.

In America, if the server doesn't come check on you every 10 minutes to ask if everything is okay, the service is bad. ""They're not serving me quickly enough, this place is slow.""
In Europe, the server is supposed to stay off to the side, only intervening when signaled. ""They don't want me to just sit here and enjoy myself, they want me to consume, consume. This place is way too commercial.""

In America, the dishes are typically very modular (e.g. you can swap out salad for fries) and special requests are honored without question (""no dairy"") and often no surcharge. ""The customer is king.""
In Europe, dishes are provided as is and it is understood that this is how the chef feels this dish should be prepared. Asking to have a recipe changed just for you reduces the chef from a food artist to just a cooking hand. ""No, you can't have that without mushrooms.""

In America, people generally go to restaurants to just eat, and then out to party in bars and clubs. If your food doesn't arrive within 15 minutes of sitting down, the restaurant is slow. Hogging a table after you're done without ordering at least another round of drinks is frowned upon.
In Europe, it is common to spend most of your evening in a restaurant,  taking time to acclimate, sip a drink, and having the food arrive at a slow pace. Meals are served in courses, and they will serve the one guy who ordered soup first, leaving the entire table to wait.

We've had lots of economic liberalization.  Even where poverty is the worst, it's often because the people have the least economic freedom, due to official and unofficial discrimination.  (African Americans who suffered through slavery and neo-slavery, Hispanics who were historically denied education, both groups who get crappy educations in today's schools, etc, etc).

EU makes waaay better predictions than gravity only cosmology.  Gravity cosmology has to be constantly patched and updated to get predictions right, like it's microsoft software or something (Inflation added to the big bang, black holes with charges or anti-matter jets, etc.).   

As for Relativity, read this guy's site.

There is no known two body solution to relativity.  Nor has anyone proved that such a solution even exists.  Every actual solution is a vacuum field solution, and thus there is no way to talk about a relativistic interaction between two objects.  When people talk about ""a prediction of GR"" they mean a prediction of a Frankenstein theory made from organs of GR and Newton.
