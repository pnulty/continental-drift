Not according to the [Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031). Iran is ranked 166th out of 173 countries in the latest index; only China, Vietnam, Cuba, Burma, Turkmenistan, North Korea, and Eritrea have less media freedom.

By comparison, Israel is ranked 46th within its own territory. It does have a problem in the Occupied Territories, where it ranks 149th, but even that's better than Iran. I think it really speaks poorly of Iran that in spite of all the repression involved in Israel's occupation of the Palestinians, Israel still does a better job respecting press freedom in the Palestinian Territories than Iran does in its own territory.

Reporters based in Teheran and Kurdistan were targeted in 2007, with dozens of arrests, convictions and closures of newspapers.

&gt; ...

&gt; More than 50 journalists were prosecuted in 2007 and the independent and opposition media were targets of the usual financial and bureaucratic harassment. The ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, which is responsible for the media, ordered at least four publications to shut down permanently. A dozen papers, including the well-known Shargh and Madaresseh, were temporarily closed pending a court decision and news websites were also targeted. Iran has the biggest number of threatened cyber-dissidents in the Middle East and dozens of websites are shut down each year.

The week long Mission visited Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Doha in Qatar. The 64 companies on the Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission participated in c. 1,500 one-to-one and sectoral group meetings with existing and potential customers. The majority of these were first time introductions particularly in the engineering, project management and environmental services sectors related to the construction industry and many of the Irish companies were called back for follow-on meetings. A number of companies and organisations made announcements of agreements reached during the mission including the PM Group, Tetco-Voxpilot, Norkom Technologies and the Institutes of Technology in Athlone, Galway-Mayo, and Waterford. Speaking at the end of the Trade Mission the Tanaiste said: ""The Gulf region is a vibrant part of the world with substantial opportunities for our internationally traded services companies.

And they are open to working with overseas companies and consortia that can contribute to the realisation of their ambitious plans.

The clear message to global markets is Ireland is open for business and Irish companies are coming to talk to you about how they can contribute to your success"". According to Frank Ryan, Chief Executive Officer, Enterprise Ireland: ""Our client companies continue to demonstrate an unstinting commitment to the development of new market opportunities for their international growth while consolidating and deepening their relationships with existing customers in their more established markets. For many of the companies on this Trade Mission it is a first step and a major milestone in what will be a long term investment in their future success here.

&gt;&gt;Wow, if you think the illegality of prostitution is barbaric (and not even in all states I might add) (and it's a law susceptible to change by popular pressure), I can't imagine that you think of acid baths for adultery. Do you honestly draw a moral equivalency between the two?

What you fail to see is that one thing is against the law the other is a bizarro crime done by religious nutjobs. One is state law mandated by a theocratic state (the US) and the other is pure religious nutjobbery. 

&gt;The US is a theocracy

&gt;&gt;Bold claim. Sensationalistic. We have no national church. We follow no one religion. We have the bill of rights, not the ten commandments enshrined in our courthouses. Several of our founding fathers detested the religion you claim inspires this country. Please be serious.

The US started out as a secular state. I'll grant you that. That's why we have legal documents like the Bill of Rights and Constitution. But those documents are rarely followed by our law and courts. For example, when was the last time Congress declared war? If near 100% of our elected representatives being self-identified Christians isn't a theocracy, then what is? YOU please be serious. 

&gt;&gt;As for freedom of speech, there is no such thing. Even in the US, there are limits.

&gt;As to my knowledge we've never outlawed criticism, satire, mockery, or general disrespect. Let's be honest here, that's what we're talking about with this anti-defamation stuff. If you think having exceptions to freedom of speech constitutes a complete dismissal of it, then at least admit that there is a right to freely criticize people, and that, at least, we've tried to uphold and they're trying to destroy.

I'm not sure why you're trying to change the discussion to ""criticism"". Freedom of speech and freedom of criticism are different things. When it comes to ""criticism"" the US media fails time and again. ""The Daily Show"" is basically built around this fact. And before you tell me The Daily Show proves free criticism is alive and well in the US, the only reason they can do what they do is because it's a ""comedy"" show on a comedy network, ostensibly spinning trivial yuks. 

&gt;&gt;Is changing speech laws in favor of a political group somehow indicative of that group gathering political power? Yes. Is this something we should be afraid of? Obviously not since religious fundamentalists have had their way in the US for many decades and it seems to be working out.

&gt;They haven't, thank god. We Americans, for all of our faults, have the good sense to be terrified of a mad pentecostal woman in our highest office. We have had the sense to keep religion out of schools, for a few decades now. Divorce is legal, adultery is unpunishable, barely anyone in our damn country even knows the ten commandments. We are a far cry from fundamentalist rule (to put it mildly).

&gt;Things would not have just 'worked out' in America if people were okay with fundamentalist Christianity. Imagine required church attendance, religion classes in public schools, national prayer times throughout the country, disenfranchisement of opposing religions, etc. That is a theocracy. That is what happens when fundamentalists get their way. And good thing we've had the good sense to oppose it.

Not sure what US you're living in, but it's tough to get good jobs, promotions, political offices, etc, unless you're a self-identified Christian. That's why almost all politicians proclaim their religiosity. 

&gt;It's so trite at this point, but if you don't see the difference, move to the Middle East and find out.

Here's where you're very wrong. Making a judgment about the peoples and cultures of the middle east based on religious fundamentalists is like judging the peoples and cultures of the US based on a chapter of the KKK. 

I sincerely hope that you stop being so closed minded. I hope that the rest of the country opens their eyes and stops feeding the military industrial complex. Giving the powers that be support to bomb these countries does nothing for the common man. 

The US media wants you to hate and revile what you perceive as backward religious zealots. Ironic since most of the US is backward religious zealots. The controversy in Europe over depictions of Muhammad was the expression of a marginalized minority group that had had enough. It wasn't the rise of religious fanaticism - yet the media wants you to believe that. They craft ""news"" that plays to your gut. 

There is a way the media can play to your emotions bypassing your intellect. Almost everything you've written about Islam and the middle east is propaganda that plays directly to the emotions. Significantly, you outline a ominous threat to the western world from Islam. Yet, there is no evidence. There are criminals and religious fundamentalists in every nation.

""There is no such thing as intellectual property law, although certain individuals, whose profit is made through the confusion of others, politicians and lawyers, would have you think otherwise""

Nothing you've linked to in any way contradicts what I wrote.

Did you read the article I linked to, the one by Richard Stallman? No? Well, here is another piece written by a noted expert in the field, Mark A Lemley, which explains the problems associated with the term ""intellectual property"". It makes  similar points to those made by Stallman but has the virtue of being short enough to be quoted here in its entirety.

""Talking about patents, copyrights, and trademarks as just another
species of property is very much in vogue. The rhetoric and economic theory of real property are increasingly dominating the discourse and conclusions of the very different world of intellectual property. The shift begins with simple rhetoric—talking about intellectual property rights as aspects of a
broader system of property. But its implications go far beyond that. The temptation to move from rhetoric to rationale seems almost irresistible. Courts and commentators adopt—explicitly or implicitly—the economic logic of real property in the context of intellectual property cases. They then make a subconscious move, one that the economic theory of property does not justify: they jump from the idea that intellectual property is property to
the idea that the IP owner is entitled to capture the full social value of her right. This leads them to an almost obsessive preoccupation with identifying and rooting out that great evil of the modern economic world—free riding""

&gt; is a list of law firms who identify themselves as practicing intellectual property law. it makes no difference if intellectual property law is the umbrella definition under which are classified all 3 of the fields you mention. it still exists.

Indeed? Then perhaps you should visit the websites of some of those firms. Note how each lists their partners and that area of law, either copyright, or patent, or trademark, that they specialise in. This is because one cannot be an intellectual property lawyer, there is no such field of law. The term groups together a number of disparate and unrelated fields of law and those firms who claim to practise intellectual property law must employ different lawyers for each of these separate fields. Occasionally one will find a lawyer expert in two of the fields, but this is rare. You will not find someone expert in all of them. Thus, to describe a lawyer as an intellectual property lawyer is to say nothing useful about him at all. It only tells you that he has specialised in one of a number of unrelated fields of law. 

It is analogous to announcing the creation of a new field of medicine, let us call it ""upper-body medicine"", which includes dentistry, concerned with teeth, brain surgery, concerned with the brain, ophthalmology, concerned with eyes, and otolaryngology, concerned with the ear, nose and throat. We might now describe someone as an upper-body doctor, but what does that tell us about the knowledge and practise of this person? Nothing much! The skills and knowledge required for each field are so different that our lumping them together has bred confusion, not clarity. My example is frivolous, for it's hard to imagine any serious attempt to lump these things together, but in the field of so called intellectual property law there is a reason, a sinister reason, why such a grouping together is done. That reason is ably explained in that paragraph above by Mark A Lemley.

&gt; people, including pedophiles, may not be using google streetview as a database, as such, but they certainly are scouring it for lurid images, and i can easily imagine some random nut who sees a child on street view and subsequently develops a psychopathic fixation on that child, whose probable location on this planet is available for all to see.

And your evidence for this is? You seriously imagine that paedophiles are scouring Google street view hoping to come upon potential victims instead of simply heading for their nearest beach, or swimming pool, or park? People can order so-called naturist documentary dvds on the internet which feature naked people of all ages. These are legal in most European countries. With the ready availability of such things as this, why would paedophiles need to spend an enormous amount of time searching Google in the small hope of coming across something lurid?

&gt; that's a small danger, and buiter overstated his case, but he's hardly a lunatic for suggesting this possibility.

It is a danger on a par with being hit by a meteorite, and as worthy of attention. Buiter did not simply overstate his case, nor did he merely suggest a possibility. Here is what he wrote:

""The cameras record details of residents’ lives, including pictures of drunk people throwing up, people in intimate clinches with persons with whom they are not officially affiliated, small children playing in a yard, with or without adult supervision, etc. etc.  A wonderful database for voyeurs, peeping toms and would-be child molesters.""

He asserts that it is so, and offers no evidence or reasoning for his claim. This is not the language of someone merely concerned with privacy, it is the language of someone with a deep and bitter grudge lashing out vindictively at the object of his ire.

There are a lot of dangerous types of dogs. Police dogs, (which are now made up of a lot of different breeds, but still predominatly Belgian Malinois and German Shepards) are partially desired *for* their ability to down and injure a perpetrator. 

Additionally, search dogs (drugs, explosives, etc) are of several different breeds, where playfulness (a leading indication of task based trainability), weather endurance, and public acceptance are the criteria used. This makes many jurisdiction shy away from enforcement type dogs, and uses things like Labrador retrievers instead (for instance the US bureau of printing and engraving's ""Money dogs"" are labs), and Europe uses some downright silly breeds for drug detection.

German shepherds ALSO should not be allowed in multifamily housing, as well as dalmatians, chow chows, rottweilers, etc.

Dogs are a *tool* man made to better control the world. Just like guns, lathes, forklifts and explosives. And just like those other things, if it has to be repeatedly taken into a hallway or common area that children and easily spooked adults are in, it should not be allowed in that building (aka, multifamily residences) if it has a danger of reacting in a way detrimental to the residents.

And some dog breeds, like some non-living tools, are suited to being used and moved around children and unwilling families. I don't really care if your neighbor doesn't want you owning a hammer drill, it doesn't affect them. Just like you owning a computer doesn't. But you owning a box of dynamite might.

I’d dispute that, depending on what kind of Zionism you are talking about. It may well be a political thing, but it has roots and justifications in religion.

It is important to note that while things may start one way, they change over time.

Further, the strong adherence to the notion of Zionism is religious in the non-theological sense.

&gt;The idea was to cooperate and live side by side in peace with the natives of the land. But the natives had other plans.

There are things called consultation and consideration. If the natives (I’m glad to see that some accept that the Palestinians were native to the regions - this seems to be commonly denied) did not want people to come, people should not have come - nowadays we hold immigration regulation to be a fundamental state right (this is obviously confused by the nature of Palestine as a protectorate, but still the people should constitute a state).

&gt;What's your solution to the Jewish persecution problem, assuming its now 1880?

I honestly don’t know. The ‘solution’ that was taken though just shifted it in time, place and people and did not actually resolve a problem of persecution of a people. In addition to that, notion was done to help the Roma, just as persecuted (and still are - most Eastern Europeans express desires similar to those expressed regarding the Jews at the beginning of last century) and yet without patron, and so without the kind of protection given to the Jews. I don’t mean this to be a justification for not helping the Jews, I just don’t think the question is wildly useful.

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation.

To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

the Zionist put alot of thought into transferring Palestinian from the land, The zionists first thought that the native would welcome them as civilizers of the barbaric land.
They imagined a grateful population, then large amounts of money enabled them to buy up land and create work away from the land they wanted, moving population out of the area they wanted. 
There where riots by the local Palestinians in 1936-39. The British killed 1000's and killed, jailed or exiled the leadership.

 - can you demand that they stay and remain persecuted, because there are some people there who prefer it if they didn't come?

  I even preempted that response.  You're dismissing the ICC's ability to hold people accountable does not detract from the definition of apartheid.  You've moved from not being apartheid to not be held accountable by the higher ethical standard.

&gt;Also, Israel could also have been referred to the ICC at any time through the Security Council. Since this has not happened, it means that the members of the security council agree that Israel is not guilty of any crimes made up by the ICC.

You know quite well that the US uses its veto on the security council as Israeli wipe-out.  Again - you're back to saying 'what about these other guys', an argument of misdirection.

&gt;Apartheid's definition was already changed by the ICC. The fact that the two largest economies in the world do not recognise the court does not lend any credence to the court.

No - legally defined by the court to recognise apartheid as a crime.  But argument of fallacy #2 is that a large economy = right.  A big checkbook does not mean you can't be guilty of oppression.  Check out the deeds of the British empire in the 19th century. Again, you move further from arguing that what Israel is doing is right to what Israel does it can get away with so it must be justifiable.  The two do not correlate.

&gt;The boycotts and disinvestment campaign was a joke in South Africa. 

Oh noes...it brought an awful lot of international pressure onto the South African government.  You see when elected governments see that the electorate are polarized on something they too act.  You might have noticed that effect when Israel broke the ceasefire and invaded Gaza.

Spin it how you like - boycott came, apartheid ended.

&gt;On a question for boycotts – you are being a hypocrite if you try to boycott Israeli products: Because you use Saudi or Equatorial Guinea oil (which are some of the worst regimes in existence). I wonder why it is fashionable for kids to have campaigns against Israel, but not against Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, DRC, Angola, China or Viet Nam? All of those are de facto dictatorships.

You don't know what I do and do not do.  You have, once again, tried to shift condemnation of the Israeli regime onto another regime by saying, 'look over there'.  Crying relativity doesn't mean that what is happening in Israel is not apartheid, and what they are doing is not ethnic cleansing.  

It is and they are.

&gt;You may even get a reverse boycott (people buying Israeli product because they feel that Israel is unfairly boycotted).

Yeah 'cos you don't buy Israel at the moment.  Sure you do.  Not exclusively Israel but you're clearly not boycotting.  However the boycott works by getting people who would otherwise have bought not doing so.  You can try to compensate by buying more but we both know the boycott works and it creates a deficit because there's far more people who won't buy as opposed to those who can buy more on principle.

Also - you must be aware that the popular support is not with Israel's behaviour.  She's having a PR nightmare.

THE BOYCOTT IS WORKING!

[""**Israeli exports hit by European boycotts after attacks on Gaza**""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/03/israel-gaza-attacks-boycotts-food-industry)

&gt;[on planning permission] Did they apply? Why didn't they take it to court. Also, did they apply for Israeli citizenship (there are a lot of people in Jerusalem who did not bother to apply for citizenship).

Apparently so - well according to Israeli human rights groups like B'Tselem and Bimkom.  B'tselem goes further [and says this](http://www.btselem.org/english/Jerusalem/Discriminating_Policy.asp),

      ""The Jerusalem Municipality enforces the building laws on Palestinians much more
      stringently than on the Jewish population, even though the number of
      violations is much higher in the Jewish neighborhoods."" 

Gee - who'da thunk.  More violations by those annexing East Jerusalem (something else against international law) but less accountability.  Back to apartheid.

&gt;If you continue building a structure when there is a demolition order, it will be destroyed.

Only B'Tselem notices that it will be destroyed if you're not Jewish....

&gt;There is a good reason for this! Arab Israeli citizens are free from conscription (while Israeli citizens are not). That is the only difference in laws between Israeli and Arabs.
I would say not being subject to conscription or mandatory military service (and losing a year of your life) is a huge advantage!

Only difference?  Piffle when one notes that Arabs can only build in 13% of annexed East Jerusalem and that Jewish permits granted for building outweigh Arab permits - according to Israeli humanitarian groups.

On the military service thing - don't sweat it, most Israelis scratched around for any and all reason to get out of military service.  It's becoming a real problem for the IDF.  Israelis of good conscience refuse to be part of ethnic cleansing and what they see as military expansionism.  Thanks for bringing it up though and giving me the opportunity to sing praise for the likes of [Yesh Gvul!](http://www.yeshgvul.org/about_e.asp)  Those peaceful Israeli guys, the humanitarians, rock.  

&gt;So? There are the same restrictions for USA citizens (you cannot visit Cuba).

Back to look over there as an argument as to why it isn't apartheid in Israel.  But thank-you, the situation is quite different to the one you falsely compare.  Point is that in modern Israel, if you are Jewish, there are places you can go that you cannot if you are an Arab.

&gt;This law apply equally to Arab and Jewish citizen alike. There are numerous countries with the same type of laws.

and this was the response you gave to a middle-east journalist who also has the insight of having reported from apartheid South Africa.  You might wish to say that there is equality but here is what he says on it once again so that it is not whitewashed:

     ""This violation of rights is directed against Arab citizens of Israel. As a result,   
      therefore, the law is a violation of the right of Arab citizens in Israel to equality.""

&gt;This law in Israel is probably to prevent Chain migration. This can be a large problem in a society that allows polygamy.

So you accept that it is geared towards a specific polygamous sample.  A law geared against Arabs.  Apartheid.

&gt;[Born and lived in Israel but not Jewish - deported.]  That is a lie. Citizens of Israel (both Arab, Jewish or other) have equal rights and are not deported.

Amnesty International joined the ranks describing the law as discriminatory:

[""A law permitting such blatant racial discrimination, on grounds of ethnicity or nationality, would clearly violate international human rights law and treaties which Israel has ratified and pledged to uphold,""](http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/066/2003/en/ef602f34-d6ac-11dd-ab95-a13b602c0642/mde150662003en.html)

&gt;The demolition orders are given before construction but ignored:

Oh you miss the point, [here is the link again](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1211872828552&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull), that of all planning permission 94% is rejected.  Thousands of homes for Jewish people are built, Arabs in annexed East Jerusalem (people who have lived there their whole lives) are restricted to 13% of the territory and even then, despite massive short-fallings in accommodation and mass overcrowding, 94% get planning permits turned down.

&gt;It is the right of any sovereign nation to decide whom they will allow to become citizens. To become a citizen of Britain, Australia or the USA for example is impossible for 99% of the world's population.

Only now you are applying it to annexed territory - which breaks another international law and the Geneva convention. Only what is allowed in and what is sent out is based on ethnicity.  You might wish to claim sovereignty but now you're claiming a sovereign right to apartheid.  Sorry, that's what Israel is having a PR nightmare.  People of good conscience don't agree.  Neither does international law.

&gt;Your defence is to attack Israel with half truths and make bad comparisons to another country (apartheid South Africa). You then exercise your hypocracy by holding Israel to different standards than other countries.

You don't know what standards I hold other countries to.  We're talking about Israel - you just wish to try and point elsewhere and say 'what about them?'  The comparisons I  make are to international law.   It is you that is trying to say that apartheid is a foreign word and make that it only belongs in South Africa.  Well you might for if apartheid can only exist in South Africa then it can't be in Israel.  Only the world has moved on and in not wanting to see a similar regime made it an international ruling, defining it.  There is a crime of apartheid and South Africa need not come into it any longer.  

Israel is practicing apartheid.  Humanitarian groups see it.  Israeli humanitarian groups see it.  Those that have seen it elsewhere recognise it now in Israel too.  

&gt;Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.

[Lebanon](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html#Govt)?  [The Republic of Iran](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#Govt)?

I've never really thought about quotation marks within headlines before, but it seems to be standard to use single quotes instead of double quotes in headlines, at least based on a quick perusal of a bunch of headlines on news.google.com.  There were a number of headlines that used quotation marks, and essentially every last one of them (by any professional news organization) used single quotes:

Examples:

* ABC News: [David Souter: 'A Classic Yankee Republican'](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/SCOTUS/story?id=7483045&amp;page=1)
* BBC News: [Hospital 'hit by Sri Lankan army'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8030605.stm)
* Al Jazeera: [Sri Lankan army 'shells hospital'](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/05/20095285641256234.html)
* Los Angeles Times: [Obama calls 'empathy' key to Supreme Court pick](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-court-souter2-2009may02,0,2486011.story)
* CNN.com: [Dutch 'royal attack' death toll rises](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/05/02/netherlands.royals.queen.car/)

Interestingly I couldn't find any examples from The New York Times, at least not of a quotation appearing in a headline.  I did find theatre / movie / book reviews that used quotation marks for a title, but that's a different thing.  (And those all used single quotes again.)

From this, I'm going to have to guess two things:

* It's some sort of typographical convention to use single quotes rather than double quotes in headlines.  It seems to be essentially universal.  Maybe with really large type (as would be used in a headline), the double quotes just look bad, or take up too much space, or are too distracting to the eye.
* Curiously, in several examples, the quoted words that appeared in the headline did not appear anywhere in the body of the article.  You would expect that if 2 or 3 words are quoted in the headline, you'd be able to find the full quotation in the article, but sometimes you can't.  I can think of two explanations of this.  One is that newspapers like to pepper headlines with quotes because they think it makes their coverage look better, because it looks like they are giving you information directly from the source.  The other possibly explanation is maybe that their own editorial standards require them to put anything in quotation marks if the phrase came from the original, as a way of giving proper credit.  I could easily see either one of these being true.  :-)",True,t1_c099l6r,1,c099y7d,1425963385,1241274486,t1_c099y7d,0,False,t3_8h1zk,t5_mouw

Domesticate them by adding moderation into their culture. This is difficult for the Europeans.

In many countries, you have to work extremely hard to succeed – and competition to get ahead is immense.

Ummmm... you clearly have been drinking the propaganda kool-aid. It is *very* clear that Georgia started the conflict. Since you're in need of a history lesson, I'll oblige, but only briefly.

Georgia and the rebellious S. Ossetians have been fighting back and forth since SO's assertion of independence. Small attacks and skirmishes were sporadic. Russian peace-keepers were sent there to prevent either side from doing anything really stupid, but they didn't have to worry much about the SO militias. Georgia's president, thinking that he could get into NATO faster if he was engaged in combat with Russia, decided to set the whole thing in motion. He built up his forces, which the SO's and Russians saw happening. The SO's tried a preemptive strike but failed to do anything. Then, Georgia launched their assault, kicking it off with a huge artillery barrage of SO's capital, reportedly killing thousands of civilians (obvious outcome, must have been deliberate). Georgian forces also attacked said peace-keepers and easily advanced into SO. What they *didn't* know was just how prepared Russia was to intervene. Russian forces came down and basically obliterated Georgia's entire military. How they didn't see that coming is a testament to Sakhashvili's idiocy. Russia played it perfectly. 

Why does any of this even matter? Because the US never quit playing the Cold War game. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US has been able to expand their empire into East Europe. They have also been expanding NATO into former Soviet territories in an effort to encircle Russia and dominate them. That's why we supplied and trained the Georgian military. That's why Russia took the opportunity to crush Georgia.

It is indeed! But in real life, the [difference in productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita_per_hour) isn't very big. Here are the GDP(PPP)/hour of the same countries you listed:


&gt;2 	United States 35.90

&gt;4 	France 35.09

&gt;9 	United Kingdom 31.27

&gt;14 	Germany 29.69

&gt;15 	Italy 29.22

As you can see here, a French worker and an American worker contribute about **the same** to GDP per hour. The French just prefer to go on vacation while the Americans prefer to work extra. You cannot say that the American system produces better workers, it just indoctrinates people into working more hours. The French have the same opportunity to obtain monetary wealth as the Americans, but people _choose_ to work less; in effect, **""buying""** time off (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws). In my opinion, it's all in how you measure these things.

Which leads me to my next point: GDP is not the end all measure of prosperity; it's an _indicator_ of prosperity. The USA is highly commercialised compared to many European countries, so more purchases take place, inflating the GDP. For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services. American nannies doing the same work would be paid for it, though, thus visibly contributing to the economy.

Now, if you couple this with the [income inequality of European countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality), you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise _better_ off than their counterparts across the Atlantic.

&gt; When you go to a movie or buy a DVD, what you're paying for isn't the data, it's the effort that has gone towards organizing and presenting that data.

I assure you that it's not so.  I can assert this with authority, since I have both gone to movies and bought DVDs fairly recently, and I can confidently report that I was not paying for their effort.  If it took them no effort at all to produce the movie or DVD, I wouldn't care a whit.  If the movie had fallen from the sky into the lap of the executive producer, and all that was left to do was distribute, it wouldn't change what I'm willing to pay for it.  (I understand that's not the case with everyone).

&gt; Traditional theft law doesn't really apply, in such a case, which is why we have IP law in the modern age.

I agree with the former, but I would say that copyright and patent law was just one of those ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" mistakes that people make.  Of course, for many decades now, a process analogous to regulatory capture has resulted in more and more strict law.  We're now in or rapidly approaching a time (as you no doubt are aware, since you're here) when there will be no way at all to control what happens with information you've given someone else.  There might eventually be some effective way to control other people's information, but I can't see how it could happen without essentially removing control over our own computers, and I think (I hope!) that it's too late to close pandora's box.  I think that people will want to continue to frequent movie theaters for the comfy seats with drinkholders, expensive popcorn, and gigantic screen (as I do).

&gt; Still, just as a bard in medieval Europe stealing someone else's songs and claiming they're his own ought to know what he's doing is wrong even though there's no explicit law against it

[From the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html?sec=&amp;pagewanted=print):

&gt;A division of the pharmaceutical company Bayer sold millions of dollars of blood-clotting medicine for hemophiliacs -- medicine that carried a high risk of transmitting AIDS -- to Asia and Latin America in the mid-1980's while selling a new, safer product in the West, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.

&gt;The Bayer unit, Cutter Biological, introduced its safer medicine in late February 1984 as evidence mounted that the earlier version was infecting hemophiliacs with H.I.V. Yet for over a year, the company continued to sell the old medicine overseas, prompting a United States regulator to accuse Cutter of breaking its promise to stop selling the product.

&gt;By continuing to sell the old version of the life-saving medicine, the records show, Cutter officials were trying to avoid being stuck with large stores of a product that was proving increasingly unmarketable in the United States and Europe.

&gt;Yet even after it began selling the new product, the company kept making the old medicine for several months more. A telex from Cutter to a distributor suggests one reason behind that decision, too: the company had several fixed-price contracts and believed that the old product would be cheaper to produce.

&gt;Nearly two decades later, the precise human toll of these marketing decisions is difficult, if not impossible, to document. Many patient records are now unavailable, and because an AIDS test was not developed until later in the epidemic, it is difficult to pinpoint when foreign hemophiliacs were infected with H.I.V. -- before Cutter began selling its safer medicine or afterward.



Bayer is responsible for causing people to become infected with HIV. They had the responsibility to give people the safe products they had that wouldn't spread this virus, but they went ahead and used a product which they knew would kill people, because the CDC had already warned in March of 1983 that the blood products spread AIDS, but after that date Bayer and other companies continued to export these unsafe blood products while they were perfectly capable of exporting safe ones.
 
[And there's reason to believe they spread this disease on purpose:](http://www.hemophilia-litigation.com/)
&gt;It is believed that three of these companies, Alpha, Baxter and Cutter, recruited and paid donors from high risk populations, including prisoners, intravenous drug users, and blood centers with predominantly homosexual donors, to obtain blood plasma used for the production of Factor VIII and IX. Plaintiffs allege that these companies failed to exclude donors, as mandated by federal law, with a history of viral hepatitis. Such testing could have substantially reduced the likelihood of plasma containing HIV and/or HCV entering plasma pools.

A more detailed analysis of [Y haplotypes and mitochondrial inheritance](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297\(07\)60694-6) shows that European Jews, consistent with Jewish matrilineal inheritance, are descended from a limited number of Jewish women. The paternal inheritance is more complicated, with significant input from the local European populations (this is consistent with the data from the previous paper, which shows that the Ashkenazi haplotypes are more closely associated with Europeans than are other Jewish or Middle Eastern groups).

* Moving on

On the topic of the Origins of the Jews and Arabs, Occam's Razor dictates Jews descend of Jacob and Arabs from Ishmael, as is these people's tradition. Academia doesn't discredit both the Jewish and Arab claim of common ancestry, as many peoples have traditions regarding their ancestral lineage that far back. The point I made was Jews and Arabs both descend of a common ancestor, Arabs are allot more diverse than Jews, having mixed from very early on with other nations.

Moving on, both Jews and Arabs moved around, true not only Arabs. Jews on the move added the ""technological and biological distinctiveness"" of others to their own, most notably a sizeable group of Khazzars at one point, in so doing diversifying their genetic profile, as you may call it. Arabs, having originated as Ishmaelites mixed with Edomites, Arameans, Nabataeans and other Semitic and black peoples, as both the Bible and genetics dictates.

Coming back, you say Jews having lost the biological distinctness through inteloving with Europeans must now relinquish their ancestral claim to the land to a people who have since settled it as they through lots of intershagging with just as varied peoples of their region have much more such distinctiveness?

&gt;I don’t actually think it make a tiny bit of difference

phew, good. because that race classification system of purity is rather old.

I think you should realise, the religious texts, in telling the tale of Jewish/Arab origins is what both Jews and Arabs believe and academia's tale isn't much different, and since this is a Jewish/Arab issue, not a Jewish/Arab/Bozo issue, what exactly is the problem?

Jewish texts say this was the Jewish homeland, Islamic texts say Mecca was the Muslim/Arab homeland and makes no mention of the southern Levant in any known reference or term. Let Jews be Jews and Muslims be Muslims... and in this land where we are together, that means let there be war.

Yes creationist is what I fear the most, especially when hidden out of sight and paid for by state funds.

And normal blue eyed christians can ""hide"" publicly, where as must muslim don't have this opportunity and since many danes really hate muslim believes, its easier than ever to recruit.

about language and this is perhaps a difficult issue to discuss, since US and Europe are so different in its culture &amp; structure.

You might be right, but on the other hand I do have to point out a big difference and that is when your fed. gov. says: *jump* then everyone disagrees on the issue in between states. This level isn't something we feel very much (EU have yet to show its teeth). You have to imagine if your state made laws like the fed. gov. did and then perhaps you would have good sense how this works.

I can see your point that people just learn one language and keep in their social group and then never gets integrated. Surely it can happen, but I think its more or less impossible in Scandinavian. Since our politicians are all over this and tries many different solution to break this stuff up. I think that in 10-15 years we don't have this problem at all, since I constantly see second generation middle eastern people totally integrated.

Of course you read about all the weird stories from Britain, but its a special case and can't be compared to what's happening in germany or scandinavia. France on the other hand have a huge problem, from what I can gather. Scandinavia/germany can't be compared to the netherlands, belgium, britain or france because it isn't yet a melting pot from all kinds of cultures.

This also explains why Im not scared of muslims where I live, actually Im not scared of it at all, because they have no power what so ever.

Outbreaks were widespread and killed people who hadn't even had contact with Europeans at that point. If you recall, the Plymouth colony was founded nearby the ruins of a native village which had been completely wiped out by smallpox years before the pilgrims landed. Only one member of the tribe was alive in 1620... and that was Squanto... and he died only a couple years later of, guess what -- smallpox. 

This is not to say that biological warfare wasn't unfairly used against natives -- it was and this is dispicable. However, by the time that this had begun, the vast majority of native peoples had already been killed off in the previous centuries due to these widespread outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases. 

Keep in mind, this is also one of the main reasons why native peoples were conquered with little resistance. Since the natives had been so wiped out by the spread of disease in the first centuries after contact with Europeans, as the Europeans made contact with other groups as they ventured deeper within the continent, their populations were very sparse and were greatly outnumbered by Europeans. So this made it especially easy for Europeans to wipe out native populations further.

I'm not excusing the Europeans and their descendants here.

My point is this. 
The brave little Israel myth is bullshit. They are the powerful well connected outsiders. They have taken over the land of an entirely innocent population of date growers and goat herders. The suffering of the jews was alleviated by bringing about the suffering of this innocent population. That is wrong yet has been disguised by reams of self denial and bullshit.

two quotes for you to ponder. 

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

And this one really nails it considering the date.

“The wealthy, crowded, progressive Jewish state will lie in the plains and on the seacoasts of Palestine. Around it, in the hills and the uplands, stretching far and wide into the illimitable deserts the war-like Arabs of Syria, of Transjordania, of Arabia, backed by the armed forces of Iraq, offer the ceaseless menace of war. To maintain itself the Jewish state will be armed to the teeth and must bring in every able-bodied man to strengthen its army. But how long will this process be allowed to continue by the great Arab populations in Iraq and Palestine? Can it be expected that the Arabs would stand by impassively and watch the building up with Jewish world capital and resources of a Jewish army equipped with the most deadly weapons of war until it was strong enough not to be afraid of them? And if ever the Jewish army reached that point, who can be sure that cramped within their narrow limits it would not plunge out into the new, undeveloped lands that lie around them.” Winston Churchill 1937

si1kyfish,7,atheism,0,0,False,,,,"HOWEVER, OSC makes some okay points too.

(1) &lt;i&gt;They raise the false claim that religions have caused all kinds of evil in the world. But this merely shows that they are willing to speak without physical evidence, because history shows, not that religion causes wars and persecutions, but rather that humans are prone to war and persecution, and then invoke whatever excuse their belief system provides them to justify their actions.&lt;/i&gt;

Black is the new pink. Sex is the new black. And statehood is the new religion. True story. Before there were no nations as we think of them (not as long ago as you think-- 500 yrs max [before that, in most of Western Europe, it was simply allegiance to a King as a matter of divine lineage-- religion]), there were clans and religious affiliations. Tribes are always fighting. When statehood become the new fad, wars continued, the inhumanity followed. Those religious wars are not a matter of incompatible belief but rather, clans' natural desire to dominate.

Now, to be fair, the Romans coined, ""To rule, divide,"" and that happens in the states, on the topic of religion. But if it weren't for religion, our elected leaders would find another strategy to divide and rule. (When we all get together and bash religious extremists, we are complicit in this corruption.)

(2) &lt;i&gt;In fact, one could, with far more merit, argue that religious faith tempers the actions of believers, and that the evils done by nominally Christian societies were done only by those who deviated from the norms and teachings of their faith.&lt;/i&gt;

I was going to wait to the end to divulge, but I will now: I am neither religious nor atheistic or agnostic. Call me a humanist, I don't care. That's the point, I don't care. I don't even think about it save in human terms.  But truly, I grew up United Methodist outside Philly. The preacher kept to the administratively assigned texts each Sunday, but sometimes declared that he didn't care for a passage and told us why for an hour, and then opened it up to discussion. A church that asked us to think! The preacher was a professor at a nearby university on topics like the compatibility of faith and science.

These churches are out there. I don't go to them, want nothing to do with any steeples. But, point in fact: these churches are out there in numbers you don't know. OSC might not belong to one, however, his point is valid because attacking the speaker of an argument in order to attack the argument is, of itself, an Ad Hominem logical fallacy. So, whether OSC is a dick or not (I certainly think he is), this is true. There are lots of Christians out there that are Christ-like too. You won't find them on CNN or Reddit, but OSC has a point here, whether he knows it or not.

(3) &lt;i&gt;Intolerant, rigid, closed-minded atheism offers no visible improvements over intolerant, rigid, closed-minded religion. &lt;/i&gt;

I have never seen, on Reddit, a post that praises a faith-motivated effort towards charity, generosity, sacrifice, love for a stranger.

On the other hand, you don't find much of that on the news.

Okay, done with the balancing act. It is itself a logical fallacy to assert that OSC's article lacks valuable points because OSC is OSC. On the other hand, I find that lots of us Redditors believe that every church is taking turns with the eight year old girls in the graveyard out back. This is what they want you to believe. And if you do, you are dividing our society just the way they want you too. Accept that faithful folk might not be ign'ant hicks. They might just want to believe. We all believe in &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; or we woulda eaten a lotta pills last night. Reach out to one.

Affirmative action and political correctness aren't the same thing. Political correctness is why people say African-American instead of black, shouldn't refer to the 9-11 hijackers as Arab or Muslim, [why some Christians have been ordered to remove crosses from their necks or be fired](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410299/Christian-BA-employee-legal-action-suspension-wearing-cross.html), it's happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, it's why thought can be a crime particularly in Europe, why people actually suggest calling illegal aliens in America ""undocumented workers"" as an example. It's essentially a self-segregating behavior when certain groups are removed from the whole lest they offend 10 people. It was political correctness that terminated her from the program for taking her supervisors advice in refeerring the student.

It also isn't affirmative action as affirmative action is the doctrine that minorities must fill some sort of a quota. It is designed to specifically improve women and minority economic status.

&gt;Her assigned texts didn't excuse her from dealing with people because of their sexuality. They just said in extreme circumstances referral could be a last resort. It was her first resort.

Her first resort was to consult with her instructor, as per the guidelines she is expected to follow and as the book states. Refer to 235-236 of Knowing Your Values a attached to the PDF towards the end. It's a specific addressing of why this student was expelled from her program verifying that in fact nearly half of councilors have to make referrals when it comes to sexuality. In fact referrals are taught and suggested as an option for irreconcilable differences in general. In fact this is from the ACA code itself:

&gt;A.11.b. Inability to Assist Clients
If counselors determine an inability
to be of professional assistance to
clients, they avoid entering or con-
tinuing counseling relationships.
Counselors are knowledgeable about
culturally and clinically appropriate
referral resources and suggest these
alternatives. If clients decline the sug-
gested referrals, counselors should
discontinue the relationship

&gt;It would be a shame if someone like her could get a qualification from a normal university. I could see her getting one from some Christian uni, and advertising herself that way. That would be fair enough. But advertising herself as a proper councellor when she stands firmly against the available science in the field, is just false advertising. It makes the degree worthless. I can see why the university doesn't like it.

So you are suggesting a Christian with traditional Christian values shouldn't be allowed to achieve certain degrees? There are laws protecting that. There are state and federal laws protecting that as well and to say she shouldn't be allowed to practice seems to imply that at least 40% of counselors shouldn't be allowed to be counselors since that is a statistic cited in the book specifically for this issue. The ACA code does go into further detail on these types of things. See section D2A, A9B as well as earlier noted references that relate to referrals. And no counseling isn't a science and really neither is psychology in the sit down and talk sense of the word as opposed to psychology which studies human behavior.

Unfortunately, these so called jews have been commiting their same transgressions long before their was ever a state of israel.

South Africa moved black people out from South Africa to ""home lands"" to make sure that they couldn't be South African citizens. When they lived there they were controlled by the South Africans and worked in South Africa they just didn't have any rights. This is how Israel treats the Palestinians they occupy in the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights.

That logic is insanely impossible to defend. It promotes bullshit worldviews of ""us"" versus ""them"". It promotes religious and racial justification for killing. It promotes all kinds of horrible, horrible shit. 

The entire point of bringing up North America is because, under your logic, you are guilty of the same crimes.

Many news sources repeated the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) statement that Ahmadinejad had demanded that ""Israel must be wiped off the map"",[5][6] an English idiom which means to ""cause a place to stop existing"",[7] or to ""obliterate totally"",[8] or ""destroy completely"".[9]

Ahmadinejad's phrase was "" بايد از صفحه روزگار محو شود "" according to the text published on the President's Office's website, and was a quote of Ayatollah Khomeini.[10]

According to Juan Cole, a University of Michigan Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, Ahmadinejad's statement should be translated as:

    The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods) must [vanish from] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad).[11]

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translates the phrase similarly, as ""be eliminated from the pages of history.""[12]

According to Cole, ""Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to 'wipe Israel off the map' because no such idiom exists in Persian"". Instead, ""He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse.""[13]

On June 2, 2006 The Guardian columnist and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele published an article based on this line of reasoning.[14]

Sources within the Iranian government have also denied that Ahmadinejad issued any sort of threat.[15][16][17] On 20 February 2006, Iran's foreign minister denied that Tehran wanted to see Israel ""wiped off the map,"" saying Ahmadinejad had been misunderstood. ""Nobody can remove a country from the map. This is a misunderstanding in Europe of what our president mentioned,"" Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference, speaking in English, after addressing the European Parliament. ""How is it possible to remove a country from the map? He is talking about the regime. We do not recognize legally this regime,"" he said.[18][19][20]

Shiraz Dossa, a professor of Political Science at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada who presented a paper at the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust conference in Iran, believes the text is a mistranslation.[21]

    Ahmadinejad was quoting the Ayatollah Khomeini in the specific speech under discussion: what he said was that ""the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time."" No state action is envisaged in this lament; it denotes a spiritual wish, whereas the erroneous translation—""wipe Israel off the map""—suggests a military threat. There is a huge chasm between the correct and the incorrect translations. The notion that Iran can ""wipe out"" U.S.-backed, nuclear-armed Israel is ludicrous.[22][23][24]

In a June 11, 2006 analysis of the translation controversy, New York Times deputy foreign editor and Israeli resident Ethan Bronner argued that Ahmadinejad had called for Israel to be wiped off the map. After noting the objections of critics such as Cole and Steele, Bronner stated:

    But translators in Tehran who work for the president's office and the foreign ministry disagree with them. All official translations of Mr. Ahmadinejad's statement, including a description of it on his website, refer to wiping Israel away. Sohrab Mahdavi, one of Iran’s most prominent translators, and Siamak Namazi, managing director of a Tehran consulting firm, who is bilingual, both say “wipe off” or “wipe away” is more accurate than ""vanish"" because the Persian verb is active and transitive.

Bronner continued: ""..it is hard to argue that, from Israel's point of view, Mr. Ahmadinejad poses no threat. Still, it is true that he has never specifically threatened war against Israel. So did Iran's president call for Israel to be 'wiped off the map'? It certainly seems so. Did that amount to a call for war? That remains an open question.""[13] This elicited a further response from Jonathan Steele, who took issue with the use of the word ""map"" instead of the phrase ""wipe out"" and criticized this Wikipedia entry (as it was on June 14, 2006) for misrepresenting Ethan Bronner.[25]",True,t1_c09ccmk,1,c09cjod,1425964848,1241541550,t1_c09cjod,0,False,t3_8hvmc,t5_6

The Re-sale agents who charge timeshare owners to register their timeshare for sale usually at the price they paid for it or in some cases even more then claim to take a percentage of the sale arranged by them between a current timeshare owner and a perspective client are rife in Europe, Trade Weeks questions their validity and cannot understand the logic of a business we don’t believe exists!

Trade Weeks.co.uk concede that there are many timeshare marketers selling weeks directly to the public and doing a very good job, Mr Simon Mullish of Trade Weeks said “We know they exist we supply most of them with stock, they do a great job of marketing through, usually print advertising and are a great benefit to the consumer as they are able to sell at much lower prices because of their low marketing costs”

However Trade Weeks questions the validity of the re-sale agent with the two following points

1.	Timeshare is not usually purchased it is SOLD to a client in an extensive face to face presentation usually on a resort or in an office, there are exceptions to this statement, there are educated timeshare owners who look to purchase a specific week, they are the consumers who will reply to timeshare marketers who advertise LOW COST weeks (Usually less than 40% of the retails price) in the press, we estimate this market to be less than 3% of the total market.

2.	Why would any company with the ability to sell Timeshare at the retail price wish to do that on behalf of a consumer and take a percentage of the sale for example 20%, when they could buy the same stock from Trade Weeks at less than 10% of the retail price and keep 90% versus 20% from the consumer, even taking into account the amount they are paid to register the clients this does not make logical sense

Trade Weeks suggests that these business’s only exist to take registration fees, that is the focus of their business and we can only deduce from the facts that it is impossible to sell a timeshare week on behalf of a consumer at retail price!

Trade Weeks warns timeshare owners to exercise extreme caution when dealing with companies who charge upfront fees and that claim to have a buyer for their week at anything above wholesale prices, as to us it sounds too good to be true and when it sounds too good to be true it usually is!

eaturbrainz,5,worldnews,0,0,False,,,,"I'm just going to go ahead and write my own commentary here.  This article clearly shows that Khaled Meshaal is a devious, clever man, and knows quite well how to play the game of international diplomacy.  He says:

&gt;“I promise the American administration and the international community that we will be part of the solution, period,” the leader, Khaled Meshal, said during a five-hour interview with The New York Times spread over two days in his home office here in the Syrian capital. 

Then he goes on to say:

&gt;""There is only one enemy in the region, and that is Israel.”

He is reaching out to President Obama and the new administration in America, and to Europe, but if you ask him for a concrete proposal you get the same old, same old:

&gt;On the two-state solution sought by the Americans, he said: “We are with a state on the 1967 borders, based on a long-term truce. This includes East Jerusalem, the dismantling of settlements and the right of return of the Palestinian refugees.” Asked what “long-term” meant, he said 10 years.

So what he wants is a Palestinian state in the 1967 territories (OK, fine), including East Jerusalem (unpleasant but negotiable), with the dismantling of settlements (making ""Palestine"" a Jew-free country), and the return of ""Palestinian refugees"" into Israel (which would make Israel an Arab-majority state).  This is what Israel should give him, and in exchange he offers a 10-year truce in the jihad of extermination against Israel.

To translate, he wants a Jew-free Palestinian state with a demographic Arab advantage inside Israel - forcing the Israelis to either become a true apartheid or an Arab state themselves - in exchange not for peace but for a break in the war of extermination.  There is a reason people refer to this proposal as the 1.5 state solution: it results in a Jew-free Palestinian state and an Arab-majority Israel, with Jews no longer actually having any greater independence than as a national minority in another people's country.

The Hamas proposal then, is as it has always been: ""*Give us all that we want peacefully, or we shall take it by force!*""",True,t3_8i1n3,5,c09cp7b,1425964989,1241551204,t1_c09cp7b,0,True,t3_8i1n3,t5_2qh13

Only in those cases?  I suppose the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were made by Flat-Earthers.  Nazi science was actually a step ahead of the rest of Europe in many regards -- they were a full generation ahead of us in researching the effects of alcohol and tobacco use and would likely have split that atom before us if we hadn't lured away their most prominent physicists.  Even American supporters of science like Rockefellar could take a scientific principle like Darwinian evolution and endorse it as justification for the exploitation of the lower class.

Science simply doesn't come with intrinsic safeguards against immoral use.  No belief does.

&gt; Science changes based upon new evidence, religion tends to resist change.

Stock answer; not really sure what it has to do with this particular issue.  Care to elaborate?

&gt; It would be easy for the religions of today to repeat the same errors of the dark ages...

I've talked about this ad nauseam on reddit.  Religion wasn't responsible for the Dark Ages in Europe.  The collapse of Rome, and the resulting famines that resulting in successive waves of barbarian invasion, caused the Dark Ages.  If anything, the Catholic Church was one of the few institutions that actively worked to lessen the severity of the resulting chaos -- cf., for example, [the Peace and Truce of God][1].

&gt; So, yeah, I've just given you a rational argument as to why belief with scientific basis and supporting evidence should be held in higher regards than religious belief.

I'd say your argument suffers from some serious bias confirmation.  On the one hand, you ignore the ways in which science really has lent itself to misuse, or qualify them by saying that the people turning them to immoral ends simply aren't scientific enough.  On the other, you misrepresent religious history, making it appear bleaker than it actually is or misattributing responsibility to religion that really should fall on other causal factors.

At any rate, I don't think reference to historical cases will suffice in this case.  What you need is a categorical argument that will explain *why* religion should be more susceptible to misuse than other forms of belief.

""In fact, three Popes (Paul V, Urban VIII and Alexander VII) have officially declared that heliocentrism is opposed to Sacred Scripture, and condemned the notion that heliocentrism was a truth to be believed with certainty. Instead, the Scriptures, the Apostolic Tradition and teachings of the Church support a geocentric cosmology vis-à-vis a heliocentric one.""

&gt; Actually, it could be read either way. Casting out demons to cure sickness v. casting out demons and curing sickness. Either way, medieval Christians weren't using Young's Literal Translation.

Actually, no it cannot. The logical construction of the sentence precludes it.

""he gave to them power over unclean spirits, so as to be casting them out, and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.""

power over unclean spirits is one clause. The descriptions of that power follow in the other two clauses ""so as to be casting them out"" and ""to be healing every sickness, and every malady."" In order for your interpretation to be valid, it would have to be phrased ""he gave to them power, over unclean spirits so as to be casting them out; and to be healing every sickness, and every malady.""


But you're right. In medieval times, they weren't using Young's Literal Translation. Instead, for most of that time, they were using the Vulgate Bible, which was a more-or-less-literal translation from the Greek (which was what the new testament was written in) into Latin. For most of the medieval period, only Latin scholars (usually members of the clergy) read the bible at all - everyone else learned about the bible from them.

Besides, you can look up that passage in the vulgate bible, and translate it into English. It reads pretty much word-for-word identical to Young's Literal Translation.

And no, I don't have to connect jack or shit from any scriptural basis to religious tradition. In fact, when you get right down to it, it's almost irrelevant, because for the entire period from about 500 CE to 1500 CE, there WAS NO western civilization outside the church, practically speaking.

&gt; The mechanical nature of the penis is completely destroyed. In that sense, half of its function is destroyed.

I'm not saying your point here is wrong, but to say that half its function is destroyed shows a little misunderstanding about what the *function* of these things are. I don't have *half* a son, even though I'm circumcised. Still works fine for passing on genes.

So, I'm missing some nerves - quite a few of them. I can believe that, it makes sense. But here's the thing. Sex is *really* fun. I'd be all for it being more fun, if I could go back in time and talk to my parents, but I don't think the difference would be *that* great. There's no way to know, to be sure, but mine is evidently still full of quite a few nerves that work pretty well. And, if I could only go back in time once, I should probably try to stop Hitler or something.

If FGM is usually pretty benign, that's news to me, but I'll believe you. So from an equality perspective, that's one of your strong points.

&gt; exact same reasons

I was shocked, *shocked* in talking to my wife's OB, who brought up circumcision, to find out the typical reason is that people want their son to look like them. Astoundingly retarded (there's that word again), but that seems to be most people's primary reason. It certainly isn't purity, sometimes a contributing factor is cleanliness (although that goes away with education), and I don't think it's a sign of manhood in anyone's eyes that I know of.

&gt; Muslims believe it is a religious practice

[citation needed] but I don't have one either. I've never heard it argued from the Koran or their other texts, but I'm not Muslim. So, I doubt it, but possibly.

I'm completely with you here. Let's point that out to the Christians - it's in Galatians 3, I believe. But they *think* it is, so until we point it out, they're doing it.

&gt; this is still mutilation

I suppose it would have to fit the dictionary definition of mutilation, but every time you call it that, one person will stop listening to you.

Here's the reasons I didn't circumcise my son:
* I spent about 2 days angry with my parents when I first heard all these mutilated penis claims.
* I think permanent body modifications should be decided by adults (earings, tattoos - why the HECK have I ever seen a baby with pierced ears?) so if he wants it done someday (I can't imagine why) he can, but he forever has the option to keep it undone

Since you're having trouble laying hands on a copy, I'll quote some of the relevant material.

&gt; [p. 15] We should, I think, realize what was the intention of many of these scholars if we are to understand their theoretical constructions.  They sought, and found, in primitive religions a weapon which could, they thought, be used with deadly effect against Christianity.

The whole of *The Golden Bough*, a work of immense industry and erudition, is devoted to primitive superstitions.  But it cannot be said that he added much of value to Tylor's theory of religion; rather than he introduced some confusion in the form of two new suppositions, the one pseudo-historical and the other psychological.  According to him, mankind everywhere, and sooner or later, passes through three stages of intellectual development, from magic to religion, and from religion to science, a scheme he may have taken over from Comte's phases, the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive, though the correspondence is far from an exact one. [...] Eventually, says Frazer, the shrewder intelligences probably discovered that magic did not really achieve its ends, but, still being unable to overcome their difficulties by empirical means and to face their crises through a refined philosophy, they fell into another illusion, that there were spiritual beings who could aid them.  In course of time the shrewder intelligences saw that spirits were equally bogus, an enlightenment which heralded the dawn of experimental science.  The arguments in support of this thesis were, to say the least, trivial, and it was ethnologically most vulnerable.  In particular, the conclusions based on Australian data were wide of the mark, and, since the Australians were introduced into the argument to show that the simpler the culture, the more the magic and the less the religion, it is pertinent to note that hunting and collecting peoples, including many Australian tribes, have animistic and theistic beliefs and cults.  It is also evident that the variety, and therefore volume, of magic in their cultures is likely to be less, as indeed it is, than in cultures technologically more advanced; there cannot, for instance, be agricultural magic or magic of iron-working in the absence of cultivated plants and of metals.  No one accepts Frazer's theory of stages today.

By this last sentence, Evans-Pritchard of course means no one in the field of anthropology.  Lay persons are significantly behind state-of-the art when it comes to anthropology, and I've seen the theories of Tylor and Frazer repeated practically verbatim in authors like Dennett and Harris -- that is, in authors who share the Victorian anthropologist's disdain for contemporary organized religion but who haven't kept current on anthropological studies of religion.

The bit about agriculture and iron-working, incidentally, echoes the work of Mircea Eliade, the prominent historian of religion.  In his work in *The Sacred and the Profane* and in *The Forge and the Crucible* he notes that the cultures which produce myths of explanation are almost invariably the cultures that already understand the fundamentals of the natural objects contained in those myths.  For example, in the latter book:

&gt; [p. 34] When we talk of the 'sexualization' of the vegetable world it is necessary to be clear as to the precise meaning of the term.  It is not a question of the actual phenomenon of the fertilization of plants but of a qualitative 'morphological' classification, which is the culmination and expression of mystical sympathy with the world.  It is the idea of life which, projected onto the cosmos, sexualizes it.  It is not a matter of making objective or scientific observations but of arriving at an appraisal of the world around us in terms of life, and in terms of anthropocosmic destiny, embracing sexuality, fecundity, death and rebirth.  Not that men in primitive societies were incapable of objectively observing the life of plants.  The proof of this is the discovery of the artificial fertilization and grafting of date trees and fig trees in Mesopotamia.  These processes had long been known, for at least two paragraphs of the Hammurabi Code legislate on this point.  This practical knowledge was afterwards handed down to the Hebrews and the Arabs.  But the artificial fertilization of fruit trees was not looked upon as a horticultural technique, efficient in itself, but as a ritual ...""

Evans-Pritchard picks up that theme as well.  Tylor and Frazer isolated the early stages of religion (animism for Tylor; the magical and spiritual stages for Frazer) as eras of confusion, in which primitive societies symbolic action for empirical and could not readily distinguish magical and mechanical causation.  The technical skill of primitive man belies all this -- nearly all modern domesticated plants were cultivated before the advent of ancient Greek science, and metallurgy was already in practice by 3000 BCE.  That indicates a high level of instrumental skill, even if it lacks anything as rigorous as modern scientific method.

What Evans-Pritchard and Eliade both recognize in their respective fields is a distinctly religious way of dividing experience into overlapping domains, called by Eliade the Sacred and the Profane.  What is seen under one aspect in the Profane takes on a different cast in the Sacred.  Thus a stone placed in the fork of tree (Evans-Pritchard's example) is seen as an efficacious way to slow the descent of the sun only so long as it's circumscribed in ritual; in any other context it's just a stone.  The religious significance given to metal during ritual in non-operative outside of the ritual -- in the realm of the Profane the metal is an inert substance, subject to the same tendencies we'd expect of any inanimate object.  Paul Veyne, in his book *Did The Greeks Believe In Their Myths?* arrives at similar conclusions in the specific example of Greek myth, and by a different route.

This explanation has run long, I realize, so I'll close with another quotation from Evans-Pritchard discussing classical authors like Tylor and Frazer:

&gt; [pp 5-6] Anthropology was still in its infancy -- it has hardly yet grown up.  Till recently it has been the happy hunting ground of men of letters and has been speculative and philosophical in a rather old-fashioned way.  If psychology can be said to have taken the first steps towards scientific autonomy round about 1860 and not to have rid itself of the trammels of its philosophical past till forty or fifty years later, social anthropology, which took its first steps about the same time, has yet more recently shed similar encumbrances.

&gt; It is a remarkable fact that none of the anthropologists whose theories about primitive religion have been most influential had ever been near a primitive people.  It is as though a chemist had never thought it necessary to enter a laboratory.  They had consequently to rely for their information on what European explorers, missionaries, administrators, and traders told them.  Now, I want to make it clear that this evidence is highly suspect.  I do not say that it was fabricated, though sometimes it was; and such famous travellers as Livingstone, Schweinfurth, and Palgrave were given to gross carelessness.  But much of it was false and almost all of it was unreliable and, by modern standards of professional research, casual, superficial, out of perspective, out of context; and to some extent this was true even of the earlier professional anthropologists.  I say with the greatest deliberation about early descriptions of the simpler peoples' ideas and behaviour, and even more of the interpretations of them put forward, that statements cannot be taken at their face value and should not be accepted without critical examination of their sources and without weighty corroborative evidence.

Needless to say, reading that for the first time several years ago made me rethink a lot of the classical works that I had previously taken without much question as authoritative.",True,t1_c09d045,2,c09d357,1425965229,1241580570,t1_c09d357,0,False,t3_8hum4,t5_2qh39

The first of those Pope wasn't canonized until 1605, more than 60 years after the death of Copernicus.  That means geocentrism wasn't made an official doctrine of Catholicism until more than a generation after the Church had already given its initial support to the heliocentric model.  As I argued above, the Church only set itself against the scientific arguments when it perceived them as the basis for challenges to specifically religious and moral orthodoxy.  So if you're hoping to call those doctrines in as support for the argument that religion is an attempt at explanation, I'm afraid the actual chronology of events leads in the wrong direction.  Rather than supporting your thesis, they point instead to Catholicism's 1600 year lack of interest in astronomical explanations.  The better explanation is that the Church caught on to ways in which Protestant agitators could make a partisan issue of the Copernican model, and declared against it in order to ward off the seduction of its congregation away from Catholicism.

As for your quotation from Young's Literal, your use of a semicolon to separate the two clauses *is* clearer, yes, but that doesn't really change my position on the matter.  Semicolons didn't gain wide usage until the sixteenth century, so an argument from absence would be, in this case, anachronistic.  Beyond which, the sentence as it read *can* grammatically be interpreted as I suggested.  If you don't agree, I suggest taking it to a professional to parsing.

&gt; In fact, when you get right down to it, it's almost irrelevant, because for the entire period from about 500 CE to 1500 CE, there WAS NO western civilization outside the church, practically speaking.

You're wrong about that.  There was, for one thing, a strong feudal strain with heavy roots in Germanic paganism.  This was the point of origin for most of the chivalric and romantic traditions of the era.  Paganism itself survived in the form of folk traditions, of which the Church's constant opposition was evidence.  The Church was continually having to lend its weight against heresies as well, and many of these incorporated older pagan or extra-European traditions.  Spain was, for the nearly the whole of that period, Moorish, and some cultural exchange persisted despite the hostility.  Starting in 1000 CE military engagements in the Middle East brought European culture into contact with Islamic culture -- resulting in exchanges that would eventually re-introduce Europe to classical Greek Platonism and kick start the Renaissance.  Contact with the Byzantine Empire was ongoing, and the Fourth Crusade would further complicate that relationship by paving the way for the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople.  Marco Polo was importing Chinese and Indian culture by the early 14th century.

On the whole your perception of medieval culture seems to be unduly (though understandably) influenced by the interpretation of the Enlightenment historians.

1) Teachers are a very large group. To educate any number of children, you will always need an army of teachers within society. Among these teachers, there will be the usual bell curve of (a) awful (b) average (c) awesome teachers. 

2) Teacher evaluation is one of the hardest things to enforce and determine. Teachers are not directly responsible for the abilities of the students they are in charge of. Too many variables are in play. At the same time, teachers can make a difference in the outcome, but not all outcomes can be ""measured"". Tests are not an accurate measure of education. 

3) Teacher evaluation is the responsibility of principals. They, principals, are usually under fire from three fronts : administration from above with unrealistic goals and government pressure, parents who are just plain irrational on the whole and biased, and teachers who resent arbitrary administration and often weak leadership. 

4) There is no proof that certification leads to better teaching. Educational faculties are notorious for being ideologically bent towards unproven and unprovable educational theories. Teaching is not a science, it's an art and an ability that someone either has or will never acquire. 

**The fundamental issue at hand is not the quality of teachers, but basic societal questions:** 

a) What is education for ? The individual or society. Are we to strive for happy self centred children, or cogs that are selected for a streamed system that benefits the wider societal needs

b) What is education about? Process or knowledge, or what combination of those two aspects of learning? 

As a product of the European system and having worked in the North American system, may I state that the European model is knowledge based, and the North American system is process based. 

The result being : *Europeans students know everything and understand nothing, North American students understand everything and know nothing.*

Having followed Darkfall's progress since they announced the project years ago, having played beta and release, being part of a well-known PvP/PK guild, and being aware of what Darkfall failed to deliver, a 2 out of 10 is a pretty kind score.  

The game design clearly indicates the developers and the publishers can't agree on their target audience, so the ultimate game produced is a contentless, macro treadmill of cookie-cutter avatars with exciting but short spikes of combat fun.

Religion, or religious people in general are not humble, why would you expect atheism to be any different?  In both cases, humans are involved, with all the variety that entails.

&gt; again you are nitpicking and searching desperately for an argument.

This is an immature statement.  Claiming such things doesn't make them so.  Stick to the subject under discussion - if you have a valid argument, your points will make that clear.

*My* point is that your claim of humility as a characteristic of ""true religious"" people, that is somehow more prevalent than it is among atheists, 
 has no basis in fact.  You have yet to attempt to address that point, and instead have been attempting to avoid facing it, so I have to assume you're conceding the point.

It is not nitpicking to point out that the basic premise of your position is false.  It undermines everything you're saying.

For example, the example you raise of some atheists wanting old people to die is certainly not one of humble atheists, there's no question about that.  
But how does this relate to your point?  There are plenty of religious people who are equally aggressive.  These are properties of humans, not of presence or absence of beliefs.  This is the basic fallacy underlying your position - you're assuming some sort of connection that you've made no case for.

&gt; Think about that for just a moment and re-question why people won't trust atheism.

The notion of ""trusting atheism"" is nonsensical.  ""Atheism"" is a word that means lack of belief in deities.  You're making an invalid connection between that position and the behavior of the multitude of individuals who hold it.

&gt; You can not, as a subreddit, claim that xtianity is the cause of all war...

The subreddit does not claim that.  Some individuals in it might, although I think you're exaggerating.

Another problem with your position is that you're talking to a group of diverse people as though they were some sort of unified movement.  They're not.  Atheism is not a replacement movement for religion.

&gt; what you do possess... intelligence.

As atheism grows, there's no reason to expect that the intelligence of atheists will be much greater on average amongst atheists than theists.  This is yet another manifestation of a flaw in your basic position.

&gt; Unfortunately atheists are not humble enough to use it correctly, remaining second rate.

This is another unfounded generalization.  A large proportion of scientists are atheists, for example.  A large proportion of people in many European countries, particularly Scandivanian countries, are atheist.  Are they all ""second rate""?

You need to think your position through more clearly, remove the unwarranted generalizations and connections, and if you find you have any remaining case worth making, make it more precisely.

No it didn't. The fact that Georgia acted as the aggressor and that the initial, contrary position that both the media and politicians stated was incorrect has been acknowledged by both the Media and the politicians concerned (at least in Europe).

&gt;so that's why NATO supported Georgia, because Russians where looting and killing everyone on their route...

No they weren't, as I said, both senior NATO officials and EU politicians have reiterated this, claims made by Georgia that Russia attacked and that Russia committed war crimes have both been shown to be false (claims that Georgia committed war-crimes and killed civilians also appear to be over stated).

&gt;So, Russia likes it or not, Georgia is going to have training on their own territory and let those Russian fear it, nobody cares.

I don't really care what Russia does or doesn't do to Georgia, it is fairly clear that Russia could, if it wanted destroy Georgia, but at a price to its reputation and relationships with the west.  What I am concerned about is NATO embroiling itself in Georgia and Russia's games and brinkmanship.

&gt;Georgians are right - Russians wrong.

In both cases they are acting in their own self interest, Russia is acting rationally, Georgia is acting in a dangerous manner, especially in trying to draw in NATO and the EU.  Neither party can claim or be seen as being right.

&gt;So it's stupid. And no matter how one country interprets actions on 3rd country territory - it can't be in any way justified

Yes it can.  Russia's interests in the region are threatened (rightly or wrongly) as such Russia is being threatened.  This is a bad thing for anyone except possibly some Georgian nationalists.  This situation needs to be dealt with sensibly, not through posturing.  The latter, especially if insanity prevails and Georgia is granted NATO membership, could lead to a dangerous situation where NATO forces are required to defend Georgia from Russian forces, even if that later turns out that the Russian 'attack' was once a gain a defensive move.

How countries view each other and themselves is important, primarily because it is on that basis that they create policy and act.

Because they can't and don't want to interfere in what is an American area of interest.

The 'crimes' that Georgia claimed Russia carried out have been determined to be false.

""*.  The matter was taken up with the Georgian government by the British Foreign Office.

&gt;Soon Russia will have to pay for war crimes

Even if Russia had committed war crimes this is rather unlikely. Given Russia's position on the UN security council it would be almost impossible to make Russia 'pay', even an economic sanctions would be impossible given EU dependence on Russian energy exports.  I should add that it is extremely unlikely that Russia committed the kind of organised war-crimes claimed (although I don't doubt that some Russian troops acted improperly at some point, it would almost be unusual if they didn't).

&gt;it's just Russia's ambitions and not ""safety case"" or ""justified claim"" PERIOD.

No, it is the fact that Russia faces an aggressive neighbour who has already attacked Russian forces once in the hope of getting western support, who is now looking to join an organisation that has consistently acted in an aggressive manner and may require just that kind of response.

There are tradeoffs to be made - doctors and nurses or teachers?  How much do you spend to save a dying baby - is $1m too much, $100m, $1bn?  What about an elderly adult?  Do your answers change if they smoked?  What about if they did rock climbing?  Do you do a liver transplant to someone who is likely to die 6 months later anyway?  

These are really hard questions and all healthcare systems have to address them.  Unfortunately people don't want to.  It is trivial to have no waiting lists, immediate surgery and the best diagnostic equipment but that always comes at a price.  Different countries have picked different points.  For example the UK spends about half what other countries do, and does a pretty good job for the majority of the population.  Other European countries spend more but come closer to 100% of the population.  (In the UK dental and eye stuff are not covered, regular diseases and trauma are treated just fine, more esoteric ones may take longer to diagnose and treat.)

There is also usually a private health system as well for those prepared to pay.  You'll get better rooms, quicker appointments etc - see [BUPA](http://www.bupa.co.uk/about/html/what_we_do/index.html) in the UK.  One Canadian province did try to outlaw any private care hoping the private money would then flow to publicly funded facilities.

If Indian people and white people were of the same proclivity to hunt these things to extinction, then they would have been gone long before white people even landed on the shores.

Just because the very early Indian people hunted some species to extinction very early in their history (all the species stinkypyper named were prehistoric) doesn't mean that the Indian people of 200-400 years ago were the same.

Among other things, I was going to add that multi-lingualism is not necessarily a sign of intelligence and that (although most Americans might not believe it) it is possible to be a dumbass in two or more languages.  Since America is so mono-lingual, we often equate speaking multiple languages with being intellectually superior.  I'm definitely not saying it's bad to speak more than one language but in most cases, it's about exposure to multiple languages.  I'm convinced that virtually everyone could speak 2, 3 or more languages if they were immersed in an environment where it's necessary.

I mean, what's the best way to learn a language?  Move to the place where it's spoken.

Also, it's not like the Europeans all love each other.  Sure, they all share the same currency and they have their EU but it's not like they speak each others' languages because they like each other, it's because they need to be able to understand each other.  For example, how else could you run a business that operates in Spain, Italy, France and Germany?  Of course, you could use English but you'd probably want to know at least a little bit of the languages spoken by your customers/partners.

Also, the fact that you can communicate with so many people in the US with just one language is a blessing as much as it is a curse.  It's convenient to have a universal language.  The fact that it's also a language a chunk of the rest of the world knows is also a plus for us.

&gt;Reality: Seals are not skinned alive. Independent international veterinarians and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts concluded that the suggestions by anti-sealing groups that many seals are skinned alive are not true. In fact, EFSA said in its 2007 report that “it is incorrect to conclude that 42% of the seals in the sample were skinned alive.”

&gt;Sometimes a seal may appear to be moving after it has been killed; however seals show muscle activity (referred to as a ‘swimming reflex’) even after death. This reflex gives the false impression that the animal is still alive– similar to the reflex in chickens.

&gt;Recent changes to the Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) will enhance the humaneness of the annual seal hunt. These changes include the three-step process (stunning, checking, and bleeding the seals); and require sealers to verify death and animals being bled for a minimum of one minute prior to skinning.

a9bejo,9,gaming,0,0,False,,,,"&gt;This means that every 4 years, the bare minimum a &gt;console would last you, you are spending $800-$1000. 

Nonesense! I keep track of all my gaming expenses, hardware as well as software.  I invest 300,- in gaming every 4 years, when I buy a new computer, and 100,- more after 2 years for a new graphics card (Thats $ as well as EUR, since both hardware and software is usually much more expensive in Europe).

That's 100,- per year for hardware. And the only reason you come to a higher price is because you add the price for the whole pc to the calculation!  Seriously, that's complete nonesense. Do you count your TV and the rent to your flat into console gaming cost? 

I used to have a PS2, did not play any games on the PC for 4 years, and I still had to pay 500,- every 4 years to get a new PC (By the way: I do not have a TV or a high-fi system. I have a PC instead).

Then, xbox live membership is another 60 Euro/$80 each year just to play games with people.

Then, software costs. Here is my data for 2008/09 (in Euro): 

* Avg price/game: 12.89
* Median price/game: 5
* Most expensive game: 49.9
* cheapest game: 2.5

Now, you can buy older games for consoles as well, but because the console market is regulated, there is less competition. The result is that the prices are higher, and there are no bargain deals like on the PC. On PC, a good 2 year old game with good reviews can be bought for $5. Games that sell well for $45 are expected to come with a very good multi year service, including lots of content at no additional costs. On the console, you even have to pay for maps.

I like PCs for many reasons, but the most honest reason why I'm using them is because gaming is dead cheap. And I'm proud to be a cheap ass gamer.

&gt;A lot of people I know have a strong aversion to &gt;taking a step backwards in terms of graphics, but I &gt;think the industry as a whole would benefit from it.


I don't have an aversion against that step backward, and I agree that this step is necessary.  What I'm saying is that most PC gaming companies are already on board.

killerstorm,0,Economics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt; Our bankers aren't on strike, but they are certainly being paid by the state. They just threaten economic doom instead of striking.

they were not paid, they recieved loans or sold part of their business.

also, we are apeaking about European Union, afair they had much less bailouts there.

&gt; Assuming the economy continues to worsen, and it will, then the government defaulting on payments is extremely likely.

you should distinguish debts denominated in national currency and debts denominated in something else. 

it is extremely unlikely for a country to default on their national currency debts, as they can create any amount of it at will.

it is another thing when they have to pay with some other currency or commodities, as they have real value.

Weimar Republic payed reparations denominated in gold, therefore they had huge payment deficit and eventually had to default.

rather than just looking on debts, you should look on payment and trade balance -- that is what can cause default and high inflation. if you produce little but buy a lot, you have a problem: first, national currency will get devalued, then it can cause a default. note that it is self-regulating system: overconsumption causes national currency devaluation, which curbs consumption (people can buy less stuff for same money) and props up exports, as they become relatively cheaper.

EU has somewhat negative trade balance, but it is rather low relative to GDP (largest in the word, by the way). by no means it can cause _hyper_inflation, that would require major destruction of european economy. and slight deficit is not a problem at all -- if it goes too far, euro will get slightly devalued, they'll have more exports and less imports, and balance will be restored.

&gt; I'm not sure what you meant by ""they can demand it back"" anyway - we are the borrowers not the lenders.

there is no ""we"". there is a central bank which lends money. and there is a treasury that borrows money. what treasury does is mostly irrelevant to discussion, as it is central bank who manages money supply.

modern central banks have lots of tools how they can affect money supply -- from selling papers, to rising reserve requirements, to just stopping refinancing so banks will have to return money after term ends. they essentially can do whatever they want with money.

&gt; If fighting inflation was as simple as ""take the money back"" then inflation never would have been a problem to any nation throughout history.

inflation itself is never a root problem, in modern history, at least. the root problem can be a lack of economic growth, budget deficit, negative trade balance etc. inflation is more like a solution how to go through hard times. central bank can choose to curb inflation, but consequences might be bank failures and further economic slowdown.

There are two things going on in this movie: 

On the surface, it's a high speed chase film. The main character spends a majority of the movie running for his life; the guys chasing him are trying to fuckin' kill him. He's tired, wounded and running through the jungle armed with nothing but his smarts.

&gt;No, you don't. You are standing up for attacking one group for their speech and forgiving Holocaust deniers on free speech grounds. That was why you stepped into this discussion.

..

&gt;Denying something happened.. and calling for the death of all people of a certain ethnicity.


&gt;I can see how that works...

..

&gt;What in the world are you taking about? Are you now saying that Holocaust denial is an acceptable position because some people (I have no idea who, but it is your strawman) have turned it into a "" a one size fits all rebuttal for all arguments""?


Pretty much, it's used as justification for the creation of Israel, is often referred to as what happens when anti-semetism becomes popular, etc, etc. Sorry for the straw man argument but honestly the argument that holocaust denial is the same thing as calling for genocide is quite ridiculous.


&gt;That is utter nonsense. The countries of Europe did not make Holocaust denial illegal to protect Israel. They passed those laws when there was no Israel.

Oh that's right, I forgot, holocaust denial is a crime in Europe. I wonder if denying any other genocides is illegal in Europe? I can deny the darfur genocide that is presently ongoing, I can deny Armenian genocide but I cannot deny Hitlers genocide. How very emotionally created and politically kept.


&gt;Bullshit. This is like creationism, not flat Earth. **There has been plenty of ""open discussion"" of the topic**, the evidence is in and clear.

No there hasn't, especially in Europe, you know why? Because Holocaust denial is a crime in Europe.


&gt;There is no valid historical issue here. But since you have political sympathy with the deniers you will help them.

It is not about validity, it's about free speech and hypocrisy, it's about the political nature of history and how the holocaust is no longer a factual reality but rather an emotional one.

And for the record I don't have political sympathy for skinheads and I'm not a fan of trying to prove I'm right using raw emotion, in fact I condemn it. Holocaust deniers don't help my agenda at all (in fact they hurt it) but I'd rather see them freely deny the holocaust than be thrown in jail for it. Holocaust deniers cannot forever be cast aside as lunatics, in the end people will start warming up to their views in the ways I've detailed in my previous comments and it won't be a pretty day because of its implications.

&gt;So that you Nazis can continue to push you agenda?

Given if the Nazis had their way I'd probably never have been born I find that to be quite hilarious.


&gt;But censoring anti-Arab ideas, that is fine by you. It is a good thing you are not agenda driven, right?

If someone got up and said 'Saudi Arabia oppresses women and its government should be over thrown' I wouldn't have a single problem with that (for a variety of reasons), if someone said 'kill the Arabs' well, that's suspect to say the least, I'm as against kill the Arabs as I am kill the Jews 'free speech'.",True,t1_c09g45g,1,c09g6p6,1425967042,1241884948,t1_c09g6p6,0,True,t3_8ivyb,t5_2qhvo

a) you want to use a weapon for hunting - this means you almost never carry it with you and usually it is not adapted to shootouts (no repetition, slow reload etc); this is already possible in all western countries

b) you want to use the gun for protection - this isn't a good idea because most of the time the attacker will not have a gun, but only a knife or no weapon so if you lose your cool you'll end in jail; plus most people aren't cold hearted enough to deal with a similar situation without causing a great deal of harm for a simple robbery 

c) if an attacker pulls a gun on you he will almost surely be prepared to shoot you, so now the defense theory transforms into a contest of who is a better shot even if at the beginning the gun was to be used for intimidation only; again, this will not help the average Joe as the attacker WILL be a better shot and he will now fight for his life

No I'm not opposed to the existence of Israel.

Think of it this way: What is the result of free speech if its carried out to its fullest in real life: In one case it's that the holocaust will be removed from the history books, in the other it's that there would be a killing of people of a certain ethnicity.

I won't say you're so pro-Israel that you don't see how obvious it is, instead I'm just going to call you out on your hypocrisy, calling me out on a straw man argument then using one against me.

Ever bodies fault who allowed it to be like this.

Even in the US open discussion has never been really allowed. People have even tried to take asylum in the US because they'd be put in prison in Europe. I can talk about creationism all I want without being deported from the US, why can't I have another wacky theory?

Since the discussion is limited, especially in Europe, there is a lot of contradictions going on historically which historians themselves are probably afraid to correct because they fear imprisonment.

I can't remember names but a historian in German was put in prison for saying the Auchwitz gas chamber was re-built after World War 2, he was put in Prison because that is apparently holocaust denial. In fact one of the people who wanted to testify in his favor, [Dr. Franciszek Piper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciszek_Piper),  was not allowed by the judge.

Another issue when actual open discussion is banned, of course I have no problem with people calling for the death of Jews being thrown in prison as that is a different thing entirely.

I came here to defend free speech, I've never defended holocaust deniers.

mantra,7,technology,0,0,False,,,,"It depends.  The body handling this is the ITU (International Telecommunications Union).  This article is pretty good in terms of an overview of legal structures and definitions.

http://www.trp.hku.hk/e_learning/spectrum/section1.html

The allocates can and often do differ at an ITU region level (there are 3 regions) and sometimes at a national level (though this is rare).  The above link has a ""Hong Kong"" spectrum allocation chart.  If you compare it an FCC US spectrum allocation, you'll see much is the same (especially in the far-propagatin low frequency sections) but there are also differences.  Some are ITU-region dependent but some are specifically HK-unique.

The world-wide allocations of transworld propagating frequencies are not even uniform.  The US has always had more amateur radio (ham) bands than the rest of the world so there are some frequencies shortwave radio that are commercially allocated for Europe but ""shared, accepting interference"" for ham radio.

The biggest issue in allocation is interference (or its avoidance). Part of this is technology: analog modulation schemes have relatively low thresholds for interference (SSB is the worst, then AM, then FM and last being CW [morse code]).  Digital modulation generally has error correction, and can use spread spectrum techniques which reduce sensitivity to interference.

Perfect immunity to interference is a physical impossibility and not all services using spectrum are valued the same for interference. Military uses are generally held superior to commercial users which are held superior to amateur uses.  Similarly there is a power and structure hiearachy as well.  And finally there are different causes, effects and risks for interference depending on a numebr of factors.

The primary technical factor to interference is propagation: some frequencies only travels short distances at a given power level while others only need a whisper and can go around the world several times.  

The latter are shortwaves (3 MHz - 30 MHz).  Most of the ITU justification for existence was from back in the day before satellites when most international telecoms were *only* sea cable or shortwave radio.  Satellites didn't really take over until well into the 1970s (I remember TV still mentioned ""by satellite"" into the 1980s as it was something really novel"".

Others like UHF and Microwaves, only go a short distance - this feature is used expressly for cellular telephone where the design itself relies on poor propagation defining cell boundaries.  802.11 standards are relatively unregulated because of similar propagation limits combined with modulation schemes (spread spectrum) that are more inherently interference resistant even with multiple occupancy on the same frequencies.

The second factor is power levels.  Put enough power into any EM signal and it will go as far you can afford power - it might fry everything in its path but at some frequencies a little power goes a long way.  The shortwave above, for instance.

100-200 MHz is low VHF which has propagation distances in between shortwave and microwave.  You don't get the ionospheric reflections that enable shortwave to go all around the world but you do get diffraction effects that enable propagation beyond the visible horizon.  FM radio is 88 MHz to 108 (in the western hemisphere).  In Europe you'll find the FM band spans a slightly different range of frequencies.  This is one of the region-different allocations.

BTW you learn all this stuff (technical and legal) to get various levels of ham radio license.

Before the internet, ham radio was the closest approximation to ""people power"" communication that existed.  Getting a ham license was more or less the same as getting at connection to the internet.  The internet is more egalitarian - in radio the crazies were mostly relegated to CB bands while ham radio had much of the decorum and erudition of the arpanet and pre-commercial internet.

&gt;Sri Lanka's military expenditure increased from 0.75 billion Sri Lanka rupees in 1977 to a budgeted 139.6 billion for the year 2007 - an almost two hundred fold increase. During the same period, foreign aid to Sri Lanka has kept pace with Sri Lanka's increasing military expenditure. It is not simply  that  Sri Lanka's economy is structurally dependent on foreign aid - it is also that that dependency shows a clear in built increasing trend.

&gt;Without foreign aid, Sri Lanka would not have been able to continue its genocidal war against the Tamil people - and it may well have found the need to talk with the people of Tamil Eelam on an equal basis and structure a polity where the two peoples, the Sinhala people and the Tamil people, may associate with each other  in equality and in freedom. And foreign aid has been forthcoming because each 'aid donor' is intent on securing its own strategic interests in the Indian Ocean region - and this is true, whether the aid donor is the US, the EU,  India or China.

&gt; ""Didn't you read the article?""

I don't form my opinions by reading someone else's ideas. I did brush over that list of things. It seems to me, to be mostly an excercise in hyperbole. I can see that writing style a mile off, having grown up and lived my whole life in the Usa - which is steeped in that kind of public discourse.

&gt; ""...whereas if you go to a National rally, you'll see that they attract one type of person and one type only--the cold and conservative white middle and upper class, mainly business-owners. They held a rally at my high school once, in a part of New Zealand with a fairly typical Maori and Polynesian population, but not a single brown face did I see in the audience.""

*""...high school...""*? - Do you mean secondary school? Isn't that called ""college"" in New Zealand?

*""Cold""* is a perception of the observer, rather than a character quality of the person being described.

*""Business owners""*  Yes, of course - the right wing in all english speaking nations caters to business owners. Their proposition is that by creating a better environment for trade and business - they create a higher standard of living for everybody in that country; and there is a lot of truth in that. It is true that ""the best things in life are free"" - but a lot of important things in life are the result of trading our goods and services. Do you disagree?

*""...not a single brown face...""* That's troubling. A political party which forms a government needs to be catering to the interests and concerns and approaches to life of the entire scope of the citizenry of that country. However, from what I've heard, the Maori party has formed a reasonably secure alliance with National (snubbing Labour, and the chance to gain power through being part of an opposition coalition?). From reading John Key's face as he has spoken about that agreement with the Maori party - I see nothing but constructive attitudes in him, there.

&gt; ""National could only give a damn about business-owners. National, in times of crisis, never fails to immediately go running to the business associations asking what they, as a government, can do to protect New Zealand's ""best interests"". ""

And one of the best propositions I've seen in recent weeks, has been this nine-day working fortnight proposition. In contrast, both republican and democratic administrations in the usa have been hocking the future of our country across the Pacific, by tossing billions at their cronies in the banking and auto industries. As a program, the nine-day fortnight proposal is very small - almost nonexistent. But as an idea, it sets an excellent precedent. We, in ethnically european nations would be wise to adopt a lighter work ethic. We become time-starved, as a people; and time, of course, is the thing which life is made of. I remember one day I saw [a humourous video featuring Bill Gates](http://www.break.com/index/bill-gates-last-day-of-work.html) which showed his staff what he was going to do with all his time after he retired. And what I saw in that presentation, was a person who may be one of the richest people in the world, but who, over most of his life, would have had no time at all to pursue all of his many aspirations. I thought it quite sad, actually.


&gt; If you talk to a typical Nat-voter, you will typically find that either they or their dad (they always get it from their fathers) ran a business at some point, and have a strange complex whereby they believe that they were the only ones doing any work for the country.

I agree that some of the most important contributions to society are those things which do not net someone monetary return. That's been the story of the last few years of my life, actually. However, it's also true, that to make a fair and egalitarian society, we have to provide a way forward for people who do those kinds of things to also make a reasonable living for themselves. Right wing parties tend to want to help others to help themselves, whereas left wing parties tend to offer handouts. Both approaches are important. But I'll tell you that poor people in the Usa, at least, tend to appreciate assistance in moving forward in their lives, more than the situation where they are stuck in a continual state of having to rely on the dole. Getting on your feet is a long term solution, and with it comes with a lot more personal dignity.

It exists currently (See [Amendment 7 of the U.S. Constitution](http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/whuscons/whuscons.htm#7th-amend)). The law of the land states that the 'seat of the government' (10 square miles) is the territory of the 'Federal Government of the United States' - if you live there, you live in Maritime law, under direct Admiralty to the Federal Government. However, if you do not live there, you are not under Maritime law, but rather under Common law, or otherwise called 'God's Law'.

Living under 'Common Law' means _only_ what the U.S. Constitution states is _law_. If you sign a contract with the federal government (which you do if you get a drivers license, S.S. card, etc) then you can surrender those rights, but otherwise, you are protected.

What all this means is that, among many other things, I am not obligated by the law of the land to, for instance, pay taxes to the Fed. I have signed _no_ contract in which I pledge to pay any tax - and it is _certainly_ not specified in the Constitution.

Anyways, the idea behind the movement is exactly the same as it was 300 years ago. There exists a 'naturally imbued' set of 'inalienable rights', such as private property, the right to bear arms, the right to travel freely, the freedom to speak and publish, the right to sign contracts with fellow men, and the right to have such contracts (public and private) ordained and enforced under the law.

We Common Law Americans (as we like to fashion ourselves) believe that we do not need a complex, corporate, and commercial merchant law in our everyday lives. Rather, we believe in the power of the Constitution, and that we, as the American People, have the right and responsibility to protect ourselves from foreign interests (the Federal Government, being literally a foreign state, is a 'foreign interest').

Another core tenant of Common Law is self-representation. Trials would be set to an even keel if people had to defend themselves (of course, lawyers could still give council, but just not a defence).

While much has been harped up about how un-modern Dubai is and how it is mainly a facade of modernity, from my experience having recently moved back here from Scotland, I find it to be the most culturally open society in the Middle East. Yes, you will find alot of retardation within single units of families, however there doesn't exist the same sort of societal pressures that usually hamper women in the middle east.

A central part of the Scandinavian legal tradition is that the courts on some levels are presided over by one or more ""professional"" judges with legal training and one or more ""lay judges"".

It's not a jury in the US or UK sense (Norway at least have juries *too* at some levels in the legal system - I don't know about Sweden), as they deliberate *together* with the judge, and they decide both matters of law *and* matters of guilt (where in jury trials in the form used in most countries with legal systems based on common law, the judge decides matters of law and the jury matters of guilt), though the professional judge(s) tend to have rights to overrule the lay judges in extreme cases of failure to follow the law in deciding the case.

This distinction is important, because the professional judges to a large extent have ""the upper hand"", and so it can *not* be assumed that a case with lay judges / co-judges is equivalent to a jury trial - it is *not*. In a US style jury trial the judge does not get to hear and influence the deliberations, while in a Scandinavian style trial with lay judges the professional judge has the advantage of formal legal training, and a biased professional judge could to a large extent push the lay judges around by referring to the law.

First of all you will never ever get the yield you could potentially get from an HID, but there are quite a few benefits.


Benefits for detection evasion:
- Virtually no heat footprint
- You can grow in the worlds smallest spaces (Fixtures take up 2 inches, no heat)
- Less power consumption, you can grow 20 plant SOG under three 45 watt fixtures


Benefits for your wallet:
- Less power consumption.
- Less cooling investment.
- You don't ever have to replace them.


Downsides:
- Yield.  The maximum you're going to get is about 3/4 of what you could get with an HID.
- Documentation.  There really is not that much you can find on LED growing.


I agree with mikec23 about the internodal spacing, however you can get CRAZY small spacing just by moving the LED fixture lower, you don't necessarily have to buy an HID.  The guy I know uses 45 watt LED fixtures (http://www.shop.sunshine-systems.com/product.sc?productId=10) and can get nodes less than 1mm apart depending on how close you bring the LEDs.  LEDs hardly generate heat, so do not be afraid to bring your fixture down... Although I must say you will probably want nodes bigger than 1mm, having tiny spacing is great after your clones have rooted, because you can force the plants to be bushier later on in life.  However to really get enough energy from LEDs your going to have to keep them at most 30cm away from the canopy.

After looking through your setups I think you should probably try SOG of SCROG.  The problem with LED's is that they work best when the light emission beam angle is very small. If your going to build your own like you have, make sure you keep the angle under 45 degrees per bulb. I recommend between 15 and 30 degrees, and just getting more bulbs of lower intensity, because collectively they will be stronger.  The rule of thumb here is the smaller the degrees and the closer the bulbs are together, the higher the intensity over the area.  Higher intensity will lead to smaller nodes. In your setup, you grew a few plants at a medium height, therefore only the tops are getting good lighting.  With a SOG or SCROG setup, you can put your lights close and get more yield because essentially all of your top leaves (which are the only ones that matter in SOG) will be getting tons of light.  Close lights will make plenty of nodes, which in turn will give you plenty of bud-sites, which is a good thing even if your only expecting small amounts from each of them.

Because LED's are easier to use on SOG or SCROG, its naturally more designed for indica growth.  However a properly managed sativa SCROG would work if you kept the nodes short and used a few less plants.  It looks like your broad leaved plants did much better on your setup, which sort of validates my point.  A lot of people recommend putting LED's on the side if you're going to grow tall sativas, otherwise the light simply won't penetrate low enough because of the tiny light emission beam angle.  

Blue &amp; Red spectrum targeting DOES work very well.  Just make sure your LED's are the right wavelengths. Your plants need both types of chlorophyl, thats why you usually see double the red LEDs (also blue LEDs technically are more intense) http://i44.tinypic.com/107kjo6.jpg

Go Hydro or Aero... Especially since yield is a concern, soil just isn't going to cut it for LEDs.  As much as it sucks to maintain one, you will be much more likely to reach that 3/4 of an HID yield with hydroponics or aeroponics.

Do you believe this because it's God's truth, or because it helps you sleep at night? I would think that, as a Christian, if the word of God isn't entirely clear, you would strive to find the most truth, not just the view that is most convenient. Sure, an ""age of accountability"" sounds nice, but the fact is still that they haven't explicitly accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. If there are gray areas with children, there can be gray areas with adults as well. I don't know, I guess I'm just tired of ""these parts are gray, these parts are black-and-white"" kind of arguments from ""every day"" Christians. It's all too convenient, _for them_.

&gt;IF God exists, which you say you have nothing against the concept, just no ""proof"" that suffices for you, then do you really think a being that is capable of creating and sustaining the universe is subject to your (or my!!) limited evaluation?

I don't need to completely understand God, but a single shred of evidence that he exists at all would surely be very nice. I'm not asking much here. I could settle for a ""crocoduck"" :)

&gt;If that's true then consider that God has revealed Himself through Scripture

That is a claim made by men, nothing more. Men also wrote the bible, which is what's claimed to be the word of God. Surely, you don't expect me to just _believe_ the bible is holy, do you?

&gt;I can understand someone accepting Hinduism since it offers such a stark contast to Christianity.

Admittedly I don't know much about Hinduism, but I don't think I've heard a single accounts of someone converting willingly to that religion. To me it seems to be a largely cultural thing, you're either born a Hindu, or you're not.

The committee's leader, Amin al-Husseini, relocated abroad and his organization continued to serve in exile as the Arab Palestinians' internationally recognized leadership. (As an aside, notice that this is very similar to what occurred years later when Yasser Arafat's PLO became the Arab Palestinians' leadership-in-exile.)

&gt; On September 26, 1937, the British district commissioner of Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, was assassinated in Nazareth. This caused Britain to take action the following day including the outlawing of the Arab Higher Committee and the arrest of several of its members. Amin al-Husayni managed to escape arrest and went into exile.

&gt; By mid-1946, when the committee moved to Cairo due to Amin al-Husayni's exile from the British Mandate for Palestine and then from Europe (he had spent the war trying to get aid for the Palestinian cause from Hitler), membership had dwindled to just Jamal al-Husayni (acting chairperson), Husayn al-Khalidi (secretary), Ahmad Hilmi Pasha and Emile al-Ghury.[1] But at the beginning of 1947 the AHC was expanded to include the four remaining core members plus Hasan Abu Sa'ud, Izhak Darwish al-Husayni, Izzat Darwaza, Rafiq al-Tamimi and Mu'in al-Madi. This restructuring of the AHC to include additional supporters of Amin al-Husayni was seen as a bid to increase his political power (Khalaf, 1991, p. 129-130).

It clearly demonstrates that in 1947, the UN recognized the Arab Higher Committee as the official representative of the Palestinian Arabs, essentially the Arab counterpart to the Jewish Agency. The Higher Committee's vice president Jamal Husseini addressed the committee on the Arabs's behalf; the Jewish Agency's former president Chaim Weizmann spoke on the Jews' behalf.

When Las Vegas was incorporated as a city on March 16, 1911 the city was only 18 square miles and had about 800 residents.
Today Las Vegas is 84 square miles in area and is home to over 500,000 people, while Clark County's population is approaching two million.
Many Casino's have restaurants that offer specials that aren't listed anywhere on the menu. You have to know about them and ask about them by name to receive them.
A good example of this is the ""steak dinner"" at Ellis Island. You get a complete meal for only $4.95 but only if you remember to ask for it by name.
A lot of people are wary about how casino comp cards work. Casino's offer them to determine who they're going to give their best comps to. The more you lose the more you get. They do this to try to keep the big spenders loyal to the casino they're at and generally not for any other purposes(e.g. selling mailing lists). If you play a slot machine or other electronic gaming device you insert the card in the designated slot and it tabulates points based on how much you lose at the machine. To earn points at table games you give your card to the dealer when you sit down. A floor supervisor or pit clerk will come by, get the card and then swipe it at a computer terminal. The player is listed in the computer until they leave the table. Occasionally the amount the player is betting at a given time will be updated to allow the computer to more accurately award points.
The city is home to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. It's classified in the Doctoral/Research University-Intensive category by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. UNLV is home to 27,000 students and is rapidly growing. It currently offers about 200 degree programs.

I wonder who these ""consultants"" really are? By threatening shipping they threaten the oil supply routes to the world. Germany, Japan, and many other countries have to respond militarily in order to protect the oil shipping route through the Suez.

...and this is the kicker...these ""pirates"" are nothing more than part of plan to bottle up the resources in the middle east and central asia, diverting their flow to Israel away from Russia and China. A great defensive circle around the grand prize.

Other parts of the puzzle (circle): because we now have a ""missle shield"" threatenng Russia and Iran, strategically stationed in eastern Europe...NGO color-coded ""revolutions"" in Poland and the Ukraine, which can block NG flows to western Europe; the attack on south Ossetia, the so-called ""war on terror"" inflaming all of muslim, oil-rich middle east and central asia; Israel about to bomb Iran any second, closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz (Iranian oil); with Pakistan now being torn apart; with India, hoping to get water and oil from Kashmir and central asia, being subjected to a false-flag attack in Mumbai, and now facing nuclear war with the patsy Pakistan and its ally China...all of this basically threatens to cut the oil and NG pipelines off to the world, China and Russia, not to mention creating the potential for destroying the world (except for Israel).

Indeed, this is a miraculous chain of ""circumstances"". It is an amazing coincidence, because if things get real bad, if the oil and NG does get bottled up by these miraculous circumstances, we SURE are lucky Israel is just sitting there, waiting, to get all of that blocked oil and NG gas flowing to its terminal in Haifa, as it is the only viable route remaining:

EU makes waaay better predictions than gravity only cosmology.  Gravity cosmology has to be constantly patched and updated to get predictions right, like it's microsoft software or something (Inflation added to the big bang, black holes with charges or anti-matter jets, etc.).

There is no known two body solution to relativity.  Nor has anyone proved that such a solution even exists.  Every actual solution is a vacuum field solution, and thus there is no way to talk about a relativistic interaction between two objects.

Other parts of the puzzle (circle): because we now have a ""missle shield"" threatenng Russia and Iran, strategically stationed in eastern Europe...NGO color-coded ""revolutions"" in Poland and the Ukraine, which can block NG flows to western Europe; the attack on south Ossetia, the so-called ""war on terror"" inflaming all of muslim, oil-rich middle east and central asia; Israel about to bomb Iran any second, closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz (Iranian oil); with Pakistan now being torn apart; with India, hoping to get water and oil from Kashmir and central asia, being subjected to a false-flag attack in Mumbai, and now facing nuclear war with the patsy Pakistan and its ally China...all of this basically threatens to cut the oil and NG pipelines off to the world, China and Russia, not to mention creating the potential for destroying the world (except for Israel).

Indeed, this is a miraculous chain of ""circumstances"". It is an amazing coincidence, because if things get real bad, if the oil and NG does get bottled up by these miraculous circumstances, we SURE are lucky Israel is just sitting there, waiting, to get all of that blocked oil and NG gas flowing to its terminal in Haifa, as it is the only viable route remaining:

In addition to the strategic position the Horn of Africa provides Israel, Israel and the US has another reason for insinuating itself into the Horn of Africa, they also have designs on the water supply of the Nile:

Israel is also supplying weaponry to the Darfur rebels, another area rich in oil on the Horn:

mangadi,5,AskReddit,0,0,False,,,,"Well, lets start with cereals; they are arguably the most important crop for domestication.  Egypt was famous for being the ancient world's breadbasket due to its grain production; Alexander, Rome, they all needed Egypt to sustain their empires.  Even in modern times, the first thing we send to starving nations is wheat.  The food pyramid suggests that you take 6-12 servings of grains a day, thereby consistuting the largest portion of your daily diet.  With that said, the only indigenous cereal in the Americas was corn.  Even then, corn does not match the nutritional value provided by wheat, barley, and other cereals present in Eurasia.  

The fossil record shows that Americans did domesticate corn, but it was only in southwest Mississippi.  

Compared with the dozens (if not hundreds) of empires that arose in Eurasia, American only offered 3: the Mayans, the Incas, and the Aztecs.  I'm not sure what their food sources were, but lets take the case of the Aztecs.  Most historians agree that this was the mightest of the three, however it came into existence around 1400, a mere 150 or so years before Pizarro (or was it Cortez, always mix them up) wiped them out.  The Aztecs only recently introduced to population densities, did not have time to develop resistance to disease.  Nor did they have animals to aid them in this quest.

Actually, for me at least, Diamond provides a very convincing argument of the geographical benefit of the Eurasian landmass.  First consider its major axis, it's horizontal.  What this means is that crops developed in the Middle East can easily be adapted to Spain France, and Italy due to the fact that they all share a similar climate.  Furthermore, the landmass, due to its size, statistically it had a greater number of animals and plants that could be domesticated.  Finally, Eurasia has a few geographical barriers (unlike the Isthmus of Panama and the desert in South America) , ideas can easily move around from one place to another.  Consider this, the Aztecs and the Incas never had any contact (or perhaps I should say significant) even though they were only separated by a few hundred miles.  But even the French knew about China, and that is around an 8000 mile gap! (I'm guessing the distance, don't have an atlas, but regardless it's huge!).

If you think about it, Europeans only migrated (not colonized) places where they could take their own crops.  In other words, places that had similar climates.  There are Europeans in South Africe (nowhere else in as large numbers in the African continent), Europeans settled in the coastal regions of Australia becuase they their crops are suitable for the climate of eastern Australia.  And Europeans came to America.

I'm not sure if American crops suddenly experienced a boom just due to a European presence.  Evidence states that first Europeans brought their own crops to the New World.  Of course eventually in their free time they began to try to domesticate local fauna due to the techniques they had learned over millenia.

Finally, Diamond does look at the fossil record for animals that would've been useful for domestication: animals that weigh over 100 lbs.  Perhaps an aribtrary number, but understandable if you realize that a beast needs to have signifcant mass if it is to do any labor.  The Americas do have a few large animals, bison, bears, and deer come readily to mind.  But then what Diamond does is that he studies the animal psychology of these animals, whether they like being in large groups, are they carnivorous, etc.  After studying their temperaments the only two animals that are suitable for domestication are dogs (10000 Bc) and llamas (4000 BC as you point out).  Even today, we haven't been able to domesticate bears, bison, deer, cougars, coyotes, wolves, etc.  Look at Africa, a plethora of large game roam there, but due to their temperaments, wildebeest, buffalo, hippos, zebras, giraffes, lions, gazelles, antelopes, and so many others can't be domesticated...even in modern times.

Read the book ;).  You'd be surprised as to the great deal of thought he's put into it and I think he answers several of the questions you put forth.  He provides a basic formula for understanding human history that I've been able to apply to every part of the world.  Granted it omits the ""greatness"" of people, and some people find that troubling.  But as a large entity, it really allows you to understand how the planet go to where it is today.  I've found this formula very helpful in understanding the difficulties people face around the world: from the Near East to Africa (fine small range, but this is what hte news focuses on).

While that sounds wonderful and seems to make sense, there is very little proof for domestic origins.   

Increasingly, phylogenetic analyses of human pathogens seem to show that these diseases are older than ~10,000 years ago.  See this [Pearce-Duvet 2006](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=455539) article for a great review.  

Diamond focused on epidemic, mostly viral, infections (smallpox, measles, etc) that could not proliferate in foraging groups at current levels of virulence.  Europeans had them, Amerindians didn't, so Amerindians died.

Pathogens evolve.  For example, just because smallpox as we know it would, and did, burn through small foraging populations we have no idea what an ancestral smallpox (if there was such a thing) acted like before humans settled.  Our transition to agriculture could have relaxed constraints on virulence because the virus could now easily pass between people without running out of hosts.  

There are multiple different explanations for disease emergence.  I think Diamond fixated on one possibility (domestic origins) and applied it to explain all of human history.  ",True,t1_c09jl43,2,c09jlvz,1425969288,1242234710,t1_c09jlvz,0,False,t3_8k0r6,t5_2qh1i

&gt; Whoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or belittles an act committed under the rule of National Socialism of the type indicated in Section 6 subsection (1) of the Code of Crimes against International Law, in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine.

So up to five years in jail or a fine (not sure of the amounts involved but I remember cases where people were fined ca. 50.000 Euros).

I share your doubts about the legitimacy of criminalizing thought in a modern democracy. On the other hand, I can also see some sense in the reasoning. Here's my own translation of the reasons given by the German Supreme Court in denying a motion to dissolve the law (April 1994):

&gt; Holocaust denial does not fall under the constitutionally granted Right of Freedom of Speech; rather, it is a statement of fact which has been conclusively proven to be false based on countless eye witness accounts and documents,  assessments/appraisals by the courts in criminal trials, and the findings of the science of history. In itself, an allegation of such content does not warrant protection under the Right of Freedom of Speech.

[Case # 1 BvR 23/94]

I can see the point in that: It's 100% clear and proven that the Holocaust happened, we know a great many details about it and thus, to deny it is not really a matter of opinion. Just like it's not a matter of opinion whether the attack on Pearl Harbor happened or not.

It's an interesting dilemma. Personally, I'd tend towards *not* having such laws, because I'm wary of the ""what next?/where will it end?"" situation regarding cuts into the fundamental values of a human rights/personal freedom oriented democracy. But it's also important to understand that the whole Nazi mess still has its impact on German society today, and the reasoning behind such laws (which also include the prohibition of Nazi symbols or literature like ""Mein Kampf"" outside of educational or historical/documentary contexts) is to prevent a fascist totalitarian regime from taking over again by cutting at the roots of that kind of thought by *officially* not giving legitimacy to people who belittle the crimes of Hitler and his followers.

I am *happy* that at least part of the tax I paid in Holland (and now in the UK) goes to poorer countries that need it. Why?

The whole thing is awkward. The three-strikes concept loses all of its credibility without judicial weight behind the assertion of guilt; but, to involve the courts in every case places far too much weight on the judicial system. There isn’t any way around it in our traditional legal framework, which is why everyone’s commenting on the legislation without offering any alternatives.

...

In many ways, the two legal situations compare very well. Where I live, red light cameras confer a fine - but no legal penalty. This is a nod to the fact that anyone could be driving a vehicle captured by camera, but that ultimately its the vehicle owner’s responsibility to choose who they give access to the vehicle, what they do with it, and who pays a fine. Should someone receiving a camera ticket wish to dispute it, they can do so via the traditional court system. An internet equivalent would acknowledge the responsibility of the owner of an IP address (the account holder), without assuming that they are the individual actually doing the downloading (driving).

The key difference is that France’s internet law involves disconnection - akin to the police seizing your car after three camera tickets even though its your kid driving it. That’s the part that bother’s the EU too - disconnection without judicial process denies people the right to communicate for what may be arbitrary reasons. So - what about switching France’s law from disconnection to fines, and backing it with a legal framework similar to that used around camera tickets? Three strikes, then fines, graded to encourage account holders to proactively manage their network, supported by education (’Network Security for Residential Internet Customers”), with the option to plead “not guilty” at any point and engage the judicial process?

Erm, the EU *has* been in existence for quite some years now...

The sad fact that I can't live with my family in my *own* country (the Netherlands) is exactly because EU law doesn't apply *there for me as a national*. That's national law, ""sovereignty"", for you. I'm sure this is hard to understand for simpletons like yourself, but basically, for any EU citizen who is in *another* EU country, EU law (thank goodness) applies. If a EU citizen is in their *own* country, *national* law applies. So, in my (somewhat xenophobic) home country, I can't live with my family, because of friggin' national, ""sovereign"", laws. I can, however, live and work in *every other EU country of my choosing*, because then, thank goodness, EU law rules.

Going to bed late at night and sleeping in every day makes you feel tired during the day, which makes you too tired to start working on the things you need to do, which in turn makes you feel depressed, which further messes with your daily rhythm… it’s a vicious circle, and [this image](http://imgur.com/2W6tT) will give you a much better idea of what I’m talking about. Go to bed early, wake up early, and spend the first hour and a half eating breakfast and exercising. It will be tiresome at first, but it’ll provide you with double the energy in the long run. Learn to say no when your friends ask you if you want to go out with them. Set a time in the evening at which you definitively turn off your router so you won’t be able to surf your valuable sleeping time away until four in the morning. Better yet, if you don’t really need internet on a daily basis, don’t install it. Every library has (sometimes free) internet nowadays; make a list of everything you need or want to look up using pen and paper and spend then every three days or so spend an afternoon in the library looking at all the items on your list and catching up with the world through Reddit. I realize the irony of advocating an internetless life on the internet, but really, the internet, and sites like Reddit in particular as it provides you with an unending stream of interesting links and thoughtful comments, are like the devil if you have work to do.
* Start using a calendar to organize your day. Working with a calendar, and having visual evidence of the months you’ve procrastinated away is an further motivator to start getting work done. [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) is free and works fine. If you set it up right it’ll even send you reminders of whatever you want to your phone, for free. 
If you have a flaky internet connection, like me, and already have the Office Suite, you can also use Outlook, which I find a bit easier to work with than GCal. I use them both in synchronization with each other though, that way I can access my calendar anywhere (GCal) and anytime (when my connection is down, Outlook).
* Buy an external hard disk, and identify all the files and programs that are non-essential for you to complete whatever you need to do. Move all your movies, music and the like to your external hard drive, uninstall every other program which you suspect might even slightly leech your time. I’m looking at games here, and especially games with no end, such as WoW or Football Manager if you’re in Europe. If you want a distraction, visit the [Berkeley Webcast website]( http://webcast.berkeley.edu/) and download a few lectures on a subject you like, so that when you’re wasting time, you’re wasting time in a productive way.
* Limit your browsers to 1, and let that one be Firefox. Then install [Leechblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476) and block all the sites that constantly provide you with new content, such as Reddit, Digg, Youtube, and so on.
* Another option to block your internet access is [Internet Lock](http://www.toplang.com/internetlock.htm). A friend of mine sent me a link to this program some time ago, but I haven’t installed it yet. He is absolutely convinced of its effectiveness though. 
* Ultimately, you have to make the mental switch yourself. You have to realize that you’re throwing all the skills and abilities you have, and the promise you showed as a younger you straight out the window if you continue in this lifestyle. Think of whatever you wanted to do with in the academic direction you took, think of what job you wanted to end up doing in fifteen or twenty years, and realize that you still have a shot at getting there, but only if you start living your life in an ORGANIZED way. I realized some time ago that in stead of becoming a diplomat, which was the job I always wanted to do, I would end up flipping burgers at my local Mickey D if I continued down this path. Now I’m studying law, and working as a volunteer at an international organization in my university town, and I’m well on track to realizing the goal I set out for myself.

tl;dr: life fail ahead, organize yourself to win. It is a long, difficult and dangerous quest, use these tools to help you on your way.

I know people that migrated to Australia (fellow Socialist comrades) from China. I've had long, long discussions about the politics and organisation in China and it is not even remotely close to Communism.

The Tank Man was not U.S. propaganda against China. That shit actually did happen, more over, the massacre itself happened. But then, again what about the attacks on the Tibetans? Hell! What about China's recent threat against Taiwan recently that resulted in arming up its missile silos? That's hardly communist, especially since what sparked the issue was the Taiwanese people wanting independance and also wanting to have the barbarism perpetrated against them recognised.

My comrade from China was telling me that if you showed the Chinese people the *real unedited* works of Marx and Engels, it wouldn't surprise him if they immediately moved into revolutionary struggle *against the CCP.*

And again, the CCP is an anti-thesis to Communism. *It openly states it wishes to harmonise Capitalism and Communism.* More to the point, it *has a market economy - another fundamental anti-thesis to Communism.* And! Its economy has to maintain an 8% growth rate just to support the influx of impoverished Peasants into the cities who are looking for work to *feed their families.*

China is also Imperialist, selling arms and signing economic trade deals with other nations - a reason the U.S. has been so bang on about the middle east (as prior to 9/11 that is also a place where China had begun to gain influence - alongside Russia and the European Union obviously).

And why do you suppose that those costs of living are lower?  It is because the labor, sanitation, and regulatory standards throughout the supply chain of everything consumed in these countries are also much lower, as are the services people in these countries can expect to enjoy (thinking: air conditioning, new cars, well-insulated houses, etc.).  

The reason why things cost so much in the United States and Europe is because they take more resources -- chiefly in the form of labor and technology -- to produce at the level of regulation and standards of safety required.  It's not because things magically cost more in more developed countries.

She (and a friend of hers) and I had sort of a weird love/hate thing going on, where we'd publicly insult each other a lot, but still sort of get on ok.  She was the quiet, darker one, her friend the quirky sort that I found pretty attractive.

We met up for dinner once while I was visiting on holiday a few years later, and had a great time.  She was pretty cute, and all was well, until she mentioned ""my boyfriend...""  At that point the ""wow, attractive woman"" part in my brain turned off and switched over to ""wow, nice person, friend"" mode.

A year or two after that, she was on a trip in the US and tried to contact me to ask if she could stop by to visit; thinking about it, I thought it'd be great....but she only had my mom's contact details, and my mom ""forgot"" to forward the message.  Gee, thanks.

A bit after that we started corresponding by letters.  At the time, I was madly in love with a woman in my house.  Turns out my best friend was madly in lust with her as well.  At some point, my girl/friend in Europe started writing me about how much she could imagine our friendship developing into something.  Me, I'm an idiot with women.  I went to the woman in my house, confessed my mad love for her, and was shot down -- ""let's just be friends.""  She and my buddy hooked up.  Shortly after he looked at one of the letters from Europe, smacked me in the head and asked me WHAT-A-YOU-A-THINKIN?  EEDIOT!

So, I visited Europe again for a summer.  Euro girl/friend and I had arranged to go on an Interail trip around a few countries.  And lo and behold, first chance we got we kind of flew into each others' arms and bang.  Turns out she'd had a crush on me during that whole time.  I didn't realize it, because, frankly, this kind of thing just doesn't happen to me.  She confessed later that she'd spent an entire christmas bawling after I'd gone back to the States.  Whoops.

I went back to finish college, and we had the most miserable few months of long-distance relationship of our lives, until I was serendipitously offered a job in her country and moved over.  We've been together since (13 years.)  The woman is gorgeous, brilliant and successful, and I still ask my self how the hell that happened.

With this comment:

&gt;Why would you expect the political process to respond to your demands? By your own argument the rights you would be asserting would be illegitimate.

I disagree. If people like like grandfather, who saw what was happening with the rise of fascism in Europe had been successful in preventing it before it was entrenched, there would have been no need for violent response. Remember, people who take control also do this with the acceptance/accession of a significant proportion of the populace. Without that tacit agreement it doesn’t happen. If people feel that they can fix it later, they are less likely to try hard at the outset. This I think is where you and I differ in view.

The central component of my argument would probably most easily be shown with reference to the success of our democracy compared with yours (which is a claim I’ve made in past comments): we have a long history of democracy, with the invention of the secret ballot, the second territory to give voting to women and public rejection of bans on political parties while you guys were doing the McCarthy thing and we have maintained this democracy without resort to violence, or even the threat of violence.

It only took one spectacle of violence each to neuter Australia, New Zealand and Finland, and politicians were not making aggressive moves against gun ownership before those events.  There are a few cases like Mexico where constitutional gun ownership rights persist, but the government has clamped down on all sales in the formal economy by making the army the sole retailer, and by heavily restricting CCW permits to the wealthy and politically connected.

There is a smug notion amongst gun control advocates that frontier culture is a social pathology unique to citizens of the United States.  That couldn't be further from the truth, as voters in countries like Brazil have voted strongly against eliminating sales of firearms and ammunition despite a media that reported in lockstep with the ruling administration back in 2005.  In the Czech Republic, Norway, and Switzerland, gun ownership is taken for granted.  Sometimes it is a stumbling block to EU consolidation.  Actual disarmament or registration by open force of the state is often only a consequence of political and economic instability, like in post WWI Germany, England since the introduction of Protestantism probably, or South Africa today.

So that all said. I'm going to write a new article RIGHT HERE:


I'm somewhat introverted. I am completely content keeping to myself. So the idea of taking my first trip to Europe alone was somewhat daunting. But, my desire for adventure outweighed my fear of travelling alone and off I went.  

The primary advantage of traveling alone is that you have complete control of your own actions and others perception of you. There's no social stigma based on your reputation and other interactions with people. There's something about travelling that makes people incredibly friendly and outgoing. Every time i've gone to Europe i've met and hung out with new people. It seems daunting, but you're not the only one traveling alone, and all those other solo travelers are eager to meet new people. 

Nearly any Hostel you stay at will be full of people who want to hang out and adventure.

Rather than hiring a private guide (haha), another idea would be to look into www.couchsurfing.com . It sounds a bit scary at first, but it's a community with a very strong feedback system so you don't get raped. Staying with local people was an invaluable experience for me and while it limited my interaction with other travelers, it was a really good experience and got me better acquainted with the local people.

[deleted],-1,reddit.com,0,0,False,,,,"Um, indorock, you do realize that the countries in Northern Europe are capitalist, not socialist, don't you?

Capitalism is defined as a society that has private ownership of the means of production.  The northern European countries have a primarily private ownership base, with some government ownership.  Just like in the US, Canada, Mexico, *and every other country in the world other than places like North Korea (100% socialist) and Cuba (75% socialist)*.

Socialism is by definition a society characterized by government or ""collective"" ownership of the means of production.

Having universal healthcare, welfare, and other such things does not make a country socialist.  It makes it capitalist with government intervention.

See, what you have to understand is your own thoughts and your mind here.  I know that you *want* everyone to have this or that benefit, and that you *want* everyone to be healthy, and that you *want* the world to realize that an alleged capitalist nation, namely the US, is ""proof"" that capitalism does not create the happiest people.

Notwithstanding that illogical claim (you cannot compare happiness, or utility, across two or more economic agents, for utility is personally subjective, not a measurable and comparable thing across two or more different people), you can't think something just because it makes you feel better.  

One cannot say that person A is twice as happy as person B.  The only thing that matters is whether person A is able to achieve his desired ends, and whether B is able to achieve their desired ends.

Socialist thinking is always manifested in an absolute way of considering other people.  For example, just like Marx, everything good is called socialism, and everything bad is called capitalist.  Then, on the basis of this arbitrary nomenclature, *conclude* that socialism is good and capitalism is bad.  This must be the case with you too, for how else could you have possibly accepted the implied proposition that northern Europe is socialist, when in reality it is a mixed economic region just like the US in that it has both private ownership and government ownership of the means of production?  How else could you have concluded that it is somehow possible to compare levels of utility across two or more different individuals, when doing so in more depth results in contradiction and nonsensical conclusions?

I'm sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news, or what I like to call ""truth"", but you have to stop thinking that which is false, and your thinking the northern Europe is socialist is clearly and irrefutably false.

&gt;As in discussing? Why shouldn't people just discuss ideas? 

I never said people *shouldn't* discuss ideas. What kind of shit is that to insinuate?

&gt;Why can't people discuss theism without their harbouring a political agenda for global conquest?

Are you trolling me or what? What the fuck did I just spend 2 hours of my life discussing this for? I'm not advocating an atheist political party with a military branch, if *that's* your concern.

&gt;Is it impossible that discussions themselves can lead to changes in thinking and behaviour?

You know, when you talk to people like they're imbeciles you're not giving them the benefit of the doubt which I find to be a common trait of people who have made up their minds, have no intention of even considering changing them and are only engaged in a conversation because they have nothing better to do and/or to strengthen their own predetermined ideas.

&gt;Maybe it will lead some people to question theism, others may have questions about theism/atheism answered. Maybe it will promote atheism.

I think - wait... yes... I think I get that. Maybe I'm just a poor stupid turd, but, yes, by Jove I think you got through to me on that one.

&gt;I don't think you understand what atheism is. It is simply a non-belief in theism, that's it. It isn't some political movement to destroy theism.

I don't think you know me well enough to make a judgement as to what I understand atheism is or isn't. I certainly don't think its a political movement to destroy theism but in saying that ""it is simply a non-belief in theism, that's it"" I don't think *you* understand the context of atheism in today's world. 

A thousand years ago, people were burned alive at someone's say-so they were in cohorts with ""the devil"". 600 years ago, Galileo was placed under house arrest for stating what was scientific fact about the nature of the universe. 300 years ago, the Spanish slaughtered tens of thousands in South America and justified it religiously. 60 years ago, a backlash of Christian fundamentalism on the back of some clever propaganda, was the direct cause of deaths of 6 millions Jews, with the Vatican's blessings. 

And less than 10 years ago, the Catholic church formally apologised and ""absolved"" Galileo for his ""beliefs"". 

The world, my friend, is not a pleasant place when ruled by ignorance that stems from religion. Destruction and suffering are the order of the day and politics are heavily influenced by the clergy.

I have witnessed a religious war first hand. I have seen with my own eyes, not through a TV screen, blood and guts of people who were killed because they were of a ""wrong faith"". Hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes while the men who were executing the orders to chase people away from the homes their grandparents were raised in were celebrated in churches and had hymns sung to the glory of their ""victory"". 

This happened in Europe less than 20 years ago. 

If you even harbour the slightest inclination to think that you enjoying stability of the society you live in has even remotely anything to do with the tolerance *you* exercise towards the religious, remember that the machine that feeds the ""news"" into the minds of the lazy can just as easily change its tune from promoting cheap burgers to promoting any other brand of idea - be it food, cosmetics or religion. 

So if you ever wake up and find the world you live is falling apart around you because people that are not too busy killing, maiming or looting are too busy glued to a screen that's telling them it's good to hate enemy's of ""our way of life"" - then you'll understand the true and present danger of religion.

Crestina,1,politics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt; I brought up history simply to make a point: Ron Paul's ""State's Rights"" fetish has direct, real, consequences that are not at all pleasant

What's stopping the states from implementing their own civil rights acts? Each country here in Europe managed to do it without EU hanging over us micromanaging. Why can't the states of the US manage to do the same? They aren't *that* retarded compared to us, are they?

If Paul wants to do away with federal micromanaging of civil rights, blaming him for acts of entirely different people (the ones governing the different states) is meaningless. Blame the state-governors if they do wrong. Don't blame Paul for not wanting to spend his time babysitting what should be adults. 

&gt; Funny how he only cares about the Constitution when its convenient for his own beliefs, isn't it?

Not really. I already said I expect some level of crazy from Christians. You are now only running in circles repeating the same arguments over and over. If he leaves those matters to the states, who cares what his personal delusions are. He won't be ""the decider"".

And I've also addressed the newsletters. Exclusive interviews to white supremacists? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt but I'd like to see sources cause I'e never seen any  mention of that anywhere.

&gt; I will observe that pretty much every nation on Earth has abandoned commodity based currency, and while the majority is not always right I do have to say that it seems likely that they probably know something the goldbugs don't.

No, they don't know something goldbugs don't. It's an argument over the actual practical functions of an economic system. There are differences in opinion. Some people want a volatile system to be able to rapidly adjust the increase in production speed, while others can sacrifice production speed for stability. 

Who is ""right"" and who is ""wrong"" depends on what you perceive the goal of the system to be. 

Edit: I forgot to address your spanish example from 300 years ago which should apparently demonstrate how standardized economics in general are wrong, and say that you should be aware that your example isn't very representative. A short period in spanish colonial-history with massive import of one good combined with declining population and declining demand is a rather particular economic framework.

[Not really](http://cirp.org/library/). It has the same benefit you'd get from cutting any part of the body off: If there is no body part, there can be no problem. Problems of the foreskin are rare and usually solved with much less invasive procedures than an amputation of 15 square inches of specialized, erogenous, protective tissue.

Consider that no medical institution in the world endorses neonatal circumcision beyond the notion that it *may* have benefits. In fact, **none** of the following medical societies or associations advocate infant circumcision (they point out that there are no prophylactic or therapeutic reasons that justify the surgery on healthy boys):

And similarly so with the 40-50k thing, i guess it would be pretty neat to not have to worry about paying for an education or seed money for a business endeavor or time to work on something cool. but really, how much better is 50 million? i guess that might make you important in a way, but in my experience that's usually only a symptom of power.

sotonohito,1,politics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt;What's stopping the states from implementing their own civil rights acts?

Ummm, racism maybe?

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears that you're European, and I'd guess not particularly well versed in US history.

The Civil Rights act was passed by the US federal government specifically to end a set of laws collectively known as ""Jim Crow"".  Basically the Jim Crow laws enforced and legalized race based discrimination against black Americans.  Segregation was a part of this, but not all of it.  Among other things under Jim Crow black Americans couldn't serve on juries, were banned from certain types of employment, were paid less for the same work (not secretly, but completely upfront and legally), etc.

Many US cities had ""sunset laws"", which prohibited any black person from being inside city limits after dark.  The ""after dark"" part was necessary because underpaid black labor was often critical to the towns survival, but they were (thanks to those laws) forced to live outside the city limits.

All of these practices were defined by state law (mostly in the states that were formerly part of the Confederate States of America, but not always).

So, the reason they didn't pass civil rights acts of their own is because the majority of voters in those places liked the situation the way it was, and the politicians there actively courted racist votes in order to stay in office.  Numerous state politicians of that time were members of the KKK, a terrorist group established for the purpose of torturing black Americans to death (a practice called ""lynching"") in order to keep the majority of black Americans cowed.  Unlike in modern America where the KKK is marginalized and membership would be a political liability, in the time period of the Civil Rights act membership in the KKK was a definite advantage for many politicians.  

The Civil Rights Act was, essentially, a (slim) majority of America forcing a portion of America to stop being North Korea to some of their citizens.  It'd be nice if they'd stopped on their own, but they were not going to.  Absent the civil rights act there's no reason to suppose that Jim Crow would not still be active today.

&gt;They aren't that retarded compared to us, are they?

Yeah, basically they are.  There are parts of the USA which are, for all intents and purposes, like Turkey (on the good end) or Saudi Arabia (on the bad end) only with Christianity instead of Islam.

In several US states the government regulated sex, and imprisoned people for having the wrong kind of sex.  Right this second several US states (again, mostly in the former Confederacy) have laws against sex toys which are so broadly worded that if applied evenly they'd ban the sale of carrots or cucumbers (and no, I'm not exaggerating).  They aren't applied evenly, of course, but if they were.

&gt;If he leaves those matters to the states, who cares what his personal delusions are. He won't be ""the decider"".

That would be because, in the first place, like all other ""State's Rights"" freaks, he **WOULDN'T** leave matters to the states.  They're all total and unrepentant hypocrites on the topic.  When the issue is one that matters to them (usually an issue of oppressing a minority) they shriek about their sacred ""State's Rights"", but when the issue is one the don't agree with they suddenly become advocates of using Federal power to oppose it.  Look, for example, at the issues of marijuana laws, assisted suicide, etc.  In each instance the leading forces in favor of using Federal might to stop the state incentives that direction are also people who had previously gone on and on about ""State's Rights"" [1].

More to the point, if Paul enacted his ""State's Rights"" agenda there are numerous US states (mostly in the old Confederacy) which are pathetically eager to get back on their agenda of oppressing minorities.  Under Ron Paul, for example, I'd see my right to vote, hold office, or sit on a jury taken away because the only think that preserves those rights in Texas is the Federal government, if Paul got the Federal out of the rights business I'd lose mine.

&gt;Each country here in Europe managed to do it without EU hanging over us micromanaging. 

Contrary to what many insane Americans will tell you, the US is not a sort of super EU.  The states in the USA are not nations, they are not sovereign.  At one point in US history that was kind of the idea, but that time has passed.  We're all one country now, and while the Federal is not as pervasive as it is in France or Japan, neither is it (nor should it be) a powerless UN-esque facade.

The US economy and position in the world would fall apart immediately if loony tunes like Ron Paul got their way.

&gt;And I've also addressed the newsletters. Exclusive interviews to white supremacists? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt but I'd like to see sources cause I'e never seen any mention of that anywhere.

If by ""addressed"" you mean ""ignored"", then yeah.  Google ""ron paul vdare interview"" and you'll see the first link is an exclusive interview he gave the racist website vdare.  After people complained about the interview, Paul gave the same ""I'm a moron"" defense that his worshipers give the newsletters.  They claim that, just as with the newsletters, Ron Paul was so stupid that he simply didn't know who he was talking to.

Assuming that the Paulites are not lying, I find their desire to support the sort of complete idiot they believe Paul to be bizarre.  I mean, they're claiming he's doing stuff that's George W. Bush level stupid, but they want us to elect him President?  No thanks.

As for gold, like I said, I'm out.  I tried, I'm giving up.  Further, I've decided that I'm done with goldbugs in general, you guys are in Creationist type denial of reality so there's no point engaging on that topic.  Other topics related to Ron Paul I'll discuss, but on the gold insanity you'll just have to assume that I'm a brainwashed tool of the Federal Reserve and that the fact that I consider Ron Paul's desire to cripple America with an insane gold standard automatically disqualifies him from getting my vote, for anything ever, is based on my brainwashing not on any sane or reasonable desire not to see the US economy wrecked with goldbug lunacy.

[deleted],1,politics,0,0,False,,,,"Why does Europe allow the domestic production of any HFCS if they're opposed to it for health reasons? They don't call it HFCS, BTW, they call it isoglucose. One thing that has caught on in all developed countries, although the US still leads the way, is inverting regular sugar for use in food manufacturing. 

As I commented before, the unbound sugars is superior to regular sucrose  sugar for a variety of reasons. Inverted sugar syrup has become a preferred product to food manufacturers in the developed world. A common argument coming from HFCS detractors is that the unbound sugars is somehow worse for us than the bound sugars. They give various reasons for this, none of them true in fact.

I can tell you this about HFCS; It's made from a crop that can be grown with great success in the US over a much much larger area than cane. Believe it or not, a larger amount of corn starch can be recovered from an acre of corn than sugar from an acre of beets or cane. 

Cane sugar is only cheaper than corn because of lower labor costs than in the states. Cane workers in many countries don't live any better than the slaves that harvested it in the 17 and 18 hundreds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhmgPmHubxU Brazil however is phasing  out hand harvesting in favor of  mechanized harvesting, and they're supposedly phasing out the burning of cane, which is always done right before harvest to eliminate the leaves. That makes harvesting and processing cane a lot easier. It's still burned everywhere, though, even in the states. http://images.google.com/images?q=sugar+cane+fire&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS248US298&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi

There may well be a trend in switching to cheaper cane sugar due to the lifting of trade barriers to imported sugar in the US (NAFTA made a big difference) but this wont change a thing health wise. There is simply no valid evidence that HFCS is worse for us than sucrose sugar. I can always break detractors down to merely arguing that the 5% extra fructose in HFCS 55 is what makes it worse for us than sucrose sugar, but if true, that would make the second place sweetener, HFCS 42, healthier than sucrose because it has less fructose than sucrose.

My thing with all these arguments is if there's valid evidence that one is worse than the other, than bring it, but don't bring easily debunked arguments to the table such as the following: Unbound sugars are worse for us than the bound sugars, your body regulates the metabolism of sugars from sucrose, but it can't regulate the sugars from HFCS, HFCS has mercury in it, corn is environmentally destructive, HFCS causes liver disease, HFCS has harmful carbonyls in it, HFCS is responsible for a rise in obesity, HFCS causes fatty liver disease, HFCS is responsible for a epidemic of childhood diabetes, HFCS is responsible for an epidemic of childhood obesity.

All of that is bullshit, and it may well be that producing sugar from corn is more environmentally friendly than producing it from cane. I suspect that if regular sugar takes over because of a lifting of trade barriers, US sugar beet and cane farmers may either have to switch to other crops, or they will require more protectionist legislation, which they already have, BTW.",True,t1_c09o49a,1,c09o743,1425971825,1242737927,t1_c09o743,0,True,t3_8lc9g,t5_2cneq

I get kind of wierded out and overwhelmed when it comes to huge games like that, so I end up reading the 500 page manuals for a few hours and it becomes my excuse to not play any more. The same situation plays out again and again. I did the same thing with GalCiv and Sins of a Solar Empire - I'd play enough to get sort of familiar with the game in a bumbling foolish sort of way but never enough that I felt any sense of real accomplishment. Win a couple tutorials and I'm back to a shooter or whatever.

So last night around 8:30, the kids are in bed and I'm putting in the time to read the manual and take turns cautiously. I'm determined that this time I'm not going to give up. So I'm clicking along, making some alliances, building some new settlers. Can't figure out what even the basic resources do or how they're computed. I'm getting a little frustrated by this point, which one of the 500 buildings or 50 different civic techniques I want to employ. And I'm just about ready to save my game for the last time, you know? 

Then out of nowhere these fucking Mongols start getting pissy with me and my German allies. Hey, what's the deal with that? Well I'm certainly not going to sit back and take any smack from a bunch of assholes waving spears around, oh hell no. So I fire up my war elephants and knights and strike the first blow! 1500 years of game time later, I'm still bombing their little shantytowns with artillery and zepplins while they chuck spears. Finally their last city falls somewhere in northern China.

Meanwhile this is all going on, I discover South America and claim it all to myself. Again in a very bumbling way. By this time I'm clicking all the ""Recommended"" choices and not really paying a lot of attention. I don't care, I just want to get to the next round so I can move some more units.

But now Ramses III is getting a little edgy, demanding I switch religions or some shit. I don't know what his deal is. He starts attacking my German vassals. I don't even know what that means to me in the game that they're my vassal, but who cares. So I gift all my high science to my German friends in exchange for 20 gold and a pat on the back and we start gearing up for the next conquest. Egypt's already claimed Australia and the entire lower half of Africa. I have all of Europe to Asia under my control by this point, railroads and rockets, and a good foothold in the Americas. At least I think I have railroads. I earned the technology but I don't see how to have my roads upgraded automatically. And my best sea boat is some little canoe with little guys who throw rocks.

[deleted],1,socialism,0,0,False,,,,"The argument that Capitalism has given way to a new epoch in human health and general, overall wellness is a farce, at best. For the majority of the population Capitalism has made little difference to their life expectancy. Mass poverty - starvation, homelessness, disease - afflict much of the world's population, particularly in India, North and South Africa, the Middle East and China.

Those benefits we've received in the West - Europe, Britain, Australia, the United States (which in itself has a serious problem when it comes to poverty), Canada and so on can be amounted to socially neccessary advancements. It is impossible for these nations to maintain a healthy, stable, mass industrial workforce without having one that can be relied upon to live longer than their 25th birthdays. But again, to draw back to what I've said before, Capitalism has not the capacity to deal with the new ailments of the world - as it only invests where it is deemed profitable to the investor. There is no forethought. Do you think Capital saw fit to better the lives of its workers off the bat? Hardly, Engel's rather detailed accounts of the British working class in the 19th century are a grand testament to the poverty that Capital was willing to inflict on the working class - what's more is those accounts are echoed in all other rising Capitalist nations during the 19th Century. Their affliction was not naturally caused, but caused by the rapid industrialisation of economies and a polarisation of wealth into the hands of the Capitalists, Aristocrats and Bureacrats of the State. And again, these benefits we receive have come at the grand expense of other nations' populations. 

At no point did I say that Land ownership created Surplus value. Capital does not create new value, it doesn't create of itself surplus. I stated that raw materials (resources) were a necessary foundation to all Capitalist economies. With the degradation of those resources, economies suffer well and truly before they can even reach the stage of profiting from the exploitation of Labor.

On the topic of the Environment, what we can say for certain, that is empirically, is that since the Industrial revolution there has been mass destruction wreaped on our world. The pollutants and destruction of natural resources has gone into overdrive since the 19th Century, and you'd be foolish to claim this is not as a result of the epoch of Capitalism - especially given that the only social order in this world right now is Capitalist - be it be a state bureacratic denomination or a Liberal one.

I did warn you in my last comment not to travel down a misguided path of trying to tell us, the Socialists and Communists, what it is that Socialism and Communism is. I did warn you not to make that mistake again, it seems you blindly walked into another dead end.

No where do the theories of Marxists claim that Socialism or Communism rests on removing Capital from the Capitalist. On the contrary we say specifically: Destroy all relations of Capital. Abolish bourgeois private property. Abolish private ownership of land. At the point that Capital falls into common ownership it ceases to be Capital and is now merely the means by which society can produce wealth for the whole. Your assumption is born out of a lack of knowledge on the subject of Marxist theory and Communism. Let me remind you for the second time: Do not make the mistake of assuming to know more than I do about a set of Politics and theory you have read nothing on (unless provided by your liberal/libertarian/capitalist economic thinkers).

What you neglect about the Russian Revolution and subsequent Socialism is that Europe's ruling classes launched an offensive against the Russian working class. A three year long civil war, for the purpose of crushing its workers' state in already industrially backward Russia. I could go more into this, I could detail for you the exact causes of Stalinism in Russia, but that would greatly lengthen this comment and I have made several remarks on this topic in the past - you need only look for them. But I will say this: What atrocities and authoritarian dictatorships have existed in the name of Communism have, in most cases even before their conception, broken from Marxism. Stalinism reflects nothing of Marxism, Maoism the same, Third world nationalism also. It is easy for those who have no interest in free society for all to white wash the facts, to try to canonise Marxism to what they *think* it is. The realities starkly disagree.

Also, don't preach to us about Authoritarianism. We currently live under the Dictatorship of Capital. Billions suffer, millions die in its wars, billions of wage slaves are forced to obey, lest they be sent to the pits of poverty like the others. This makes Stalin look like a toddler. Finally on this point: State-capitalism - I.e. state bureacratic ruling classes assuming the role of Capitalist. Let's not make the mistake of assuming the U.S.S.R, China, Vietnam and so on were more Communist than they were Capitalist. If it looks like a duck, smells like a duck and acts like a duck ~ it must be a fucking duck.

I did not make a claim that the current crisis was proof of Marx (my personal opinions on that subject did not come into it at all). On the contrary, Marx did theorise, along with other early economists, that Capitalism had its boom bust cycle. Marx pointed out that Capitalist crises would deepen over time, and indeed it appears that they are.

The rest of this ideologically driven circa-jerk can be boiled down to this rebuttal: For the last 200 years, with each crisis, each political, economic problem, economists, regulators and capitalists have scrambled to readjust and tweek the system. Again, they have more than empirically (as there have been well and truly more than 3 generations of proof here), shown they are incapable of preventing crises or dealing with them quickly enough. We've been needing to look at this for two centuries. We've been having to wait for Capitalist democracy to work for all for two centuries - and you dare to tell us, ""Oh, I know its been longer than you were born but you still have to wait for *us* to fix the problem.""

What makes you think I do not read Law and Legislatures? Wouldn't I be on a rather terrible backfoot politically if I did not? What makes you think that the entirety of my literature and political theses is based solely on works written 100+ years ago? What makes you think that Marxism is as stagnant?

You've really got to stop making those false assertions. Do a search - ""What is the real marxist tradition"" on Socialism Reddit and read it. It'll clear up that question quite nicely.

Also, you fuckers and your bourgeois institutions have done *nothing* tangable for the whole *ever* in the *history of Capitalism*. The *only* time anything of worth has been won, decided or maintained, that benefits working class people, that benefits those suffering because of the callousness and barbarity of Capitalism has been when *we* the *working people of the world* stand up and fight back.

Civil liberty doesn't exist because Capital invented it. *We* invented it. Workers rights don't exist because Capital was benevolent at one time, they exist because *we* made them exist.

For someone with zero insight into Communism, into Marxism, into how the world actually works, you sure are over stepping yourself by telling me what it is that I should be doing with my time.

IConrad,3,politics,0,0,False,,,,"&gt; I have always been intrigued by this one, aren't the statistics skewed by the fact that in the US, many people will imply not be able to seek treatment for these kinds of conditions

No.  There is this thing called ""Emergency Access""; anyone whose medical costs are immediately catastrophic to the point where they might be denied care otherwise go onto the federal insurance plan due to extreme need.  

No one can be denied care that would be the difference between life and death, by federal law, regardless of whether they can pay.

&gt; (bankruptcy due to medical expenditures).

That is a genuine problem.   But I, for one, would say that it's better to bankrupt a few people now than not have a medical system at all in twenty years.

That being said, I remain convinced that there is an alternative solution that would easily mitigate if not eliminate this problem, which does not rely on government provision of care.

&gt; (infant mortality is one)

I touched on that in the self-same comment that you responded to.  Infant mortality is artificially deflated in other countries as compared to the US (or, vice versa, artificially *inflated* in the US as compared to other nations.)  We count a ***MUCH*** broader range of events as ""live births"" -- all it takes is 'some sign of life' -- whereas in Europe the child must actually survive for a certain period of time before it counts as a live birth.

That's going to radically alter your mortality rates.  To then criticize the nation with the lower standard on what qualifies as ""live birth"" for having a higher infant mortality rate without acknowledging this is to either be ignorant of this fact or else to have an ulterior agenda.

&gt; I assume you can also couple with that the fact that people in the US (oddly those most at risk, the poorer segment etc..) are far less likely to see a doctor (due to costs and also issues with getting insurance later in life) and so may remain undiagnosed?

Actually, you are far more likely to start receiving treatment in the US once you have been diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness (cancer in particular) as compared to other nations.  I have personally known two people who were treatable at diagnosis who were **not** treatable at the time their waiting period for treatment ended in other nations.

I'm not, here, claiming that number is accurate -- merely a hypothetical.
