Perhaps you are overly concerned with making all people the same. Cultural diversity isn't always a bad thing, it can enrich your country. Why turn everyone into the same mold?

Integration issues are often caused by the host society feeling superior. These brown people are treated as social inferiors, their kids get taunted in school, there is subtle discrimination in housing, employment, etc. Then they turn to themselves and walls are created.

Again, bulldozing is itself neutral. Was my home bulldozed because it was destroyed in a flood? Because it was taken by eminent domain? What? The ""bulldozed"" has nice emotional appeal, but only that.

&gt;but when it is intended to convince the Palestinian Authority to accept a deal, then it fits perfectly into that definition.

Nope. Actions by one government to another are not terrorism. Terrorism is violence directed against civilians.

&gt;And there are laws in this conflict as well. The UN Charter, to which Israel is a signatory. The acquisition of territory through war is illegal. And it's reiterated very clearly in resolution 242, referring specifically to the occupied territories.

242 is deliberately vague. And what is Israel supposed to do with property taken in a war when the country they got it from does not want it and the people who do won't agree to a peace treaty? 

&gt;Many cultures have been resisting foreign occupation since WWII and they usually involve a combination of violent (never to be condoned) and nonviolent approaches. Algeria, South Africa, India &amp; Pakistan, Iraq. 

Iraq? Do you mean the Kurds? And, yes, the India and Pakistan case in an important one. Somehow that never gets mentioned here even though it would seem to have all of the same qualities as Israel/Palestine. Why do you think so many people here condemn Israel and are ignorant about Kashmir?

&gt;Maybe you have something in mind that works as a closer analogy here where people willingly gave up their land or rights. 

I was thinking that the people moved in the India/Pakistan separation built lives on something other than continuing the fight. The millions of refugees in Europe settled down and built lives, not bombs. But Jordan and Lebanon and Syria kept people in refugee camps and only supported violent efforts. The Palestinians are refugees in camps because of political decisions made by various Arab leaders, not because Israel is evil.

&gt;If the UN decided that the Romani people should have their own state and that 50% of the Israel would be given to them, I doubt that many Israelis would be happy about having to give up their homes. 

Are there 2,500 year old Romani communities in Israel? Have the Romani been trying to return to Israel for 2,000 years? Did they move in legally by buying land and building communities? 

&gt;This is basically the attitude of the Palestinians today and sadly, it is not easy to repair that damage.

The Palestinians today feel that way for many reasons, only some of which you can put on Israel's doorstep. The Arabs objected that the Ottomans got rid of the dhimmi laws, they objected that Jews were buying land, they objected to legal immigration and to Jews escaping the Holocaust by legally moving to the Mandate. All of that predates any violent actions by the Jews.

The proportion of the worlds people who are hungry is actually decreasing (though due to the fact that the population is still growing, and disproportionately so in the poorest countries, the absolute number of hungry people may be increasing moderately).

That said, the main reason that people *are* going hungry in some countries (mainly India and sub-Saharan African countries), is poor governance. We all know that there is enough food in the world to feed everybody, and there is even enough arable land in poor countries to feed the population, so why are they hungry? Corruption, inconsistently applied rule of law, and bad economic management by governments (especially African ones), make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food, and get it to market. 

Bad policy in the rich world makes the situation worse. European governments (especially France) and the US government implement a complex system of tariffs and subsidies that protect their (wealthy) farmers. The result of this is that food in these countries is overproduced at incredibly cheap prices, and the excess food is often ""dumped"" on the markets of poor countries. The cheap food is irresistible to the populaces of these countries, but it damages the local agricultural economies, since the mostly poor and subsistence farmers which comprise them cannot produce food at comparably low costs. Everybody gets fed, but the country never develops the ability to sustainably feed itself. 

The currently standard system of Western Aid to poor countries is also arguably damaging. Western governmental aid is mostly distributed through the governments of poor countries. These governments are mostly corrupt, and most of the money ends up lining the pockets of a wealthy, connected elite, rather than helping the people  of the country. Since it is in the interests of this corrupt political class to continue to receive Aid (which they use to pay themselves and buy votes), they have an incentive to keep the country in poor enough shape that they will be judged as needing more Aid (though not quite so poor as that the country would be seen as requiring a change of government through military intervention). They delay or ignore important reforms because they make money by remaining poor.

the opposite is more true. Menial labor is imported since the nature of the work requires it be done locally, like digging ditches, laying railroad tracks, washing dishes, cleaning homes.

By the same logic skin pigmentation itself wouldn't be possible either (recall that we're not really talking about skin color itself when we say ""black"", e.g., see Colin Powell), nor would lack of an epicanthic fold (in Asians), Mongolian Spots (also in Asians), and a whole host of other racially-significant phenotypes. But *they* *do* *exist*, and some are on the inside (e.g. adult lactase production in Caucasians).

There's *no* reason why average IQ can't also vary by race (there is indeed apparently evidence for an IQ boosting gene in European Jews. That alone could potentially be the entire story.).

Diversity in a gene pool has little relevance to the matter unless one were to make one of those straw-man claims. *But*, even if it did, have you shown that African Americans have a diverse gene pool?  Why? Because there are a lot of groups in Africa?  Did they come from a random sample of African tribes? I think not (as many people seem to forget, African Americans are probably about 50% English genetically, due to the country's sordid history).",True,c0p7c7y,,0,rudster,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0p7c7y

_In the US_. I'm in the US for a one-year stay at the moment. I had never in my life seen a check before. I am currently 24 years old - grew up in Germany, lived a few years in Lebanon, and started university in Finland. In none of those countries have checks been used routinely for a very long time now.

I am most familiar with the Finnish system, which I gather is also very common in most of the EMU. Everything is based on wire transfers. They are free within the country. They post immediately to accounts in the same bank, and next business day for accounts in different banks. To transfer money, you just need to know the account number.

So, say you want to pay rent. You just go online and deposit x amount of funds to the account of your landlord. This is also works for transferring money to your buddies, or any other bank account. Nothing special required. All bills are paid this way. Your corporate reimbursements get paid to you that way. Nothing special needed for direct deposit, it's the standard way.

I'm talking about the ""energy crisis"" that all the politicians are talking about. I don't think we have one and that science will give us new energy sources before it becomes that huge of a problem, but I may as well operate within the paradigm most people seem to accept. 

&gt;Maybe they should look at what European countries pay and decide that a 1+$ tax per gallon

Try more than that. Most euro countries pay upwards of 5-7 equivalent dollars / gallon. Keep in mind though, most of America has a population density that would make the rest of the western world smirk. That's why we consume so much more oil than everyone else - most of us can't catch the subway to work. 

&gt;No nuke plants built for 35-40yrs, freeway system 50-60yrs old, still living off black gold like 100yrs ago and finally just now giving permits for the first offshore wind farm. What was the reason behind that again?

The reason was that there were people of a certain political persuasion didn't want us to have nuclear power because they assumed since the communists couldn't do it right (chernobyl) that the rest of the world can't do it - now we rely on coal. As for wind farms, people of that the affore-alluded-to political persuasion were all for it until the deafening motors required to run them were built within a mile of their property and caused them to change their mind.

To start with, I look German, and though I speak almost no German, my Schwabian-German accent is perfect, and I was wearing European cut clothing.  So you can imagine the raised eyebrows when I blurted out a well practiced pet phrase, to the effect of, ""Pardon me, but I don't understand German very well"", just as someone would have said who lived in that area their whole life.

He spoke German fluently, but with the heavy upper class French accent of his French German language teacher.  But he could have easily read and discussed Goethe in German, while sounding like a Parisian snob.

This left the Germans perplexed, to say the least.  To the point of demanding that we explain ourselves.  This was done by the third gentleman in our group, who was a professor of German history and language, spoke German in four accents, and had been given an award by the German government for improving US-German relations.

In the twangiest East Texas drawl I have ever heard, peppered with ""shucks"" and ""golly gee whiz"", and other Americanisms, he made a bumbling display of ignorance about everything and anything German.  While we gawked at him with open mouthed amazement.

But this utterly satisfied the Germans.  They now knew that we were all American, and Americans are odd.  So order was restored to their universe.

However, her hypothesis is based on the notion that members of different racial groups are often more closely related to each other than members of different races. This is thanks to minimal mixing of genes between these groups before the age of exploration.  No real geneticist or evolutionary biologist will argue this.  When applied to animals, its how we use genomes to tell the evolutionary history of different groups.  For example people of northern european ancestry not only tend to carry genes for lighter pigmentation, but they also carry the genes for cystic fibrosis at far higher levels than any other race.  Likewise, sickle cell anemia's genes have much higher prevalences in people of african descent.   Both of these have supposed evolutionary advantages for carriers of these disease.  Carriers are people who have one gene but not the other.  Since we get one copy of each chromosome from each parent, recessive diseases like those can be covered up by the one working gene.

(Different schools in different cities, but together during breaks.)  Keeping conversation fresh when you're far apart is definitely a challenge—when you spend time together, you have shared experiences to build on and discuss.  When you don't have those shared experiences, though, there's little new to talk about, and it's easy to get into a rut of carbon-copy conversations every night (""How was your day?""  ""Fine, yours?""  ""Okay.""  *long pause*), and that's no fun for either party.

It sounds like she says everything she has to say when she calls you after work.  Have you tried keeping those conversations shorter, in exchange for longer evening conversations?  You could also talk to her about alternating phone calls.  Even days, she calls you after work, odd days, you call her later in the evening.  (I guess the usefulness of that depends on whether you'd just prefer to talk to her in the evening, or if you're looking for more conversation total.)

You could also try creating shared experiences, even though you're far apart.  This can be done as simply as sharing links and occasionally reading the same website/article—or, with more of a shared time investment, you can watch a movie or TV show together by syncing up your viewing while you are on the phone.  (Broadcast TV is easy for this, but with a countdown and a couple hours you can easily watch a movie ""together."")  Movies that invite joking and interruption are best for this, since your goal is to be talking.  (My beau and I watched *Troll 2* this way a couple months ago, and it was a blast.)

As for ""not listening,"" well. . . as long as you're following the gist of what she's saying and just missing some words here or there, you're fine.  People sound different on the phone, and sometimes things just don't come through clearly.  (For example:  there's something about my sister's voice that makes her extremely difficult for me to hear.  It doesn't matter which phone she's calling from, or which one I'm on—if we're on the phone, I will have to ask her to repeat what she's saying several times throughout the conversation.  I don't have this problem with her in person, or with *anyone else* on the phone.  My ears just can't pick up everything she says.)  

I'd talk to her about it some time (maybe even in person) *before* you miss something she says—that way, you'll both be as level-headed as possible, and will hopefully be able to resolve it before she becomes upset (and you get put on the defensive) again.  It's totally understandable that she thinks you're not listening (""Where in Europe?"" could easily be construed as your skimming the conversation, rather than actually listening), but it's just as understandable that you can't always understand her.

I just know Czech puts out a lot cool [firearms](http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz-tt_1.jpg) that end up over here in the states and from all the movies, pictures and stories I've seen and read, Czech seems like a down-to-Earth place.

&gt; why is that one of your biggest conditions?

Aside from the fact that I have a decent firearms collection I don't care to sell off, I believe that civilian firearms ownership is one of most significant checks against a tyrannical government. The American Revolutionary War was started when the overbearing British King tried to disarm the colonies. Nazi Germany disarmed those who were not German loyalists. Stalinist Russia disarmed the entire population as much as possible. I know these are all fairly uncommon once-in-a-century occurrences but why would you want to risk putting your family's safety at risk if it does happen?

Additionally, government is not the only entity capable of hurting you. Firearm bans do *not* remove guns from the hands of criminals. They're criminals, they don't respect the law anyway. Are we to expect criminally-inclined persons to throw away their firearms when the government bans them? This isn't very reasonable to assume. Firearm bans only criminalize law-biding citizens who own them and make a violent criminal's job easier.

I know Europeans like to throw stats around such as, ""Well, England has less gun crime than the United States, etc."" but one thing they fail to take into account is the population disparity between nations.

* England: 51,446,000
* United States: 320,173,000

We also have a plethora of larger cities than most European nations have where violent crime of any sort is most rampant. If you also look at violent crime as a whole, several anti-firearm European nations do appear fairly high while gun-friendly nations like Switzerland, Austria and Poland appear fairly low.

I feel as though there isn't really much of a significant correlation between gun ownership and crime (of any sort). Gun crime in the United States has been dropping steadily over the past two decades as gun ownership has exploded. The most gun-friendly state in our country (Vermont) has absolutely no tangible restrictions on gun ownership and only had around 3 murders in 2009 if I recall; none of which were committed with a gun. If there is to be a correlation between crime and gun ownership, I'd say the gun-friendly camp would have some strong evidence like what I have just put forth.

Regardless of what either side believes, it is just something I need as a condition of living elsewhere. If criminals and corrupt government can own them, why can't I? What are they afraid of? Civilians being able to defend themselves? If people don't commit crime and if governments are just, there is absolutely nothing to fear.

Sorry about that tangent :p Aside from those reasons, they're just one of my biggest hobbies. I enjoy collecting them, working on them and shooting them.

Thank you for your response, though. I'm trying as best as I can to give the United States as much time as I can to redeem itself, but the political climate is getting rather unbearable here. I may heavily consider Switzerland. I'd consider giving up my guns if I could live in one of my ideal countries rather comfortably (meaning obtain citizenship and find work): Ireland, Iceland, The Netherlands, Finland, etc.

I am considering Switzerland at some point. They seem the most liberal with gun restrictions. If I can become a citizen there, they would issue me a fully automatic weapon as military service is compulsory. :)",True,c0p7nf6,,0,[deleted],,1,0,0,True,t1_c0p7nf6

According to historical accounts, Hitler's death was a combination of a suicide by gunshot and cyanide poisoning on April 30, 1945, when the Soviet Army entered the Nazi Germany capital.

In early June of that year, the Soviets buried the bodies in a forest near the town of Rathenau, Germany. Eight months later, they secretly re-buried the remains in the Soviet Army's garrison in Magdeburg.

But in March 1970, the Soviets decided to abandon the garrison and pass it over to the East German civilian authorities.

As long as the burial place of the Nazi leaders was in the territory of a Soviet garrison, it could be kept secret and barred from strangers. But following relocation of the Soviet Army unit, the decision was made not to rebury Hitler's remains but to burn them, Khristoforov explained, calling it ""perhaps a reasonable decision"" given the circumstances.

Khristoforov said that all that remains of Hitler's corpse are fragments of his jawbone and skull, items that are kept in Russia. The general said the Russian FSB has no doubts that the bone fragments are genuine. No other fragments of the German dictator exist in other countries, he said.

Ummmm, you can get indoctrinated into the idea of thinking for yourself? Ummm.... that's an oxymoron.

&gt; Pish tosh. One of science's greatest strengths is that it strips our understanding of the supernatural.

No, it demands TESTABLE, FALSIFIABLE IDEAS. If the supernatural can actually come up with testable and falsifiable claims, then it will come within the realm of scientific inquiry. 

&gt; That's why atheism is so comparatively rational.

And yet, you don't actually show any connection between the two. You can be atheist and be completely scientific illiterate, and believe in homeopathy, an expanding earth, or any number of unscientific things.

&gt;  Please take it for granted that I want to try to improve the world. 

If you want to improve the world, then you MUST confront bad ideas. That's the ONLY way to improve the world. You must say that certain ideas are wrong and don't work. And we can empirically SHOW that certain ideas don't work, and religion is definitely one of those ideas. 

&gt; There is no society large enough to support sustained intellectual effort that has not had a religion associated with it. 

And there is no society large enough to support sustained intellectual effort that has not had crime, drugs, fraud, liars, con-artists, thieves and rape. What does that have to do with anything? There are plenty of things that come along with sustained intellectual effort, but are still detrimental. Religion is especially so. If you disagreed or even attempted to understand the universe in a way that disagreed with the bible you were violently suppressed. Galileo is just a big example of this. The Middle East is an amazing example of this! Before the rise of fundamentalist Islam, the middle East was an intellectual PARADISE! Algebra, optics, and countless other things were discovered and first understood in the middle East, but thanks to religion look what has happened to the region for the last 800 years. It went from an ENLIGHTENED REGION to the most backwater insane region in the world BECAUSE OF RELIGION and is still that way today BECAUSE OF RELIGION! 

&gt; Religion serves key functions in the initial stages of cultural homogeneity.

At the expense of racism and bigotry to the out-group. At the expense of independent thought. At the expense of free thought. 

&gt; Look into the speed that the empire borne of Islam was created.

And look what happened to it when religion got a hold of the governments of the region! IT COLLAPSED! An intellectual paradise COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF A RISE IN FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGION, and admittedly other such issues, and thanks to religion it has yet to come out of this intellectual collapse. And religion is actively trying to keep the middle east in this same intellectually dead environment. You don't know your history very well...

&gt; Look at Europe.

Yes, let's. That whole Dark Ages thing was GREAT!! Yeah, and that whole Renaissance thing came about BECAUSE people cared LESS about religion. They focused on MAN, not god. And how did this golden era for Italy end? Oh yes, the BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES! Yeah, religion has been GREAT for Europe. The crusades, World War 2, the Spanish Inquisition! Yeah, all of those had huge RELIGIOUS COMPONENTS. 

&gt; Hell, even look at the Chinese, arguably the oldest polity on earth, with their deference to their ancestors.

Yes, and I guarantee that they also have committed plenty of atrocities in the name of their religion. Japan had the Emperor as their living god, and World War II came about because of it, the Raping of nanking was a result of that unswerving loyalty to their ""god"". 

&gt; You can't condemn the idea without condemning the individual.

Bullshit, I condemn plenty of ideas that people espouse, but at the same time freely agree with them about others. My best friends are religious, and I don't condemn them for their beliefs. I condemn Bill Maher for his anti-modern medicine stance, but I like him and agree with him about plenty of other things. IDEAS ARE NOT PEOPLE. 

&gt; What were you taught as a child?

As I said, I was a non-theist. My parents didn't teach me anything about any religions, they just taught me to be good, and that was all that was required to make me a good person. 

&gt; Do you think your brainwashing stopped when you started to see the light of science?

You once again are equating science with atheism, which again is bullshit. You don't need to understand science to be an atheist. The Greeks and Romans didn't have a handle on most of the universe, but there were atheists even then. You don't need science to understand logical fallacies or to be an atheist. 

&gt;  If atheism is so powerful an idea, is it not a most effective form of brainwashing? 

Do explain how you brainwash into someone a lack of belief? Do you have to be brainwashed into not believing in unicorns, dragons, faries, elves, etc? 

&gt; You are not in control of the information you receive. 

Bullshit, if you are PASSIVE about what you learn then that is true, but if you are active you ARE IN CONTROL. You CAN go find out more information. If you're not satisfied with the current explanation you are free to go out and look for more information. Or if it isn't there you can try and do research into it yourself. 

&gt;  If you seek out information about atheism and rationalism, it is because you received information that made you question, made you skeptical...and then you sought.

Or you've sought out information about religions, atheism, and rationalism and then worked off from there. 


&gt; So don't condemn religious people for indoctrinating their children. You'd do the same. You are indoctrinated as much as they.

Yes, I fucking will condemn them! They mentally torture children into believing. They tell their children that they are horrible, and dirty from the get go. They tell their children that you must believe or you will forever burn. That's a central tenant of christianity. The penalty for deconverting from Islam is death! So, the child isn't just indoctrinated, but they are forced under the threat of death to never question their beliefs. The fact that you are trying to equate religious indoctrination with a secular upbringing is out-fucking-rageous!!

[Zbigniew Brzezinski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) former United States National Security Advisor said America's control over the Middle East [""gives America indirect but politically critical leverage on the European and Asian economies that are also dependent on energy exports from the region.""](http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/GlobalOilPoliticsandtheEnergySecurityintheAsianregion_JNandakumar_110405) .

The US derives a huge amount of its superpower status from its control of the M.E.  If Iran could ally with its fellow Shiia nations they could rival the USA for control of the valve. That will not be allowed.

Yes, it does sponsor outside groups, but this is nothing new in that region. For example, compare the biggest foreign influence that Iran has leveled against other countries, versus that what other countries have fielded against Iran.

Hizbollah is arguably the biggest foreign group sponsored by Iran. They are theocratic (though not even half as much as some other groups by western countries, for example during the Afghan-Soviet conflict), they are a bunch of thugs and murders too, and arguably the biggest obstacle to having the first truly democratic state in the Middle East (Lebanon).

However, they also fought a legitimate war against the occupation, and won. (Compare this to the rhetoric of the Arab states, who then turn around to oppress or even massacre the Palestinians in their own lands). And they pretty much limited themselves to one country, and the aggressor against that country.

Field this against instigating Iraq to attack Iran, once known to us as the Gulf war (The Imposed War as the Iranians still call it). Not only was Iraq supported by billions of dollars from all the states in the region that now cry the hardest about a nuclear Iran, it was also supplied with weapons of mass destruction by both the Europeans and Americans, that killed over 100.000 Iranians (by comparison, the Nagasaki bombing killed 60,000–80,000 according to sources you can find on Wikipedia). The US had it's own particular role in this, supplying not only the chemicals (for farming, of course), but also the delivery weapons (helicopters, for crop dusting of course), and planning the actual strikes using US satellite data (they didn't bother to come with an excuse for that one).

And of course there was the diplomatic support, in particular again by the US; like refusing to recognize the Iranian peace offer of ending the war after the conquered back all their own land (and actually halted at the border) in exchange for reparation payments. Or trying to blame the Iranians when Saddam started gassing the Kurds (later of course used as the excuse to invade Iraq.. who knows, maybe they'll switch back again when it's time to bomb Iran). Top that off with direct military involvement during the tanker wars, contentiously supplied intelligence, etc 

Ironically about the only country that sided purely with Iran was Israel, by selling them and directly shipping them crucial high tech weapons like anti tank and anti air missiles, and mediating the ""contra"" arms sales. Israel at that time of course considered Saddam's Iraq their existential threat, not Iran. (since this post is idiotically long already, I might as well include this little fact; the Iranians bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq before the Israelis did)

So if we're going to apply the words ""terror-sponsoring, genocidal, oppressive, brutal"" or ""monstrosity"" to governments in the world, you'll have to make a pretty long list if you want to include Iran as well. This is the point Chomsky is making, Iran does not have a history of aggression against other countries, if we compare it practically every other country in the region or even the world.

There's a lot more to the Taliban/Buddhas story than reported in mainstream media. 

In short, Afghanistan was facing a major human catastrophe and was in dire need of aid for its civilian population. At this critical time, Western governments told the Taliban they would be given money to save...rocks. That is, money to transport the statues, and nothing else. Taliban asked about Afghan civilians (including the starving women and children), and the West said ""fuck them"". Taliban then destroyed the statues. 

I heard that from the Taliban spokesmen themselves (first hand source). They also mentioned a religions factor. When I saw how the story was reported in Western media, I was not surprised at all. Some time ago I needed to find an English-language source for that story and found almost nothing. Again, not surprising. Just barely I found one source that mentioned it as I described it above ([click here](http://www.mail-archive.com/pen-l@galaxy.csuchico.edu/msg64237.html))

Excerpt: 

&gt;First among [the factors that led the Taliban to destroy the statues] is the new range of UN sanctions imposed in December 2000, sanctions which were criticized and opposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but which were nevertheless passed by the Security Council on the initiative of the United States and Russia. The Pakistani Foreign Minister commented that were these sanctions to be imposed, the world would witness ""one of the greatest human tragedies of our times.""

&gt;    The second, and related, factor is the humanitarian crisis looming in Afghanistan, the scale of which is truly formidable. According to the UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, Kenzo Oshima, at least 1 million Afghans are at risk of famine. The worst drought in memory combined with the devastating effects of over 20 years of war, have forced over 700,000 Afghans in the past year alone to abandon their homes; the Afghans, according to the UNHCR, constitute the largest single refugee group in the world.

&gt;    **Third, according to a Taliban envoy recently in the United States, the destruction of the statues was primarily the result of an offer made by a visiting delegation of mostly European envoys and a representative of UNESCO of substantial sums of money to protect the Buddhas at a time when little attention (much less financial aid) was being given to the humanitarian crisis there**. As Sayed Rahmatullah Hashimi said: ""If they can destroy our future and kill our children with sanctions, who gives them the right to talk about our heritage?""",False,c0p7zdl,,0,DesertDude,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0p7zdl

This is the usual issue with deterrence, for a deterrent to be credible the UK must be seen to be in a position to retaliate against a first strike, whether the UK would is another matter entirely.  That said in the event of all out nuclear war, nothing really matters, everyone is screwed, but when looking at states with a limited number of deliverable weapons, deterrence is still valid.

The point there is that most European nations are part of NATO, they are all essentially indirectly nuclear states because an attack on one is an attack on all, and as a group NATO has a nuclear capability.  you are right though, times have changed, it shouldn't be necessary for anyone to have a stockpile of deliverable weapons, they are no deterrence against terrorism (even nuclear terrorism if we ever have to face that).

Long denigrated by US pundits as the land of high unemployment, the EU currently even has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the United States. Indeed, the World Economic Forum in 2008-09 ranked Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands among the top ten most competitive economies in the world. They are also ranked at or near the top of most lists for quality of life, health care and social benefits. That's not a coincidence, since the participation of workers on all corporate boards of directors allows for both economic vibrancy and more egalitarian social policy. And while the United States also ranks high in competitiveness, it is near the bottom among most-developed countries in health care, social benefits and quality of life.

Sweden, Germany and other European countries are proof that you can have it all -- but only if you have the right institutions to facilitate both a powerful economic engine and the supportive institutions and benefits to harness that engine and keep employees and families healthy and productive. These distinctly European advances may be the most important innovations in the world economy since the invention of the modern corporation, since they encourage free enterprise combined with economic democracy and worker consultation that does not unduly burden entrepreneurship and commerce. The advances allow businesses to be both competitive and socially responsible.

In effect, Europe has reinvented the corporation. Yet the latest critiques of capitalism by leading authors like Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky and the producers of the popular film The Corporation tend to view all corporations and all capitalisms as the same. American progressives, while searching for effective responses to globalization, appear to be mostly unaware of these intriguing European inventions. Movements to revoke the charters of offensive corporations, while having gut-level appeal, have failed to recognize that European corporations are fundamentally different animals from their ""disaster capitalism"" US counterparts.

English and Dutch are both classified as West Germanic languages and linguistically they are closer than say English and Spanish or English and French, etc.

From Wikipedia:
&gt;The English language belongs to the Anglo-Frisian sub-group of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic family, a member of the Indo-European languages. The closest living relatives of English are the Scots language, spoken primarily in Scotland and parts of Ireland, and Frisian, spoken on the southern fringes of the North Sea in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany. As Scots is viewed by some linguists to be a group of English dialects rather than a separate language, Frisian is often considered to be the closest living relative.

&gt;After Scots and Frisian come those Germanic languages which are more distantly related, namely the non-Anglo-Frisian West Germanic languages (Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans, High German), and the North Germanic languages (Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese). With the exception of Scots, and on an extremely basic level, Frisian, none of the other languages is mutually intelligible with English, owing in part to the divergences in lexis, syntax, semantics, and phonology, and to the isolation afforded to the English language by the British Isles, although some such as Dutch do show strong affinities with English, especially earlier stages. Dutch, for example, is most similar to Middle English, while German and Icelandic are more like Old English. ",False,c0p82tm,,0,daftbrain,,4,0,0,True,t1_c0p82tm

Banks will be better regulated by Bank of England, who know their shit, unlike the FSA.

&gt; They will scrap Sure Start that gives great savings in the future as oppossed to the silly marriage proposals.

This would be a bad move; lets hope that local people can save Sure Start. This is one of the best things that Any Government anywhere has come up with.

I'm sick of crazy regulations, imposing uneeded costs, for example a contractor has to use a crane to change the bulb of streetlight, ladders not allowed.

I have no opinion on this but understand it. Kent has like over 100,00 Lib dem voters but it is 100% Blue.

&gt;Their talk of renegotiating links with the EU are farcical as it seeks free trade without workers/social rights. It's a non-starter and dog whistle politics. They would also want to scrap the highly successful European Arrest Warrant that helps catch the most despicable, purely because of hatred to Europe, a division they try to hide.

There is a fine line between managers rights and workers rights. Let's hope that we can get a fine balance. The workers should have a right to work and managers a right to manage.

There will be a time lag, so don't expect it to work over night. *They understand that people respond to incentives.* For example people can get a discount on council tax if they contribute to society, this potentially means a lot of things; more charitable work, more healthcare, more policing.

I think it's all a mater of trust. People who believe in their fellow people should vote Conservative. People who believe that government is best informed to make decisions should vote Labour (let's face it some times the government knows best).

I personally would not vote for Lib Dem, they emphasize fairness too much through direct intervention, at a time we need growth.

You're taking this out on context. The Israeli government bulldozing Palestinian homes has nothing to do with natural disasters or eminent domain. They're deliberating destroying homes and putting settlements in their place. I don't see what's neutral about that.

&gt; Actions by one government to another are not terrorism. Terrorism is violence directed against civilians.

Does that mean that Hamas is not guilty of terrorism because they are the government? Terrorism is usually defined in such a way to include states. The US ""War on Terror"" for example has been largely fought on that principle. So being a government does not mean that you can't be a terrorist. The expansion of settlements is definitely an attack on civilians who are being shoved out of their homes. And it was intended to coerce the Palestinian Authority. 

&gt; And what is Israel supposed to do with property taken in a war when the country they got it from does not want it and the people who do won't agree to a peace treaty?

I'm willing to accept that Israel was not in an easy situation, but building settlements all over your newly occupied land is no way to reach a peace agreement. Even if Israel's motivation was peace, which I find hard to believe, it's absurd to think that destroying people's homes and building on their land will do anything except anger them and radicalize part of the population.

&gt; Somehow that never gets mentioned here even though it would seem to have all of the same qualities as Israel/Palestine. Why do you think so many people here condemn Israel and are ignorant about Kashmir?

I don't think it's the exactly the same. If Pakistan was created by Europeans who were driving people out of Western India to create a new state, it would be more similar. That issue is about self-determination. But it is important, absolutely. Why doesn't Reddit talk about this? Well I can't speak for anyone, but I would imagine it's partly because most Redditors are Americans. There's growing discontent about how our tax dollars are being used in Israel, more than any other country receives from us.

&gt; I was thinking that the people moved in the India/Pakistan separation built lives on something other than continuing the fight.

Well those people still have a state and with it, certain rights. If India were to drive Pakistanis out of Kashmir, they do the unpleasant option of moving to another part of Pakistan away from the violence. Not so for a Palestinian. You may be driven out of East Jerusalem to Ramallah, but you still have no state and no rights. 

&gt; The Palestinians are refugees in camps because of political decisions made by various Arab leaders, not because Israel is evil.

Not defending the other Arab leaders (although they did allow many to become citizens before caving to political pressure, the people of those countries had a hard time taking the strain of so many immigrants), but I'm sure that to a refugee, returning home is more desirable than gaining a new one. 

&gt; Are there 2,500 year old Romani communities in Israel? 

The 2000 year old claim to the land has a lot of problems. First of all, imagine this as a legal precedent for the rest of the world. Virtually ever border on earth would be in dispute and there would be absolute chaos. Second is the problem of whose ancestors were there. Many Jewish people remained in the Middle East, intermarried and converted to Christianity and Islam. The Palestinians therefore have the same roots to the land. Similarly in Europe, people converted to and from Judaism. Tracing exactly who has claim to the land is impossible. You may say that the criteria should be based on the persecution of the Jewish people, which of course was very real. Maybe we can ignore the finer points in light of their suffering and their lack of a state of their own. This is exactly why I include the Romani. Their suffering was very similar to that of the Jews in Germany and Eastern Europe. They were slaughtered by the Nazis as well. To this day they have no state. They do not have a 2000 year old claim to Palestine, but the Palestinians have a 62 year old claim, going back many centuries. Why should the ancient claim take precedence when the land once belonged to their grandparents? 

&gt; Have the Romani been trying to return to Israel for 2,000 years? 

Nor have the Jewish people. Maybe in small numbers, yes, some did resettle there. For centuries, they lived in relative peace with Christian and Muslim neighbors. The idea to create their own state didn't arise until the late 19th century.

&gt; Did they move in legally by buying land and building communities?

It is true that parts of the land were purchased legally. But not 57% of it. Certainly not 80% of it. The British recommended their own partition plan to give only the areas that were largely in Jewish control to Israel, roughly 30%. The Zionists weren't very happy with that and the British turned it over the UN to come up with a solution. The one that narrowly won the vote put Jewish people in the minority in both states.

&gt; they objected to legal immigration and to Jews escaping the Holocaust by legally moving to the Mandate

There were Arab leaders after the Holocaust who said, ""Look, this was a horrible thing and we'll accept a share of the refugees to live within Palestine with full protection as equal citizens, if the US, Canada and Australia make the same offer. We're a small state and we just can't take everyone."" Of course, those states did not except the offer. Similar perhaps to how the Arab states have stopped accepting Palestinian refugees today.

That is undeniably a good thing. The difference between Chinese minorities like the Tibetans being taken over by China, and the Native Americans being consumed by European settlers is that China didn't *have* to invade these regions. It can be argued that it was inevitable that the Native Americans would eventually lose their land after explorers discovered North America, and settlers started crossing the Atlantic.

It has tried to hold onto these regions in the past only to protect China proper by creating a buffer zone, because the Great Wall wasn't working. The Han have always looked at the people of these regions as if they were of lesser value than themselves, and have always focused the most attention on improving China proper, while neglecting their buffer zone.

This has carried on into present day. Up until the past decade or so, these regions have seen exponentially less benefits than the east from China's modernizations and reforms. Even now, the situation is just beginning to improve for many of these people.

Maybe, if China had never invaded these regions and hadn't focused so much effort into getting them to assimilate, causing resistance and setbacks, while also neglecting the needs of their people, which has caused poverty and starvation, they would be much more prosperous today. On top of that, for the past 150 years or so, and up until around the 80's, China itself went into decline and eventually complete turmoil, and these regions were dragged along with it.

The person tossing the coin could be magician in total control of the outcome, forcing it to land how ever he sees fit. He could make it seem to disappear, change it into another coin or somehing else all together. These things can all be controlled for.

You cannot observe that they exist while alive, but only after death. That creates another set of unproven and unjustified assumptions.

The central problem with your argument about the carbon/land use/lifecycle of growing plants vs. animals is that all of this is an argument that is valid when you compare factory farmed meat with factory farmed vegetalbes.  When you compare factory farmed vegetables to local, env. responsible meat the story is entirely different.  This is something no vegan I've ever known has been able to grasp, even when they admit they eat Chinese GM soy all the time, and even when the jobs they work at serve local, env. sustainable dairy and meat.  

Veganism is not a choice people make to be env. responsible.  It is a religion they join and a lifestyle choice they make for either misguided reasons, out of some desire to be a radical, or because they don't like meat, or don't want to hurt fuzzy, cute little animals.

Maybe it is ok. Is it a possibility for you at all?  There are atheists that will teach their children nonsense or  immoral behavior by behaving certain way as there will be muslims, christians and jews. I mean if your children read some of the narrow minded responces to complex topics and insults that you have posted in your responses, I doubt it would teach them good lessons either. 

There are so many things that are wrong with your question that it inherintly prohibits you from seeing another other prespectives and learning anything useful and unbiased. 

It clumps together faith and religion, which are not the same thing at all. You yourself have faith in many things without requiring a proof. If you were to truly examine yout beliefs you would find that to be true.

Your view on the topic also merges religious laws with cultural traditions, which maybe often reinforced by religious views but do not always originate from religion. Such as burka question. You will find a wide variety of views on the topic among the muslims.

From what it sounds like you think your view is superior to that of people who follow anyt religion or have faith in God. This is kind of a view that has no proof and does not require any either. 

&gt;Arabic language does not contain magical properties which cannot be properly translated. The claim that one must be able to read the Qu'ran in its original form in order to truly understand it is nonsense.

It does not contain magical properties you right, but it is very difficult to translate certain things and you inevitably loose something. The english you speak today is the not the english that was spoken by peasants 200 years in Europe. That is the rules in english language were codified by aristocrats and not peasants, as such formatlities were included and constraints were imposed make it less then optimal for certain things. 

There is a question, how does the language that you speak influences how you view and understand the world.  
For example you say: ...things which haven't been proven *real*.

English word _real_ comes from Latin **res ""matter, thing,""**, which is different from **veritas : truth**, while in Arabic world _real_ and word _truth_ come from the same root word Haqq, which is also the in the absolute form Al-Haqq(The Truth) is one of the attributes of God. The Real Reality is Haqqiqa. This is just one examples. If you do not understand that or cannot see the difference you will not be able to understand  why people ""believe in a deity which has never been proven real"". Can you prove to me that reality is real?

Another example is word ""proof"" : Ayat (proof, evidence, verse, lesson, sign, symbol, revelation, etc.). However word _burhan_ is also translated as evidence or proof, but they have very different connotations. There are other words as well. In english it is the same word. 

But even take trying to translate victorian english which you cannot easily understand into modern english, it is no easy task and it is not the same. Or try translating some poetry from another language. 

You try to simplify complex topic to a degree that it is impossible to provide you with feedback that would be useful. 

*tl;dr;* Your question is a fail, your understanding is a fail, your project will also be a fail useful only to those who agree with your oppinions to begin with.

Federalism doesn't have a well defined meaning in the UK, could you please clarify what you mean? If you mean handing out more power to councils and decentralising I think you'll find that LibDems would be better choice, if you mean having an unfair voting system which encourages swaying to particular geographic regions rather than having general support everywhere then OFC you should vote Tory, but you should also be forced to move to a region where you vote doesn't count as it's a safe Tory/Labour seat.

&gt;The Cake must be shared equally and also be grown. This represents the latter action.

So the rest of us should pay more in order to keep the rich, rich? While labour have let the rich/poor gap grow, it's pathetic for the Tories to launch attack ads on the matter when:

1) The situation would be much worse if it were not for labour moves over the past 12 years

2) The Tory plans would actively stretch the gap.

&gt;  I'm sick of crazy regulations, imposing uneeded costs, for example a contractor has to use a crane to change the bulb of streetlight, ladders not allowed.

The regulations have more to do with the sue friendly culture that has arrived on the back of no-win/no-fee a m, without the regulations the council would get their asses sued off, now if the contractor ignores it, it's their problem.

&gt;Please expand

The claim that a hung/weak parliament will hurt the pound is dubious at best, yet the Tory's keep claiming it's true in order to scare off potential lib dem voters. They then claim that the current electoral system is the best way to vote because it always gives a strong parliament and it's better to force people to have a strong parliament even if the country is actually divided on the issue.


&gt;Hopefully, with 'Big Society' reforms, the safety net will be more efficient, better and more effective in getting people back to work.

Because hoping that charities do better than government agencies without funding or oversight is such a good way to improve the safety net.

&gt;There will be a time lag, so don't expect it to work over night.

There is a lack of proper policy, so don't expect it to work at all!

&gt;For example people can get a discount on council tax if they contribute to society, this potentially means a lot of things; more charitable work,

If it's goverment funded charity work then i want it to be regulated and checks and balances in place so i know how my money is being spent, infact i don't want it to be charity work at all i want the goverment to be held accountable dammit

&gt;more healthcare, more policing.

wait charity healthcare and charity policing, fuck that I want my doctors to be qualified and my police to be held in check and filling out enough paperwork to make sure they aren't hassling me or anybody unduly.

&gt; I think it's all a mater of trust. People who believe in their fellow people should vote Conservative. People who believe that government is best informed to make decisions should vote Labour (let's face it some times the government knows best).

If that's really what it's about, then why don't the Conservatives trust people enough to vote for a fair electoral system. Instead they know that FPTP benefits them and them alone (their only allies in European parliament are right wing nutjob parties)

Indeed, truly stupid policy.  The UK has enough class problems with the Government helping.

&gt;They will scrap Sure Start that gives great savings in the future as oppossed to the silly marriage proposals.

Is this true?  Have you got a link?

&gt;They will weaken Health and Safety in an environment where 1600 people die from work accidents.

I've no idea if there is any evidence for your claim.  Britain does seem to be slipping down the easy of business tables, which aren't the be all and end all but it's no ideal.

&gt;They still have prominent members who espouse homophobia and do not back the green line Cameron has pasted on.

Indeed he was wrong and he was rightly moaned at by everyone in the party.

&gt;They think saying change entitles them to Government but despise electoral reform. The warnings against coalitions has been rubbished by economists. When they talk of strong majority, they mean one third of people should have their way over the other two thirds.

There stall is that FPTP is the best system.  It is you who is trying to tie change and electoral reform together.  And don't use economists to back up your arguments, they can never agree on anything!

Aside:  If the vote is cast as it looks, I would say ER is still pretty likely.  You simply can't have a party getting a third of the vote and a sixth of the seats.

&gt;Their talk of renegotiating links with the EU are farcical as it seeks free trade without workers/social rights. It's a non-starter and dog whistle politics. They would also want to scrap the highly successful European Arrest Warrant that helps catch the most despicable, purely because of hatred to Europe, a division they try to hide.

European Arrest Warrants are a bit of dodgy area at the moment, when half of the new member's judiciary is corrupt as fuck. 

&gt;They just plain ignore the evidence of projects. If you are poor, vulnerable or sick, they don't care. If you are not, the effects on these people will affect you. And you are only one step away of falling through cut safety nets.

This is just twaddle.  Loads of completely untrue statements.  The Tories by far have the best plans for dealing with education.  Can't you see that Labour's statist system has failed the people who need it most.  A particular damming statistic is that if you are born poor and go to state school you are as likely to play for Man United as you are to go to Oxbridge.

I think the EU has created a lot of opportunities for our country. Aside from the business and social benefits, having people closer together prevents war and gives us a louder voice globally with China and the US. I do think however that the recent expansion was a bad idea. We should have allowed countries in at a slower rate, we now have a big divide in terms of standards of living that is causing the immigration issues.

&gt;Don't agree with their views on immigration

At least they are proposing something, tightening border controls and having a one off amnesty. The other parties have their fingers in their ears and don't have any alternative proposals to deal with that particular problem. The Tory cap is a PR exercise as it won't affect 80% of the immigration anyway, they say they want the figures in the 10s of thousands yet have no policies to actually make that happen. Labour hasn't proposed anything new either. The people that really care about immigration have been given nothing of any real substance from any of the 3 main parties.

&gt;Of course, I agree! Now, suppose we have a federal voting circle. We can't distinguish between French or Dutch voters/representatives anymore. Since there's very little communication between the population of north and south (different languages, the south being mostly oriented to France), more often than not a northern majority will outvote a southern minority. Do you think that's acceptable?

That's assuming the North will agree on what/how they vote. I see this as entirely unrealistic.

Also since legislation isn't tied to language anymore it becomes quite impossible to discriminate against one language.

I fail to see why he attracts so many supporters, Sam Harris would debate the shit out of him. In this case it actually is a failed rebuttal against **The End of Faith**. I am not going to completely give my opinion on this matter as I am writing a serious paper on the two books therefore I am going to give a few pointers as to where I think it's absolute crap.


First of all, he is considered by many to be a great philosopher and this statement enrages me for he is not a philosopher he is merely a theologian. If he was a philosopher he certainly wouldn't have gotten a degree. Let me enlighten you:


he starts off with a fictional account of a mother who commits suicide because her child *converted* to atheism. (Later on he says this is a reality and Harris must pay for it, or something like that -_-')


&gt; But why do I begin to address a work as seriousminded as that of Harris with an imaginary scene like the one above? Because realities that are far from imaginary are enveloped in this story, and I wonder what Harris would say to those possibilities.
(15)


From this statement alone you can see he is not a great philosopher nor a well-reasoned human. He begins with an *imaginary* story then suddenly there are *realities* enveloped in the story and from there on suddenly *possibilities*. So it is not real, it is real, it is possible. What is it? I am inclined to be a non-believer on this question as well.


I suspect it happens quite a lot in his other books but seriously, stop the fucking quote mining; here he takes Hawking and Penrose totally out of context because he probably has no understanding of math and physics.


The whole ""hey look at me I was an atheist, I thought like one but found Jesus!"" kitsch is bullshit, I suspect he was taken away from faith by smarter peers because it is evident that Zacharias can't think for himself, he feels a need to follow and believe. If he does not believe he'll commit suicide (and probably fail again).


&gt; I find Jesus to be more beautiful and attractive than ever before.
(28)

This guy is into the real hardcore stuff.


This is also annoying, he considers god to be a fact, to him it is absurd to question god. I find this ridiculous, he is either the biggest troll I know or he thinks god is as real as that screen you're looking at. You cannot reason with people like this.


He takes a stand against atheism because he thinks it has nothing, it's ""emptiness"". This emptiness leads to suicide, he says, because without religion you have no morality, no values and no meaning. Utter bullshit. ""Atheism is bankrupt for answers"" is his favorite saying throughout the book.


Again some philosophy, he regards the question ""What would a world be without god?"" to be devoid of philosophical meaning.


The book is filled with little gems like this: he uses the quote “Let’s recognize imagination for what it is.” - John Polkinghorne (31) as a way to deflect a non-beginning at the big bang but then immediately goes onto the God ""theory"". Isn't that just astounding? Seriously, logic does not apply to Ravi.


According to him Francis Crick was a nutcase.


As a Christian he is not able to grasp evolution:


&gt; As individuals and collectively as cultures, we humans long for meaning. But if life is random, we have climbed the evolutionary ladder only to find nothing at the top.

Top? Whatcha talking bout Willis? Evolution continues.


Oh yeah Hume and Sartre missed the point, he says.


Homophobe? 


&gt; I wonder what would happen if a movie that exposed homosexual practices, using medical research to evaluate the practice, were shown in our theaters.
(65)

Medical research? Is there something wrong with being gay?


A little bit of irony:


&gt;...to child pornography, atheistic philosophy is having its way with our children.
(72)

Seriously, I am not making this up.


According to him every airport in Europe is a sex industry, well I live in Belgium and he's wrong... again.


Sometimes though he is on to something:


&gt; Devoid of reasons for hope, people will create substitutes and follow cultic rituals they have devised in anticipation of realizing hope.
(74)

But he fails to see that this is exactly what he is doing.


I have loads of this rubbish but I'll end with this;
He attacks Harris for being too hard on Christians and says he is lying about Islam being a religion of violence, a couple of pages later he gives us this:


&gt; The disrespectful way in which Harris has addressed Muslims makes me wonder whether, if he were to make these same statements publicly in a Muslim country, he would leave unscathed.

Not constant. Monthly or bi-monthly. I'm going to see my grandmother today, and the trip is about 150 miles each way. I don't do this often, but there are other places I like to go that would not be accessible if I was limited to the range of the best that electric car technology has to offer now. Other places I couldn't go: the nearest beach, the nearest worthwhile city, and the city in which my parents live.

And I don't even have a family. When I was growing up, we took road trips in cars because there were five kids and flying would have been prohibitively expensive. Does it cost a lot to drive a Suburban halfway across the country? Sure. Does it cost more than plane tickets for seven people? Not even remotely. Would such a trip be possible if we had to pull over and charge the battery for five hours every three hundred miles? Hell no. These are occasionally-needed but still essential capabilities.

I blew $27k on my car. If I had to choose between a car that can get me to work and a car that can get me to work **and** let me do all this other stuff without it being a huge pain in my ass. I'll take the more capable vehicle, thank you. So would damn near every consumer. Which is why things are the way they are.

 *so no, you did not address my point. you are using 1 day examples per year to try to knock an argument. not reasonable.*

As I said, I think you underestimate the need for that type of capability. I go on trips that would be impossible in an electric car at least once a month and I am not at all atypical.

*did i say that gasoline cars would be outlawed? no. people would simply have to rent a car for their 1 day road trip where they drive 12+ hours the whole time. (remember, according to you, these people making road trips would not be stopping overnight)*

Or they could just buy a car that does what they want it to do. Which is what they do and will continue to do.

*the highest average trip length of any vehicle type: 15.6 miles on weekdays; 22.21 on weekends.*

Average doesn't matter. I agree that an electric car will cover a commute or daily use. But it doesn't cover use that happens significantly often for just about every car owner. 90% of the drivers that average 15.6 miles on a weekday will, once a month or so, have to drive their car a distance that exceeds the range of an electric.

*Yes, voters don't want to pay more. But lobbyists know that once gas prices go up, voters will start looking for alternative fuel cars, just like in europe. when less people buy gas, they lose money. they aren't going to let that happen.*

The oil companies aren't worried about that. Every last drop of oil in the Earth will be extracted and burned eventually, and they make about the same amount of money no matter how fast it is extracted.

No politician wants to put an arbitrary tax on gas because it is massively unpopular with voters. Rightly so, since it **fucks them for no reason except unicorn thinking**. 

*the reason america starts wars for oil is because of people like you. the tech is there to remove many gasoline cars from the road.*

No, actually it's because of people like you. Morons that are holding out for tech that may never come killed the nuclear industry in the US, and the lack of clean, abundant, cheap power killed any interest in battery tech that could have made your unicorn car feasible.

&gt;The key thing here is that we are beginning to unveil what I've labelled the dirty secret of wind: utilities don't like wind not because it's not competitive, but because it brings prices down for their existing assets, thus lowering their revenues and their profits.

*But there is one complication to this that environmentalists need to recognize.*

With the liberty of some simplification, electricity in the US and Europe is priced hourly in auctions. Each generator is asked for a price at which they are willing to generate electricity and for the amount of electricity they can generate. The auction clears **at the price where supply meets demand**, that is, every generator gets paid the same price no matter what it costs them to produce the electricity.

In a very simplified example, a small town requires 1000MW for the next hour. There are no wind generators that supply this town, only a coal plant and a natural gas plant. The coal operator can supply 700MW at a price of $20/MW, the gas operator can supply 500MW at $27/MW. The market will clear at $27/MW, taking 700MW from the coal plant and 300MW from the gas plant. The coal operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(700MW) = $18,900 for that hour and the gas operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(300MW) = $8,100. If we assume that both operators are pricing in $2/MW of margin (profit) into their prices, that means the coal plant profits ($27/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $6,300 and the gas plant profits ($27/MW - $25/MW)x(300MW) = $600.

Now say the town installs 500MW capacity of windmills. Let's rerun the scenario. The town needs 1000MW for one hour again. The wind operator says the wind is blowing moderately and it can supply 300MW for $2/MW (essentially his costs are $0/MW - he doesn't need to pay to use the wind and there are no workers and wages to pay). The operators put the same bids as before. Now the market clears at $20/MW because you only need the supply from the wind and coal operators to meet demand. Wind profits ($20/MW - $0/MW)x(300MW) = $6,000; coal profits ($20/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $1,400; and gas profits $0.

As you can see, the coal and gas plants become less profitable. So tough shit to them, right? Well okay fuck coal, but now you have replaced a relatively clean **and** reliable source (natural gas) with a clean **but** unreliable source (wind). **So the point is that wind (and solar) have a tendency to cut the profits of coal, but not necessarily eliminate their emissions** (in the example, coal was running at 700MW in both scenarios). Furthermore, wind and solar have the tendency to price **relatively clean and reliable** sources out of the market.

I am not trying to bash wind (or solar), but I just want people to realize they are not reliable sources of energy and they do not have the muscle to get rid of the cheapest and dirtiest emitters (coal).",False,c0p8gy7,,0,novalidnameremains,,33,0,0,True,t1_c0p8gy7

For example, Russia, to protect it's Southern border, has to keep at least some of the mountain range in the Caucuses.  Failing to do so would ultimately leave Russia open to future invasion from the South.  So Russia HAS to keep Chechnya, regardless of the political ramifications.  
  
America has the same situation.  We are only open to invasion by sea, so we are determined to maintain an enormous Navy.  It isn't an option, it is determined by our location on the planet.  
  
Germany is located in the middle of Europe, and it has learned that it cannot secure it's power using military means, so it must depend on political techniques, and the European Union has largely been the collaboration of France and Germany finding a way to use their power effectively.  Again, it isn't a plot, it is dictated by their circumstances.  
  
So lastly, I would say that the New World Order is not a plan on the part of some people to get us somewhere, but rather an outcome of the circumstances we find ourselves in.  An outcome of cheap travel and immediate communication.  America is very powerful and it exercises its power with certain lies, such as ""we are good and want to help you all"" when in fact we want full spectrum dominance regardless of the consequences.

&gt;Big society may be stupid, but charity certainly isn't. You could equally make a good argument that the state crowds out private charity.

We have been in the position where essential services, including health were provided privately and by charities, the result was poor delivery and limited access.  It is absurd to suggest that people should be reliant on charity for their basic needs if all else fails.  That said, the government should make it possible for charities to do what they do.  It is also dangerous for essential services to be delivered by charities that have more than one aim, I would be extremely alarmed at having religious societies of whatever stripe providing community support and essential services on the back of religious positioning.

&gt;The Bank of England will regulate banks, as it did before the FSA was set up.

And the regulators will be the same people.  This point is essentially one big reshuffle with little real value.

&gt;I don't have the figures to hand, but anyone who now owns a house in London has (or almost has) a million pound estate.

Some people in London who own houses have million pound estates, the average house price in Greater London is 370k not a million. Moreover it doesn't apply to partners so essentially the tax only becomes due when passing on a house to your children or others.  Moreover, having a house worth a million pounds is a big deal and inheriting a million pound house isn't common.  Plus, if you inherit a million pounds worth of house, you are by definition going to become rich (because you just received a million pound asset).  Now whilst I think that there should be protections in place to permit people to keep houses in their families (maybe pay the inheritance tax if the house is sold, or over a period of 10 years etc..) I don't think it is unjust.

&gt;Assassins Creed 2 ... The truth about the lame scene group Skidrow
&gt;and a message to the scene
&gt;
&gt;Protection: Ubi DRM
&gt;Date of Release: 25.04.2010
&gt;Type: Read NFO
&gt;
&gt;ÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛ
&gt;
&gt;First of all we would like to thank all people out there that helped us
&gt;beating ubisofts DRM for Assassins Creed 2.
&gt;
&gt;Now to the points of Skidrow which someone pasted us after the scene
&gt;nuked their theft of our work.
&gt;
&gt;1. You are true about how the orbit works BUT you did not even log a
&gt;single value yourself. This is easy proofable to all people that
&gt;would like to take the time and start logging from the very
&gt;beginning. Alot of values, which you recieve while logging we merged
&gt;in our database together into 1 or 2 lines Like 5 values 1 line but
&gt;if you log them yourself, they will never look like the given ones
&gt;from our value.db. Also there are some values which do not exist
&gt;in your released version of AC2. They are russian only!
&gt;
&gt;2. Of course we are not stupid and tagged our value.db. There are
&gt;several values inside that you can never log because they simple do
&gt;not exist. They are fake and used to tag our work from stealing.
&gt;I will not mention which one but as a hint it will be transformed
&gt;a greeting to ru forums as thanks for all our supporters there
&gt;logging values.
&gt;
&gt;3. The way you transformed the orbit is not good. If you want to play
&gt;any orbit game like Silent Hunter 5 or Settlers 7 or SPlinter Cell
&gt;you can not play them anymore even though you bought them. The
&gt;Skidrow crack fuxks up all originals you want to play. How stupid
&gt;is this ""leading force""
&gt;
&gt;4. Just for your info: Settlers 7 will be also tagged with values that
&gt;you can never recieve from the orbit. You might understand how the
&gt;orbit works but you will never understand how cracking works because
&gt;you steal almost everything. Let me proof this:
&gt;
&gt;- securom cracks: These ""cracks"" you supplied had never ever
&gt;the securom VM applied. They even still
&gt;include the debug codes from the times before
&gt;mastering
&gt;
&gt;- starforce cracks: Your cracks are lame. They are made of russian
&gt;cracks and often wrong rebuilt cause russian
&gt;code is different to european code or you
&gt;simple have access to another unproteced exe
&gt;that was never protected by starforce.
&gt;
&gt;- solidshield cracks: Your unprotected exes are super great
&gt;
&gt;5. Steam cracks: Your steam cracks are done exactly the way of
&gt;our russian RE forum. Its ok as its a tutorial
&gt;but if there is something new your fix arrives
&gt;directly after our forum serves the fix.
&gt;Guess the rest.
&gt;
&gt;6. next Ubisoft game: Oh yeah. Silent Hunter 5 without even testing!
&gt;wow. Settlers 7 with incomplete values or will
&gt;you wait till ours are complete?
&gt;
&gt;So at final conclusion to the fuckers of Skidrow:
&gt;
&gt;- Stop fucking around the real crackers if you are not able todo the
&gt;job yourself. Once the greatest cracking group on Amiga and now the
&gt;stupiest group on PC that steals whatever they can catch.
&gt;
&gt;- Stop destroying a name you can not serve proper with your work
&gt;
&gt;- Stop releasing when you can not crack yourself
&gt;
&gt;- Stop talking about other groups work when you dont even understand
&gt;it.
&gt;* Reloaded dll's are simple rebuilt functions
&gt;* Razor &amp; Reloaded Securom cracks are not emu for the protection
&gt;to be continued for all that the Skidrow fuckers do not understand.
&gt;
&gt;- Start thinking before typing bullshit in your nfos.
&gt;

&gt; wearing a bunny costume in public.

In that case you would have to imagine a scenario, where all the females of a sub set of 5-8% of the general population of major European countries began to wear Bunny suits ALL the time. Every day. 27/7... 

When asked why? They would respond, that it was completely voluntary and that they did so to honer the teachings of a (pedophile) bunny prophet, that had taken notes while speaking to the master Bunny God. 

When asked if it's not a bit warm during the summer, they would say, no way, we love it! And they would have specially crafted bunny suits for going to the beach... sort of like this: http://www.muslim-swimwear.com/ - for the same reason, public pools would have to have special hours where only bunny-women would be able to use them.

When ever someone pointed out, that it seems like an odd explanation and that the whole bunny thing was a problem, since women wearing them was unemployed and collected well fare (since no one wanted to hire people dressed that way), they would just state, that you were ""racist""... More over, every socialist voter would agree, adding that you were just scared of bunnies... 

The women constantly wearing bunny gear, would have husbands that did not wear bunny gear. Each of them would seek to have 4 bunny-custume-wearing-women and they would get a shit load of children. This would put a serious strain on the fabric of the European well fare societies in general. When asking for details, the bunny-crowd would causally explain that the bunny stance towards life is superior.

When Bunny-wearing-women was asked why they had to collect well fare, if the whole bunny-thing, was smarter, than anything else... they would respond by shouting ""Infidel"" and ""racist"". If probed for some explanation as to why the Bunny-Majority countries all suck and people living in them are piss poor, they would respond in a similar manner. To top things of, they would also threaten to kill people, that stated anything like ""Bunnis are BS"" for instance in art or poetry... for the reason, that it is not allowed according the bunny God.  

Children from Bunny-homes would frequently be unable to complete school (that is be illiterate) and much more likely to go end up in jail... While there parents would be working actively for Bunny-law to be made general, since the bunny way of life is superior - you see...

If anyone uttered, lets ban this crazy bunny-thing, socialists would get all agitated and speak of freedom of religion...  Great stuff.

Doesn't actually matter in terms of free speech and religious equality. As long as they are not causing harm to others or preaching harm, which they are not and wearing a burqa certainly isn't they can have any beliefs they want. The same bigoted, racist views you hold are also protected by these ideals by the way. 

&gt;Do you have any evidence that its a free choice?

The multiple women who wear a burqa and have come out and said it's a free choice? Do you have any evidence that women who wear short skirts and bikini's in public are not doing so because their husbands or partners are forcing them to? Should we ban them as well then? If extreme abuse is occuring in a relationship then this should be investigated on a case by case basis, you can't make blanket laws that simply assume everybody wearing a burqa is being abused, it's nonsense. You have nothing to show otherwise either. 

&gt;My religion is that you must die. Clearly you respect that right? Its in the human rigthzy thingy --- you just have to live with it... or wait...

Fortuantly only extremist muslims hold that view as do extremist Christian groups and others and honestly if you hold that view as a religious belief, as long as you don't act upon it or tell others to do the same then obviously you can have the view. Thought crime is not a crime. 

For example, whenever we talk I have a strong urge to throttle you. 

&gt;No, because they are not a threat to the freedom of the rest of us. They are not criminal and on welfare while breeding like hell.

Neither are women wearing the burqa. This law applies to 30 women in belgium, women wearing the burqa are an incredibly tiny portion of wider Europe as well pray tell how exactly 30 people equate into a growing and breeding population? 

&gt;No, because they are not a threat to the freedom of the rest of us. They are not criminal and on welfare while breeding like hell.

See above. 

Note, you can not make discriminatory laws against a group of people while ignoring everybody else. It's ironic you talk about Nazism when what you are proposing is EXACTLY what the Nazi's did. They signalled out the Jews for special treatment within Germany as they saw them as a threat when of course in reality no threat existed and they were just a scape goat. But it's fairly obvious you're a racist bigot so it isn't surprising you'd accept Nazi policy. 

&gt;Perhaps, if you are blind stupid and Muslim at the same time?

Considering I'm a white, British atheist then I think not. 

I just realise that plenty of good people died to protect peoples freedoms and what you are proposing spits on their courage. If we had it your way we'd be marking every Muslim with a crescent moon then sending them off to concentration camps.

They opposed it because the government could not show a need, Hague stated at the time that if the government could show that there was a need that they would support it.  They did support 28 days.  As to ID cards, I couldn't agree more, Conservative opposition and a strong commitment to getting rid of them if they take power are all good things.  However it isn't all plain sailing, it is worrying that they haven't been more clear on what they intend to do with the HRA and they take almost the same position as Labour on the retention of DNA from people who are not convicted.  They are also looking to politicise the police (with elected individuals responsible for police priorities) which I think is dangerous from a rights and civil liberties perspective (but that may just be as a result of the various NPT meetings I have attended...).  They also seem to ignore the issues with RIPA and indeed pro internet monitoring and intrusion in that area.  They also seem to prefer closer ties to the US (rather than Europe) and I see problems there with both extradition and indeed cooperation with the US in other areas.

&gt;The Lib Dems are better on civil liberties (another reason I'm voting for them), but I don't buy the argument that ""the tories would have done the same""

The Lib Dems generally are, and whilst I am not suggesting that the tories would have done just the same, I find that they are and have been broadly supportive of things I dislike that Labour have or continue to do and I am no happier with conservative social engineering than I am with some elements of Labour social engineering.

&gt;We have the chance to get rid of the government that did. 

We do, but we need to replace it with something that is better, not just different, or worse but in different ways...

&gt;Besides, all this shit requires massive amounts of public spending, something the tories have never been fond of.

Well.. That isn't overly accurate.  The Tories are generally just as happy to spend as Labour, the difference is usually where they spend (and where they get their money from, everyne seems to conveniently forget that Thatcher had access to massive N Sea oil revenues and still managed to dump half the country in the shitter).  In principle though, I agree.  However, I will say that Tory support and traditional Tory positions tend to be a bit divisive and a large portion of their supporters are in the same group demanding action against people on the grounds that they could be youths, criminals, pedophiles, terrorists or some immigrants etc... In short, I don't trust the Tories not to do other things I don't like.

I suppose the fact is that I would prefer a Labour party that had old labour values and dropped the 'hard on crime' authoritarian streak,  unfortunately that group doesn't exist (the closest being the Lib Dems).  That said, if I had to put in order of preferences the three main parties that are standing, I would go Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative, because I know that as someone who lives in Sheffield, has family in Newcastle and Durham, is unmarried but has four kids, owns a small business (and remembers the 80's.) that the conservatives are going t make things worse for me ad quite possibly the country, than the other two.

also, rebut this point. why is that europe has more fuel efficient cars than the usa in an effort to cut down on pollution? it's because once gas prices went up, european car makers invested in better technology.

**1999** - US: Controversy Surrounds Evergreen State College Graduation Ceremonies. Governor Gary Locke refuses to speak at 1999 Graduation because Mumia Abu-Jamal, US political prisoner on death row, chosen as Honorary Speaker. 

&gt;In an attempt to stifle freedom of speech &amp; student representation, last week, state troopers &amp; local law enforcement associations pressured Locke to rescind his acceptance of the invitation to speak so as not to share the stage with the controversial figure. 

&gt;The significance of choosing this man as graduation speaker: Evergreen chose to accept the unprecedented opportunity to hear this man speak at graduation. In an historic moment that denies particular people their rights to speak &amp; be heard, Mumia represents the voice of struggle &amp; strength despite the shackles of imprisonment. Committee members cited Mumia's reflections on education &amp; freedom as parallel to the philosophy of Evergreen. 

&gt;The students also wish to publicize his case in order to raise public awareness of the case &amp; the prison crisis in this country. Racism in death penalty sentencing is blatant &amp; shocking. Selecting Mumia Abu-Jamal as the graduation speaker is an historical opportunity &amp; will reverberate beyond the walls of this particular institution.

**2001** - Switzerland: Demonstration in Zurich between a group of globalization opponents &amp; the police. The police tried to control the demonstation with substantial tear gas application &amp; rubber projectiles. 

**2001** - Governments resort to police violence against international May Day protests... 

May Day demonstrations around the world on Tuesday gave voice to growing discontent over poverty, unemployment &amp; the impact of global capitalism on the lives of ordinary people. Alarmed at the rising tide of protest, many governments responded with police violence. 

In England: A massive police presence — according to some reports outnumbering protesters by 2 to 1 — greeted May Day rallies in London. Some 6,000 officers were on duty or standing by, &amp; 30 police vans were stationed in Whitehall to prevent demonstrators gaining access to Downing Street, the residence of Britain's prime minister. 

Several thousand participate in anti-corporate demonstrations organised loosely around the theme of “May Day Monopoly”, with small rallies taking place at several London sites featured in the board game. The protests, organised by a variety of anti-globalisation, anarchist &amp; environmentalist groups, are denounced as “spurious” by Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

In Zurich, Switzerland, police sealed off the financial district of the city from protesters &amp;, at the conclusion of a peaceful march, surrounded 400 masked anti-globalisation anarchists. After the demonstrators threw rocks &amp; paint bombs, police responded with overwhelming force, firing rubber bullets, water cannon &amp; tear gas before launching baton charges. Some 200 arrests were made. 

Riots &amp; street fighting took place between police &amp; demonstrators in Berlin, Germany, following a ban of the annual “autonome” (anarchist) demonstration implemented by city interior minister Eckart Werthebach. A total of 9,000 police were mobilised to stop thousands of anarchist &amp; anti-fascist demonstrators from carrying out a planned march. Street fighting erupted as police used water cannon &amp; truncheons to clear several hundred demonstrators from a crossing in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. 

An estimated 100,000 rallied in Vienna, Austria, demanding job security. Large crowds took part in traditional marches in France, Italy, Spain &amp; other European Union states with concern over unemployment among the main slogans. 

Some 20,000 marched through Istanbul, Turkey, denouncing the treatment of political prisoners &amp; government economic policies. 

An estimated 300,000 people took part in May Day rallies in 480 cities across Russia, calling for higher wages, improved social security &amp; price controls. In Siberia, an area hard-hit by industry &amp; mine closures since the restoration of the capitalist market, over 50,000 were reported to have demonstrated. Throughout Eastern Europe, rallies denounced the vast social decay that has accompanied the return of capitalism. 

In Pakistan, the police &amp; military pre-empted planned anti-government protests by imposing de-facto martial law in Karachi &amp; banning all outdoor demonstrations. Up to 1,000 members of opposition parties were arrested in morning raids. 

In South Korea's capital Seoul, 15,000 riot police used batons &amp; water cannon to block a march on government buildings by 20,000 members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU). 

Indonesian police attacked a rally of 2,000 workers in the West Javanese city of Bandung as they marched on government offices. 

Some 1.5 million people took part in May Day activities in Sao Paulo, Brazil, under banners condemning the free trade agreement for the Americas. The events paralysed the northern sections of the city. 

In Buenos Aires, Argentina, unemployed workers established street barricades in industrial areas to protest against joblessness. In Colombia, rallies took place in 30 cities against the 18.8 percent official unemployment &amp; continuous paramilitary violence. A large rally in Santiago, Chile, denounced unemployment &amp; government steps to freeze wages. Workers demanded jobs in Montevido, Uruguay, where an outbreak of foot &amp; mouth disease has led to mass layoffs in meat packing plants. 

In Long Beach, California, police fired rubber bullets &amp; arrested 100 anarchist demonstrators who disrupted traffic to protest the treatment of immigrant workers. Some 1,200 people marched in Portland, Oregon calling for an end to corporate greed &amp; an investigation into the police shooting of a Mexican immigrant last month. May Day protests focusing on the plight of immigrants in the US also took place in New York, Boston &amp; Chicago. 

Rallies were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver &amp; other Canadian cities. 

Across Kenya, workers boycotted official May Day celebrations en masse to protest the collaboration of the trade unions with the austerity policies of the government. At the conclusion of the official event in the capital Nairobi, riot police dispersed the small crowd to prevent opposition politicians addressing them &amp; criticising the union federation. Riot police also attacked workers in Harare, Zimbabwe, when they tried to prevent groups connected with Prime Minister Robert Mugabe taking over the rally. 

**2002** - England: Anarchists plan jubilee mayhem. Protest groups join forces to disrupt Queen's celebrations &amp; bring May Day chaos to the capital. The Movement Against the Monarchy (Mam) is gearing up for a summer-long campaign, which will include an attempt to take control of London's Millennium Bridge on 4 June while the Queen is attending a service in nearby St Paul's Cathedral. 

**2002** - US: Festival Del Pueblo / Festival Of The People (May 1st - 5th), Boston, Ma. 5-day celebration of resistance, of community, &amp; of freedom inclueds demonstrations, direct actions, community carnival, bookfair, free school, revolutionary soccer tournament, revolutionary music festival, &amp; cultural gathering. Endorsed by the NorthEastern Federation Of Anarcho-Communists (NEFAC) &amp; the Boston branch of the Industrial Workers of The World (IWW). 

**2002** - Australia: Police clash with thousands of antiglobalization protesters. 

**2002** - England: May kicks off with a minor riot in Soho which saw our street blockaded by armoured police while mounted ones charged up London's Shaftesbury Avenue. All this while hordes of unwashed harridans claiming to represent Soho's sex workers danced maniacally to the tribal drumming of anarchist musicians &amp; what appeared to be dressed down office workers armed with flutes. There was still something highly suspect in the sight of a lot of protesters marching in support of sex workers when actually, if truth be told, they would rather close down or censor the strip clubs, sex shops, porn videos, et al, on the grounds that they are deemed to exploit, &amp;/or, degrade men &amp; women. 

**2006** - US: One million protesters hit the streets nationwide, in school walk-outs, &amp; a day of rest for many workers who fail to show up at work, opposing attempts to criminalize some 12 million immigrant ""illegals"" &amp; to highlight rightwing attacks on their civil rights.

Now that the EU appears to be demonstrating they're not likely to activate a bailout without a default, the S&amp;P rating has been revised to its normal position based on the relative public debt and the chance of servicing it.

As this rating has been revised, it has normalised the price for buying more debt, and since the only way Greece was servicing debt was by getting more, it has made it practically impossible to do anything but default without assistance.",True,c0p92ef,,0,phira,,4,0,0,True,t1_c0p92ef

Yes. That is the point. The Fed is supposed to be quasi-independent of the government so that, while the President--as the elected representative of the people--has influence over it, direct control is not exerted by the government. The Fed is supposed to act in the best interests of the economy as a whole, not exactly how Senator So-and-so and the coal interests in his state want it to. 

&gt;Fiat money is the creation of debt out of thin air, in as much that there is NEVER enough money to pay the interest owed on the original creation and loan that the Federal Reserve Corporation extends to the US government; it can never be paid back.

The size of our economy--the total income earned or the total amount of goods and services produced--is intended to constantly increase (apart from periodic downturns). Thus, the supply of money should expand to keep up with the new volume of goods and services, income etc. Without that expansion we would see constant deflation and sky-high interest rates. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve Corporation did NOT save the world from the dark ages by printing $1.3 trillion and to imply such a thing is to not understand the dark ages or the ability of states to self-govern and self-correct.

It's not a fucking corporation. The ""dark ages"" metaphor is not to be taken literally. The Fed's monetary policy actions (low rates, QE, and monetary expansion) --along with Congressional fiscal policy in the form of stimulus, tax cuts, extension of benefits, etc.--did save the economy from total financial collapse and another Great Depression in 2008-10. 

&gt;Fiat money allows for the government to confiscate value from citizens covertly.

You mean inflation? Yes, Fiat money involves value loss for those who keep cash only. The same thing happened in Europe in the gold-and-silver standard era when silver flooded in from the New World in 1500-1700. Inflation occurs. Stop freaking out about it. Oh, and nice job backing your argument up with a quote from that noted Economic thinker Ayn Rand (and don't tell me the fact that Greenspan added some chapters gives it economic clout--he helped pilot this ship towards the iceberg). 

Injecting money into the system through QE freed up liquidity and stopped a massive contraction in the money supply because of the crisis of confidence. The result will be higher inflation over the medium term. Your savings account will have its value eroded more quickly than it would otherwise, until you can secure a higher rate of interest.

Add to that strong unions with a culture of striking, and parliamentary system where it is easy to bring down governments that don't cater to the public, and you have politicians who get their jobs by cooking the books and ignoring the problem.  

None of this is anything that hasn't happened before in Greece and other countries.   What's different is the euro.  Before, you could compensate with monetary policy, devaluing your currency, reducing your debt, and causing inflation.  It was painful, but the economy took care of the austerity, without politicians have to stick their necks out too far.

With the euro, Greece doesn't control its own monetary policy, so its options are limited.  EU policies are going to be weighted towards the larger countries with larger economies, and are likely not optimal for Greece's current situation.  

I don't see this as an indictment of European social democracies...more of a worst case scenario.  Social programs are fine, but the still have to be paid for, and Greece has been in denial about this for a while.

Also, it show the folly of letting nation pride blind you to the reality that your economy is not mature enough to meet the sometimes strict obligations of the EU.  Joining was probably a mistake, and Greece would now be better off with the drachma.

The EU is a great big black hole sucking in cash and taking out a lot of the checks and balances in the free markets, not just in the UK.

In addition to the millions of non EU workers in the UK there are over a million more from the EU and with Turkey poised to join up, it can easily be millions more. It would be good if the figures were more readily available but when you're in the 6 digits, its irrelevant to my argument.

Its irrelevant because I'm not anti-immigration, quite to the contrary. Libertarian economists like Milton Friedman have taught that immigration is a good thing, when people come to work, their labour accounts for something, they contribute to the economy. My main problem is welfare.  Its no good when people come here not to work but to go on the dole, of which many are.

Another problem, a huge problem is our minimum wage, which is a lot higher than in say poland where its 291 GBP p/m. Compare that to ours which is 1005 GBP p/m, what you get is Poles coming to with the same sit of skills, working much harder, longer hours with much less living expenses as they pool rides and dorm together.

To crown it all, they don't spend their earnings here, they send their wages home to relatives, or portions of it and after a few years go home.

These are a few examples of how the checks and balances are done away with when we open our border for migrant workers without thinking it through. Only recently did we pass a new law requiring them to work here at least two years before being able to sign onto the dole.

I mean whatever, I don't know why I'm having a debate with a racist.  Racism is like one of the dumbest of all the dumb things that people believe.  It's almost as dumb as believing in God or that blowing yourself up in a crowd of innocent people is a good idea.

But since you're here, and you're listening, I'll say a few things.

Here's the deal -- you've got these genes, right?  And the genes determine all sorts of things about you, your hair color, how tall you are, whether you get certain diseases, how smart you are (maybe) -- all sorts of stuff.  And your neighbor, unless he's your identical twin, has a whole different set of genes.  Got me so far?

Ok so all these genes arose in different ways along the way due to natural selection, etc.  And so it happens to be the case that people in some parts of the world have these genes that sort of ""come from"" that part of the world, in the sense that if you go to that part of the world, LOTS of people have that gene, whereas if you go home to Britain or wherever you're from, not so many people have that gene.  You know, dark skin, narrow eyes, that kind of thing.  It's a gene that has a kind of ""nationality"" whereas other genes (like being tall or short, or being able to move your ears, for example) don't really have a nationality -- they are found everywhere.  There are weird reasons for that, like there's more sunlight in Africa, and it's cold in Europe so Europeans are hairier, etc.

Now here's the thing that scientists have found -- by doing experiments and examining the genes themselves.  When you're sitting there in Britain talking to your neighbor, and he's short and has red hair and blue eyes, and you're tall with green eyes, the fact is you're more likely to be different from him than you are to be different from a black person, when you examine the entire genotype.  In other words, if you take a whole mess of people and segregate them by whether they have these location-specific ""race"" genes (for example, separate them into the blacks and the whites), there is more variation *within* the groups than there is *between* the groups.

If you look around you, you'll see this actually is really true.  Take a really close look at a group of whichever nonwhite group it is that you think you're so much better than.  Look at their faces, their bodies, listen to their voices.  Look at the way they move around.  There's a tremendous amount of variety among them.  Just like there's a huge amount of variety in any group of white people.  On the other hand, if you take these people and sort of average all these characteristics together to make person A, and then you take all your white friends and average their characteristics together to make person B, you'll find that person A and person B only differ in a few, small ways.

This is the general idea as to why racism is just stupid.  You're walking around all day meeting people, and they have all these crazy all over the place genes that manifest in all sorts of ways, and you don't blink an eye, but then you walk by a black person and you see this black skin and you're like ""Oh!  I know that gene -- that's one of those African genes, isn't it?  Oh, well that means this person is inferior.""  Couldn't be stupider.",False,c0p9jzo,,0,eeeeaaii,,14,0,0,True,t1_c0p9jzo

Eliot, maybe the leading English-language poet of the entire century, has a bit in *Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar* (1920), where he’s describing a disgusting society in decline:

&gt; The rats are underneath the piles.	
&gt; The jew is underneath the lot.	
&gt; Money in furs.

How antisemitic Eliot was, or how forgivable his antisemitism is, is a whole different issue. The point is, someone educated at the best schools of America, France, and Britain could put stuff like that in a serious poem and critics would puff their pipes and nod.

Hitler took power in 1933, when his antisemitic ideas were already clear. Over the next seven years, things got steadily worse for the Jews – and the Roma, and several other ethnic groups, and the disabled, and homosexuals, and Jehova’s Witnesses, and anyone who spoke up. And the rest of the world didn’t do much more than complain. In mid-1938, they [discussed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évian_Conference) taking in refugees and basically decided not to. The US only withdrew its ambassador (and without breaking diplomatic relations) after [Kristallnacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht), late that year. [Even in 1939](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis), Jewish refugees were denied entry to the US and other countries because they couldn’t pay fees or didn’t have return addresses.

During the war, it was clear that something was happening to the Jews in Axis territory, but the assumption was that it was merely POW-style encampment, perhaps involving forced labor, with mass executions on a relatively small scale: something comparable, perhaps, to [the US internment of Japanese Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment), which was disgusting but not genocidal. The Nazi line was that the whole system was basically mere apartheid.

There were accounts leaking out from the camps. [Witold Pilecki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki), a member of the Polish resistance, let himself be taken to Auschwitz and made detailed reports which reached the Allies. The high command assumed these were very exaggerated, plus there was no way to make a surprise direct assault on the camp, deep inside Poland, with any chance of getting the prisoners out safely; they were essentially hostages. But reports kept coming in: [the Gerstein Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerstein_Report), etc. Two more escapees from Auschwitz gave [an account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrba-Wetzler_Report) that was described on the BBC and in the *New York Times* in June 1944. This was (as far as I know) the first time the general Allied populace heard about the gas chambers, but there still wasn’t a lot of credence for the huge numbers being reported – 30,000 people killed in one day at Birkenau, etc.

In summer 1944, to push back against these rumors, the Nazis took the Danish Red Cross on a tour of Theresienstadt (Terezín), a ghetto in Prague. The Red Cross representatives were not allowed to talk to the Jews, but the Nazi guides did, and they seemed reasonably humanely treated. The representatives saw shops, [a children’s opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundibar), etc. – all pretty much what the Nazis claimed: mere apartheid. The Red Cross was reasonably satisfied. Later it became clear that Theresienstadt was simply a staging area for Jews headed to the extermination camps. Many of them had been taken there early to make it look less crowded. The Nazis even had a Jewish film director make [a film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresienstadt_\(film\)) there, which Wikipedia says was to be called either *Terezin: A Documentary Film of the Jewish Resettlement* or *The Führer Gives the Jews a City*. He was soon killed, along with most other residents.

All this to say that (1) the Nazis covered their tracks extremely well considering the scale of the enterprise, and (2) the Allies were disinclined to believe, or act on, what reports there were. They were fighting for their own freedom and for the future of civilization, not Jews. I think it’s fair to say that in the West now, the Holocaust is central to the popular understanding of WWII. But **while it was being fought, WWII was not really about the Holocaust**.

And this view of it could not change overnight. Outside the tribunals, no one was in the mood to parse out the difference between the war and the crimes against humanity. It wasn’t so much ignorance or denial as it was overload. The homecoming GIs tended to have other things on their minds. The Holocaust, as mind-breakingly enormous a thing as it is, accounted for only a tenth of [WWII’s casualties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties). Ten million Chinese civilians died, and the US killed a fifth of a million Japanese civilians over four days. I’m sure people who were in heavy combat had trouble thinking much about anything else. So in immediate postwar America, the idea of the war was mostly the war proper – the thing that thousands upon thousands of GIs had actually seen. As weird as it sounds now, in their context, the systematic, governmental murder of millions of residents based on race didn’t seem outstandingly disturbing at first.

So what happened between 1945 and the period hiffy is talking about? Basically, time passed. Ordinary people got enough perspective to distinguish between normal war and crimes against humanity. Academics slowly came to grips with something of a kind that had never been understood before. (There have been many huge genocides, but this was the first one that was seen as such and was committed by people whom English-speaking people saw as peers. The details of this are debatable, but it’s interesting to compare the reaction to the Holocaust to, for example, [the Imperial Japanese occupation of China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre).)

The semi-taboo was because there was no stable academic foundation before *The Destruction of the European Jews*. It’s a little like how it would be seen as tacky right now to write scholarly historical papers about civilian casualties in Iraq, or the Sri Lankan Civil War – we don’t have the facts yet and we can’t really trust each other not to be partisan. Plus, of course, there was the horrible scope of the thing: where do you start? What can you presume to say? So until Hilberg came along, sorted through a mountain of paper, and presented a relatively bland and factual record, most everyone was afraid of making a fool of themselves by taking the wrong approach to a subject that’s both huge and hugely important.

**Tl;dr**: 

&gt; Surely it would have been impossible to not notice that there suddenly were hardly any Jews around in Europe anymore?

They noticed but they didn’t know what to think or do about it.

&gt; Or is it simply the manner in which they were murdered that was largely unknown?

More yes than no. Nearly everyone who could have told was killed.

&gt; And why was it considered ""taboo"" when Nazi Germany had *lost* the war?

Because no one knew how to talk about it in a rigorous or useful way.

Phew. As I say, I’m no expert, and I’m sure there are mistakes here, whose corrections I will welcome.

The point is, if you want a functioning democracy, with equality for all, there has to be some basic minimum we all subscribe to and that needs to inculcated in our publicly funded schools. Those basic values do look a lot like mini-liberalism. Guess what? Our country was founded on responsible government and individual rights.

By your logic then, we should have tax-payer funded schools for religious extremists? How do we draw the line? I suggest we don't. We just stop funding religious schools. If people want to send their kids to Sunday School, or to private religious schools that don't take public dollars, I'm ok with that. But, when you ask me to spend my tax dollars, I expect it will be spent enhancing and protecting the basic minimum guarantees of equality and defending a democratic nation from being pulled apart by anachronistic (ie. theological, racist, sexist, or homophobic) and sectarian beliefs.

I dare you to find one exception or loophole in the Charter. It's a list of rights for each individual. If you're speaking about other parts of the constitution you may not entirely understand the historical context. For one, aboriginal societies were nations that the Europeans made treaties with. They've gotten the raw end of the stick, and whenever they ask our government to honour the treaties, they instead get an earful of ""why are all these exceptions for you and not me?"" Has it dawned on you that if you live in B.C. you likely live on land that was never ceded by the natives and was guaranteed by Her Majesty could only be given up by fair negotiation? You should send them a rent cheque before you start complaining about the exceptions they have.

As for Catholicism embracing homosexuality, you are just splitting hairs. The Church does not allow them to marry and therefore does not welcome their sexuality. It asks them to bury it under a blanket of shame. Meanwhile, you'd like your fellows to gather together to freely associate. Fine, you have that right. But don't use my tax money to do it and don't suggest a Catholic or religious society would be the cure for greed, which you lay on individualism. Catholicism has much to atone for--dare I start: the Inquisition, the denunciation of Galileo, the banning of literature, the oppression of French Canadians, the tacit support of the Nazis, the rape of children.

Now the issue is that the law passed in AZ, which shares a border with Mexico - thus it is a reasonable assumption to assume that the law is primarily targeting illegal immigrants coming from Mexico (I haven't noticed any news stories about large scale Eastern European illegal immigration rolling through AZ). The fear is that the language of the law, which tells officers they can demand proof of anyone's legal status based on ""reasonable suspicion"", means that this opens the door for officers to begin demanding papers from anyone who looks, in the officers mind, like they may be from Mexico. And I'd be willing to guess that if you polled a random sample of Americans asking what a Mexican looks like, you'd get a fairly stereotypical response, thus implying that these are the people who will be targeted by the law.

Now, I will agree that the language of the law is definitely not targeting any specific race (which doesn't make it any better, since there have been numerous cases stating that anyone on US soil does not have to hand over identification papers just becuase an officer asks you for them).

a) disproportionate influence on US politics.

Can you think of *any* restrictions that you might think should be applied in general, regardless of religion, sex or ethnicity?

&gt; Well, the way our government is set up, it would take amending the
&gt; constitution, which is extraordinarily difficult. 

Your perspective on time is distorted. Imagine an ideology that is tireless and works with a say, 500 year scope. Here in EU, Muslims are simply out breeding us... It might be dramatic, but given US history, try to think of current US citizens as the Indians.

&gt; They would have to actually repeal our bill of rights first and then
&gt; institute such laws. Even 60% of the population would not be
&gt; sufficient to do so. It would take almost universal agreement.

Muslims in general seek to have at least 4 male children. They are simply having more kids and they are Muslim too... they don't convert or become atheists either. This goes on, generation after generation.

&gt; We do have crazy Christians here - perhaps not as violent at the
&gt; radical Muslims overseas, but many of them would have no problem
&gt; with violence. 

Naturally, but there is a difference between hitting someone in the head with a fist and cutting off their head right?

&gt; My point is that since these Christians can't even get the government
&gt; to implement their (relatively minor) religious agendas as law
&gt; (constitutional amendment defining marriage for example), the
&gt; chances of getting radical Islamic laws passed is pretty much nill.

Again, Christians are very limited in their use of violence in accordance with their religion. It would be hard for Christians to take 1000 kids hostage and torture them. This is not the case for Islam. We have any examples of such violence. A handgrenade to a girls school here and there. Killing and torturing people and taping it on video, while chanting for Allah.

Never saw ANY of that shit with Christians. Have you ever seen a video of Christians intentionally killing killing civilian Muslims while praising Jesus and celebrating in general...? I know I haven't.

&gt; Individual rights are indeed the cornerstone of our constitution. 

For as long, as there is a majority of people supporting this... You better start getting some more kids.

&gt; As for the right to bear arms, the US Supreme court has ruled that it
&gt; is in fact an individual right. Some states have more restrictions than
&gt; others but in no states are guns banned.

And in Arizona you have to identify if asked to?... Trust me, what ever they put on paper, it will be hard to do anything, once the Muslims begin to do their thing. Bombing and attacking random civilians, while also attacking people that speak against it. Even your system was not designed to handle that sort of strategy.

Without question, Islam definitely engages in more atrocities than any other modern religion.  It is extremely disconcerting.  You will get no argument from me about that.

&gt;And in Arizona you have to identify if asked to?

No.  That has been blown way out of proportion. Legal immigrants are already required by Federal law to carry around their identification.  Arizona just gave the officers more power to enforce it.  They can't randomly stop people and ask for papers.  They have to already be engaged with the person on an unrelated matter.  That said, I am certain it will be abused and I am not in favor of it.

No, but IMHO its a good start. We need to make clear, that there is nothing moderate about Islam, therefore it is no more acceptable to wear those outfits than it is to wear a Nazi uniform in public.

I think the difference is that the Western way is supposed to be the way of freedom.   When we start banning clothing, it is a step toward their way.  A small step, yes.  Minuscule.  A step nonetheless.

&gt;If anything, allowing them to wear it, so they can see how many followers of evil there really is will galvanize them.

Embolden is probably a better word to use but I see your point.  Nevertheless, giving them something to point to and say they are being persecuted can arguably fuel the fire and strengthen the ""us vs. them"" mentality.

&gt;The only issue, is that nothing seem to indicates that path of events. We have third generation Muslims here. Still they prefer Mohamed over free speech and democracy. They still oppress their women, indoctrinating little girls to wear veils. Demanding halal food in public schools etc. etc The list if endless.

I don't know.  I have seen some American Muslims who get enticed by our culture.  It may be the exception instead of the rule, or it could be that for the time being, we mainly attract those Muslim immigrants who already had a secular predisposition.  It's hard to say for sure.

&gt;We need to make clear, that there is nothing moderate about Islam, therefore it is no more acceptable to wear those outfits than it is to wear a Nazi uniform in public.
&gt;Today, the only real difference is that the Neo-Nazis know that will get attacked if they try to wear shit like that. Unfortunately most citizens in the western world seem to think that Islam is kosher...

I don't personally see Islam as kosher, nor any sort of oppressive religion.  Islam is definitely the biggest offender as far as violence in modern times goes, however.  Here, people can wear a Nazi uniform if they wish.  But yes, they do generally get their ass kicked if they do.

&gt;But you could prevent some of it, but clearly showing that Islam is not acceptable and that you wont accept Islamic schools, where kids are told that Islam is great and filled with various lies.

Well, they can have private Islamic schools.  There won't be any public Islamic schools due to the separation of church and state.  Halal food might be an issue.  I am not entirely sure if that would need to be accommodated.  I suppose it might but I don't think the school would change its menu for everyone.

Many people here do speak out against Islam, in many cases quite offensively, although usually it is qualified as Radical Islam.   There is also a difference between tolerating customs and adopting them.  That said, our constitution would not permit any law that banned clothing or restricted speech.  

One thing in our favor is we do not have so called ""hate speech"" laws.  It is perfectly fine to publicly state any opinion about Islam, Muslims or anyone else.  

I do now understand the thinking behind why Belgium implemented the law, and it might even be appropriate for them.  As an American, though, I do not think such a law would be appropriate here.

I know a lot of people probably disagree, but for me Prague was a let down.  It was probably due to it being the last few days of our trip, and after being in Budapest and Zdiar where we'd seen very few other tourists Prague just felt like a tourist trap over run by Americans throwing up in the hostel's bathroom.  Having said this, it wasn't all that bad, just disappointing.  We stayed in the Tyn Hostel in the old town and it was a nice location, convenient to downtown and not a long walk over to the castle side of the river.  How long were you planning on being there? After two days we had seen most everything we wanted to see and we spent the next two days just hanging out in parks or beer gardens reading which was actually really nice to me.

If you're willing to consider somewhere in the Czech Republic other than Prague, check out the town Olomouc, http://wikitravel.org/en/Olomouc Apparently it has a reputation of being what Prague was like 10 years ago, though I haven't checked it out personally (or know what Prague was like 10 years ago).

I can't speak about Bratislava since we were only in the bus station there for a few minutes, but if I was going to do 2 weeks in eastern Europe again I would probably go from the Czech Republic, then to Poland, south into eastern Slovakia, then to Budapest spending about three days in each.

If you're interested in a little bit of downtime, we really enjoyed staying at a cool hostel in Zdiar, eastern Slovakia.  The tiny town is right next to the high tatras range so there's an awesome view out of the house, and some fun 2-3 hour hikes around the house.  There's not much nightlife, just a nice place to relax and re-charge that we enjoyed between cities.

Finally, Budapest was great.  Try to go see the Jewish cemetery in the eastern part of the city, the city park in the east is also great.  Climb up the hills on the Buda side for nice views and go to the grand market on the Pest side for a pretty big selection foods and trinkets.

Check out Student Agency www.studentagency.cz buses also, that's what we took for most of our trip and even 22 hours on the bus wasn't all that bad.

I strongly disagree with the charity vibe of donations.  There is no need to tell people to donate, then later we will tell you what your donation can buy, and how that will be useful to you.  There is **no need to do as a first step** make a corp and escrow account (spend money on it), and definitely not the first thing you do is get a lawyer.  First you decide the bylaws of the corporation such as what does your share give you (you need a specific plot of land to answer that, a budget outline that shows how project is fair to workers/board/adminstrators and investors)

If you go the amorphous donation route, then you should be taking loans from people.  An example structure:  ""donation"" accrues at 12% and entitles bearer to convert loan into an investment as soon as tangible opportunities are made available (the go point).  After go point, if the lender has chosen not to invest, his ""donation"" accrues at 5%.  He continues to maintain the option to convert into investment, but gains 2 other rights.  He can join a queue of donors who want their money back at 0% interest.  These people are paid in first join first served order.  Or he can join a queue of donors who want their money back with full interest.  All donors in the 0% queue are paid before anyone one in the paid in full queue.  The coop however is only obligated to pay back when it can, but should set aside a % of new investment, and a % of surpluses to pay these back.",True,c0p9xao,,0,Godspiral,,5,0,0,True,t1_c0p9xao

You also have to remember that the Russian army had just suffered a very embarrassing draw against Finland. There is no way Stalin was looking to take on the Germans any time soon.

As far as I can see, this theory is more political than factual. It allows the Germans to be presented as the saviours of Europe from the communists, as was the German view during the war.

counterintuitive. After all, why would any leader seeking to gain global respect want to constantly remind his 
people and the world of his country’s former humiliation? Perhaps Chinese leaders (both Nationalist and 
Communist) calculated that if Chinese could become sufficiently aware, even ashamed, of their weakness, they 
would be goaded into rising up and reclaiming their national greatness.

I have never seen somebody comparing China to Israel, but this looks quite similar to me.



&gt;Thus, we feel sensitive to any kind of slight and often have a very sharp reaction to perceived unfair 
treatment or injustices. On an emotional level we cannot help but associate treatment in the present with past 
injuries, defeats, invasions, and occupations by foreigners. There is something almost in our DNA that triggers 
autonomic, and sometimes extreme, responses to foreign criticism or put-downs. 

&gt; ...

&gt;In any event, since 1949, a significant part of China’s effort to create a new national identity has been based 
on the dream of restoring the country’s territorial integrity, 


What is that something? Does China have to unify its territories first or can it be 
transformed by other means? Otherwise, this is a guaranty for war.



&gt;And in the film, Liu Xing’s American Ph.D. adviser is arrogance incarnate. When Liu arrives in his lab, he is 
smugly told, “Well, feel free to challenge me all you want. Just keep in mind, I’m always right!”

&gt;When an assistant reminds Liu’s adviser that his student has “been pulling a lot of all-nighters” doing 
research for him, he contemptuously replies, “Oh, come on! These kids are grateful for whatever work I give 
them. They come from a place where astrology is considered a science and toilets a luxury.” 

&gt;Such exchanges in the film echo a kind of condescension that has historically marked many kinds of 
relationships between the West and China and slowly formed a kind of “dark matter” that continues to exert a 
powerful, if unobserved force. 


It's funny, because the relationship started the other way round:

&gt;[This stemmed from the traditional imperial world view of seeing China as the centre of the world and viewing 
all foreigners as uncivilized barbarians unworthy of equal diplomatic status.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty)

If the Chinese actually feel humiliated by America, then they don't like their own food and I think it is 
especially painful as they don't objectively perceive the Western attitude but project their own arrogance onto 
the Westerners and believe that Westerners think about them in the same way they think about their neighbours.


&gt;A particularly important element in the formation of China’s modern identity has been the legacy of the 
country’s “humiliation” at the hands of foreigners, beginning with China’s defeat in the Opium Wars in the mid-
nineteenth century and the shameful treatment of Chinese in America. 

I think it's a mistake to start history with the Opium Wars because China's situation is not only the result of 
European aggressions. History would be different if China hadn't turned down [the Macartney Embassy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macartney_Embassy#Outcome) or [ hadn't scuttled its Pacific fleet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_history_of_China). 



Another neglected point is the missed opportunity to turn into a modern society on its own:

&gt;[Cixi then consolidated control and established near-absolute rule over the dynasty. She installed her nephew 
as the Guangxu Emperor in 1875. A conservative ruler who refused to adopt Western models of government, Cixi 
rejected reformist views and placed Guangxu under house arrest in later years for supporting reformers. However, 
after a humiliating clash with the Eight-Nation Alliance, external and internal pressures led Cixi to attempt 
institutional changes and appoint reform-minded officials. Ultimately, the Qing Dynasty collapsed a few years 
after her death.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi)


One ""funny coincidence"": Japan initially did not try to conquer entire China but Manchuria, the origin of the 
last dynasty, [the Qing Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty). Ignoring later Japanese expansions, 
that looks to me like native Americans, complaining that England gets annexed by the European Union.


Chinese position to their Manchurian heritage looks especially strange when compared to [Nanking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre): 100,000 to 300,000 died there, but the Manchus killed up to 
800,000:

&gt;It also involved huge loss of life, including the infamous Yangzhou massacre of 1645, when a ten-day rampage by 
troops in the city with the permission of Prince Dodo resulted in an estimated 800,000 deaths. 


It gets extra  strange as China is [turning Manchuria into ""The Northeast""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria#Origin_of_the_name).

&gt;Europe could be 100% renewable by 2050.

A ""super-smart"" grid capeable of dealing with the large local fluctuations in powerproduction, and the hydroelectric power-production capacities which would be allocated for energy control would be VERY expensive.

It may be recalled in this context that the Warsaw Pact plan for World War III was to invade Western Europe. The devastation suffered by Russia in World War II meant that the Kremlin planned to wage war on enemy soil, hence the emphasis on nuclear weapons in the Warsaw Pact plan to be used as super-artillery that would smash through NATO defenses. It was the deterrent strategy of NATO that spared Europe from a nuclear nightmare. But Obama’s divergent strategy is not merely to appease Muslims but also to circumscribe Israel with his determination to create Palestine state, knowing full well that such a state will be a haven for Hezbelloh and Syrian terrorists. The recent Muslim summit convened by Obama is to consolidate Muslim power worldwide. He has arranged the next summit in Turkey. Immediately after the summit Obama has called on Billy Grraham probably to cover up his Islamic ties and to  entice  Americans. The Russian-Ukrainian naval base agreement is a setback to U.S. efforts to establish control of the Black Sea, which is a gateway to Russia and the Caucasus. During the five-day war with Georgia in 2008, Russian warships based in Sevastopol sank a Georgian missile gunboat and played a key role in ferrying marines and weapons to the war zone A Navy source said Russia would now strengthen Sea Fleet, consisting of about 40 combat vessels, with new surface warships and submarines. China is emerging as a dominant power in Asia, and its economy has sprung back to life with remarkable speed. The much ballyhooed stimulus plan of Obama has so far yielded little measurable benefit, save putting some spark back in stock markets. Americans will soon feel crunch of the much trumpeted Obama’s health care. Moscow and Beijing are now extending their tentacles even into South America and have signed treaties with countries in the exclusive U.S. turf because the White House has now become effete. Instead of concentrating on these vital issues, Obama has been diverting the attention and twisting American foreign policy by focusing on non-existent Muslim priorities.  He and Hillary are bent upon humiliating Israel, a loyal ally in the Middle East, just to appease Muslims.  Awash in petro products, Putin is acting with a swagger and assertiveness, taking advantage of the impotence and weakness of Obama. If the creation of Palestine state will put an end to Islamic terrorism, why there are bomb blasts in Mumbai, Madrid, Moscow, Islamabad and other places? Obama is a novice in foreign policy.

Demographically:

The thing about the US compared to Europe and Canada, is that the US's Urban centers are so much more violent that they pull the curve. Places like DC, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Chicago, routinely make up the most dangerous cities in the world. These large metropolises are outliers compared to the rest of the population, that don't live in those cities.

That might sound weird to you, since over 40% of Australia lives around the four largest cities.  In contrast, the mid-way point for the US is Louisville, KY, the *42nd* largest metropolitan area in the US, with 1.4 million people.  So the experiences of much of the country are quite different.

For example, compare Iowa to Alberta, Canada. While similar in population and demographics, Iowa has a lower crime and murder rate.

As a whole, the US has a much lower crime rate, per capita, then a lot of places in the world, but our crimes are more violent.  This is a trade off.  Further much of the crime problems are due to drug prohibition and poorly maintained parole systems, both of which are fixable problems, and there's some slow progress being made on those fronts.",False,c0pa7nd,,0,Alexandrite,,6,0,0,True,t1_c0pa7nd

Especially if I'm talking to someone ""above"" me. It helps establish that you're on the same level, no matter how more materially well-off they are.

EDIT: Okay, I got bored reading the comments and really love my major, so here's a little eye contact information:
---
In the US, it's considered impolite and strange to maintain eye contact when you see and greet someone from afar and, while walking toward one another, keep your eyes on them the entire time. We always divert our attention after the initial acknowledgment and re-establish contact when we meet. Foreigners often say that this little American quirk is bewildering. (class notes/text)

Eye contact (and nonverbal signals in general) is used more by women than men. (class notes/text)

Eye contact is important in face-to-face encounters for many reasons. In a worker-boss relationship (or any relationship where there is a distinct ranking system in which one is higher than the other), the lower person uses more eye contact to show that he or she is paying the utmost attention. The higher person shows he or she is higher up on the totem pole by using less eye contact. This shows conversation control; the higher person reserves the right to break off the conversation at his or her convenience. (nonverbal textbook)
*Note*: For women with a male boss, men often incorrectly interpret nonverbal ques as a sign that women are sexually interested in men. Be careful about the signals you are sending to male superiors. This misreading is the beginning of many a sexual harassment lawsuit in companies. To all the male superiors reading this, she's probably not into you, she's just better at using nonverbal ques than you are. She likely believes that using more of them will make you view her more favorably. (class notes)

Eye contact shows attention. We make eye contact with professors to show we're listening. We give our girlfriends eye contact because they may interpret a lack of it as us not caring for what they're saying. It's also an intimacy thing; we make more eye contact with those with whom we are close. Of course, the amount of eye contact (as well as other intimacy cues) depends on the culture. Compared to Americans, people of South America and southern Europe use more intimacy cues. They stand closer, use more eye contact, and touch others more. On the opposite side, Germans and other northern Europeans use less. (class text) Even in the USA, there's a subculture rift. Whites use more eye contact when they are listening, while blacks use more eye contact while talking. This leads to a white assumption that the black person doesn't care about the conversation because he is looking around more while the white person talks. The black assumption is that the white person is looking all around while talking because he wants to exit the conversation or is uncomfortable talking to the person because of the racial difference. (class text)

Eye contact is also an intimidation maneuver. When we argue or are about to get into a fight, we use more eye contact as a way of staring our opponent down. It shows we are not afraid. We also use this sort of intense eye contact when feigning intimidation. Just because we aren't actually going to fight doesn't mean we can't fake it hoping the other person backs off. (class text)

When lying to others, a common mistake is that we make too much or too little eye eye contact. It's difficult to fake a correct amount, especially with intimates. (class text)

---

So there's some information for anyone interested. I couldn't find my text in order to cite properly, but if I do, I may edit again so people know where my info is coming from. It was a really engaging textbook.

tl;dr: Eye contact is important to show interpersonal attention, intimacy, attraction, importance, to intimidate, and just about anything you are trying to communicate.  ",True,c0pa8vq,,0,embur,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0pa8vq

&gt; In terms of subsidy per unit energy...

I'll not address this now - I need to research it. However now that I've established that you're quite comfortable telling lies -  [claims ""51% of Europe favours either maintaining the current proportion of nuclear energy or increasing it"" - cited report clearly exposes this  as a lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bvol5/over_100000_people_form_a_120kilometer_74mile/c0p9q7j) - I just need to work out how you're doing it with these numbers. And I will.

&gt; Here there's only about 1 GW of solar pv indicated as under construction...

This is another huge indicator of your dishonesty. It's clear to anyone with the least interest in energy that that page doesn't begin to cover the [solar farms under construction](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=new+solar+plant+OR+farm) and it completely ignores the PV being put on millions of roofs around the world.

So? Stock go up, stocks go down, stocks go up again. Relatively new market that has seen phenomenal growth over the last several years takes a dip after global recession. So what's your point?

&gt; Look at the headline on the page you just linked to for support:

So? Spain overheated their solar market in the middle of a global recession. So what's your point?

And if you'd managed to read past the headline you would have seen:

&gt; But despite these gloomy figures, all is not lost for the Spanish solar sector. To begin with, a great deal has already been achieved. While many have lost their jobs, more than 10,000 people still work in PV, and in 2009, with a total capacity of 3317 MW installed, PV produced nearly 3% of the nation’s electricity. (In fact between them, wind and solar now are providing around 13% of the electricity in Spain.).

And when people say ""We all came from Africa,"" they have this erroneous notion that ""black people"" emerged from Africa and populated Europe and Asia. The thing is: All the skeletal remains from East Africa are what we would more or less consider Caucasoid morphologically. Not a single one is ""negroid"". That was the thing that shocked geneticist Cavalli-Sforza: the massive gulf between sub-Saharan Africans [i.e., black people] and the rest of the human race. Apparently, they were cut off for, like, 100,000 years and developed in relative isolation. They were *not* the group that emerged from East Africa, and East African skulls and skeletal remains are patently *not* sub-Saharan.

People peddling a ""politically correct"" model of human origins always leave these facts out. Or else deceptively imply that sub-Saharans were the ones who ventured out of Africa. According to the DNA and the skeletal remains: nope.

You had two very distinct groups on the continent: sub-Saharans (who were isolated and extraordinarily old) and a sort of proto-Caucasoid race that probably looked a lot more like Middle Easterners or Berbers (and who are aeons younger than the sub-Saharans). 

If you believe Carleton Coon's multi-regional development theory, then that original band of non-sub-Saharans ventured into Asia where they encountered Neanderthal and changed even further in aspect when they adopted Neanderthal traits [such as freckles, red hair and blue eyes]. And we know from DNA advances that Neanderthal had all these traits before modern-man had them. Anthropologist Carleton Coon believed that, evolutionarily, there wasn't enough time (or large enough population numbers) to account for the sudden and massive racial differences we see between population groups. He suggested that proto-hominids in Eurasia changed when they interbred with Neanderthal, that proto-hominids in East Asia like Homo erectus bred with modern man creating the ""Mongoloid race,"" that sub-Saharans may have bred with Homo habilis, etc.


   He based his suspicions on skull similarities and skeletal structures that these proto-hominids had that seemed to suddenly appear in ""racial groups"" in the regions Homo sapiens later entered.


   For about 50 years, his multi-regional development theory was scoffed at—until recently, when DNA and paleogenetics are re-opening the issue. 
   It's especially compelling with regard to the case for Neanderthal interbreeding with early humans. Neanderthal (once thought to be mute or incapable of speech) had the Fox P2 gene, which allows speech in modern man. He's the only other primate to have it. (Chimps don't, gorillas don't.) Most early proto-hominids didn't. But Neanderthal did. And so did modern man.
   A recent article takes it a step further, too: http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2010/04/early-humans-may-have-bred-wit.html


So, in the end, ""racial differences"" may *not* be due to slow evolutionary changes and adaptation to environment—because they appeared too rapidly for that to be realistically the case—but due to our various ancestors breeding with remaining pockets of proto-humans.

We have had massive migrations in the past.  First there were the Italians, and then the Irish.  We had a huge wave of eastern europeans as the soviet empire fell.

Why does the united states not have the same problems that Europe has at integrating people into society?  It's because the united states doesn't have the same luxurious welfare systems as Europe.

Muslim child goes to France with his family.  His family is paid to stay on welfare.  The welfare is given so that immigrants don't take the high paying jobs that French unions worked so hard to get high salaries, and benefits for.  Once you are employed in France it is against the law to fire someone for anything but the most extreme circumstances.

Businesses in France wont hire someone on a whim.  When you hire an employee in France, you are making a full lifetime commitment for that employee.  They will, by law, work for you for 30 years or more years.  Regardless of if they are a good worker or not.

For that reason, you don't hire new employees unless you are absolutely sure you will need a new employee for 30+ years.  And you're sure as hell not going to hire some Muslim immigrant who doesn't even speak French.

So the Muslim family gets welfare.  The parents never learn French, thus never become employable.  The children, while they do learn the language, wont get hired because again, when you're making a 4 decade commitment to hire someone, you don't hire children.  Children are irresponsible.  You hire a man who's over 30 and has a wife and is settled down.  Not some 22 year old who still goes out drinking and dancing every night.

Now look at the united states.  We have shitty welfare.  You come here, you either work or starve to death.  And despite what the democrats tell you, a human beings desire to survive is extremely strong.  So they get jobs.  And they learn the language.  And their children can get jobs because in the US companies hire and fire on a whim.  If a company only needs work for the summer, they'll hire high school kids just for the summer.  It's not a life long commitment to hire a teenager.  If he's good, he may stay on the job for a whole lifetime.  Hell, he may end up owning the place.  If he's bad, he may not make it through the full first day.

So the reason you don't have to worry about a massive influx of Chinese Communists is because they will become culturally acclimated just like the Irish, the Italians, the Ukrainians, the Africans, the Mexicans, the Japanese, the Armenians, the Iraqis, the Christians, the Jews, the Buddhists, the Athiests, the blacks, the whites, the browns, and even the Chinese already have.  I don't care how many ways you can divide a man, he can come to the US, acclimate, and be free.

Plus the Constitution pretty much legally bans everything that Communism is about.

Tibet Autonomous Region is the only province in China where ethnic minorities form a majority of the population: 92%! 

And this is not because Tibet is a fairly recent addition to the Chinese nation. It's because repeatedly, under the influence of the British and the Russians, who wanted to annex more land for British India and the Russian Empire (ironically since you said that Native American land grab was 'inevitable': sorry to say that this is too) convinced the Tibetan warlords to repeatedly expel ethnic Han while China was reeling from Western/Japanese colonialism.

Nothing like an 'invasion' from China proper into Tibet happened: the two areas had a personal union since the Tang dynasty (618-907), and were unified administratively under the Mongol empire in 1927. The only break in this happened, as said before, in the period of Chinese turmoil before World War I. Then, *all* of China's provinces were functionally independent, because of a weak central government. You cannot say the People's Liberation Army ""invaded"" Tibet any more than it invaded Guangzhou, or Hunan, that the Bolsheviks ""invaded"" Moscow, or the American Revolutionaries ""invaded"" Boston.

Furthermore, since then, Tibetan culture has always been preserved, with not as much effort to assimilate as should be applied to such a restive people. Your allegations of racism, uneven development, and ""trying to wipe out culture"" are totally unsubstantiated and out you as someone who knows no more about China than propaganda from the pretender to the throne of a theocratic feudalist regime of the past, the Dalai Lama.

That's (mostly) the case, but does not undermine my argument, because it's known that some large government-bond holders also:

**A)** own the shares of many of the central banks in the world. (There are exceptions though)
 
**B)** in addition to point A also own the commercial banks that sell the bonds at a fee. (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan etc)

The way I explain it is heavily simplified for the sake of conversation, because the chain of ownership of central banks is often obfuscated by many links in the ownership chain, but the core of it still stands.

In short, that small group of people owns for the most part the entire chain of money creation, meaning that a great part of the taxes you and I pay flows to them.

&gt;Much of what I mentioned isn't payed out of the federal budget. There are local taxes, you know.

Local taxes are still pocket change compared to the large expenditures you see on the chart.

&gt;but that's a defect of the US system

Large interest payments to central banks and big defense budgets aren't unique to the US unfortunately. There are quite some EU nations that have an even bigger debt proportionally to their GPD and while they might have smaller defense budgets compared to the US, in terms of their budget their defense spendings are still quite large. Meaning both Europeans and Americans pay a lot of taxes for banking interests and the military industrial complex.

Well done for latching onto an obvious exaggeration. 

&gt; Immigrants tend to stick together, act in a group and look out for each other. White people do not this, and you would probably call them racist if they attempted to do so.

Immigrants stick together because they're in a minority that is constantly under attack by prejudice. It really isn't hard to understand why this happens. The only thing Bangladeshis voting for Bangladeshis proves is that they feel nobody else properly represents them, and in a country where a large segment of society are immensely misinformed about immigration and borderline racist, I'm inclined to agree.

&gt; They contribute for anyone who might employ them. For jobseekers they are unwelcome competition in the job market and for workers they also act as competition in the labour market and so cause decreased wages and a reduction in bargaining power for individuals.

Among its many virtues, America is a nation where laws are generally reasonable, respected and impartially enforced. A glaring exception is immigration.

Today an estimated 12 million people live in the U.S. without authorization, 1.6 million in Texas alone, and that number grows every year. Many Americans understandably want the rule of law restored to a system where law-breaking has become the norm.

The fundamental choice before us is whether we redouble our efforts to enforce existing immigration law, whatever the cost, or whether we change the law to match the reality of a dynamic society and labor market.

Low-skilled immigrants cross the Mexican border illegally or overstay their visas for a simple reason: There are jobs waiting here for them to fill, especially in Texas and other, faster growing states. Each year our economy creates hundreds of thousands of net new jobs — in such sectors as retail, cleaning, food preparation, construction and tourism — that require only short-term, on-the-job training.

At the same time, the supply of Americans who have traditionally filled many of those jobs — those without a high school diploma — continues to shrink. Their numbers have declined by 4.6 million in the past decade, as the typical American worker becomes older and better educated.

Yet our system offers no legal channel for anywhere near a sufficient number of peaceful, hardworking immigrants to legally enter the United States even temporarily to fill this growing gap. The predictable result is illegal immigration.

In response, we can spend billions more to beef up border patrols. We can erect hundreds of miles of ugly fence slicing through private property along the Rio Grande. We can raid more discount stores and chicken-processing plants from coast to coast. We can require all Americans to carry a national ID card and seek approval from a government computer before starting a new job.

Or we can change our immigration law to more closely conform to how millions of normal people actually live.

Crossing an international border to support your family and pursue dreams of a better life is not an inherently criminal act like rape or robbery. If it were, then most of us descend from criminals. As the people of Texas know well, the large majority of illegal immigrants are not bad people. They are people who value family, faith and hard work trying to live within a bad system.

When large numbers of otherwise decent people routinely violate a law, the law itself is probably the problem. To argue that illegal immigration is bad merely because it is illegal avoids the threshold question of whether we should prohibit this kind of immigration in the first place.

We've faced this choice on immigration before. In the early 1950s, federal agents were making a million arrests a year along the Mexican border. In response, Congress ramped up enforcement, but it also dramatically increased the number of visas available through the Bracero guest worker program. As a result, apprehensions at the border dropped 95 percent. By changing the law, we transformed an illegal inflow of workers into a legal flow.

For those workers already in the United States illegally, we can avoid ""amnesty"" and still offer a pathway out of the underground economy. Newly legalized workers can be assessed fines and back taxes and serve probation befitting the misdemeanor they've committed. They can be required to take their place at the back of the line should they eventually apply for permanent residency.

The fatal flaw of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was not that it offered legal status to workers already here but that it made no provision for future workers to enter legally.

Immigration is not the only area of American life where a misguided law has collided with reality. In the 1920s and '30s, Prohibition turned millions of otherwise law-abiding Americans into lawbreakers and spawned an underworld of moon-shining, boot-legging and related criminal activity. (Sound familiar?) We eventually made the right choice to tax and regulate alcohol rather than prohibit it.

In the 19th century, America's frontier was settled largely by illegal squatters. In his influential book on property rights, The Mystery of Capital, economist Hernando de Soto describes how these so-called extralegals began to farm, mine and otherwise improve land to which they did not have strict legal title. After failed attempts by the authorities to destroy their cabins and evict them, federal and state officials finally recognized reality, changed the laws, declared amnesty and issued legal documents conferring title to the land the settlers had improved.

As Mr. de Soto wisely concluded: ""The law must be compatible with how people actually arrange their lives."" That must be a guiding principle when Congress returns to the important task of fixing our immigration laws.

&gt; [Zionism is an] international *nationalist* political movement that, in its broadest sense, calls for the existence of a *sovereign, Jewish* national homeland. 

&gt; In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl infused Zionism with a new ideology and practical urgency, leading to the First Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897, which created the World Zionist Organization (WZO).[16] *Herzl's aim was to initiate necessary preparatory steps for the attainment of a Jewish state.*

Hertzl wrote [*Der Judenstaat*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Judenstaat), for Dog's sake!  He wrote a book ""The Jewish State"".  How can you claim ""The original aim of Zionism was not to establish a Jewish state"" and cite Herzl when he wrote a book the very title which shows you to be wrong?

&gt; It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century. He argued that the best way to avoid anti-Semitism in Europe was to create this independent Jewish state.

When the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia in 1917 they were invaded by, among others, the UK and the US. The invaders claimed the invasion was to keep Russia in the war, but the US stayed in Russia for *years* after WWI ended trying to overthrow the Bolsheviks.

The US spent huge sums of money to rig elections in France and Italy in the late '40s to prevent communist parties from winning. As late as the 1980s the US committed and sponsored terrorist attacks on its own NATO allies (e.g. Germany, Belgium, Italy) targeting innocent civilians in a successful effort to push those gov'ts further to the political right.

Nope:  It's just the media trying their usual to tell only a tiny fraction of what happened to get people *interested*, with claims of greed, etc., grabbing people by the gut so that the media can get eyeballs for ad revenue and now also to pursue a partisanly political agenda.

So, the media likes to cry ""Wolf!"", greed, evil, sin, corruption, etc., and trigger false alarms in people's danger detectors.  That has been the main technique of the media going back for well over 100 years.

They also want to bash large corporations and push DC owning essentially all the means of production, transportation, finance, energy, communications, and health care -- essentially as in Communist China.  Yup, sadly, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, and LAT are so far *left* that they are at least communist if not Communist.  Sorry 'bout that.  How?  Why?  One claim is that in the 1950s the US Communist Party decided to go *stealth*, join the Dems, and concentrate on the media.

What actually happened recently with GM is simple, **dirt** simple, with **nothing** wrong at all:  GM had a loan from DC for a few billion and paid it back early.  Simple.

I know, I know:  ""But, but, but what about the huge, taxpayer **BAILOUT** of those ugly, greedy ....????""

More media nonsense.  Again, it's simple, **dirt** simple:  GM sold a LOT of common stock to DC, enough stock that DC is now a majority owner of GM which it is fair now to call *government motors*.  In time, the price of GM stock will likely increase.  Then GM will sell some new stock to the public and take the cash and buy back the DC stock.  If this works as intended, then the US taxpayers will make at least a small profit, maybe even a large profit.

This stock buyback has **NOT** happened yet; it was not planned to happen yet; no one in a responsible position is claiming that it's happened yet; but the media want to sow confusion to grab people by the gut to get eyeballs for ad revenue, pursue their bash large corporations political agenda, and to keep some favorite, easy to write, *stories* going to make it easier on and on to get eyeballs, ad revenue, political progress, etc.

GM blew it.  One reason:  In the 1950s GM had nearly a license to print money.  They had to be careful not to sell more than 51% of the cars or risk anti-trust action.  Soooooo, the UAW saw a big chance -- dream jobs with lifetime financial security, health care, job security, etc.  Then the UAW also insisted on lots more jobs than GM needed.  GM was so rich they put up with it.  The Dems liked the UAW donations and went along with it with labor laws, etc.  So, maybe GM didn't have a monopoly, but the UAW did and, then, made Ford, Chrysler, etc. go along also.

Accidentally and/or deliberately, the US let in Japan and Germany, and they went to *right to work*, aka, anti-union, states in the US South and started making solid cars for less money.  Detroit slowly suffered.  They began to move jobs out of the big three and into *suppliers*.  So, get seats from Lear, many parts from TRW, etc.  Then they moved jobs to Canada and Mexico.  Sometimes they tried bringing in parts from car companies they owned in Europe, etc.  The UAW membership shrank.  Labor employment in Detroit shrank.  Detroit was nearly destroyed with large residential areas deserted.  Finally with the financial crisis of 2008, Chrysler and GM were bust.

So, if only to slow down the crash, DC helped Chrysler and GM.  Actually likely DC will show a profit.  I'm not up on Chrysler, but GM can survive and do well:  The number of UAW employees in GM is down from a few hundred thousand to maybe 35,000.  Michigan as a state still just loves labor unions, but GM is now mostly out from under the UAW labor monopoly.  The UAW may have a good friend in the White House for now but has nearly no friends elsewhere in DC.

Looks like GM will survive, be a strong company again, and leave DC with a profit.

So, who loses?  The old GM stockholders, **NOT** likely the taxpayers.  Who were the old GM stockholders?  Individuals in *index* (aka *market average*) mutual funds, IRAs, 401K programs, university endowments, life insurance companies, employee pension funds, etc.  They worked hard, made money, and to have financial security bought stock.  Then the Dems in DC set up the UAW as a labor monopoly and greatly weakened GM.  Then DC told Fanny and Freddie to make bad housing loans and caused a housing bubble.  When the bubble burst, the economy was so sick that weak GM went bust.  In fixing GM, the old stockholders lost, essentially everything.  At one point, could have bought all of GM for, what, about $1 billion?  With its pension fund liability, GM was seen as having deeply **negative** net worth.  Only the bankruptcy let GM get back to, say, zero net worth.  Now GM has a chance again, but the old stockholders lost.

If want to write some media *stories* about big loses, then write about the old stockholders.  Much the same for the stockholders in AIG, Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and so far at times even Goldman Sachs.  E.g., due to more silly yelling and screaming in DC, Goldman Sachs stockholders just lost about 30% last week.  Isn't DC wonderful?  Don't we want so **MUCH** more DC?  Instead, the media writes about DC losing money, which they likely won't do on the GM deals, maybe even on the AIG deal, and certainly not the TARP deal.

Even worse the media writes about the TARP money *given* to the *greedy ....*.  Goldman Sachs didn't need or want the TARP money.  Secretary Paulson **ordered** them to come to DC, sat them on the other side of a table, and ""made them an offer they couldn't refuse"":  ""You **WILL** sign this term sheet before you leave this room.""  They signed.  Why did Paulson do this?  Likely he wanted to stop *runs*, that is, to make public that all the large US financial institutions **DID** have money.  Then GS paid back the TARP money, **WITH** 12% per year interest, as soon as the term sheet said they could.  The taxpayers made a profit, actually a nice profit.  Goldman Sachs paid the money back and didn't complain.

Don't hear this on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, LAT, etc.  So, who are you going to pay attention to?  When you curse, spit, and raise your longest finger, who will you aim at?

As long as those newsies still get eyeballs and ad revenue while doing their old stuff, now heavily partisanly political, they will continue to do so.  So, I'm doing my part:  I pay **NO** attention to ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, and LAT.  Also *Time* and *Newsweek*.  I **never** take seriously **anything** they say.

Yup, I wish I had some good news sources.  I suspect a lot of people do and that there's a business opportunity here.  Meanwhile, recognize the sewage for what it is and ignore it.

1) Finally getting really high-quality fruit. I grew up being offered an endless parade of red delicious apples, canned pears, sour oranges from big bags, and watery grapes. Unsurprisingly, I was also basically indifferent to fruit until I was in my early 20s. It wasn't dislike, I just didn't understand why anyone bothered with them. 

Then I moved to Europe for a few years, where the baseline quality of produce is higher. I remember the first really good apple I ever had -- it was just a braeburn, but it was a revelation to me. It wasn't mushy or mealy, it was sweet and juicy, and it tasted like more than just generic ""sweet."" During the course of the next few years, I re-learned what fruit's actually supposed to taste like. That changed everything.

2) Get rid of the extra sugar in her diet. I'm just coming off a month of no sugar in my diet, just as an experiment. No juice, no soda, no artificial sweeteners, obviously no candy or cake or ice cream or any of that. The one allowance I gave myself was fruit -- but only whole, unprocessed, fresh fruit. And I made sure I got the best stuff I could find. Over the course of that month, I was astonished to find that grapes (lovely pink muscats) changed from being a sad substitute for dessert into a decadent little treat. At this point, I only eat them by the handful because they taste so overwhelmingly, richly sweet. Everything else tastes sweeter, too -- milk, sauteed shallots, carrots, etc. It turns out, cashews are sweet! Who knew, right? 

I understand about not liking some textures -- I'm still unenthusiastic about peaches just because they're so soft. And everyone has a right to not like a few things. But not liking any fruit? That sounds more like stubbornness to me. 

Lastly, the only way to learn to like a new food is to try it over and over again. Repeated exposure is the key to developing a taste for anything. That, however, is something you might not be able to do much about; if she doesn't want to, she won't. ",True,c0pau1a,,0,nobody_you_know,,13,0,0,True,t1_c0pau1a

Find a nice excuse, and go somewhere *far* away alone, preferably somewhere a lot more open-minded than wherever you're living. I don't really know where in the world you're located, but I'm sure you can think of a nice city - Amsterdam or Paris if you're in Europe - and find a gay bar. Go there. Look good. Feel the mood and the vibes, dance a little, live a little. Maybe you'll meet someone nice, maybe you'll just have some fun and go back to the hotel alone, but either way you've stuck your toe in the water. 

Keep it to yourself if you like, but explore yourself. There's **nothing** wrong about liking kinky business in the bedroom, there's nothing wrong about liking men too, and there's nothing at all wrong about wanting to explore yourself.

Choosing between taking a public sector drone job in DC to knock out my student debt, taking a Fulbright grant, going private sector, or applying to regular (affordable!) European grad schools. I started my bachelor with a scholarship and admittance to an honors biochemistry program, and randomly decided to take a four-year trek into the academic wilderness and major in medieval studies, which I am shitty at; art, which I am mediocre at; and linguistics, which I like. It was a careless decision, but I'm not too unhappy with it. I got to learn how to tap dance and make felt out of the deal, so it's not all a waste, right? ;) 

I don't like school all that much anymore since I gave up science. It's too hands-off and full of bullshit. When you are sitting in a room full of old men arguing about what runes on a rock could be, you really begin to feel the utterly dreary and pointless nature of humanities; you CAN NEVER PROVE OR DISPROVE ANYTHING. It's a fucking circle-jerk. I have much more fun volunteering. Actually getting to teach, lead groups, and get shit done is much more satisfying. Volunteering is fucking wonderful. No one can say shit about how well you do your work, everyone is grateful for the help, and you get to do things you TOTALLY are not qualified to do and then get experience that qualifies you to actually do things you like for money. 

I don't believe in the Ivory Tower fantasy dude, I believe in getting respect, getting paid, sticking to my beliefs, and working pretty goddamnned hard to get what I want. I didn't come from a well-off family (dad's disabled, mom's a caretaker= not a lot of cash), and I've put myself through school and lived wholly independent from my family since I was 18. I don't have any notion that I'm entitled to shit, and frankly, you've got it wrong. I want EVERYONE to have the opportunity to make HELLA money. But the fact is that a lot of people don't have the resources that even I had. 

As a life-long socially-awkward dork, I spent my entire sheltered-loner-agnostic-in-a-poor-Catholic-family youth playing with Lego pirates and reading. If you read 5+ hours a day for 12 years and don't gain SOME skills, you are doing it wrong. It was a pretty fucked-up time, and reading and Lego-building are great escapes. I also focused on school, since I didn't have friends to take up my time. I became awesome at school because it was easy and got me a lot of attention. I did the tech squad, worked in the library, played in the marching band, made a bunch of band friends and then led a nerd coup to vote myself and the one-eyed Hawaiian kid in the band as homecoming king and queen. Life was good. 

But the fact is that I had academics as my ""thing"" and that got me pretty far. Most people in my situation are drug dealers, shift leaders at fast-food places, teen-parents in their twenties, dropouts, or just dead. My high school class had over 20% drop out, and then out of the graduates, only 5% went on to even community college. 

See, the problem with the US is that it isn't all that possible for people who start out poor to really make something of themselves. I got lucky and had Catholic parents who instilled a sense of fear and guilt in me so great that I was pulling all-nighters in the sixth grade to meet project deadlines. I also had an atheist-treehugger friend with a groovy professor dad in elementary school, and they took me in when I ran away from home while my parents were fighting. Gave me a lot of perspective. I would be totally satisfied with the system if it was fair, but it's stacked against people who don't have options. 

Nobody chooses to be born to stupid, poor, or neglectful parents, but in an information-based society where intelligence and good social skills are the currency of success (you've gotta check out Gøsta Esping-Andersen; Danish sociologist helping with a lot of EU planning), kids that get fucked over don't usually succeed. It would be nice if everyone could work hard and make 100K, but there are a lot of people who get left behind. The way to level the playing field is to make regulations that allow EVERYONE to have TRUE freedom. 

Just because I can angle for my boss to give me a couple unpaid weeks doesn't mean that I can afford to take them, ya dig? That's the central issue. Of course everyone has the legal and theoretical possibility to have a certain standard of life doesn't mean that in the US it is actually attainable outside of certain exceptional circumstances. The vast number of people in the US working for the American Dream maybe don't realize that they are getting the shit end of the stick. 

When I came to Norway to study, my ""American Dream"" was that I would someday be able to afford to pay for things and not count every fucking dime, and that I would have enough to build a safety net so that I couldn't lose everything overnight by getting sick or having car problems. I dreamed of working a job I didn't hate, having a small fixer-upper, a fuel-efficient hatchback, and the ability to travel once a year, maybe. That was it. I grew up seeing how fucking stressful living below the poverty line is, and eating government dried beans and canned fish, and having powdered milk, and even though my parents worked hard up until my dad got sick, there was nothing for them when it happened. Then I entered a country and a society where they have actually made that ""Dream"" real for EVERYONE WHO WANTS IT. Sure they have problems, and sure it's not perfect. But it means equality, and it means that they get the control over their lives that so many Americans do not. Not all Americans have that freedom you know. 

The mob of the majority; PLEASE. 

You benefit from living in a society, and the cost of that benefit should ideally be less than the cost of the same benefit in a state of complete anarchy. The idea is that if we all pay a fee, we get a super sweet membership in the club called 'Merica. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work that way, and the rich stand on the backs of the poor as it were. I can understand resentment, as the payout for our taxes is not as good as in other places. We don't have great public transport, low tuition, good schools, fair representation, public benefits, etc. But shit is not free. You might have discovered that Mr. Moneybags. Of course you don't want to pay when you don't get jack shit, but stand up and yell at your government. Take a couple days out of those 6 weeks ya got there. Go volunteer somewhere and meet people who have actual problems and who have actually had their whole lives swept out from under them as a result of a mistake or misfortune. 

Freedom, real freedom, is the ACTUAL realization of the ability to have a reasonable standard of life when you work hard. I'm happy for you that you had the opportunity to get where you have gotten, and I am glad that you haven't had to see how fucking ugly the other side is. I hope you never do see it. I'm glad that you have actually had the opportunity to MAKE the choices you have gotten to make. It's just too bad that you got all the way to 28 without having to consider how the reality stacks up for us bottom 40%-ers. It's also too bad that you are such an unfeeling judgmental ass. 

Consider for a moment that you are not the only type of person and that you have somehow managed to cut into the top. You have probably worked hard, but you also got to start somewhere. You got a break somewhere in the genetic lottery, or you had resources (aka $$$). Maybe not much, but enough. Your success is yours, but you owe it to the chances you've had, and the choices you HAVEN'T had to make.

But the truth is the EU is essentially a cost saving excersise.

Looking at the economy as a prudent example, historically each country would have to negotiate its affairs with every other country on its own terms. Every time we set to do business with a foreign nation we'd essentially have to negotiate a new treaty with them, trying to impose our trade laws on to them and vice versa. With some nations that could be quite an expensive process, and in some cases even mean that we cannot do business with them. 

Now businesses are generally free to trade in whatever countries they wish, but the security that comes from these treaties accomodates a compromise between cutting cost and low risk.

With this in mind, would it not make more sense to negotiate a single treaty with as many countries at the table at the same time, rather than have them resolved individuallly? (see addendum)

Not only that, but if everybody is working to playing the same sheet of music it becomes even cheaper to run your business. If you know a foreign state addequately certifies its business practices then you know you don't have to run as extensive background checks. For example, if country X works to ISO standard 321 for smelting metal ore A in to metal alloy B (which cannot be found in england), then your company can make substantial savings by not having to send out inspectors and perhaps do less quality assurance checks. In terms of labour, perhaps this decrease in risk would bring jobs back to europe rather than see chips of lead paint inside your chinese made baby formula ^_^

Anyway, I've digressed. The reason why a lot of advocates think we should stay involved with europe is that if we ignore it, well eventually it's going to succeed. Germany, France, Italy and Spain are the big players (in terms of GDP and population) and that gives them a lot of sway in what rules the EU adopt. If we sit aside while they create rules and regulations for its member states, when it comes to us doing business with the EU we **will** have to compromise to their will else they will go elsewhere (26 countries have a lot more bargaining power than england, take the united states for example). Not only that, but we'd find ourselves having to adopt all the regulations and ""best business practices"" they choose, just for our companies to stay competitive. However, if we continue to work with them then perhaps our existing influence can mean that our regulations won't have to changed at all, and at worst only compromised.

That's ignoring the potential the EU has as a forum for other matters. Like bring global warning and polution to the agenda of lesser developed countries. And ignoring the fact the increased bargaining power the EU state has with existing supernations (the US/Russia/China), in the same way the UK would struggle to influence the EU from the outside.

And back to my insinuation that the UKIP are similar to the BNP, well if you think the above makes sense then don't the entire arguements of ""Saving money"" and ""National Pride"" really not translate to ""Ignorance"" and ""Xenophobia"" which are essentially both points on the same axes of ""Stupidity"" and ""Racism"" the BNP are reknowned to campaign on?

And lets not forget the UKIP party's MP's often have roots from within the Conservative party. I happily make digs about the elitist nature of the tories as any other man, so I'd like to make the point that the connection is quite unnerving. Letting my inner conspiracy theorist run wild, it wouldn't surprise me if a number of the parties founders had close ties to people who run successful businesses that are dependant on some caveat of current trade agreements. That if changed may adversely affect their businesses (accepting more eastern european countries in to the union and having to enforce the EU minimum wage etc). But of course that's purely speculation, I'm sure they're all just doing it because they just ""know"" its right and/or for the chance to partake in the glamorous spectacle that is British politics! ;)

Addendum: Just to show how expensive it can become to work in such a method here are some examples:

Three countries A, B and C want to set up individual trade agreements. This requires 3 agreements (A+B, A+C, B+C or 2+1=3)

Four countries A, B, C and D want to set up trade agreements. This requires 6 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, B+C, B+D, C+D or 3+2+1=6).

Five countries A, B, C, D and E want to set up trade agreements. This requires 10 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C, B+D, B+E, C+D, C+E, D+E or 4+3+2+1=10)

Six Countries A, B, C, D, E and F want to set up trade agreements. This requires 15 agreements (5+4+3+2+1)

There are 27 states in the EU, every time that an issue should arise if we were to discuss it individually then there would potentially be 378 negotiations (27+26+25+...+2+1=378). Should it be a matter that concerns all 50 european states then there would have to be a combined effort of 1275 negotiations.

In order to do that, they pulled off a bunch of logrolling and compromising, the result of which was the Constitution.

As far as I know, the 'original' claim lays on a deity and the 'original' settlers lost that claim in a war some thousands of years ago.  Your logic seems to admit any current claim is impermanent, regardless.  Do you agree the entire strength of the current claim rests on military hardware, weapons and delivery vehicles that are 90% reliant on petrochemicals to be operational?

&gt; When you engage in a war and lose you lose those claims. So yes, you do have a moral obligation to grant the victors the spoils.

&gt; You're misreading Article 22. The UK owned the land prior to the mandate. MacDonald paper is irrelevant.

&gt; I never said the UN set up Israel. Israel declared its independence in a land owned by no one.

&gt; A land grab in a defensive war is not a crime against humanity.

The fact that the offer was made to Palestinians, specifically, and not to others doesn't strike you at all?  Palestinians were dealing with massive social upheaval from the presence of refugees already, so accepting the deal was 'bailing out' the colonial occupiers who were doing their best to ship Jews out of Europe and to the Middle East (or kill them and hide the bodies in mass graves) already.

By this logic, Palestinians who deem the war to not have ended are justified, militarily, in reclaiming their homes and land by removing particular ethnic groups, through settlement, starvation, demolition of existing residential areas, and military occupation.  Is that not what you are directly stating?

&gt; Superceded by the UN mandate which Palestine rejected.

&gt; Nope, Palestine did not accept the UN provision at the time.

In point of fact, it was the Arab League and leaders of the Arab Higher Committee (an explicitly religious-based organization) that rejected the UN mandate, preferring the League of Nations agreement.  Today these organizations hold almost no authority, and we can practically interpret this as a result of their inability to prevent crimes against humanity from being inflicted, continuously and systematically, on political refugees in Israel.

The history is told ""like a story"", with a clear narrative train, following what happened in an orderly manner.  Sometimes a single point of view is used, but usually multiple points of view are offered allowing contemporaneous incidents in multiple locations to described.

Narrative history is one of my favourites too.  Some ""scholarly"" historians look down on it, and consider it populist, but so what?  History *should* be popular!

Some of my favourites include

[The Making of the Atomic Bomb](http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780684813783/The-Making-of-the-Atomic-Bomb) by Richard Rhodes.  This is an amazing book.  Rhodes justifiably won the Pulitzer Prize for this book.  It really does read like a thriller, and along the way you learn about history, economics, WWII, American politics and military affairs during WWII, European history, physics... the list goes on.  Try it.  If the opening scene with Leo Szilard doesn't catch your attention, then nothing will.  :)

[The Civil War - A Narrative](http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780394749136/The-Civil-War) by Shelby Foote.  The most important ""American story"" you can read IMHO.  Foote's history is amazing.  You can tell he was a novelist, as his book carries you along with the sweeping scope, the little details, the fascinating little details and asides, the character descriptions and (oh!!) the awesome battles.  A huge trilogy, it will take some time to read, but you won't ever regret it.  An d American historical masterpiece.

[Peter the Great](http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780345336194/Peter-the-Great) by Richard Massie is a wonderful historical biography describing the life and times of Russia's great Czar; credited with opening up Russia to Europe, as father of the Russian navy and creating St Petersburg (amongst other things).  Great story very well told.  Much more interesting than it may look at first!

[The Guns of August](http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780345476098/The-Guns-of-August) by Barbara Tuchman is another classic.  Perhaps America's favourite popular historian, Tuchman's book describes the opening month of WWI.  The opening passage is this book is considered one of the most famous in narrative history.  Another Pulitzer Prize winner.

[Rubicon](http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781400078974/Rubicon) by Tom Holland is a recent history of the Fall of the Roman Republic.  One could argue it has some thematic (as opposed to narrative) aspects, but it still tells a thumping good story!

Western powers exploited the region for its wealth and drew artificial borders, with little or no regard for the native people and their cultures.

Hitler didn't kill Jews because they practiced the religion judaism. He killed them because they were Jews by race. And that includes both the ones with the hats and curly sideburns and all the other ones who aren't very religious and look like Italians or any other white person. I wouldn't call those Zionists atheists. I would just call them not very observant. The one thing they all had in common was the fact they are Jews by race. And whether you disagree that there is such a thing, since it's a religion...that's not the way the anti-semites see it. They see it as a religion and a race.

As much as I am against anything that makes divisions based on race, I have exceptions to that. Poor black people, for example, aren't given a fair chance. I support some affirmative action to help get them on a level playing field. For Jews, they were literally almost wiped off the entire face of the planet. They were getting persecuted and expelled from Arab lands. They were getting persecuted and massacred in about half of Europe. And the rest of Europe wanted nothing to do with them, nor would they take on the huge numbers of potential refugees. So the way I see it, unless these anti-Zionist redditors and far left wingers and far right wingers want to accept Jews in their home and offer them protection from persecution, which they have faced in every other place they have lived, then they shouldn't be against Jews having their own damn state so they can have their own army to protect them and not be a minority in some government that doesn't like them for who they are.",True,c0pb0h2,,0,I_scored,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0pb0h2

Typically, when a small country like Greece overspends and runs large deficits year after year, there is a corrective mechanism that prevents this from getting out of hand. The corrective mechanism is:

1. Lenders realize that the country's debt-to-earnings ratio is getting bad, and either stop lending or else increase interest rates so that debt becomes more expensive, and the country can borrow less. It's the same as when you max your credit cards - if your cards are maxed, you will have a hard time finding lenders who will lend you more.

2. The currency devalues as a result of the large debt-to-earnings ratio, so imports become more expensive. Imported goods cost more, so people buy less of them. Spending decreases.

With the Euro, both these mechanisms are impaired. The currency can't be devalued, it's not under Greek government control. And they have kept getting low interest rates based on the creditworthiness of the Euro itself, not based on the state of the Greek economy. In effect, they have been getting loans on the same terms as the Germans, for example, who are massively more creditworthy.

This is [starting to change](http://web.stratfor.com/images/europe/art/ClubMedSpreads800.jpg?fn=9615397669), but for almost a decade, that's how Greece has coasted along. This is how the Greek government were able to finance social schemes, grant an amazing range of welfare benefits to their citizenry. It was a popular way to get votes. And as you pointed out, there is an enormous amount of corruption within the system too, from people not paying their share of taxes to outright bribery.

These things are obviously the fault of Greek politicians and citizens. They have been living off debt which they can't repay. However, there is another side to it as well, which is the sheer difficulty of integrating a country like Greece into the Eurozone.

When you have a common currency across a large region, when goods can move freely across the region, you have basically expanded the range of competition to the whole region. If a Greek is producing widgets for sale across Europe, and a German is also producing the same widgets for sale across Europe, the German and the Greek are pretty much competing on a level field. They sell in the same currency, they buy their raw material in the same currency, they pay the same in tarrifs (or lack of tarrifs). This system only works if their efficiency of production is comparable.

But Greece has had only brief flirtations with capitalism in recent history, and they have not learned the efficient use of capital. So efficiencies are not the same across the Eurozone. If you [compare the efficiency of production per unit of labor](http://web.stratfor.com/images/europe/3-15-10-Eurozone_labor_costs_800.jpg?fn=7715699362) across the Eurozone, you will see that Greece is near the bottom, and Germany is at the top. In other words, Greece **can't** compete with Germany for anything that Germany decides to produce and sell across Europe. The normal mechanisms available to a country to offset such imbalances (such as to devalue their own currency) are not available to Greece. This basically means that Greek industry dies whenever it encounters a more efficient producer. In the Eurozone, this usually means Germany.

So for the Greeks, this has been a two-edged sword. On the one hand, they got cheap credit, but on the other hand, at the cost of killing their industry in the face of German and French and Dutch competition.

If Greece had been wiser, if their politicians more honest, if their citizenry more willing to put up with hardship, they would have used the cheap credit to build up their economy - build modern factories and infrastructure, train their people, invested their money to bring them in line with the level of capital efficiency of Germany, or at least near the average for the Eurozone. Instead, they used it to cater to special interest groups, welfare programs beyond their earning capacity, etc. So now they have a crisis.",True,c0pbd20,,0,xenofon,,3,0,0,True,t1_c0pbd20

Now to be honest IQ elitism has always struck me as being a bit dubious - having spent some time in environments that select for high IQ they are much more disfunctional than average.

&gt;You are too far gone for me to convince you here that your basic assertion that religious governments are more fundamentally susceptible to injustice than secular governments is flat wrong.

The argument is not and has not in any way ever been that secular governments are not susceptible to injustice. You are moving the goal posts.

Further to this from wikipedia (not the best source, but easiest to find)
&gt;Thus, while the rest of Europe was plagued by revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up an actual constitution which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues.

Correct me if i'm wrong but weren't the US Founders working on their constitution around 1787? Around this time Switzerland was a confederacy of authoritarian family controlled valleys. Napoleon conquered the country in 1798 and imposed a unified constitution. Which was replaced with the aforementioned 1848 number.

They want a share of Europe's prosperity, but they'd be happy to work for it, to integrate into society (if given a chance) and contribute. But there are also those who see themselves as a spearhead of a global movement to promulgate the word of Allah, establish a caliphate to which all other cultures will be converted or submitted and enslaved. They are no doubt the minority, but they push really hard. I'm appalled that England has turned part of its judiciary over to so-called Sharia courts that practice a separate and incompatible form of law right within British territory. These folks claim to be asking for religious freedom, which I'd not object to, but in reality they are demanding concessions aimed at the ultimate goal of making Europeans tolerated slaves in their own countries. These ""loud"" Muslims also strive to radicalize their otherwise peacable brethren. There are Muslim ghettos both in France and Germany where police forces cannot go for fear of their lives.

I'm painting with a very broad brush here and I'm consciously not examining deeper reasons and assignable blame. I'm just trying to explain why I feel uneasy at what's happening with Muslims in Europe. I see what passes for ""culture"" and ""society"" in much of the Middle East, and would prefer, thank you very much, to have no part of it anywhere near me.

Personally, I think that if cultures mingle it needs to happen slowly and carefully. European colonization has essentially destroyed most of the indigenous population of America (both continents) and severely disrupted most African cultures. In more recent times, the USA's efforts to introduce democracy by carpet bombing are also showing mixed results, to put it kindly. In fact, I get the impression that whenever there is a massive influx of one population into the turf of another, at least one of the cultures involved takes massive damage.

As far as I can tell, the Algerians who pack up their bags to live in France are dirt poor, borderline starving poor. When they move to France, they can make a better ""living"" on welfare than they did back home. This is very understandable motivation, but apart from putting a few Francs into their pockets, there's nothing really being accomplished. The Algerians have trouble with the language and don't bring any useful skills to the labor market, and the French aren't managing very well to integrate them; nor do they seem highly motivated to do so.

The result is that you have mutually resentful parallel societies, neither of whom is really benefitting. So long as European countries don't develop (and the Muslims don't accept) processes for successful mass acclimatization and integration, nobody is served by the influx of Muslims into Europe.

What seems to work is stuff like educational exchanges. Students from developing countries learn and study in Europe and often bring back knowledge and ideas that help improve life and culture back in their home countries. They see that there are tangible benefits to not letting the clergy run a country. They see that a liberal society is not necessarily a society of rapists. They see it's possible to make friends with infidels.

Similar ideas going the other way, but I see this is turning into a long-ish essay.

This is, roughly, my personal vision of how Muslim and European cultures could approach each other: In measured doses and from a distance. Let loose on each other in quantity, cultures do not fuse, they clash.

Germany is paying the *most*, not just because we're the biggest country in the EU but because we're the baddest. We have more money.

As it is now with the millions of EU migrants working here on our minimum wage but below our standard of living, as well as collecting welfare checks, they're gaining more than we do, especially those who save their money to go back home with, which most do.

May Day was celebrated by socialists and social-democrats long before the Cold War, long before the Eastern Bloc came into being. 

In the Netherlands, May Day is not (and I suppose never was) a national holiday, but in Utrecht, where I last lived before emigrating, social-democratic and union workers would, back in the day, march down from the workers' neighbourhoods towards the city center with marching bands and banners and the lot - and that was long before the Cold War. It has a venerable tradition that, while definitely ""red"" in nature, was in no way tied to the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Hell, I played in a May Day play in the local neighbourhood center when I was eight, back in the seventies, in a West-European country, as the child of a social-democratic family that wanted nothing to do with communism.

&gt;it's actually because the US is more advanced than the May Day celebrators in recognizing worker's rights.

But this again only works if you define ""the May Day celebrators"" as Eastern Bloc countries, which despite all their rhetoric were lousy with workers' rights in practice. But since May Day was (and partially is) a holiday across much of the Western world outside America too, in particular in countries with a long social- or christian-democratic tradition where workers rights are definitely better guaranteed than in America, I don't agree with this either.

&gt;So initially the US didn't celebrate because they already had labor day. Later they didn't switch (like other countries) because May Day was associated with communism / Warsaw Pact.

OK, fair enough, that's straightforward enough, from the US vantage point, and I realize that really just was your original point.

For the record, if this wasn't clear from my post, I in no way implied that communists and social-democrats formed a *front* against the Nazis. The Volksfront as a particular alliance against the Nazis did only materialized late, only in some countries, and did not last for long once Stalin ordered another course reversal when he worked together with Nazi Germany to occupy Poland.

No, and I'm sorry if I was not clear, I did not try to create a Volksfront. The communists and social-democrats were often bitter enemies. But they were, both, at the forefront of resistance against the Nazis, fighting them when the conservatives ended up striking a deal with Hitler and helping him into power. I don't think that a cherry-picked strike where communists and Nazis worked towards the same ends is much of a refutation of that. 

It had been communist youth groups that battled the Nazi ones on the streets, it had been the social-democratic leadership that had warned against the Nazis from the start and refused to ever deal with them. While both social-democrats and communists loved to paint the other black, they both identified themselves as the Nazis' main opponent - and were identified as the left end of the axis with the Nazis at the right end of the axis by contemporaries. And it was the socialists and social-democrats who were the first to be sent to the camps and prisons after the Nazis took power; and it was, across most of Europe, communists and socialists who were the most active in the anti-Nazi underground resistance during the years of the occupation, and gave their lives for it. That makes the equation between socialists and Nazis distasteful to me.

&gt; Ulbricht thought of the GDR as a socialist country of German nation (see constitution until 1974) and reunification was one of his goals.

&gt; You need to curl up and die. Now. [...] [You] fucking lying propagandistic piece of shit.

I'd rather not, but thanks for the certainly well-meant advice.

&gt; Any labour shortage in Germany is due to companies ""outsourcing""; tax the fuck out of that and get the rest of the EU to do the same so that it's no longer profitable and employment here will rise. Which benefits our own economies the same way you managed to restate the obvious about kick-starting EE economies so they can afford to become consumers.

Wait -- I thought you wouldn't like mercantilists? But protectionism is OK in your book?

As you already mentioned, we have a comfortable current account surplus. It would hurt us more than anybody else. Outsourcing and imports are the same thing, as you probably know.

&gt; Germany is paying the most, not just because we're the biggest country in the EU but because we're the baddest. We have more money. We have more people (but only get as many votes as the neighbour with a 30% smaller population). Our economy isn't in shambles. We are the rock which stabilises the euro.

We also hold the largest share of the ECB's capital, which is the key used for the distribution of the bailout costs.

&gt; Which is what caused the problems in the first place. Apparently you're not as clever when it comes to economics as you initially tried to make it seem.

Wut?

&gt; Except that the fuckers don't work. They strike all the fucking time. Or simply don't bother going to work at a rate which is shocking even to German bureaucrats.

Stereotype much?

&gt; Finally, you're buying a VERY flawed argument about the loss of euro value which is no surprise considering everything else you wrote. We are already an exporting nation and much of what we export -- even agricultural goods -- are fairly price-inelastic. Yes, even cars: if you want a Merc or BMW you're not going to settle for a Honda Civic (although you might go with an Audi).

People still need to be able to afford them. And much of our exports is heavy machinery, for example, a sector where we're competing with Japan or the US.

How about PBS? [**shattered dreams of peace **](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oslo/negotiations/)
 
*In a desperate attempt to salvage the peace effort before Israel's  election (hard-liner Ariel Sharon was forecast to defeat Barak) negotiators met in the Egyptian resort of Taba, focusing on new parameters for an agreement which had been developed by Clinton the previous month. The new terms went further than what Israel and the U.S. had offered at Camp David.*

*In contrast to Camp David, the Palestinians this time made counter-offers. After a week of off-and-on negotiations, senior Palestinian and Israeli negotiators announced they had never been more close to reaching agreement on final-status issues. But they had run out of political time. They couldn't conclude an agreement with Clinton now out of office and Barak standing for reelection in two weeks. ""We made progress, substantial progress. We are closer than ever to the possibility of striking a final deal,"" said Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's negotiator. Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, said, ""My heart aches because I know we were so close. We need six more weeks to conclude the drafting of the agreement.""*


Bit different to your account isn't it?

I remember it. With two weeks to go in an Israeli election, Barak was tanking in the polls with leaks of his negotiation with the Palestinians and Sharon stomping around demanding the negotiations end..

so that's what happened. Barak broke off and said he would resume post the election.  Arafat appealed in Israeli TV that he return to the table, he didn't.

Post the election Barak went further, and wrote [**this**](http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/2/Barak%20to%20Bush-%20Sharon%20is%20not%20bound%20by%20negotiating) to the new president of the US.

*Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak clarified this evening that the ideas which were brought up in the course of the recent negotiations conducted with the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, including those raised at the Camp David Summit and by President Clinton towards the end of his term in office, are not binding on the new government to be formed in Israel. In a letter to President George Bush, Prime Minister Barak stated that his government had done the utmost to bring about an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but that these efforts did not bear fruit, primarily because of a lack of sufficient readiness for compromise on the part of the Palestinian leadership...Before sending the letter, Barak spoke with former President Clinton, and they were in agreement that the ideas raised in the past months are not binding on the new government in Israel. Prime Minister Barak intends to convey this position also to the heads of the European Union and to Chairman Arafat.*

Sorry to rain on your parade. But at least now you know.
  
FYI

[**""It was not Arafat who broke off the talks at this critical moment, when the light at the end of the tunnel was clearly visible to the negotiators, but Barak. He ordered his men to break off and return home.""**](http://gush-shalom.org/archives/article183.html) Uri Avnery Feb 2002 (an Israeli writer and founder of the Gush Shalom peace movement and former member of the Irgun.

That is the definition of trade according to Menger, that people will trade only when mutually agreed upon interaction behooves them, and no longer. Diminishing marginal utility means their valuations are subjective, but remember, it's separate valuations that cause them to trade *at all*. To regard an trade as occurring at a point of equal valuation leads to absurdities. If two people trade when they consider the value of what they are getting to be equal to the value of what they are giving up, there is no reason that they shouldn’t simply reverse the trade a moment later.

&gt; The state is the only entity with the power to stand up to modern transnationals.

No it isn't, and without removal of state assisted corporate personhood through the act of incorporation, transnationals will only grow in importance.

Going back to Ostrom's prize this past year, where she studied the commons, the study concludes of course that commons are almost always better when managed by private interests ... but she says she ""despairs over the oceans"". that any current form of management could never work.

Extrapolating out her work, and work of someone like a Hayek who finds that humans always find a most efficient way to manage things eventually, we'll likely end up with multi-nationals literally running the world so long as powerful state influences assist it. There really is only one eventual option, should corporations continue to recieve the protections they do (and they will, SCOTUS just affirmed personhood, and the EU treaty did as well). 

People making hundred year predictions often look foolish down the line, but I'm pretty certain that we'll eventually see transnationals managing the commons by way of representation. Whether it's through bought politicians (likely), or a more seemingly ""market"" approach (scare quotes because it's important to remember that I describe a likely outcome, not an endorsed one where incorporation is stripped and companies therefore limited to employee levels in the hundreds by marginal utility and reduce barriers). 

I think eventually unless the power of corporations and nations are disentangled, the only manageable outcome is oil, fisheries, shippers, tourist interests, etc, managing the oceans by way of a ""board"" of sorts, or bought politicians as their actors. I'd prefer a board I suppose, since reality is people are going to continue to argue for ""more regulatory framework"", and that always assists big business.

A board getting restitution from oil by way of the ire of fisheries, tourism, etc is probably going to be the outcome of national incorporation. We'll probably se an ""Oceancorp"" of combined interests in 2100, unless the wheels come off before that and people are eeking out mid 20th century productivity existences. 

It's frustrating people like yourself (no offense, I swear) don't realize they are *assisting* these corporations with arguments like yours above, but I really don't blame ""everyman"". This is incredibly complicated and no one of us, including anti-capitalist or market libertarians, truly understands the scope and lessons here.

 Yeah that was about 150 years ago (the land was sold via treaty after the Mexican American war and approved and signed by the respective govt. of Mexico), prior to this the area was a part of Mexico for around 50 years. Prior to that it was a Spanish territory (European conquest). Prior to that It was held by Local Indian tribes  virtually wiped out by the Spanish, and then the Mexicans, then the US. 
 So please do go on about how this was part of Mexico's land, though prior to the Spanish invasion only parts of Texas were ever historically part of anything that currently resembles Mexico. (your welcome to take that up with the Texans)

 In short, history does not stand by your implied statement that somehow this was always historically Mexico's land. (It was a leftover of European conquest)

Furthermore, after state intervention, previously established institutions of trust, recourse (e.g., arbitration, spontaneous ostracism), and customary law survived as a source of competition for the state. Reliance on the state for rules and/or legal sanctions at an early stage of economic development is likely to mean that the future evolution commercial law will be along very different paths than the ones taken in the economies of Western Europe and North America. Withdrawal of the state from any efforts to influence
commerce will do more to stimulate the emergence of economic activity than any proactive state efforts to speed up the process: such efforts will inevitably be undermined by the problems of knowledge and interest.

&gt; Fran: Is there a role for government in those situations?

&gt;&gt; Elinor: We need institutions that enable people to carry out their management roles. For example, if there’s conflict, you need an open, fair court system at a higher level than the people’s resource management unit. You also need institutions that provide accurate knowledge. The United States Geological Survey is one that I point to repeatedly. They don’t come in and try to make proposals as to what you should do. They just do a really good job of providing accurate scientific knowledge, particularly for groundwater basins such as where I did my Ph.D. research years ago. I’m not against government. I’m just against the idea that it’s got to be some bureaucracy that figures everything out for people.

&gt; Fran: How important is it that there is a match between a governing jurisdiction and the area of the resource to be managed?

&gt;&gt; Elinor: To manage common property you need to create boundaries for an area at a size similar to the problem the people are trying to cope with. But it doesn’t need to be a formal jurisdiction. Sometimes public officials don’t even know that the local people have come to some agreements. It may not be in the courts, or even written down. That is why sometimes public authorities wipe out what local people have spent years creating.

After this the students should decide on whether to attend a two year technical college for a skills trade (carpentry, automotive, machinery, construction, etc) or continue onto their ""higher schooling"" years and take two years to prepare them for university.

During those ""higher schooling years"", which should last about two years, a decent size of the student body will be filtered out via failing, not meeting standards. The ones who do ""survive"" these two years receive free education at any university that will accept them. The ones who filter out won't receive free education and either have to choose to go to technical college, pay their way manually through university, or do something else.

The mathematical consequences of the various systems of inbreeding have been worked out by several authors. Kalmus and Smith (1948), Crow and Roberts (1950), and Polhemus, Lush, and Rothenbuhler (1950) have reported on the various systems of inbreeding possible with honey bees.

The corporate spokesmen you speak of are very much in support of the government however on the subject of our military, war, and global imperialism in general though, yes? So in that sense they don't want their listeners to run from the government, quite the contrary, they want them to join up and start shooting for the good ol US of A!  Very unlibertarian, my friend.

I then realized much of what they said about ""evil corporations"" had a bit of truth in it as well.

Why do you think the big oil companies have been behind so much regulation in their industry?  Why do you think Big Pharma and the big insurance companies are so in favor of Health Care Reform?  It's because they own the politicians!  They write the regulations themselves to effectively box out the competition and give themselves favor.  Much political rhetoric over the past decade has centered over whether a particular policy is “favorable to business,” or whether a candidate is “pro-business.” In earlier years, I rooted for any “business-friendly” policy move, and supported conservative “pro-business” politicians. But, as I learned over the years, “pro-business” ideas are all too often inconsistent with “free-market” ideas.

When politicians speak about being “pro-business,” they try to create the impression they will do things to benefit the business climate. That help, however, can come in two forms. One form is in the promise of deregulation, or a promise to fight new regulations or taxes that will potentially harm the economy, an industry, or a firm. This is generally all to the good; the help is “negative”; that is, the politician will focus on what the government should not do regarding a business’s activity.

But the second form of “pro-business” help is “positive,” that is, the state takes some action that specifically helps a business or an industry, usually at the expense of other people. The government creates some law or regulation that allows a business to do or have something it could not otherwise do or have in a true free market. It grants what amounts to a privilege.

I do know what a ""figurehead"" monarchy is. But this is not the point of the article. It talks about monarchies as if they were interchangeable. The term lumps together regimes that don't have very much in common, except that they happen to call their head of state king/queen or whatever. And it assumes the fact that you have a monarch is THE relevant factor for democracy, when instead the actual research on democracy shows that other factors are way more important. For example: 

- political system 
- what kind of society (strong civil society?)
- size of population
- homogeneity of society / equality
- wealth
- young/old system

Once you take this in account and look at the actual data, you will find that the leading countries in the democracy index are Scandinavian, followed by norther european countries. So this leads to a strong hypothesis: The fact that they lead the democracy index is not so much because they all got a monarch. It is because they are all very much alike in key areas that make a high score on the index more likely.  
It is also worth mentioning that the research on modern welfare theory (where the democracy index draws key indices from) is heavily influenced by scandinavian authors like Esping-Anderson.

Generally speaking, the economy of Scotland in this period was critically underdeveloped when compared to that of England or the Netherlands or really most other countries in North West Europe.  It is pretty evident from the writings of the directors of the Company of Scotland, and other contemporary observers, that the Darien scheme was basically one grand attempt to enrich the nation by establishing their own colony.  One way to look of it is a sort of 17th century equivalent to Bismark's 'Place in the Sun' though not nearly as jingoistic.  

So far as I know, enclosure was less of an issue in Scotland that it was in England, though I admit, I haven't really explored how this directly impacted the colonization effort.  What I can say is that following the personal union of the two crowns (which is different from the union of 1707) in 1603, Scotland was placed in an increasing role of economic subordination to England which includes your note about Scotch-Irish participation in English colonization.  The difference between this and Darien was that the Scots in the English colonies were typically servants or laborers working under English hegemony.

When people are not oppressed and generally doing better religion as a whole is less important in their lives, and Christianity in particular seems to do worse.

Therefore the fact that Christianity is thriving in China, where it is oppressed, and in Africa where quality of life is low, while it's doing less well in areas where it is freely practiced and where quality of life is higher is exactly what I'd expect.

&gt;No, we would not have negotiate terms with each member state for Free Trade agreements and the such, we would negotiate directly with the EU who represent all member states.

Didn't I make this point myself? Europe will have more power in negotiating against us if we attempt to negotiate as an individual state from outside the EU. Then there's the whole best business practices that a lot of our companies will be forced to adopt regardless of being part of the EU. A lot of companies are internationally based (Banks, Supermarkets, retail and the majority of industry finds it's raw materials outside our borders), expecting them not to be heavily influenced by regulations passed within the EU when these supercompanies find themselves making a large portion of their profits outside our borders is extremely naive. We should help lead europe, not end up being led by them.

&gt;What it really comes down to is this, we in the UK exploit a lot more than than our fare share of the planet's resources, we're richer and better placed in the markets than most other EU members.

And we will continue to be better placed in all of those markets than most other EU members. Why? Because we're there already. Just like how France and Germany continue to be extremely successful even though they are full members of the union.

&gt;As it is now with the millions of EU migrants working here on our minimum wage but below our standard of living, as well as collecting welfare checks, they're gaining more than we do, especially those who save their money to go back home with, which most do.

I agree that would be a problem IF it were actually a problem. You see, aside from the recent influx of unemployment due to hiccup in the economy there has been little change in the unemployment rate in recent history. The rising figures are mainly down to the population increasing naturally (10% of 100 is less than 10% of 1000). Perhaps there has been a worrying decrease in the number of apprenticeships available each year. But then we've seen increases to the age of retirement, people living longer healthier lives and this mean we aren't just filling old jobs with new faces we're having to create new jobs to accomodate a large portion of school leavers.

Why is this relevant? Well, if those nasty immigrants were coming here and stealing all our jobs because they'll work for a cheaper rate, then wouldn't we see unemployment raise proportionately to immigration? Well to my knowledge it doesn't, and the only parties that claim it is are the UKIP and BNP. I'm hessitant to use the following link considering your next point, but it's the most [appropiate article based on external data](http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=20351).

&gt;Now you may be part of some socialist movement that seeks to divide up the world's resources equally in thin slivers for each human inhabitant, but you ought to know it won't work. As you pointed out yourself there are special interests, super rich people. And just think of it, you're most likely quite rich yourself compared to most people in Poland, Latvia and other East European countries.

Rofl, socialism is horrible, our socialist healthcare, police force, fire service, local maintenance groups and essentially our government are all terrible terrible socialist things. Not only that, but I whole heartedly think nations should continue slave labour by manipulating foreign economies and exploiting their work forces. After all, it's not slavery unless we bring them here!

Do you have any idea how unbelievabley racist you sound? My dental practice just got taken over by a polish couple, why? There's shortage of dentists wanting to work in my area and shock horror they're qualified dentists. Just because somebody is from Poland or Lativia or any of the eatern european states shouldn't mean they are lesser people not worthy of my money. Like all the candidates at the prime ministerial debates said, if people want to come to england to work and pay taxes, and won't put a strain on employment for UK nationals then they are and should always be welcome to come here. 

You make out like every person allowed in to the country is here to seek benefits. The reality is, most of them come here to work and of the immigrants that do come here and end up on benefits the majority are assylum seekers and they only make up a small fraction of people that make it in to the country.

This is why brown made a passing remark about that woman being bigoted. There's a massive and unfounded stigma about immigration that is largely false.

Only, it will be too late then for though you can change your mind, you will have given rise to a real populist movement with very unhealthy cultural characteristics, even racist.

Firstly, to become a member of the EU is not something that just happens. Your country has to meet a number of criteria in policy that nations within the EU have agreed on in the [Acquis Communartaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire). Essentially it's a document that defines how developed a nation must be before they can be considered for EU membership. [Here is how turkey currently stand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Status_of_the_acquis_chapters) on being accepted, all of those must turn green or have exceptionally good reason why they cannot be changed. As you can see, as of 2006 when Turkey last negotiated it's ascension they pretty much failed on all fronts.

And even should Turkey meet the criteria the EU sets, they must then be unanimously voted in to the EU. Should only a single country disagree then they won't be accepted in. At the moment, a large portion of the wealthier countries in the EU see turkey as a potential landmine. And until they see a vast improvement in Turkeys politics, they aren't going to let them in to the EU.

So yes, Turkey could join the EU as soon as 2013. But unless a miracle happens, and by miracle I literally mean an event of divine nature, then it won't get in. If you believe they could then you really don't understand what the EU is and will continue to be.

&gt;So there is that, but there is the statement you made ""irrational fear of giving part of our own governments powers to other countries"" which betrays either a certain ignorance or tyranny if you're a politician for a nation's sovereignty is not yours to give away. And even if this was on the back of a referendum that made this legal, you really think central planning works? How old are you?

The EU isn't a government as such, it's a stakeholders meeting for international policy. Laws are rarely passed at the EU level, just agreements and directives to facilitate a better standard of life and business for its members. And anything that is passed as Law is done so because its essentially accepted by all the member states already, there just isn't any way to enforce it actually happens (just as criminal law changes to meet the requirements of the times).

That said, we are a big influence in europe. The little power we have already given up, has greatly increased the power we have to dictate what other countries do themselves.

As you said, it's not our politicians power to give away and there should be a referendum before we further intergrate with europe. To my knowledge Labour and the Lib Dems both agree that we should look to join the EU when the time is right. However I think it's worded that not because they think now is a bad time to join, but because if they held a referendum, it would never get passed due to the ignorance of the masses that are allowed to vote on the subject. In essence advocating a referendum when nobody is interested in joining would be political suicide, just as attempting to get our country to join without referendum.

I'm all for democracy, I think the right for everybody to vote is a fantastic thing. But I feel that a lot of people aren't voting on things they fully understand. They're ability to think freely and in their best interests is corrupted by media scare stories that take things out of context. Take the Greek economy for example, do you think europe would just stand by and watch it crumble if it weren't for the EU? I doubt it very much. It wouldn't surprise me if countries outside the EU with interests in greek business have also loaned them money to try and stabalise their economy. However the media have gone to great lengths to make out that the EU is some kind of piggy bank that struggling european nations can always turn to. Completely missing the point that perhaps those countries aren't loaning money because of the EU, but because their individual country has interests in Greece.

As for your question about whether central planning works, I'd have to say yes I think it's fairly apparent that it is important at least to some degree. I'll jump the gun here and assume your raising the point because you think it isn't. To that I would firstly like to ask, do you think the central planning that we're going to vote on thursday works? And secondly, do not see how important international stability is for individual countries?

To elaborate on the latter question, I'll go back to the greek economy. Do you agree that adverse events to the greeks can also impact a number of other european states? And do you agree that the EU could have done a better job in instigating better directives to have avoided this crisis all together or at least lessened its impact to a more manageable level? 

Personally I think both are true. While I have no idea what british buisinesses are directly tied with the greek economy, it's not hard to imagine a rippling effect that will actually affect us. I also think the EU could have done a better job in protecting us from having to pay out billions to save their economy, but I also appreciate the EU is a realtively new thing. There is still a lot of work to be done in fine tuning it to benefit everybody, but that will never happen if at the first sign of trouble countries begin to jump boat.

The world isn't like it was 100 years ago. International business is becoming much more common. It's not unheard of for small to medium sized businesses to have initiatives set up in a number of countries. You can't just bury your head in the sand and say that you only care about the ones based in your own nation any more. You only have to look back 12 months to the banking crisis to see how true this is.

The EU is the way forward, the sooner we get more involved the better and frankly, anybody who disagrees either doesn't understand how the modern world works (lets call them the voters) or simply driven by greed (lets call them the explotative businessmen, aka tories).

It's a biological fact.** Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that's used in the Old Testament is ""the Abomination."" Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And **there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew,** which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So **it's an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking.**

I repeat: Where is your research? Could you please give any reliable source with FACTS, that show a more constant energy production.
The sources of the images are written on the images. Albeit the German one is difficult to read. The source of the daily average of wind power energy production in Germany 2008 Geis: Statistisches Bundesamt, BDEW-PGr ""Strombilanz"".


&gt;I can see that multiple of your claims are nonsense, e.g.

and 

&gt;wind always blows strongly enough to generate electricity somewhere in Britain.

You used this quote from a opinion page in order to ""disprove"" my claim that wind power fluctuates between 5% of average output to 280% of average output several times every month.
These graphs based on data collected by the British and the German government organizations do show these fluctuations. I never claimed, that there are extended periods of time with NO energy production. So, yes, there is always enough wind to produce electricity, but sometimes far less electricity than average. Therefore large over-capacities and/or storage facilities are required in order to provide electricity during these periods.
There are also times, when far more than the average power is produced, therefore the infrastructure has to handle a multiple of the average load. 

These are direct conclusions from the fluctuating power data. You have not debated any of these conclusions to this point. You have only made ad hominem remarks, and the demand, that I write my online comment with the same rigor as a scientific paper (while not doing it yourself). It is not my job to convince you, and show you all the data in such an informal setting. Don´t believe my facts, check them yourself! If you want to debate my comment, go and do check my data, or provide solid contradicting data. If you don´t want to bother with my comment shut up and stop insulting me!


&gt;I don't understand what you're trying to say.

I am sorry that my English skills were not good enough to make my argument comprehensible. Let me try again:

When you use electricity from your outlet, then you do not simply require a certain amount of energy, but energy that is delivered where you need it, when you need it, at a certain voltage and at a certain frequency with a certain stability.
Providing the latter requires a vast infrastructure and causes costs. [This](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Strompreis_2D.png&amp;filetimestamp=20100321163327) is a Graph of the factors that contribute to the German energy prices. 37% of the price are the costs of energy production including the company profit, 24% is the transport and control of electricity within the private grid, 7.7% is the cost of the public grid, 1% is the cost for the disposal of nuclear waste, and the rest are different kinds of taxes. So 31.7% (24 + 7.7) of the price are for transport and control of electricity. This means: if the cost of transport and control of electricity increases by the factor of 2.2 or more, then the infrastructure alone will be more expensive than current infrastructure + power production. At current market prices this would mean that the value of energy-production becomes negative.

 We need the capacity to produce, transport and control an amount of energy which is at least the average demand, because the average energy supply needs to be equal to the average energy demand. However any additional capacity costs extra money. When 280% of the average wind power are produced, then the infrastructure needs to be capable to handle 2.8 times the average power-output. When wind power delivers only 10% of its average power-output, then you need the additional capacity to produce the remaining 90% from different energy sources, from different locations (transeuropean grid), or from storage. However, this extra capacity can not be used, when there is more wind power, and therefore costs extra money. These two factors and others increase the costs for handling wind power at least three fold (under ideal conditions).
 
 So even if wind power production was free, its fluctuations will cause costs, which are more expensive than the total current system (except taxes).

 
&gt;No. I'm not interested in analyzing your evidence-free opinion.

If you don´t want to analyze it, then don´t debate it and don´t insult me!


&gt;I used no sarcasm. Perhaps you should check the definition of that word?

I do know what sarcasm is. Even if you follow a sarcastic comment with your direct opinion in the next sentence, this does not make it not sarcasm. Trying to wiggle yourself out of this with semantics, does not effect my criticism of your smug debating style. Of course you can insult me, claim that i am doing nothing but spreading propaganda, or claim that i am lying. We both live in free countries, so you can be as shameless as you want.

What defines the Asperger's... it's hard to put that in words. When I'm not around people (i.e. alone at home basically) I don't notice anything, but as soon as there is contact there is this alien-like quality about how I go on communicating with them. I never noticed this early in my life but with the medication self-awareness of the differences improved much for me, and it's also what allows me better to compensate for the difference.

A big difference is that in my normal unmedicated state I almost completely lack empathy for other people, in a very fundamental sense. I.e. when I ask someone on the street what the time is and they're being all friendly and cheery I'm totally unemotional, just say ""thank you"" and go my way. Sort of like that. However I am capable of feeling empathy for my friends of which there are about 3 or 4 and that's it (but I don't really need more than that.) I think this lack of empathy, or, dealing with interpersonal situations on a pure logical basis lacking emotion can be easily misunderstood for misanthropy but it's not like that at all (although I have my reasons to hate people, too), it's just a mode of operation.

What others notice about me is repetetive behaviour (I tend to do the same things all the time and do them in the same way), they notice the lack of empathy in certain situations, they *strongly* notice that sometimes, a situation is just ""too much"" for me and I need to get out of it (but only those who know me better, for everyone else it probably just seems like I'm getting very nervous).

What people *also* notice about me is my humor and my capability for practical jokes which I tend to do all the time, sometimes even in inappropriate settings, and people have always liked me because (semi-quote) ""I'm so weird but a really funny guy with weird but funny ideas"".

That collection grew with games like The Last Remnant and F.E.A.R. 2 also forcing me to use Steam. I didn't like Steam then, and I don't like it now. However, it is a convenient way of digitising my collection. I often buy games from Steam that I have the discs for, or have on another platform, simply because it makes gaming when I'm out and about a lot easier. Of course, there are games I own on Steam that I don't own the physical copies of. About 125, if my Steam games list is to be believed, but that is less than the count of my physical games collection, so I'm happy. I also make sure to have every Steam game installed at the same time.

It it safe? Pretty much. Especially if you're in the EU, where there are a whole load of consumer protection laws that stop you getting fucked over. Buy a game at full price only to have it go on sale the next day? Invoke the cooling off period of distance selling regulations, have it refunded and then buy it again at sale price.

No, but uninformed yet-opinionated people such as yourself holding out for tech that is always a decade away have stuck us with the current situation. Solar was a decade away in the seventies. Know-nothing hippes blocked nuclear in favor of the tech that was just around the corner. Solar was a decade away in the eighties and wind was going to be a big deal. Know-nothing hippes blocked nuclear in favor of the tech that was just around the corner. Repeat for the nineties and the aughts. In a few years you'll be able to repeat it for the 'teens, and we'll still be choking to death on coal and oil smoke.

*you are actually pretty misguided along with the rest of hicktown usa (aka southern usa).*

Let's see here, I've displayed (at least) a basic grasp of economic principles, the current state of technology, and reality in general. You write at the level of a fourth grader. If I'm in Hickville, you must be in Somalia.

*it's already a fact that lobbyists in the USA did not want electric cars. history shows that ford and GM chose to make big SUVs because they did not view gas as an issue. On the other hand, toyota went for fuel efficiency and invested in hybrid tech. ford and GM had to catch up in technology once gas and pollution recently became a big issue.*

So? Lobbyists are one factor, but only to the extent that corrupt politicians allow them to be. The consumer still drives much of the market. Detroit went into SUVs because they had a high markup, because **people wanted them**, and because they were being bled so much by unions they didn't have a whole lot of options. Both Detroit and Toyota made the decisions you speak of before the big oil spike, and both actually made sense for each company at the time.

Honestly, you're alleging some collaboration between the oil companies and the car companies, but that is not the case at all. No car company cares about fuel efficiency beyond what it thought it mattered to the consumer that was buying the car. Car companies and oil companies, as separate entities, have no reason to collaborate in some sort of retarded conspiracy theory as you describe.

You really sound like most of your perspective of the world was formed by watching old episodes of Captain Planet.

*also, rebut this point. why is that europe has more fuel efficient cars than the usa in an effort to cut down on pollution? it's because once gas prices went up, european car makers invested in better technology.*

Two things here: European consumers drive more efficient cars because the governments have artificially raised the price of gas through taxation. But the only reason this is possible is that Europe was mostly designed for pedestrians, horses, or trains and the average citizen can get around just fine without a car. It's not a big deal that gas is $8/gallon there since the people buying it tend to be upper class and have ample room in their budgets. 

In the US, even the lower classes depend on cars to go to work, and raising the price of gas 400% would simply make it so that a large segment of the population wouldn't be able to get to work or do anything else. That's reason one such a thing will never happen here. Reason two is that all of our infrastructure is based around the internal combustion engine. If you start taxraping the price of gas, the cost of groceries and consumer good will also skyrocket.

The second point is that European technology isn't embargoed from the US, as you seem to think. I bought a German car because of fuel efficiency concerns. It is a diesel that gets 45MPG, and I bought it entirely for the mileage.

*so your trip. 150 miles EACH WAY. how long are you stopping there? 15 minutes? exactly. all you have to do is plug it in while you are there. wait, is your town so fucking backwards that it doesn't have electricity?*

Yeah, 150 miles each way. And then I use the car to take my grandma places in her town, so there's no chance to plug it in. What if I'm going to the beach or a lake, or any other place that doesn't have a place where I can mooch electricity? As a consumer, am I going to buy a piece of shit that creates such a logistical nightmare, or am I going to buy a fucking car that works?

*oil companies aren't worried because they have lobbying power. fucks sake. they should be worried is my point. the last drop of oil on earth should not be extracted.*

you still haven't addressed the issue. foreign car makers invested in better tech because they were smart enough to see that oil would have been a problem. meanwhile, american auto companies just made gas guzzlers. they were obviously not inclined to start developing green tech.

it's funny you say that europe has the public infrastructure for people. didn't you previously assert that usa had good public transit? 

 the european government, unlike the usa, got smart and realized they didn't want to be dependent on oil forever. 

european tech is embargoed. americans cannot drive the 80+mpg cars that are available to the european market

there is a chance to plug in when you go to grandmas. are you constantly driving once you pick her up? you don't stop at the store with her or go eat? the whole point is that the infrastructure would be there to allow you to charge the car while you do these things. and yes, the infrastructure would be created, just like how there are gasoline stations.

you DO NOT NEED A GUN. First of all as a foreign worker in Brazil you dont want to be dealing with getting stopped by the police and carrying a gun in your pocket.

There is NO NEED for a body guard what so ever (i mean its not like you guys are worth millions of dollars). That being said definitely hire a maid/nanny if you feel you need it. Ask your employer and coworkers for advice as to hiring help so you get someone reliable.

At the upper levels it is not uncommon to have a driver, nanny, maid, gardener/handyman and cook. Some of the help stay on for years and become part of the family, in fact when i go back my family makes a point to see the former cook of a family friend of ours. 


As far as staying up late you can choose to go out at 2am or go out at 9pm both options exist, though the clubs/bars are going to be more fun towards midnight but you dont NEED to change your sleep schedule if you dont want too. 


&gt;5. Hospitals there are not so great (relative to good hospitals in the US/Canada). 


This blanket statement is categorically untrue. you will receive all the care that you need there if you find yourself in an emergency. Especially in Rio there are excellent hospitals on par with what you would find in the US and Europe. There are some hospitals that are not as good but they exist in the less populated areas of the country. Again i can not stress to you enough that Rio is a modern city with everything you would expect to find in any other modern city around the world. That being said you should find your own primary care doctor that you like and trust as you would in any other country in the world. My uncle is a surgeon in BH (the third largest city in Brazil) and i have been to one of the hospitals he works at and I it was just like any of the hospitals i have been to in the US.

But when they do, the Isrealis (and Isreali apologists like you) work very hard to dismiss them. The Israelis don't want peace, but they don't want to admit that, so they claim that the Palestinians don't want peace. I'm calling bullshit.

I agree that the reason the Palestinians want peace isn't (just?) because they are inherently better people, but because they're suffering from the conflict, whereas the Israelis are gaining from it (few casualties, and opportunities to steal more land).

The obvious conclusion is that the only way to get to peace is to put intense international pressure on the Israelis, through boycotts, divestitures and sanctions, so that the benefits of peace outweigh the benefits of prolonging the conflict.

&gt; The richest countries in the world are ""on the side"" of the Palestinians

As far as I know, the richest country in the world is the U.S., which AIPAC has wrapped around Israel's finger. Canada and much of Europe blamed the Gaza War on Hamas terrorism rather than IDF terrorism, even though the war started not with Hamas rockets but with an IDF invasion of Gaza.

*it's funny you say that europe has the public infrastructure for people. didn't you previously assert that usa had good public transit?*

No, I said that the US had passable public transit. What I was saying was that in Europe public transport is the primary mode of transport, not what you fall back on when you lose your job or when gas prices shoot through the roof.

*european tech is embargoed. americans cannot drive the 80+mpg cars that are available to the european market*

No, any car that's made over there that meets the standards for our roads is available here. Furthermore, any fundamental tech like engines, batteries, transmissions, and generators is freely exchangeable and indispensable across the pond. If you're just going to resort to making lies up from whole cloth, this really isn't worth my time.

*there is a chance to plug in when you go to grandmas. are you constantly driving once you pick her up? you don't stop at the store with her or go eat? the whole point is that the infrastructure would be there to allow you to charge the car while you do these things. and yes, the infrastructure would be created, just like how there are gasoline stations.*

Not really. I came into town for an hour, took her out to dinner, and left. There was no opportunity to plug in anywhere since the car was not stationary for more than thirty minutes. And this was a borderline case. If I had gone on a 400 mile round trip, the battery would have to be charged for several hours at my destination, something I may not have time for. If I had gone on a longer trip, say a vacation spot 1000 miles away, it would take me an extra day to make each leg of the journey. Even if there were charging stations everywhere, the charge time of five hours per 300 miles makes this completely impractical.

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_%28volume%29#Oil_barrel), oil is commonly measured in cubic metres (m^3), or especially in tonnes (t), which is how it's increasingly traded in the Europe.

1 cubic meter is exactly 1000 litres, so they're virtually interchangeable. Tonnes might be of more interest to someone purchasing oil, whereas litres seems more appropriate for measuring an oil slick.

Converting between litres and tonnes requires knowledge of the oil's density. Crude oil is graded from light (less than 870 kg/m^3) to heavy (920 to 1000 kg/m^3). Water is 1000 kg/m^3 (i.e. 1 kg of water is 1 litre), so any heavier than this and it sinks (""extra heavy"" oil grading). Light oil is easier to contain. South Louisiana crude is usually light. However analysis has found the slick's oil to be heavier. [Source](http://blog.al.com/live/2010/04/gulf_of_mexico_oil_spill_could.html)",False,c0pdcou,,0,fucking_use_metric,,4,0,0,True,t1_c0pdcou

Furthermore, battery tech only recently got to to the point where such things are possible and they committed no error in not investing in alternative fuel cars before the 2000s since such investment made **absolutely no sense**.

*and your argument that the tech wasn't there is bs. the fact that toy-onda is at least 10 years ahead in alt tech proves this point.*

The tech wasn't there. Toyota didn't get started on hybrid vehicles until well after the point where the oil crisis was in the works. But those are hybrids. All-electric vehicles, the ignorant fantasy that you've been going on about, still aren't feasible because the tech **still isn't there**. The pathetic range of the best electric vehicle today proves that point.

*road standards? does the usa have magical roads or something? they are being kept out of the market with regulations established by lobbyists.*

No, we do have different standards on what is street-legal. If there was a car that was street-legal in Europe and not street-legal in the US, it is because it is essentially a golf cart. The Mini and SmartCar made their way over here just fine, what car were you referring to?

*so you go on 100000000 mile trips. congrats. electric cars aren't for you, don't buy one. you do know that projected plans include battery swap stations that take less than 5 minutes to give you a full battery. of course you did.*

So you failed English and math? 300 or 600 miles are quite different from 100000000. The former are quite normal for me and everyone else that uses a car. I'm guessing that your inability to understand the simple impracticality of the electric alternative is related to your educational deficiencies in other areas. Did they just stop trying to educate you at some point in your youth?

*just fyi, person A's observations are backed by zero sources. whereas person B's observations are backed by a documentary. although you may say the documentary is 1 sided, it is completely backed up with sources.*

Zero sources? Every non-electric car on the road backs up my side. The limited range of the state of the art in electric cars backs up my side. What you have is a propaganda piece made by a similarly uninformed and opinionated nut.

*just to re-iterate because i'm standing firm on this point: american car companies chose to make gas guzzlers and not invest in green tech. logic dictates that if you don't invest in tech, you've effectively killed it. i don't see how you can disagree. i've made this point a few times and you've never addressed it.*

No, logic dictates that if you don't invest in green tech, you didn't invest in green tech. If it was viable, and if there was a market for it, they would have invested in it. If they didn't some other actor in the market would have invested in it. One company not investing in something doesn't prevent all other companies from investing in it.

In a few decades, atheists of the twentieth century have murdered much, much more people than the Inquisition and the Catholic Church did in centuries.

To start, the Spanish Inquisition - the worst one - killed from 3,000 to 5,000 people in about 5 centuries and it was a state ministry that hired clerics, very far from papal authority. So you are way off with your ""100s of millions"" and even more absurd in trying to pin the blame on Christianity.

Second, you probably should be thankful for the Catholics of the Crusades for the privilege of not being under Sharia law today. Europe was defending itself from the invasion and rampage of Muslim imperialism.

Now look at the atheists:  the Soviet state alone in less than 60 years beat all the Catholic sponsored 800-year inquisition with a genocide of almost 62 million. Then comes Mao's China which murdered about 70 million. There is more:  Khmer Rouge, Communist Vietnam, North Korea, Iugoslavia, etc...

But let's look into his diggings.
His main argument lies in demographic sphere - how it may happen that Jewish population increased so much outside Canaan?
Well, he is not a specialist in this field, he can not tell what was the rate of birth in Jewish families that came from Canaan to other countries. But if we try to look into growth of Jewish families in 18th and 19th century, as well as beginning of 20th century you can easily find that average Jewish family had at least 3-4 children, and some were proud to have 5 to 7 children. It was normal. Why the same demographic situation could not happen in early middle ages among immigrant Jewish communities? Of, course it is possible.
I think nobody would deny that ""authentic"" Jewish families in Khasaria, Southern Europe and North Africa were to certain extend mixed with people who were converted to Judaism. It is a fact, but the roots are still from Israel.
Mr. Zand also tries to appeal to linguistics - Idish and it's dialects.  However nothing is new. Any language, if it is not isolated, can be affected by other languages, which may be considered international means of communication.
And the last argument against his theory.
Let's make an experiment.
Take a group of Jews (8- 10 respondents) and ask them if they are able to identify Jews in a big group of people (25-30 people). Let it be that among them are 7-8 Jews of different background - Spanish, EastEuropean, Central Asian, Israeli, or Maroccan. I am sure they will identify at least half of them in the group. Which means that Jews from different backgrounds have few features (biological and behavioral) in common. I wonder if Mr Zand can explain this fact?

However, I believe many of them were quick to cooperate because Germany was planning on deporting or exterminating 85% of the total Lithuanian population

They didn't know that, the Generalplan Ost was secret, and that was just one option. The sad reality is that there was a lot of anti-Semitism in most Eastern European societies (and to a lesser but still very significant extent in most Western societies) and many people did cooperate enthusiastically in rounding up their Jews. 


&gt;I would not be surprised if a lot of the support of exterminating the Jews came from a ""it's either us or them,"" mentality.

The majority of local executioners were members of local para-military or police battalions who eagerly approached the Nazis to take place, they didn't do this out of fear but out of strong anti Semitic (and anti Polish) commitments. This has been pretty well documented.


&gt;True, Lithuania has been a little slow about commemorating the holocaust, however I believe they are not acting out of line. Perhaps because it is estimated that Lithuania lost 780,000 people during World War II. This includes the estimated 190,000 Jews, and is between a quarter and a fifth of their current population.

Why aren't they acting out of line? Lithuania's mass murder of the Jews was the event that sparked off the Holocaust proper, the number of Jews killed specifically for their 'Jewishness' (~25% of the total war deaths in Lithuania by your estimation, including I'd assume people who fought back against the Nazis)  was tremendous and both of these facts should be acknowledged. Furthermore, tragic as it is, people are almost always killed during an invasion of their country, but the rounding up and mass murder of a specific group even when they weren't involved in resistance and weren't just killed as collateral damage is pretty unique.

&gt;To argue the Soviet and Nazi crimes were not equal is distorting history. 

To argue that the Soviet and Nazi crimes were the same is distorting history. They're not the same thing, there were very distinct differences in terms of mindset and implementation. For all the evils of what Stalin did, his purges were not as methodically organised, they didn't target specific people on the basis of culture or ethnicity in the same way (not to say that he wasn't anti Semitic and otherwise prejudiced, the Doctor's Plot proves contrary), they didn't use such machine like methods of murder, they didn't have camps which were specially designed to dehumanise the victims and brainwash the guards to make killing as efficient as possible (the Gulags were dehumanising, but read up on the training process for the SS and guards who followed the Wehrmacht into Russia, it will make your skin crawl), they didn't have the same pseudo scientific classification of race and racial purity behind them, I could go on.

The problem with the Prague Declaration and the double genocide movements is not that they want to recognise communist crimes and the victims of Stalin's regime, but the fact that they seek to do this by lumping themselves in with another unrelated crime against humanity. Furthermore, I do wonder why this declaration refused to use the word 'Holocaust' in describing the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazi state (though I wouldn't describe this as Anti Semitic, more as a way of pushing the communist crimes to the fore).

&gt;myth of the genocide of the Jews

I've seen that actually translated as **legend of the genocide of the Jews**, which is a reference to the way the holocaust as taken a ""legendary"" role in western culture, as opposed to him referring to it as a myth, which would mean he was saying it didn't occur.

&gt; They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets. The West has given more significance to the myth of the genocide of the Jews, even more significant than God, religion, and the prophets, (it) deals very severely with those who deny this myth but does not do anything to those who deny God, religion, and the prophet.

As I mentioned, it doesn't appear he was questioning the holocaust, but rather pointing out how it has taken on a legendary status and its victims focused on more than the 10s of millions of others that died in WW2, and second, I do not think it is blasphemy to question the holocaust, or question why it is used as a pretext to create a Jewish state. People shouldn't be going to prison in Europe for denying the holocaust. When a Lancet report said that 1 million Iraqis died since 2003, Bush denied it as said only about 50,000 died. So it's ok to question how many died in the Iraq war, which occurred in a country where international medical teams have had access continuously from the start of the war, and have had access to 21st century surveying techniques, yet it's not ok to even say something that could possibly be interpreted as questioning any aspect of the holocaust, an event that occurred behind enemy lines 65 years ago.

*5(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he— (a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.*

*5(3)(c) It is a defence for the accused to prove that his conduct was reasonable.*

*6(4)  A person is guilty of an offence under section 5 only if he intends his words or behaviour, or the writing, sign or other visible representation, to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or is aware that it may be threatening, abusive or insulting or (as the case may be) he intends his behaviour to be or is aware that it may be disorderly.*

There are three key issues. The first is whether the preacher is aware that the speech is likely to cause insult, or whether he intended it to cause insult. The police officer identified himself as gay, but police officers have a higher threshold of harassment at law, so the case might fail here.

The second issue is whether his comments were reasonable. He has a right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on human rights. The prosecutor has the burden of showing that denying him this right is a proportionate response. The case will probably fail here.

The third issue, which is the real WTF here, is that this is a summary offence with a fine as a maximum penalty. For someone to be arrested, a police officer needs to warn him to stop while he is actually committing the offence, and he must commit the offence again within a short period. Based on the facts as reported in the article, he probably shouldn't have been arrested, and instead issued with a summons. He may well have a decent case for false imprisonment, which is a strict liability offence.

1) European settlers practiced highly unscrupulous trading with Indians--taking advantage of natives' lack of resources, technology, and understanding of the market.  It's how Manhattan was bought for trinkets.  They also practiced a particularly sinful method of invasion--allowing individual natives to ""sell"" their claim to their ancestral lands.  Since many Indians (other than the Cherokee and the Five Civilized Tribes) didn't have deeds, titles, and proper ownership of their own lands, the settlers simply bought them off.  This seems totally fine in libertarian theory until you map it onto our understanding--imagine if the Chinese or Saudis just started buying up whole subdivisions in CA, then started putting missile bases and troop divisions there.  After all, it is ""their"" land, right?  Not like they'd ever try to invade or anything, because hey--we just sold em ""our"" property, not Joe's next door!

2) Money DOES benefit an economy--not all spending is Keynesian.  You forget that saving, building up capital, and investing are the cornerstones of industry--why do you think that both illegal immigrants and hedge fund investors have ""offshore"" accounts?  They are putting their money where they can get the most value for it--goods cost markedly less outside of America.  However, us citizens usually don't have relatives in Guatemala who can put our dollars to better use--we're stuck wasting money in richy-rich land.  But with fewer dollars being spent at home, like you say, prices fall here--which is good... until your LIVELIHOOD is selling those goods!  What do you think happens to the ""Made in America"" t-shirt company when the ""Made in Bangladesh"" company moves their business in?  Profit here falls when money is taken out of the country, but since we don't live out of the country, we can't BENEFIT from it!

3) You've obviously never worked in a welfare office before, have you?  Lower wages means EVERYBODY needs more services for free, which taxes the highest earning folks more, which pushes down production, which cuts jobs, which lowers wages even more.  People earning off-the-books wages are the worst, because even with VAT, they are only contributing a fraction of the costs of care for them.  Hell--a federal judge overturned Prop 187 in CA which had made it illegal for illegals to get welfare (and was passed by the residents of CA, yes--the 50%-plus Hispanic population).  Now with ""stimulus"" and ""bailout"" funds for people across the globe, the federal government's official policy is it's better NOT to be part of the country in order to get handouts!

4) Mexican citizens who want to make their lives better should make their lives better... IN MEXICO.  What the hell's so wrong with Mexico that they can't make their lives better there?  Why should we have to pick up the slack for another country when our own country is in the shitter?  

It's insulting the way we treat Mexico like it's an R-Tard version of us, then allow our condescension to hobble us into taking on more responsibilities than we can handle.  Hell, in CA 95% of new inmate arrivals in jail are illegals, and according to CA law, we can't even deport 'em until trial, which could take months or years!  Meanwhile, we're making criminals in criminal grad school (prison) and giving them three hots and a cot while completely law-abiding americans are losing their homes to bankster fraud.  It's insane!

Again, i'm all for the collapse of the government behemoth--but these redistributionist policies shrouded in the petticoats of lady liberty simply don't cut it.

You even suggest that I know *what is happening is wrong* even though I'm apparently a *Muslim defender*. Sounds snappy, but I doubt I can put it on my CV.

First thing's first, I'm an outspoken atheist, living a secular life in a country which is as secular as they get in Europe. That doesn't mean I accept the false premise that the Muslims, Jews, or Christians in my community are by default evil or wicked. There's no need to conflate those two beliefs (or absence of beliefs) into one, as they are vastly different.

You've made a positive assumption that the burqa is inevitably a tool of oppression in Belgium, and you've failed to submit any proof of this. The often provided argument of *oh but Saudi Arabia is fubar* fails to do so convincingly as it introduces irreconcilable variables of cultural, political, and socio-economic differences. So I'll analyse briefly both assumptions and show you how you're wrong to support the ban even if your delusion of wicked Muslims were correct.

1) Let's start by assuming that she chooses to wear it because she wishes to do so. Yes, this has been reported in many cases, and you'll see women submitting themselves to less-than-rational traditions across the board. Ramadan fasting is no walk in the park, yet many do it voluntarily. Garter belts of days past and high heels of today are further examples. But I digress... If she did it because she desires to do so, the ban does nothing but take away her right to dress as she desires. It gives her nothing, nor does it protect her from the dangers of oppression, if this was not exerted on her. The total sum of this woman's rights is lower than it was before the ban, and the complete absence of benefits to her or society make the ban an oppressive measure by default.

2) Assuming that you're correct, let's say that the women are forced to wear the burqa by other Muslims. Will the ban on wearing the burqa in public make her take it off and live a life of freedom and enlightenment? Of course it will not, she still has the same family and community and she remains inhibited, oppressed, and judged by them all. She will either be forced to endure the fines that come with her breaking of the law or she will have to stop appearing in public. The woman that we were so desperate to save from herself and others now becomes a woman in the exact position as before, but shut in between the walls of her home. She loses the very last straw of hope of being secularized through social interaction or integrated. Her children will see mommy banned from walking in public, an act of oppression that will trump anything their father ever did. These children will grow up to be greater fundamentalists than their parents ever were, with the addition of contempt for the state which imposed this situation on them. 

Therein lies the paradox of your naive view. You know damn well that in both hypothetical cases, the law is nothing but an oppressive slap in the face of these women. The fact that you *mean well* or that you would like them to evolve into free women who aren't afraid of anything, not even their false god, doesn't mean that this law will have any positive consequence. I submit that it will not, and that anyone blind enough to support it with such weak arguments is indeed not doing it for these women.

Nay, I'm convinced that this law is actually aimed at the 99.9% of the people who do *not* wear a burqa. The only ones getting any semblance of a positive result will be the xenophobic Caucasian majority which will have proven to the immigrants that they have the power to rule over their lives. Instead of an increase in women's rights, the only purpose this will serve is the increase of the ego of the majority. We've seen this in Europe in the past and it has led us to some dark days in our history.

This was the cause of the cold winter the year, partly responsible for the slow propagation of the ash cloud that caused problems, and it probably responsible for the slightly cooler conditions we have this week.

The, for lack of a better term, national mythology is that America is defined by principles like ""freedom and justice for all,"" not the Anglo-Scotch culture of the first colonists, or any of the cultures of the people who populate it. 


Obviously, this being mythology, it isn't literally true. A lot of the reasons for the Revolutionary War were about people wanting to make money. Wherever the newest wave of immigrants are from, they're discriminated against by all the previous waves. Slavery. Racism. Backing dictatorships because they're favorably inclined to us or our business. The list could go on.


But that core idea is still what defines us in our hearts, and I think it might help those not as familiar with U.S. culture in understanding it to say that most of the real movements, right or left or whatever, are about people trying to come to grips with the fact that that idea of America as the good guys (yes, that pretty much is how it goes) doesn't mesh very much with the reality of the U.S. as just another country (one that is in fact responsible for quite a lot of very bad things). 


Unfortunately, sometimes people try to make their principles a reality, and sometimes people rationalize that their principles already are a reality, by saying ""those people don't count."" 


No, I'm not suggesting that the United States is somehow unique for cherishing ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" (as I hope my choice of phrase proves) or holding those principles dear. As you said, pretty much all of Europe and the Commonwealth nations, off the top of my head, are at least as free by any measure you'd care to use. But we don't really *have* a national identity except for those principles (regional identity being another story).

tl;dr: ""Land of the free"" is the point of the U.S. We use the term even though it's not, because we honestly believe that it should be, and it hurts to see it not living up to that.

So there you go. Among adult males, less than half could *write their own names* - forget our modern measures of literacy! - before compulsory education.

&gt; What an intellectually dishonest statement.

Given that what I said was correct and not dishonest, I'd like an apology for being called intellectually dishonest.

&gt; Are you kidding me? We spend what, $7000 per student? That is absurd. You act as if no one could read before the state took over education.

That's right.

I tend to think of myself as ultra-privileged. I was born to upper-middle-class parents in the richest country in the world. And yet as a child I had a children's book where the plot was the protagonist's newly-learned ability to *write his name,* and so I was always at least dimly aware that everything I took for granted simply did not happen in places without schools.

I guess I'm not quite as sheltered as I thought.

&gt; I don't recall anybody but governments starting wars

So you've forgotten about every coup ever - which, by definition, are not started by governments?

No, I suspect you're looking at it backwards - literally. See, when there's a successful coup, the war-starting party *becomes* the government. Apparently, you would look at a situation like that and either forget about it, or conclude that the government started the war.

&gt; the government can't create wealth therefore poverty is much more prevalent

Now you're quoting bumper stickers at me (and I'm quoting House). This is simply false, go take an economics course.

&gt; Governments are the most violent organizations in human history full of coercion and extortion.

Change ""Governments"" to ""Militaries"" and I'd agree.

Yes, there have been bad governments. But there has never been a successful large-scale society ('large-scale' so I can leave out the occasional commune or kibbutz), period, that wasn't dependent on an environment created by a nation-state.

&gt; Governments have never been a bright spot in human history, free markets and scientific progress are the bright spots in human history.

And they've almost always happened in areas with stable governments.

But there is no argument when it comes to total purchasing power. Size of economy, gdp, basically any measure of total fiscal power of a nation -- the US will top that list. Fuck even with the US's trade deficit to China we still almost double their total GDP.

Drug scene depends on the country and the specific people you hang out with. What drugs do you have in mind? From the top of my head I'd say Czech is the most relaxed country about drugs in the Eastern-Europe, but you will probably manage to get anything you wish in any other country as well.

Have you been to Western-Europe? Restaurants, drinks, taxis, parties and accommodation are cheaper in the Eastern side. Clothes, wines and foods in the stores are the same or even a bit more expensive than on the Western side, oddly enough. 

Compared to the US, club tickets are more than twice cheaper, drinks in the clubs more than 3 times cheaper. Alcohol in the stores is pretty much equal to US prices, but beers are bigger (0.33ml can/bottle in the US/Western-Europe versus half a liter or 1 pint size in the Eastern-Europe) and also stronger (usually 5-6% alcohol and go up to 12%, I didn't notice anything like that in the US).

The nice thing about hard numbers like this is that you can't really dispute them easily. The US has major problems with access to medical care - if you have money, it's available and you tend to stay healthier. Visit a doc once a year for a checkup and physical, and you can find small problems before they grow into bigger and more serious ones. If you can't afford to see a doctor... or a dentist, for that matter, you end up with bigger, more expensive problems in the long run. The advantage of easy access to medical care is evident - longer lives, healthier population, more spending on maintenance and preventive care and far less on the expensive care needed to take care of chronic conditions.

Of course, we have a lot of people here who think that people don't ""deserve"" health care (or other public services) and instead should ""earn"" it. The problem is that the people who cannot afford the cost of preventative care instead tax the public system later with expensive maintenance and ""repair"" care instead. Let's say you have a blood pressure issue. for $40 a year, you can get generic pills to help keep it down. This will lower the wear and tear on your circulatory system, and lower the risk for arterial and heart problems later on. If you don't monitor and treat the blood pressure problem from and early time, you run a much higher risk of having a heart attack, stroke, etc., each of which can cost $100K+ to treat in a hospital. The preventative costs are much lower than palliative costs in the long run, but the savings aren't instant, and they aren't as obvious for a while, but more than worth it in the long run.

Things to bring depends on if you're backpacking, or using luggage, etc.

I brought

-pair of jeans
-4 t shirts
-2 shirts
-2 shorts
-bathing suit
-toiletries
-towel
-lonely planet book
-mini laptop
-sunscreen
-sandals
-running shoes
-AT LEAST enough underwear/socks for a week (pain in the ass having to do laundry JUST for underwear and socks)
-bandaids and tylenol
-waterbottle (saves money from having to buy water everytime)
-swiss army knife
-compact sleeping bag (some places charged for sheets, or weren't warm)

This was in 2006, two days after the UK's terror plot bust that started the whole ban in the first place. I was living in Prague, Czech Republic at the time, but it was right before I was flying back to the states. The ban took effect, and at the time it was a complete liquids ban--no liquids were allowed at all, even sealed bottles, things you bought at the airport, etc. At the airport in Prague, you go through security right before you get on the plane and the security personnel went through everything that you had on you, so it took about two hours to board the plane. 

So our entire plane was standing in line, and word started to spread that we couldn't bring any bottles of alcohol on board, duty-free or otherwise. Some people forfeited their bottles, while the rest of us said ""Fuck it. If we cant carry it on with us, we might as well drink it."" Suddenly there were dozens of bottles getting passed up and down the line of passengers. Pretty much a spontaneous open bar. There was every type of alcohol you could imagine from French and Hungarian wine, to whiskey and scotch, to champagne and cognac. Everything under the sun, and more than you could ever drink. Everyone was taking large swigs of whatever came their way and passed it on. 

Two hours later, we've finally boarded and most of the adults on the flight are completely lit. A group of Italian guys are singing soccer chants, a bunch of college-age Americans are joining in despite not knowing any of the words, and everyone is in a really good mood despite the insane security headache we just passed through. Once the plane is in the air, things quiet down and everyone passes the fuck out. It went pretty quickly from the loudest, most ridiculous airplane to the quietest. It was the first and only time I've slept solidly during a transatlantic flight.

I'll never forget you, European liquids ban. Thanks for the good times.

No, it doesn't.

&gt;If you want to blame someone for wanting to be a Christian because Christians have killed millions

Christians have killed thousands *because* of being Christian.
They said ""I believe this."", ""Because I'm Christian I have to do this."", ""This is God's will."". The Crsuades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust... these things were *religiously motivated*.

&gt;you not also blame someone for being an atheist when atheists have killed millions

You don't get the difference, do you? Even if the people were atheists, they did it because of some *other* doctrine *while* also being atheist. You can not possibly justify anything by being atheist, that's the reason you are atheist: There is no higher reason. You do things because you are a human, that's what being atheist means. The decisions you make are your own. There is no God, therefore there is no bullshit justification.

You don't do bad things because of being an atheist or justify any of your bad doings with being atheistic. You *do exactly this* with religion, though.

&gt;but you resort to special pleading when it comes to atheists

As you can't compare atheism to a religion like you for whatever reason do, I'll tell you again: Atheism is the *absence* of religion. It's the *opposite* of religion. It doesn't try to explain *anything* and isn't the reason for *anything*. 

You somehow don't notice that religion is the substitution of reason and logic with superstition and faith. Atheism is the stance that there is nothing to justify with bullshit. If you do something, you do it. You are to blame. There is no God behind it that somehow justifies you being an asshole.

&gt;and say that doesn't count or they weren't truly atheists

Nobody would say that as that makes absolutely no sense.
Either you are an atheist or you are not.

Either you believe in some form of bullshit sky fairy or you don't.

If you believe in a skyfairy you start justifying things with it. Atheism just takes the chance away from you to justify your shitty decision with a bullshit skyfairy. 

If you are an atheists and you are a bad person, you are JUST A FUCKING BAD PERSON.

If you are a religious person and do bad things, you justify it by God telling you to do it and people love you anyway.

&gt;You are being completely inconsistent.

Actually, you just don't know what atheism and religion are. Maybe you should read a dictionary or Wikipedia.

&gt;The killings of religious people and religious leaders in Communist countries weren't justified under the logic that religion was an enemy of the state ideology?

Atheism isn't an ideology. It's a state of mind. The ideologies have nothing to do with being atheist and aren't justified by being atheist. Again: Atheism isn't the reason for anything. Atheism is the oppositie of superstitious justification. 

&gt;You're getting into pretty shaky semantic territory here

No, you just don't know a bit about what you are talking about.

&gt;but there were also far more important factors than simple religion which led to the atrocities of European colonialism.

That's not the point! The point is: Religion is worthless. It provides absolutely no benefit you can't achieve without religion. It provides a basis for illogical justifications, though.

hello :)

&gt;Socialism is as much Marxism as America's government is a democracy - which is to say, it's not.

There's more than one variety of ""socialism"" you know.  If you mean the USSR, China, etc., you'd have a better case.  I think those countries were definitely ""socialist"" and ""Marxist"" in the broad terms, but definitely not perfect examples.

&gt;I'd agree that it'd be stupid to blame religion for every bad thing a religious person has ever done. However, I don't think that it's stupid to blame an institution for every bad thing that it has done. See the Catholic Church for an example.

I agree.

&gt;You have a point on the colonialism, but you ignored the abuses committed directly for religious reasons.

I assume you're talking about forced conversion and such, which is obviously unjustifiable.  However, do you think this conversion was carried out as a genuinely selfless act to save the ""savages,"" or do you think it was more used as a strategy for conquest?  I'd lean more towards the latter.  The Europeans for the most part had nothing but contempt for the Native Americans and Africans, I highly doubt they converted based on the goodness of their hearts.  You don't convert to save people and you don't burn temples and books to save people, you do it to destroy cultures and render them helpless.

&gt;Surely you see the irony in comparing an organizational structure that is created for mutual defense with a structure that is supposed to be preaching universal love?

You're misinterpreting what I said, I never said anything about the nation-state itself, only the system of democracy.  Obviously if you support the idea of the nation-state you by default support violence in its defense, and maybe even violence as an act of aggression to benefit the nation-state to the detriment of others.  But my point is, if religious people have to answer to every crime committed by religious people throughout history, then why don't people who subscribe to other beliefs and ideologies have to answer for the crimes committed in the name of those beliefs throughout history?  If a Christian of any stripe by default is lending credibility to the Crusades just by being Christian, then a supporter of democracy lends credibility to the Iraq War and a socialist lends credibility to Stalin's purges.

He is clearly anti-Europe, driven by his fear of 'others' and that is why he is voting UKIP - that is their agenda. It is nothing more than 'polite' xenophobia and racism - exactly the suspicion many people have always had of him.

The European countries are not socialist, they're social democracies, which is basically a more left-leaning flavor of capitalism.  And like capitalism it is still fundamentally flawed and too full of contradictions to sustain itself in the long term.  Real Marxist movements are not at all defunct.  Cuba is still around, Maoists head a coalition government in Nepal, numerous Latin American leaders are using Marxist rhetoric and trying to move their countries in a more socialist direction (slow going against all the landed elites, granted), the Naxalites are fighting a just and effective people's war in India, etc.

&gt;Actually, I was referring to inquisitions, crusades, and directly religious wars, not the colonial expansion. These were directly religious activities carried out either by or with the direct blessing of the Christian establishment.

OK, but I still hold the primary reasons for these acts were not because those who carried them out sought favor with God.  It was to expand political power and consolidate political power.  The Catholic Church is a political entity and was even more of a political entity in the past.  It's hard to make an analogy because the current nation-state model is quite different from what the church was, but just like a contemporary nation state it was more than willing to commit oppression and go to war to expand its power.  I don't think any of this has to do with Christianity though except that the Church was ""Christian.""  It's not an indictment of the belief system as a whole.

&gt;That's not the point. The point is the continued support of a system that continuously does wrong when it's sole function is to do the exact opposite. Each individual can believe whatever they wish, but why does the system continue to act in this manner? It's the christian system at fault, not each christian.

""The Christian system"" encompasses such a wide range of beliefs to the point that it's almost a nonsensical phrase.  Does the Catholic Church do bad things?  Yes.  Do a lot of evangelists do bad things?  Yes.  Do Quakers do bad things?  Do Unitarians do bad things?

&gt;The Bush/Cheney cabal were at fault for the Iraqi invasion, and we have no trouble condemning them. Why is there such resistance to condemning the Christian system?

And this is a big problem in your thinking.  In an instance outside of religion, you're willing to point the blame at a specific culprit instead of indicting the entire system, when indeed the Iraq War is largely the product of a corrupt and fundamentally immoral and broken system (capitalism), which is also much more demonstrably interconnected and predisposed to ""act"" in a certain way than Christianity is, which is a much more nebulous and abstract concept.  Capital, now and throughout history, has been shown to ""act"" and ""behave"" in a certain way, with imperial wars of profit being a primary factor in capital's propagation.  Christianity, on the other hand, has so many disparate sects and belief systems that have changed throughout history that it is much harder to pinpoint as specifically.  

In any case, if you want to pin blame on the entire ""Christian system"" for every bad thing Christians do, then there's no reason you shouldn't pin blame on the entire capitalist system for everything bad that capitalists do.",False,c0pey4v,,0,hassan-i-sabbah,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0pey4v

For people who say that women shouldn't be allowed to wear the burka because it's a symbol of oppression, I should ask them if they think people shouldn't be allowed to wear collars in public. That's a much more clear symbol of thousands of years of slavery. Often, it's just assumed that Muslim women living in Europe are ""forced"" to wear the burka, and so this law is defending them. I think this is arrogant to assume this. They're ""forced"" to wear it only as much as our culture ""forces"" us to wear suits to work.

If it's domestic violence that people are worried about, then *enforce current domestic violence laws*. Why does the government need to enforce fashion laws?

I talked to an Afghan woman I worked with once about this. This was back when Clinton was in office and we were both working at a call center before the war. I had just read about the Taliban, and when I found out she was Afghani, I was fascinated. She had a job, and could speak to a man and was in the US, and didn't wear a burka, so she's obviously more liberal than the Taliban (which, by the way, is an extreme organization and isn't representative of burka-wearing women), but she dressed in a headscarf and was very covered and was definitely much more conservatively dressed than an American.

She said that she understood why most Afghan women want to wear the burka. She explained that most Afghan women feel that it's we Westerners who are oppressing women. She believes that we objectify them and turn them into objects of sexuality, diminishing their worth as human beings. She said she feels that the bikini is far more oppressive than the burka because the burka may not be allowing a woman to show her body, but a bikini wont allow a woman's personality to show past her sexuality. She says we've reduced half our population into being defined by their sexual appeal and made them diminished as human beings when they grow older. Half our population loses their social currency as soon as they get bags under their eyes. How horrible, she said, it must be for an American woman who realizes she can't wear a bikini anymore. She'll never have that kind of rejection from her culture. While she chose not to wear the burka, she explained that it made more sense to her than the way we expect women to dress in our culture. When I pointed out that we don't force women to wear what they wear in the West, she explained that it's cultural pressure that enforces both the bikini and the burka and the pressure to wear either is the same.

I think it's enormously pompous to just assume they're ""forced"" to wear the burka. What if they don't think about it much? What if they just wear it because in their culture, it's a respectful thing to wear? We also have such signs of respect in our culture. We wear suits to work to show respect, for instance.

For people who say that women shouldn't be allowed to wear the burka because it's a symbol of oppression, I should ask them if they think people shouldn't be allowed to wear collars in public. That's a much more clear symbol of thousands of years of slavery. Often, it's just assumed that Muslim women living in Europe are ""forced"" to wear the burka, and so this law is defending them. I think this is arrogant to assume this. They're ""forced"" to wear it only as much as our culture ""forces"" us to wear suits to work.

If it's domestic violence that people are worried about, then enforce current domestic violence laws. Why does the government need to enforce fashion laws?

I talked to an Afghan woman I worked with once about this. This was back when Clinton was in office and we were both working at a call center before the war. I had just read about the Taliban, and when I found out she was Afghani, I was fascinated. She had a job, and could speak to a man and was in the US, and didn't wear a burka, so she's obviously more liberal than the Taliban (which, by the way, is an extreme organization and isn't representative of burka-wearing women), but she dressed in a headscarf and was very covered and was definitely much more conservatively dressed than an American.

She said that she understood why most Afghan women want to wear the burka. She explained that most Afghan women feel that it's we Westerners who are oppressing women. She believes that we objectify them and turn them into objects of sexuality, diminishing their worth as human beings. She said she feels that the bikini is far more oppressive than the burka because the burka may not be allowing a woman to show her body, but a bikini wont allow a woman's personality to show past her sexuality. She says we've reduced half our population into being defined by their sexual appeal and made them diminished as human beings when they grow older.

The Government is at fault for at least these 3 reasons:

1) The Federal Government is too reliant on oil companies to manage the response to major spills, leaving the Government unable to evaluate if the response is robust enough. 

2) Current US Laws limit liability to a mere $75 Million (when Big Oil makes billions in profits who would fear a $75 million penalty?)

3) European laws require that deepwater rigs in the North Atlantic employ safeguards that would prevent similar spills from occurring. There is no such restriction under current U.S. Law.

And finally it is important to understand this: According to the non-profit, non-partisan Air and Waste Management Association, a quart of crude oil will make 150,000 gallons of water toxic to aquatic life. BP, which has been marketing itself as an energy company ""beyond petroleum,"" is setting loose upon the planet what is quickly turning into humankind's worst environmental disaster.

Semantics aside,


&gt; I don't think burying my trash in the ground effects the long term survival of the human race on this planet.


The being made isn't necessarily about you as an individual.  It's about a culture of convenient consumption (alliteration points).  A culture where *millions* of people disregard their impact on the environment because wasting energy/resources makes things *easier* on them.  Consistently using disposable cups/dish-ware.  Driving a couple blocks to pick up your kids instead of walking.  Cranking the heat instead of putting on a sweater.  Etc.


The concern that many people have is that this lifestyle will spread, especially to developing nations once they've become fully-industrialized countries.  It's not such a big deal when it's just some North Americans and Western Europeans.  But it becomes a much bigger problem when that same culture of consumption spreads to most of the planet.  And it spreads pretty easily.  The short term benefits are *very* tangible (you don't have to wash cups, you save storage space, etc).  While the long term detriments are fairly intangible (limited resources, environmental waste, etc).

I'd like to introduce it as a place to visit while you're on the continent. Hopefully other travel Redditor's agree -- it's a worthy visit.

Okay to start off:

Kraków on Wikipedia: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w)
Kraków on WikiTravel: (http://wikitravel.org/en/Krakow)

+ The medieval downtown core was not destroyed during the Second World War. Other cities were not so lucky. There are many chuches and places to explore here. The castle is beautiful on the banks of the Vistula river. As is the Jewish quarter. Oscar Schindler's factory is here, which was used for the movie. Last time I was there, the guard would come out and 'invite' you in for a 'tour'. Just pay him a bit of money for his trouble.

+ Auschwitz concentration camp is a two hour bus ride away. In January it's covered in snow making even more sobering. Remember: There are actually two camps here. Auschwitz  has the infamous 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign which was recently in the news for being stolen. Birkinau has the entranceway with the long railway line leading down to the now ruined gas chambers. There is a free shuttle bus linking the two. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp)

+ Wieliczka Salt Mine according to Wikipedia: ""The mine's attractions for tourists include dozens of statues and an entire cathedral that have been carved out of the rock salt by the miners. About 1.2 million persons visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine annually."" I went there too and was very impressed. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine).

+ Accommodation: I can vouch for Nathan's Villa, ran at the time I stayed, by an American. You mentioned you like to party and the underground bar with great atmosphere/bar will be up your street. (http://www.nathansvilla.com/krakow.html). I was traveling alone when I went and met a load of great people to do stuff with during the day.

+ As for the nightlife, there's a lot. However, the destination has become popular for weekend 'lad' breaks from the UK and other neighbouring countries. Wild weekends. That kind of thing. It's also popular for stag and hen parties.

Well I think that's all for now. I can add more if you want.

Cities are generally more liberal because people are exposed to more variety by virtue of the denser population (since a person's everyday life usually only involves a small number of square miles, the more people in those square miles, then the more exposure to variety they will have.)

Exposure to variety is also correlated with education, awareness, understanding, and intelligence.  There is an element of competition, as persons need to be smarter, faster, and more accepting to stand out in a crowd (a city) when it comes to landing a job or landing a date.  (There are also other factors: competition/interaction between cities encourages progress and the exchange of new ideas that doesn't happen in small towns, accumulation of wealth and resources in cities creates economies of scale in education, research, and technology, etc.)

Europe has more population in a smaller area, and has had many more centuries to build up and concentrate that population into cities and large towns.  Since liberal culture also tends to radiate from these population centers, and there are far more such centers more evenly distributed in Europe than in the U.S., you also find that even the European countrysides, though relatively conservative in European terms, are more liberal than the average American since the greatest mean distance from small town to big town is much smaller.

Europe's closer proximity to and physical connection to moderating influences from a variety of cultures to the east (Asia) and South (Africa), and the great number of fragmented cultures and languages that exist within Europe's borders, also created inevitable pressure towards understanding and acceptance.  Generalizing, America's East coast is probably more liberal because of Europe, and its west coast because of Asia, but it is still isolated by a vast ocean on both sides.

You don't need to debunk it, maybe just understand how limited this is. Skin color evolves very quickly and has done so independently on countless occasions; it is one of the most superficial of genetic divisions. Just because you are black does not mean you are genetically more closely related to another black person than to a white person. Most genetic diversity is in Africa and the other various non-black racial types are really subtypes of African genetic groupings. There are more genetic bottlenecks outside Africa. Haplotype analyses have shown that European and Asian racial grouping are pretty much identical to the African groups that they came from, with trivial amounts of genetic change since then.
For example, most Scandinavians might genetically basically be of the same basic genetic stock as most people from Ethiopia, and most French might be of the same basic genetic stock as most people from Cameroon. Nigeria would be a completed arbitrary representation of Africa. If they picked a different country it may have turned out comparable in IQ, or perhaps even higher, than the European and Asian groups.
There is also the issue of IQ being more genetically determined when you are contrasting individuals in the same environment (for example, kids going to the same school) and more environmentally determined when contrasting individuals in different environments. If you have a bunch of plants of different sizes, the differences are more likely to be due to genetics if they are grown in the same soil, but more likely to be due to environment if they are grown in different soil samples.",False,c0pfdhy,,0,[deleted],,2,0,0,True,t1_c0pfdhy

**France** - Paris is pretty awesome, somewhat dirty, reminded me a bit of NYC.  Make sure you check out the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. Lyon is a smaller city that's less touristy, it's a cool place to visit.

**Germany** - I've spent extended periods in both Aachen and Bremen.  Both cities are awesome, Aachen was the capital of Charlemagne's empire, so there's a lot of history there.  Bremen is an awesome port town which is also where the Beck's brewery is located.  I think one of my favorite towns was Hamburg.  Awesome city.  Other places of interest would probably Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, and Munich (I've never been there).  Wherever you go, if you're there during the summer, make sure to visit some biergartens.

**Belgium** - Brussels is pretty cool, that's about all I know.

**Holland** - Amsterdam, as touristy as it is, is a must.  My favorite city in Holland is probably Maastricht.  I'd recommend a visit.

**Scandinavia** - Both Gothenburg and Stockholm are awesome cities, if you get a chance to go to Sweden there are some nice beaches about 40 mins to an hour south of Gothenburg by train.  Copenhagen is also a pretty sweet place to go.

There are no colonists going there in order to set up a new life.  There are temporary workers, but these are not colonists.  Second, the US is not extracting wealth from Iraq in the way required by the term colony.

First of all you'd have to concede that the data largely supports my statements.  You'll notice that all of ""mainstream"" Europe has higher population densities than the U.S.A: Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Poland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom (even Ireland!).  Most of the eastern European countries do as well.  This tells me that the countries you mention are exceptions that either point to other factors being involved (some of which I already addressed), or inadequacies with the statistics (which there are).

What the northern ""Scandinavian"" countries all have in common is that they are all to the north, almost in the arctic circle, and all have harsh climates and harsh (but beautiful) geography.  I believe the livable space there is much smaller, and so the density figures don't show the full story since it is factoring in a lot of land that very few people consider livable area.

Somewhat supporting this is the fact that Iceland and Sweden have a higher percentage of urban population than the U.S, indicating that low population density is the misleading result of there being more people in (dense) cities combined with (relatively) more uninhabited terrain than the U.S.  Norway is only a few percentage points below the U.S.  I can't explain Finland which has a much higher percentage of rural population, but firstly I don't know how rural and urban are defined, and secondly I don't think that population density or rural population percentage specifically address the factor I originally posted, which would be better represented by ""population density within livable or lived-in area"".

The Arabs mostly converted and conquered and took over the traditions and wealth of the Middle East. Paris and London were large villages 1100, while Constantinople and Bagdad were full cities, with plumbing, sewers, aqueducts, street lighting etc.

It was really the Mongols, then the Timurids that fucked the Middle East over. The Ottomans were good at picking up the pieces and gluing them together again, but when they started declining, the Middle East was fucked.

A good example could be the Crusades. Basically France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the Byzantine Empire fighting against Syria and Egypt - the rest of the Middle East had been ravaged by the Mongols. And the western Europeans and Greeks lost.

Look at the size of the armies. How many men did the King of England muster for any given battle in the HUndred Years' War? 10 000 at most? And a lot of those would be men at arms and archer commoners.

At Ain el Jalut, past Muslim glory, 20 000 Mameluk cavalryment destroyed a 20 000 men strong Mongol army. The Greeks mustered about 40 000 men for the Battle of Manzikert 1071, while the Seljuk Turks probably had around 30 000.",False,c0pfhrn,,0,vonadler,,2,0,0,True,t1_c0pfhrn

Prior to the modern conflict, relations between Jews and Muslims had been relatively peaceful (particularly when compared with the relations between Jews and Christian Europe and Christian Europe and the various Muslim empires after 711 and the invasion of Spain). 

To the O.P., however, I would concede that beertime makes a good point when telling you to do some research. There isn't really a short answer. For me, I find post-67 Israeli policy incompatible with their democratic rhetoric and appeals to historical injustices suffered by the Jews. In addition, the power imbalance between the Israeli state and the Palestinian territories is so one sided that the existential fear that the Palestinians seem to invoke in the Israeli psyche do not match up with empirical evidence. That said, the Jewish history and regional history does not make Israeli fears entirely irrational. I really recommend following Israeli/Palestinian debates about the subject as they are much more informed and honest than what comes out in North America. Some academic sources that might help are Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, and Fawaz Gerges. There are many more.

I think I understand your position and I just don't agree with it...in my mind I can easily demolish your arguments but you won't accept them as demolished - and as you stated vice versa.

We both do get allot of the system and because I have kids in a real way I am investing more into the system than you are - my kids are the future taxpayers.  Those without kids are not making that investment - they are not raising future taxpayers.  This is probably something else we probably don't agree on, but in general childless people get more than what they ultimately put in.

I am not spending your money on religious schools, my kid goes to public school because I cannot afford the expense of a private school.   And as stated, the Ontario system allows someone like you to know that your money is not going to religious schooling - so only those who specifically choose to will fund the school system of their choice. I like publicly funded essential services - they suit me fine, you misunderstand my position.  My argument is that an essential service like education can be publicly funded but not state-run!  I don't see why that is hard to grasp.

Your arguments about health care, roads, ICBC, ...are ridiculously unrelated.  But if you are interested in my driveby opinions on some of those here goes: 
* health care: public and private options are fine with me as long as there is universal access - some European models seem more appropriate than our current system.  **Universal access is all that matters to me.**  And no, just because I don't like our system doesn't mean I want an American system with tiers of care.
* ICBC: don't really care, i lived in provinces with private insurance as well as here in BC obviously - I don't see much of a difference.  I just have to ask why have state-run care insurance and not house insurance or life insurance - what is it about car insurance that was so special in BC.  On the principal, I'd like to object to ICBC but this seriously isn't anything I really care about.   I don't know the true cost of a crown corp running the insurance system - I don't care enough to know.  If i thought I was paying more or even less i would look into it.  I suspect the crown corp is more expensive but I don't know that as a fact.
* roads: funding should come from a mix of property and fuel taxes, not income or corporate taxes.
* tax subsidies: I don't actually get that much, when i read the forms I tend to think trades people and home business people get the lion share of subsidies - and i don't mind that if that is what the government is trying to promote and feels its in the best interest of the economy.  If a government would like to encourage the raising of future taxpayers so be it - makes sense to me.  Subsidies should be given to those who help our economy;  so like children, students should get a break.  i'm also for helping the less fortunate so I am fine with the existing tax breaks for dependents.  I'm fine with tax breaks for charities and giving to charities - in fact I'd rather have these type of tax breaks than have the state decide where this charitable money should go (it becomes too political when states are involved) - why give foreign aid to country A and not country B? I want to give to B damn it.  *(just keeping with my tradition of letting people make decisions).*
* Hydro: i live in BC now and when I was in Ontario it was privatized.  Again I don't really notice a difference so i don't really have an opinion as to whether a crown corp is a better option.  But again on principal, a choice is generally better - i admit I'm ignorant as to whether it really is in this case..

1273009366,t1_c0pf0sm,False,,t3_bzoq2,1,atheism,t5_2qh2p,1426297699,"&gt;Now most practicing Muslims don't want to just be an average Muslim, they want to use their time to the best of their abilities, and to do this, they follow the example of the Prophet(pbuh).

This is a serious problem, because the Prophet set a terrible example on numerous occasions.  The Prophet himself was a slavery approving warlord and a pedophile according to our standard of morality, and these are just facts.  If you want to follow that example, that's not a good thing.  I personally ask you that you *avoid* following the example of Mohammed.  Please let Mohammed rest in peace.  Mohammed's time has gone and his example is no longer relevant.

&gt;So if it wasn't for the Prophet(pbuh) , Muslims would not exist today.

You'd still exist.  Your worldview would be different.

&gt; So when the first cartoons were made, even though there was outcry, the majority of Muslims might have kept quiet thinking that they were done out of ignorance and now that they know how the Muslims take offense, they might stop and have some respect.

Muslims will never get any respect if they try to export their own self-prohibitions onto the whole world.  Muslims are prohibited from drawing Mohammed for fear of idolatry.  No one else is bound by that contract!  Only Muslims agree not to picture Mohammed.  Non-Muslims do not need to live by Muslim rules.  Do you understand this?

You desperately want respect, but do you understand that you behave in a way that evokes scorn instead of respect?  Why don't you behave better?  Stop demanding that the entire world dance to the Muslim tune.  Stop taking so much offense at things.  Keep your religion to yourselves.  Don't try to reshape the whole world into an image of Islam.  And then you'll have your respect.  Loosen up.  Take it easy.

You want the world to understand you, but do you want to understand the world?  The world is not barred from drawing Mohammed.  The world can draw Mohammed all they want.  Only Muslims are barred from drawing Mohammed by their own self-impositions.  The rest of the world has not been taught to engage in such self-imposition.  Can you be understanding?  Instead of screaming that everyone should be understanding toward you, can you be the one that's understanding?  How would your precious Prophet(pbuh) behave in this case?  Would your Prophet laugh it off, as no big deal?  Or would your Prophet declare a jihad?  Would your Prophet remain peaceful after seeing pictures of himself drawn by non-Muslims, or would your Prophet become belligerent?  And should you follow that example?

&gt; Criticizing the Prophet(pbuh) is a whole different ball game, it's worst than criticizing and mocking their parents.

Not everyone's parent is a good parent.  Some parents are murderers.  Some parents are thieves.  Some parents teach their kids things that later in life end up hurting these kids when they grow up.  No all parents are good merely because they helped to give birth to a baby.  Our parents are not beyond reproach.  They are human.  And they are subject to human fallibility.

&gt;When you go to an African American neighborhood and with a racial cartoon billboard mocking the people, and you get shot, you do ask , why do African Americans demand special treatment? Why? Why only African Americans?

Theo van Gogh didn't live in an Islamic neighborhood.  Muslims came to his neighborhood.  In fact, all these problems started when Muslims came to our neighborhoods in Europe and in USA, and started disregarding the ways of our neighborhoods.  If Europe was like Saudi Arabia, all Muslims would be first raped, then beaten, then stoned, then beheaded and then burnt to a crisp for offending our European ways.  Do you understand this?  Instead we tolerate you in the way that you would not and do not tolerate us in your own cultures.  We treat you better in Europe and in USA than you treat us in Iran, or Saudi Arabia, or UAE/Dubai and so forth.  These are the respective centers of our cultures.  So Muslims really look bad on the world stage, because the countries which represent the centers of Islamic learning are populated by murderous raving bastards.  They will blame the woman for her own rape.  They will stone you for the slightest offense.  These countries represent the center of Islam!  Does anyone get stoned in Vatican?  Ever?  Think about it!  Does anyone get stoned at NASA (the center for a Scientific culture)?  If you draw a funny cartoon of Darwin at NASA, do you get death threats?  What do you think?

&gt;Mark my words, any violence of tension that is born out of this ""free speech"" will be used to limit the free speech you harp on about so much.

Not in my lifetime.  I will speak whatever I want.  If I want to mock you or your Prophet you are free to mock me in return.  But if you escalate the situation to violence, I will respond most violently.  And if Muslims continue to practice violence, not only will we not lose our freedom of speech, but we will wipe Islam off the planet.  Mark my word.

1) VERY. Norway is one of the most expensive countries in the world. A single beer will cost you around 12 dollars or so. 

2) Possibly difficult. There are seven different types of work permits and before you can even apply for the permit, you must have a concrete job offer. There are other requirements too but trying to get a job while sitting at your computer from here in the US is quite difficult.
http://www.udi.no/upload/English/FactSheet/FaktaarkArbeidEngelsk.pdf
http://www.udi.no/upload/English/FactSheet/FaktaarkStudierEngelsk.pdf

3) I've heard that it can take around 3-4 months for a skilled worker permit. I'm not sure yet because I don't have all my ducks in a row to begin the process but that's just what I've heard from someone who has made the journey.

4) I don't know about law school but remember that the course would most likely be taught in Norwegian. Snakker du Norsk?

5) Scandinavians will expect you to integrate with their culture. It's generally said that it's much harder to make friends than in America. Sometimes, Danes especially, they may come across as rude but this is a part of their culture and once you get to know them, they are really really nice and warm people. Oh, they don't have a word for ""please"". Interesting, eh? 

I know this all sounds difficult but Norway is such an awesome place and I think you'll find that other countries are similar. I've heard that Sweden is typically easier to get in to but I don't know anyone there or have any intention of moving there myself. Denmark is notoriously the most difficult European country to move to. They have a bit of a problem with immigrants integrated with their culture.

I can see how a system is build around maintaining the current status of pot as illegal, but pot is also criminalized in a lot of places where the wealth of campaign-contributors aren't that big a factor, if any on this issue. 

Many countries in Europe have banned cannabis while keeping alcohol and tobacco legal like America. This is mostly due to old scare-tactics and a backlash against the hippies in my assessment, and the laws are being rolled back slowly but steadily. Everything doesn't revolve around America and it might be realistic to see a wave of decriminalization from a more liberal continent first. As the truth about the harm of cannabis is slowly rising to the surface Europeans are having a hard time justifying its criminal status. And with a more decentralized power-structure, distributed among many countries, one local change could make the difference. 

Anyway, my preferred model of legalization is license-based, like driver-licenses, so we can get better control on addiction, violence and misbehavior on drugs. I would want this restriction on all mind-bending substances, but I doubt such a rational solution would be seriously discussed.

If you watch _City on Fire_ you'll see some similarities with _Reservoir Dogs_. But it's all in the third act, the big climax. Outside of that, the two movies have little to do with one another beat for beat. To label it as stealing is thin.  

Anyone who was watching Hong Kong movies in the late 80s and early 90s saw a lot of similar themes and plots -- the brothers in arms, buddy movies about two guys on opposite sides of the law, mutual respect and admiration all around, etc etc. Hell, John Woo practically made a cottage industry out of it for awhile with stuff like _A Better Tomorrow_, _The Killer_, and _Face Off_. 

_Resevoir Dogs_ is just an extension of that kind of film making. Where you take a single element or a core idea of one guy's movie and then run with it. 

It's not altogether dissimilar from taking Dashiell Hammet's _Red Harvest_ and making _Yojimbo_ in Japan, and then a couple of years later making _A Fistful of Dollars_ in Europe. Although in that's more of clearcut case because both of those films mirror Hammet's plot and characters a helluva lot more than Tarantino mirrors anything in Lam's work. 

Yet another disclaimer: It pains me to say this, because I'm not a Tarantino fan. I think a lot of his stuff is juvenile and one-note and that he made an enormous mistake by distancing himself from Roger Avery after _Pulp Fiction_.

9/11 and 7/7 were largely a response to American and British imperialism (Bin Laden's fatwa was issued due to American bases in Saudi Arabia and interference in Middle Eastern politics). Relatedly, Iran hates the United States so much because we propped up the Shah and have tried to overthrow their government several times.
    
The 'Troubles' were largely about class, race, immigration, and nationalism, not transubstantiation or immaculate conception. Protestant British were granted land rights over Catholic Irish, which led, over time, to two opposing 'tribes' defined in an intersection of race, religion, class, and language.  
  
The Crusades were wars of expansion waged partly in order to seize control of the profitable trade routes that ran through the Middle East to the Orient. And the rhetoric used in the texts of the time was more racial than religious. In fact, some scholars credit the Crusades with kick-starting European racial consciousness.  
  
Lastly, the poor treatment of women is a consequence of patriarchy, which is widespread and not connected to one particular religious faith.  
  
Of course, religion has exacerbated many of those problems. But just becoming atheist is not a guarantee that you won't be a chauvinistic douchebag.

&gt;This new strategy was premised on the belief that ethnopluralism, whose principle of self-determination had gained prominence in the decolonization and anti-imperialist movements of the previous decades, could be used to defend the racial/cultural integrity of European peoples, (for if Third World peoples had the right to self-determination, then, it was reasoned, so too did Europeans). 

Well, if you're going to concede that point, then you're an egalitarian after all, just on a collective level— and no friend of mine. While it's absurd to claim that one thing is somehow essentially ""better"" in an abstract sense than another, it's equally absurd to claim that all hierarchy (really, any hierarchy) should be abolished. Hierarchy is the form of organization— without organization you have anarchy or, more generally, heat-death.

That is permitting the liberal consensus to dictate the terms of the debate— ""exploit"" is such a loaded term that perhaps it should be retired.

You will find things of interest and things that are different from what you expected, there is no need to tell everybody in ear shot and beyond about everything you notice, just take it in and enjoy it.

But the passport wallet hanging from the neck, the wallet in the back pocket, the money belt under the thin t-shirt and putting a carry-bag down on the ground a few feet away from you are all obvious signs. Doing this will mean you will get pick pocketed, robbed or grafted. More specifically, this is a big thing on the rail networks, keep your stuff close to you, never put it in the overhead/under-seat storage because (particularly at the stations) there are pick-pocket kids and gypsies, and they are good at their stuff.

OK, things I also remember that may help. Go the first-class eurail, and just use the first class carriages. The trains are not listed at the stations until maybe 5 minutes before leaving. If you get there early it's hard to find the train your supposed to board. Journeys are usually less than a 3-4 hour run from city to city so you do most of these in an easy day trip, doing overnighter/sleepers are not often required, even though this may mean a free nights rent if you choose wisely.

When humans have reached 0% growth rate this will probably mean that all usable land is now used for accommodation.

In a 'real world', however...

The US and China will start by taking from weaker, poorer countries. Rationing the food to the citizens of these countries as they take what they need to feed their own. The UK will pander to the US (if current political climates are kept) in the hope that they will be provided with table scraps. Europe will band together under the EU completely, rationing out food from each country accordingly. Rainforests will disappear to be used for farming.

Russia will probably just be like 'whatever' and Australia will be like 'double you tee eff, mate?'.

Birth caps will be put on families at first, limiting them to one or two children depending on the severity. Probably one. Perhaps licensing will be put in place to see which parents are 'fitter' to have children and give them good futures. Due to an ageing population most rations will be given to older generations.

Which is relevant, too, but I was talking about real time balancing, powering your computer, right this second.  Short term balancing is extremely costly and demanding.  It does not help to know that over a year you can harvest 40TWh when right now you are 300MW short..  

And yes, backup can be provided, but it is quite costly.  All this equipment, staff on 12h notice, regular inspections.. it adds up.  Plus to back up, say, 40GW of windpower, you need 20GW capacity at the minimum, and biomass and cogeneration can't deliver that amount from all I saw until now; you need gas or pumped hydro (or a once-in-a-century technological breakthrough).  I still advocate my master plan for Germany/Italy/Switzerland to hollow out the alps for pumped storage, but so far nobody listens.. 

I absolutely support wind power and my company is building and supporting builds because they feel the same, but the technical barrier of ~20% share is still considered a steel chestnut to crack.  

It simply drives me nuts when people blatantly misrepresent complex and demanding problems to propagate an agenda, like ""wind power is baseload capable"".  It is not that easy, not by a far shot.  

(Not that traditional baseload is all that great and rosy; Denmark alternated between blackouts caused by wind power failure and blackouts caused by nuclear reactors fucking up for some years..)  

&gt; Denmark is at 24% of electricity, Spain is ~15%.

Denmark West has a huge interconnection to Germany, Denmark East to Sweden; both countries are orders of magnitude larger.  That's a lot of pretty cheap backup capacity, not easily available for other countries.  Spain I don't really know much about, but 15% is considered manageable -- provided the rest of load will scale up and down at will.  But 15% of shaky baseload is worlds apart from 60% of mostly reliable baseload.  

It might actually be worthwhile to consider if it could not be cheapest to redesign our industrial and private culture to be more blackout-resistant, say automatic cutout of the 30% power consumption considered least essential.  Also, strictly local backup generators appear to become more and more carefree and price-competitive, and who cares about fuel cost for two days of ""essentials only"" supply?  We could be off much better in the end.  

&gt; I think the cited paper shows this is not true - and real world confirms it.

I read this article.  We negotiate about power purchase agreements for a UK wind farm project, and have done some number crunching.  This particular article shows, in fig. 11, some trend that wind power fails less often in times of high demand -- but that's just that, a trend, and the author's conclusion is highly optimistic from operational risk perspective.  No, this article is quite interesting but does not prove much, and it is strictly restricted to UK, which obviously has significantly different wind patterns from rest of Europe (fig. 8, and fig.4 is almost the opposite of the corresponding curve for continental..).  Additionally, our statistician is quite critical about some methodology of the paper; it's not all that simple and clear cut.  

&gt; France would not agree - but lucky they can buy electricity from England.

Yeah, that.. They were too optimistic in plant placement and totally rigid in water temp regulations.  Germany is known to give NPPs more temporary leeway there (meaning they are allowed to emit water at 32°, not 29°, for several weeks), France prefers to import -- if they actually faced a blackout, they would emit water at 35°; not good at all, but entirely possible.  But sure, river water cooling exposes you to an operational risk, a good point; building the plants on the coast is safer, but then you have to secure against floodings and face higher grid losses.  Gas cooled reactors would probably mostly annihilate this problem mostly, but for the time being, french nuclear is pretty shitty in terms of reliability.  Just to note, they are because of political restrictions (which I support), not technical ones.  ",False,c0pgh1t,,0,kolm,,6,0,0,True,t1_c0pgh1t

American democracy is just another rung on a well-trod ladder. There is no such thing as a 'first modern democracy', successful or not.

&gt;Technology: from Silicon Valley, to nukes, to airplanes

Granted, the US is among the leaders here, but certainly not historically - you only note recent inventions yourself (what about older inventions like television, radio, telephones, steam engines, etc), and you ignore places like South Korea and Japan who are arguably among the leaders now. Truth is, you can cherry-pick the technology to agrue the same for almost any country in the Western world.

France? Diesel engine. Electroscope

Germany? Dynamo. Rotary engine.

&gt;Economy: Wall Street

Yeah, that's worked out well for us all.

Hollywood? Hollywood has no culture, all it does is espouse a fake culture to the masses. Nashville certainly does have culture, but to state this as an example of leading the cultural world is a bit US-centric, don't you think?

This is a fallacious assertion.  If you were to ask white Americans living today if they would have supported Manifest Destiny, would answer would be “no”.  They do care.

Surely there are at least a few people alive today and living in America who are the grandchildren or great grand children of Nazis.  Assuming those grandchildren/great-grandchildren are not racists and disapprove of their ancestor's participation in any racist activity, surely you wouldn't expect of them to feel guilty about what their ancestor did, right?

Manifest Destiny was wrong and shouldn't have happened, but blaming humans born in the present for a mistake made by people who lived and died over 150 years ago doesn't make much sense.  We can empathize/sympathize for the decedents of people who our ancestors betrayed, but that's not equivalent to present day us betraying present or past Native Americans so I wouldn't feel guilt about it.  I'm was never the land-grabbing asshole.  We are responsible for our own actions, not those of our ancestors.

&gt; Then we decided we wanted that and waged a heinous war against a tribe that wanted nothing but to live in peace.

Again, this doesn't justify Manifest Destiny even in the slightest bit, but I should point out that this description isn't accurate for all of the native american tribes.  Many didn't want ""nothing but to live in peace"".  They waged war among each other before Europeans arrived for some time.  Heck, there are a few tribes that were even cannibals.

Just to be clear, I am not one of them!  I am with you, I believe we can and should radically transform our grid to use only renewables as soon as possible.  It's the very reason my research is on this topic.  I'm not a denier at all, I'm just adamant about being very realistic about what the challenges are so that we can work on solving them more quickly.

So, as far as your points about the countries that already have high penetration, two things:  First, be careful when using those figures from individual countries.  I consider examples like Denmark and Spain to be great political achievements (good regulatory climates that led to using more wind), but totally irrelevant from a technological perspective.  The reason is that electrons do not care about national boundaries.  Most of Europe is all synchronously connected (one huge grid), and the wind penetration across the whole grid is the only thing that matters.  Interestingly, Texas and Ireland actually have higher wind penetration levels over their entire grids (neither shares a grid with anybody else).  So, always look at the entire grid.  Second, I am not at all concerned about what happens at 15% or 25% penetration, because that is not the goal.  I am concerned about what happens at 75% or 80% penetration or higher, because that is what I want to achieve, and that's also where the challenges are enormous.

I actually live in Texas, and this is a huge issue here.  There have already been several very close calls on the grid due to the wind suddenly dying off or suddenly picking up (wind turbines are designed to shut off when the wind blows over a certain speed to protect themselves, so excessive wind can also cause wind power to disappear quickly).  Recently the grid operators were even forced to shed load as a result (basically a controlled and selective blackout).

By the way, just thought I would mention one last thing:

&gt; it would mean tens of thousands of scientists, engineers and investors were badly wrong.

The engineers and scientists and investors are the ones worrying about these problems and trying to fix them.  They see both the potential and the challenges.  If the very well intentioned people who are saying there are no problems at all (like the cartoon's author) were correct, there would be no need for the scientists and engineers! 

Edit:  On my last paragraph:  Of course, the anti-environmentalists are also ""worrying"" about these problems, but not in a constructive way.

**Demographic structure:** What is the average age?

It's also the demographic structure of the population. In Holland, after WWII people suddenly had a lot of babies. (you wouldn't have children during the war; you could hardly feed yourself). Twenty years later, the sixties, these baby boomers would become the majority of the country. Imagine what happens, say in an election, when 18-30 year olds, during the hippie era, represent the majority of people. Imagine what happens in the media. That generation was in power, both culturally, economically and politically for 40 years. Now they've lost a lot of ground and you see my country becoming less liberal. Not just because that generation is dying off, but also because the more you have, the less liberal you are. The more you can loose, the more you care about safety and security and the less you care about ideals and stuff like equality.

**Nature:** is a society forced to cooperate?

Countries like Iceland and most of Scandanavia are countries where you can't really survive on your own. At least in the past. And although it may appear to have a low population density, you forget that only parts of those countries are habitable. So people do live in cities. You even see this in Canada: in the rural areas you are more dependent upon each other, and you will be more tolerant towards each other because of it. You can't be a biggot, because you can't take care of yourself all by yourself. Not just that, to get a road build in Norway along the fjords, to get water pumped in Holland to make room for farmers and houses, you need to cooperate. You have to. You generally have stronger governments, if the situation forces you to have them.

**They are not all liberal; and there are different kinds of freedom**

Finally, not all european countries are liberal. Estonia isn't for example.
And although Scandanavia is very liberal, they are also very social oriented. So although there is a lot of cultural freedom, there is less personal and economical freedom. These countries have powerful governments that play a more than crucial part in the culture and economy. The state is often the default solution to problems, rather than the market, or each-men-for-himself. 

**Mommy-countries and Daddy-countries**

I tend to divide countries up in Mommy countries and Daddy countries. In mommy countries a lot of stuff is usually taken care of by the big womb government. Mommy loves you whoever you are. Whether your gay, hindi or just plain weird. She won't ever give up on you . If things are falling apart, people look to mommy to solve their problems. These states often choose to regulate, rather than legislate. To teach, rather than to punish.

Daddy states are very different. They are there just to keep order and to put morality in public life. To protect a country from bad ideas and enemy combatants. If you mess up or are part of the problem, daddy will punish you. That's how daddy solves problems': he starts punishing. Makes new rules. If you have a problem and you complain to daddy about it, he will punish you for having the problem in the first place. You should be able to take care of yourself.

Daddy states favor the strong, mommy states favor the weak. Daddy doesn't understand you. He won't accept who you are. He will judge and punish. Mommy states support you, but she's never kicks you in the ass, even when you need it really bad. She likes the fact that you are dependent upon her; makes her feel special and needed. If she could, she would try to be the most important aspect of your life.

**I just wish there was a country, a political culture that was like a set of parents, rather than just one.**

So called? So called? Fuck off aljazeera. They effectively destroyed basic/lowest wage, dropped it from 720+ to 580. Sure, the 580 is only for people up who are 24years old and younger but who would bother hiring someone older? And basic/lowest wage mostly exists as a protection for the wages of those young people. They are also trying to destroy collective contracts and completely fuck worker rights.

Why dont they lower military spendings? We spend 4.3% of our GDP in the military, while all other EU countries spend 2%. Why does noone says anything about this?

A guy who is 90 years old. And they fucking gassed him just for being there and he end up going to the hospital. Was he an anarchist? The pigs are gassing everyone like cockroaches.

Also 3 people died(suffocated due to the smoke) due to some assholes(probably teenagers or young people with daddy issues) throwing molotovs into a bank that still had people inside.

Why have the Feds not enforced the immigration laws over the past 50 years?  The people of Arizona aren't to blame, neither is the governor.   They are just fed up with the lowered quality of life that illegal aliens bring to any neighborhood.  ""They"" meaning:  White, Black, Asian, European, Mexican people.   My best fried of 15 years is Mexican (born in AMerica to parents who came over here legally).  He told me a few weeks ago: *""I hate these fucking wetbacks.  They come over here and fuck everything up.  The only people that benefit from them being here are the business owners that employ them for $4 an hour.  They are giving REAL  Mexican-Americans like me a bad name because white people can't distinguish between a piece of shit wetback and a normal Mexican like me.  As such, I'm subject to dirty looks and off color jokes because of these wetback assholes.""*

The reason(s) the Feds have not enforced the immigration laws fall somewhere into one of 3 categories:

1.  The Feds are deeply in bed with the corrupt government of Mexico.   The government of Mexico advocates that their poor illegally cross the border into the US.   The Bush family has huge ties with the Mexican government.  As such, the Feds fear pissing off the Mexican government.....not for fear of a violent reprisal, but rather financial in some sort of way.  The Feds figure that they are rich enough to afford to live in multi million dollar neighborhoods not affected by illegal aliens and as such.....""who gives a fuck?  It's only Joe Blow Common American Citizens.  Why are they so racist for""?

2.  It is well known that corporate America benefits greatly from illegal immigration.  Turn on your tv lately?  See how many ""en espanol"" channels there are?   ""Push 1 for English"".   Being that corporate America controls the Feds, they have been unwilling to greatly enforce any immigration laws because that would lead to lowered profits.

3.  The politicians and Feds are too pansy fucking chickenshit to enforce the law because they fear of losing votes and/or being unjustly called ""racists"" by the fanatical proponents of illegal immigration.


What you (the average American citizen) needs to realize is that our current government is not ""by the people, for the people"".  It is a treasonous, corrupt entity that panders to anyone, anywhere for the almighty dollar bill.


Continue paying your taxes and voting.   These are the leaders of our country.



edit:  Another point to consider....

With all the talk of ""National Security"" and our airports being locked down like Fort Knox and normal law abiding Americans subject to humiliating processes before they step foot on an airplane.....it would seem as if our government has our security in their foremost thoughts.  Right?

Answer me this:  What is to stop a terrorist from booking a plane flight to Mexico (where anybody can get away with anything for the right price) then crossing the border with a bomb or other weapon of mass destruction in their backpack?   Most of these terrorists have the same olive skin color complexion that the illegal aliens do.....and they are college educated.  It wouldn't be that hard for a terrorist to blend in with the illegals and attempt to enter into the country from our southern border with Mexico.

Why haven't the Feds locked down the southern border for on 09/12?  What part of this ""National Security"" is real and what part is horseshit?

Wouldn't common sense dictate that you seal off the southern border completely if you were THAT concerned about the safety and well being of your populace?


People of America, start asking questions and holding these assholes accountable for their (in)actions.  They are in office and in power to serve YOU, not the corporate interests of America.  **YOUR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS ARE SUPPORTING THESE CORRUPT POLITICIANS AND THEIR CAREERS**.   The government over the past 10 or so years has screwed up the economy so bad, that many of your are hurting financially.  You can't find a job, you owe more than your house is worth.....and yet you continue to willingly pay taxes every year?   Unfuckingbelievable.  You are paying these assholes in power to hold you back, essentially.

Yet nobody does anything nor says anything.  Keep burying your heads in the sand, people.

The government is not representative of the people, unless the government is *representative*.

Let's say that someone tells you that they have seen the Loch Ness Monster. You ask them for evidence, e.g. pictures, and they cannot provide it. Thus, due to their inability to substantiate their claim you reject it. You might even classify yourself as ""a-lochnessmonsterist"".

Similarly, let's say that someone tells you that they ""know"" that there are gods (at least one). You ask them to substantiate their claim using evidence. When they can't you reject their claim. In this case you would call yourself an atheist.

As such, there are no ""sects"" in atheism or anything like that. Religious sects are theists disagreeing about what divine beings exist and how to interpret old books (""ancient texts"", however you prefer). Atheists reject the god(s)-claim, so there are no such sects.

Also, atheism isn't any more descriptive than ""red head"". People with red hair may be born in Europe or anywhere else, they may practice a religion or not, and may have any number of other things in common (or not). The only thing they have in common is that they have red hair.

Similarly, the only thing that atheists have in common is that they reject the claim that god(s) exist.

Australia also has a *much much higher* population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million as percentage of total population than the United States'.  From this we can infer that Australia's population is actually more densely situated, and that population density figures are simply skewed by the overwhelmingly large uninhabited Outback.

&gt; The first question of political science is-or should be: ""What is good for everyone?""

* doesn't, in an extreme case, socialism attempt to answer this question better than capitalism by providing for the ""greater good of the society"" rather than a system focused on how much ""better"" you can be than your peers?

&gt; By observing the progress of mankind, we can see that the things that are good for everyone are the things that have increased the accountability of the individual, the respect for the individual and the power of the individual to master his own fate.

* This seems to me to be implying that liberal are against personal accountability. I don't see how liberals and personal accountability are mutually exclusive.

&gt; And the industrial revolution allowed millions of ordinary folks an opportunity to obtain decent houses, food and clothes

* Weren't there terrible abuses committed during the industrial revolution that had to be curtailed by the government? Like child labor?

&gt; You steal felt tip pens. Hitler invades Poland.

* Godwin's Law... just saying :)

&gt; But any time the government treats one person differently than another becau se of the group to which that person belongs-whether it's a group of rich, special-interest tax dodgers or a group of impoverished, minority job-seekers-individual equality is lessened and freedom is diminished.

* I don't understand how treating someone else differently has any impact on your freedom or liberties. How is it that, for example, affirmative action or gay rights, takes any freedoms away from you, me, or anyone else. Particularly with the constitution to guarantee that no law shall be used to infringe on the rights of others.

&gt; Any time the government makes rules about people's behavior when that behavior does not occasion real and provable harm to others-telling you to buckle your seat belt or forbidding you to publish pornography on the Internet-respect for the individual is reduced and freedom is diminished.

* I actually agree with this totally. Why is it that when I look at people who label themselves Conservative I see, overwhelmingly, people who want to curtail people's victimless behaviors?

I came into college as a ""conservative"" republican and I absolutely hold high the values of personal responsibility, individual freedom, and the government staying out of my life. When I look at conservatives today, though, I see a bunch of people who want to regulate personal behavior, extol corporatism over the individual, and generally use the government to force their particular world view on me.

In contrast to what I see here, I look at European Socialist Democracies and the facts that they have more freedoms, a freer press, longer lives, more free time, and a general higher standard of living that we have and I think, ""why can't we do some of that?"" I realize that doe to cultural differences, we can't emulate Europe totally but it seems to me like a sound plan to look at what they are doing and take what we can.

It was not until I got out of school that my political views lurched left. I got into this ""real world"" thing everyone had been talking about and thought, ""really this is *it*?"" It seems clear to me that if we don't help eachother, we are totally screwed as a species.

To that end, it seems logical to me that we use the government as a tool to keep huge businesses, who's power arguably rivals that of government, in line; and to help people who can genuinely not help themselves. All the while, using the framework the founding fathers laid forth to keep it in line. Because, at the end of the day, we (at least in theory) own our government and it's our job to keep it in line.

Urban population as a percentage of total population and population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million as a percentage of total population is virtually on par with the United States.  This tells us that in areas where people actually live, Canada is probably fairly similar to the U.S. in terms of population density.  There are other factors at work in determining liberal leanings and since these are complex systems, it is expected that we will see variations that cannot be wholly explained by any one factor.  That said, while Canada is probably more liberal than the U.S., it is certainly more conservative than much of Europe, still has [strong conservative forces](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pgbzh).  If I recall correctly, your current PM, a member of the conservative party, has occasionally been compared unfavorably with the much derided conservative George W. Bush.

**Sweden and Iceland**: Already [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pfgxy).  Both actually have higher urban populations as a percentage of total population.

**Greenland**: Similar situation to Sweden and Iceland.  Greenland has a higher urban population as a percentage of total population than the U.S.  Most of Greenland's land area is uninhabited, skewing the population density statistic.

**Australia**: Already [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pgum1).  Australia has a higher urban population as a percentage of total population and a much higher population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million as percentage of total population than the U.S.  Most of Australia's land area is uninhabited, skewing the population density statistic.

**Estonia**: Already [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pfl0e).  Estonia is a tiny country surrounded by several large centers of radiating liberal culture very close by.  Despite this, Estonia is still relatively conservative for a European nation.

**Norway**: Already [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pfgxy).  Norway's situation is similar to Canada's with population statistics on par with the United States and large areas of uninhabited land.  I would attribute their liberalism to a combination of expected variation, nearby multiculuralism, and the imperfect nature of my theory.  That said, [apparently Norway is one of the more conservative European nations](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pgizn).

**Finland**: Already [discussed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bzzef/denmark_makes_homosexual_adoption_equal_to/c0pfgxy).  Is the best example of a hole in my theory.  I cannot explain Finland by the data I have at hand (much higher rural populations, low population density).  Clearly, other factors have played a larger role in Finland's liberalism, or the statistics are not painting an accurate picture of Finland's population density (in another country with large uninhabited areas).  I would expect Finland to be more conservative than other European nations, but I have no evidence of that.

Not true. In the US, libertarian replaced liberal because ""liberal"" had be co-opted.

from wikipedia:

&gt;The French anarchist communist Joseph Déjacque employed the term libertarian in a political sense in a 1857 open letter criticizing Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.[14][15] Déjacque said Proudhon was ""libéral et non LIBERTAIRE"" (liberal but not libertarian), that is, the neologism was coined specifically as a distinction from the classical liberalism that Proudhon advocated in relation to economic exchange, in contrast to the more communist approach advocated by Déjacque.[14][16] From 1858 until 1861 Déjacque published in New York a journal called Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social.[17][18] Since the 1890s the term ""libertarianism"" has often been used as a synonym for left wing anarchism or libertarian socialism,[19] and exclusively so until the 1950s in the United States.[20][21][22]

&gt;Enlightenment ideas of individual liberty, limited government, peace and a free market were part of 19th century liberalism. While liberalism kept that meaning in most of the world, modern liberalism in the United States began to take a more statist approach to economic regulation.[23][24] While conservatism in Europe continued to mean conserving hierarchical class structures through state control of society and the economy, some conservatives in the United States began to refer to conserving traditions of liberty. This was especially true of the Old Right, who opposed the New Deal and U.S. military interventions in World War I and World War II.[25][26]",False,c0pgz3l,,0,cdgtheory,,1,0,0,True,t1_c0pgz3l

I've lived in Singapore, Malaysia, the US, New Zealand, and the UK. I've also spent a few weeks travelling in Europe. It's hard for me to see where this perception comes from. I think all of these countries have been quite successful in developing multicultural societies, if our only measure of that is ""not murdering each other"".

As far as ""true"" multiculturalism goes (and trying to allow for the fact that ""true"" multiculturalism has different definitions from person to person), I don't think Malaysia or Singapore are more successful than the West or Europe.

There is a lot of latent racial tension in both countries that isn't visible to outsiders. Telling racist jokes *and* meaning it is extremely common. Even relatively liberal people tend to have racist attitudes. That's probably true for the West as well -- but there's no evidence that there's more real multicultural harmony in Singapore that I can see.

Look at the way the Barbary Pirates were eventually stopped - basically ruthless use of a small technological gap. Modern navies with a much greater advantage and international law on their side can and should hunt these people down, bomb their bases and summarily execute anyone they catch engaging in piracy. Hell bomb some Somali warlords too - make it clear that if they don't do something about piracy they are the enemy too. Don't send in in Blackhawks that might get shot down, just pound them from a safe distance.

Here's how to do it

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War#Aftermath

&gt; In early 1816, Britain undertook a diplomatic mission, backed by a small squadron of ships of the line to Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers to convince the Deys to stop their piracy and free the Christian slaves. The Deys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was more recalcitrant and the negotiations were stormy. The leader of the diplomatic mission Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, believed that he had managed to negotiate a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, due to confused orders, Algerian troops massacred 200 Corsican, Sicilian and Sardinian fishermen who were under British protection just after the treaty was signed. This caused outrage in Britain and Europe and Exmouth's negotiations were seen as a failure.
&gt;
&gt; As a result, Exmouth was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five ships of the line, reinforced by a number of smaller frigates, later reinforced by a small flotilla of 6 Dutch ships.
&gt;
&gt; On the August 27, 1816, following a round of failed negotiations, the fleet delivered a punishing nine-hour bombardment of Algiers. The attack immobilized many of the Dey's corsairs &amp; shore batteries, coercing him into accepting a peace offer of the same terms as he had presented the day before. He warned that if they were not accepted that he would continue the action. The Dey accepted the terms, not realising that they were a bluff as the fleet had already fired off all of its ammunition.

Oddly enough Edward Pellew was a distant relative of Thomas Pellow, who was famously enslaved in Algeria

Keep in mind that there are very different attitudes in many European countries, Germany included, when it comes to nudity. Much less hypocritical and puritan values, IMHO. 

When I was in Disneyland Paris, they had put up signs that (even small children) weren't allowed to go nude. (Small children running around fully nude e.g. on beaches if it's very hot is mostly accepted and deemed normal. Certainly it's seen as non-sexual, and if you saw it as sexual, people would accuse you of being a paedophile and really give you shit.) So the signs. The signs didn't work. The French/European guests just ignored them. And I too knew better than ask the parents to put clothes on their toddlers. See the preceding parenthetical remark.

When Germans go to the beach still in their street clothes, they will change right there on the spot (even on non-nudist beaches).

And improving the Greek economy is not the intention of the austerity measures now being imposed. The program is intended to pay off the creditors. Simple as that. Today the chief economics commentator of the Financial Times wrote about the EU/IMF program:

""it is overtly a rescue of Greece, but covertly a bail-out of banks.""

Martin Wolf is saying this. Hardly a red-flag waving anarchist.

By the way, does anyone remember the rules of capitalism? In that game the lender charges interest in order to compensate for risk. Namely the risk of default. So the lender loses if it turns out that the borrower can't pay. Now the banks will get their loans paid back anyway, although they miscalculated the risks and lent too much. Under capitalist rules, they should take the blow.

So what the Greeks are doing is exactly right. They *should* protest the way this is being handled by the EU/IMF, because this program will sacrifice the Greek economy at the altar of the international financial community.

While they may see cuts to some basic services, I've now seen in many reputable reporting cycles (Economist, NPR) that the Greek public service is out of hand, that many of the 'jobs' are simply money given to people who never even show up, or don't do anything when they do. Cutting those isn't going to hurt anyone but the parasites. And not having that money drain the public coffers will actually leave *more* for the jobs where people actually do something.

It also seems to me that if the Greeks cared about their public services, they might have considered paying their taxes occasionally.

Reducing waste and corruption *will* improve the economy. Both are a serious drain.

&gt; By the way, does anyone remember the rules of capitalism? In that game the lender charges interest in order to compensate for risk. Namely the risk of default. So the lender loses if it turns out that the borrower can't pay. Now the banks will get their loans paid back anyway, although they miscalculated the risks and lent too much. Under capitalist rules, they should take the blow.

What?! The problem is countries are a *little* bit different than a single person or small company. Companies with currency tied to a big group of other countries even more so. Your summary of capitalism isn't just an oversimplification, it's plain wrong.

I'm a cynic and skeptic, but I really don't think this is about saving banks (since I think a lot of the debt is to other countries and to the populace anyway), it's about preserving the economic stability of the European Union.

This means that there is no real way to pay for sex in the UK now without risking arrest, as it is impossible to know if you are breaking the law when doing so.

This law is a stealth law. Harriet Harmen and other feminist elements in the government were unable to outright ban buying sex because doing so did not have wide public support. This law, therefore, was a stealthy way of almost achieving the same thing.

They used the trafficing angle to get this law passed. It is worth noting that sex trafficing to the UK has been blown out of all proportion. If a woman comes to the UK to be part of the sex industry, this fits the UK governments definition of being trafficed, and is another tally in the count of women 'trafficed' to the UK.

The truth that some people cannot see is that being a prostitute in the UK can, financially speaking, be a very good choice for many eastern European women. Some people just refuse to accept that women enter this profession out of choice. The fact is that prostitution is usually driven by economics rather than violence and intimidation.

The only reasons feminists in the UK government wish to ban prostitution in the UK are these:

1. Another way to criminalize law abiding men
2. Further criminalization of male sexuality
3. Increasing women's power by removing cheap sex from the market. For women sex has always been a huge bargaining chip. This bargaining power is reduced if men can get sex for £60 rather than jump through some women's hoops.",False,c0ph8xt,,0,rmbarnes,,7,0,0,True,t1_c0ph8xt

Among linguists the prevailing wisdom is that English is easy to learn but very difficult to master --witness, for example, how few of us native-speakers are truly good at writing in English.  

But here's the thing, English is odd in a lot of ways.  On the one hand, gramatically it is simpler than all the other Germanic languages --with the exception of Afrikaans which is also gramatically stripped-down for similar historical reasons that I won't get into-- and in its modern form is much simpler than it once was (Old and Middle English were both more gramatically complicated), while on the other, it also has some very odd features like the progressive tenses and meaningless ""do"" that it borrowed from its Celtic neighbors and that have no corollary in any other Indo-European language.  

Virtually all of my students struggle with the progressives and meaningless ""do"" for the very good reason that as far as I know, they don't exist outside of English and the Celtic languages and the overwhelming majority of Celtic speakers are also native English speakers --the exception would be Breton, the few speakers of which are presumably native French rather than English speakers, but I've never had such a student and don't ever expect to.  (As an example, in answer to the question, ""what *are* you doing?"" --instead of ""what *do* you do?"" which is what you'd ask in any other language-- in English and the Celtic languages we say ""I *am* writing,"" instead of ""I write,"" which in English has a completely different connotation that is weird and to my students seems totally arbitrary, but they have to know it if they want to pass the TOEFL and go to university in the US.)

Another thing that sucks about English for learners is the spelling which, as you are no doubt aware, is very complicated and can only really be learned through memorization.  Most languages have a set of rules that govern how things are spelled such that if you know how to say a word, you'll have a pretty good idea of how to spell it.  For a variety of reasons that I won't get into --most of them have to do with quirks of history-- this is emphatically not true of English which has few consistent phonetic rules.  

A final personal observation is that for the most part people are highly unwilling to admit that their native language, or a language they have learned, is relatively easy.  I'm an exception; I speak decent Spanish and will tell you right now that it is a very easy and straightforward language to learn.  

Arabic is a great example, I think because people get confused by the fact that when we say ""Arabic,"" what we really mean is a group of languages that are at least as diverse as are the Latin or Romance languages.  In fact, linguists will tell you that basic Arab dialects are among the easiest languages there are, while knowing them all, as well as the classical Arabic in the Koran, is near impossible.  

Nevertheless, and despite the protestations of linguists, for the above reason Arabic is often considered difficult when in the grand scheme of major world languages, depending on how many dialects one wants to learn, on the scale of dificulty it's somewhere between English and Spanish and definitely not even close to Russian or Mandarin.  (Although it should be mentioned that if you already speak another East-Asian tonal language, Mandarin isn't that hard either.  Tonal languages are notoriously difficult for those who weren't raised to think of tone as imparting meaning, but for those who were, they are far less daunting.)

&gt; Serious problems first arose over the vast concrete base slab for the foundation of the reactor building, which the country’s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority found too porous and prone to corrosion. Since then, the authority has blamed Areva for allowing inexperienced subcontractors to drill holes in the wrong places on a vast steel container that seals the reactor.

&gt;In December, the authority warned Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of Areva, that “the attitude or lack of professional knowledge of some persons” at Areva was holding up work on safety systems.

&gt;Today, the site still teems with 4,000 workmen on round-the-clock shifts. Banners from dozens of subcontractors around Europe flutter in the breeze above temporary offices and makeshift canteens. Some 10,000 people speaking at least eight different languages have worked at the site. About 30 percent of the workforce is Polish, and communication has posed significant challenges.

&gt;Areva has acknowledged that the cost of a new reactor today would be as much as 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, double the price offered to the Finns. But Areva said it was not cutting any corners in Finland. The two sides have agreed to arbitration, where they are both claiming more than 1 billion euros in compensation. (Areva blames the Finnish authorities for impeding construction and increasing costs for work it agreed to complete at a fixed price.)

&gt;Areva announced a steep drop in earnings last year, which it blamed mostly on mounting losses from the project.

&gt;In addition, nuclear safety inspectors in France have found cracks in the concrete base and steel reinforcements in the wrong places at the site in Flamanville. They also have warned Électricité de France, the utility building the reactor, that welders working on the steel container were not properly qualified.

&gt;On top of such problems come the recession, weaker energy demand, tight credit and uncertainty over future policies, said Caren Byrd, an executive director of the global utility and power group at Morgan Stanley in New York.

&gt;“The warning lights now are flashing more brightly than just a year ago about the cost of new nuclear,” she said.

&gt;And Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager at Olkiluoto, said, “We have had it easy here.” Olkiluoto is at least a geologically stable site. Earthquake risks in places like China and the United States or even the threat of storm surges mean building these reactors will be even trickier elsewhere.

Let me explain. Our discredited voting system garuantees a virtual hegemony between Labour and the Conservatives.

In our proportional European elections, they consistently gain the aforementioned vote share).     

What I'm trying to say is, if our voting system was fair, the Green Party should have something like 30-60 seats in our parliament.

Member states on the other hand have sometimes conflicting views about prospective membership of some smaller states. There are worries about the economic impact of taking on some of the poorer countries and concerns about immigration and security issues arising from smaller states on the boundaries of the EU. This dissertation will examine the three main reasons that small states wish to join. Chapter one looks at the economic issues and the benefits that the single market can bring, Chapter two looks at issues around security, in particular the desire of smaller stats to combine EU membership with NATO membership and chapter three looks at the aspects of EU social policy and its overall culture that attract small states.

Also, the whole pedophilia fear is new to me, parents don't get creeped out if a guy stops to chat with their kid or play with them a little. Also, the mix of cultures and races doesn't bother anyone. True that we don't have issues with mass immigration and the Burka. But we are an immigrant country, my family is Polish, Leebanese with some Portuguese in the mix. Though funnily, the poles are always the but of the jokes in the south too.

2. Food, food, food. I love the food in Brazil and I miss it A LOT. I can get some in Geneva but in Brazil I normally have to import it.

3. Shopping and prices. There's plenty of shops and everything is relatively cheap, particularly electronics. The welfare system is amazing and I think the good national pride are cool too. The political awareness of many is also a really good thing.

4. Quality of life in general. Things are more expensive but people live well, eat well and pay for the quality of things. They are also very cultural, healthy people who enjoy being outside, going to expositions, museums, etc much more. I think the biggest proof of that is that celebrity culture is pretty much non existent here.

I don't think it's accurate to suggest UKIP holding power in that way. True, it can lead to disproportionate power (although the current system allows for disproportionate power in favoour of con and lab) but Lib Dems will hold the balance. Looking at the BBC forecasts, Conservatives were short by a good 40 seats, which would not be enough for a coalition to be formed with the minority parties to. Lib dems might have 80 and there the balance of power lies. In this election, we will not have those allegiances-it will depend on the lib dems.

I can see the argument that the least offensive candidate could be favoured by STV, leading to dullness...however this need not necessarily be the case and in any event, in recent years the two main political parties have wanted broadly similar things and policy has been dull and generally a constant infringement of civil liberties.

On the party poltical issue, I agree...clearly those with the power to make the decision have very clear vested interests based on what would be good for them. However, the current system massively favours 2 parties and potentially allows governance with far less than 50% of the vote, which is hardly democratic. Political scientists already consider the issue and will be v. interested in the coming months although an independent body to press this through would be useful.

Although there is the potential for dull candidates are stagnant government, against my better judgment, I would trust the electorate to evolve with the system and learn to vote in a way which did not favour dullness. No other country in Europe uses FPP anymore and they manage to function fairly well.

There are reasons for FPP but I want a more democratic option that favours 3 party politics and encourages engagement by voters (as opposed to voting for the lesser evil/feeling votes are wasted).

L: Hm. As you say, this doesn't apply to Russia alone. I wonder why we don't hear more about this problem?

Doug: Well, since Paul Ehrlich wrote his famous book, The Population Bomb, and perhaps farther back, since Malthus' paradigm-shifting 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population, overpopulation has been the bugaboo of intellectuals around the world.

L: Radical environmentalists have taken up the cause as well; too many people making too much trash. We're going to bury the rain forests in Styrofoam cups – if we don't chop them down first to make toilet paper.

Doug: Hysteria is the ruling psychological state in today's world. But population decline is something intellectuals approve of because, I believe, they basically hate people. The chattering classes want to see, but don't particularly want to report on, terminal population decline in the developed world. That might lead to the conclusion humans aren't going to destroy the planet after all. It's the elephant in the room nobody's talking about.

.....

L: Sounds like ""the dismal science"" should be demographics, not economics.

Doug: Right. But no one will talk about this. It's partly because the chattering class doesn't want to admit that it was wrong about the population bomb. Just as the same people won't ever own up to the scam of global warming. But also because the places where there is explosive population growth are among the poorest populations, which goes beyond social and cultural to racial implications. And it's a total no-no to even talk about that, as people like Charles Murray and Philip Rushton have discovered.

L: But facts are facts, and the current trends indicate that the average skin color will be much darker in each succeeding generation for the foreseeable future.


Doug: That's just the way it is. During the 19th century, it seemed the whites were going to take over the world. Now non-Europeans are in the ascendant. Some people don't want to talk about it, but I don't see that as being a problem in any way. The chances are good that races on this planet will meld together. Who knows?

* Both big parties have a core 'constituency' of about 35% of the electorate.  They tailor their policies to keep this 35% voting for them and use campaign smoke and mirrors to appeal to the 10% or so of voters who's opinion can be changed during an election.  The other 50-60% of the population can be (and are) safely ignored.

* These core constituencies contain the 'safe seats' where the knuckleheads can stand.  As the difficult bit of gaining a seat is the internal party selection process their responsibility to the actual electorate approaches zero.  Once selected they've already won.

* Because of this all governments are actually coalition governments; it's just that they're internal coalitions within a single party.  The electorate plays no role in these hidden negotiations - see the way that Brown became PM for an example.

* The core party constituencies in Britain are (or used to be) at opposing ends of the social spectrum.  Parliaments thereby consist of decade long re-distributions of wealth and resources from one constituency to the other until the system flips and it starts to go back the other way again.  The result has been the most unequal society in Europe.

* The only way to make your vote really make a difference in FPTP is to vote tactically.  You vote for your second best candidate to win and if he/she does then that's supposed to be a good thing.

* FPTP proponents point out that it makes bad governments easy to kick out.  Well, yes but some of us would prefer a system that makes it less likely that they're elected in the first place.

1273149477,t1_c0pgth1,False,,t3_c0d22,9,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,1426298549,"The Greek economy, although considered a developed one, isn't very good at producing wealth. The public sector accounts for a very large portion of GDP (~40%) and employment, and usually state jobs don't produce much surplus value (especially exportable value). This is a result of ""pro-voter"" policies over the past 30 years. 

At the same time, it's generally hard to start and run a business, mostly because of bureaucracy, administrative costs and uncertainty, so people are simply discouraged from enterpreneurship even when they have some capital set aside. Usually they spend it on assets such as real estate or consumer products/services. That's the same reason for the large amount of self-employed individuals, it's easier than starting a ""real business"" and there are (relatively) few corporate jobs. That also means that Greece is a bad environment for high risk, high added value activities (high-tech, manufacturing etc). Meanwhile there is still a lot of farmers, low tech industries, commodities etc, that are unsuitable for a western/first world economy. Value creation suffers on that front as well. 

So, in a way, yes, it's failure to modernise, especially since modernising the economy would change the status quo and put pressure various professional or social groups (farmers, unions etc). The government either backed down or avoided the issue altogether. Protecting various professional groups from new entrants also created a situation were there are people ""in the system"" and people ""out of the system"", who find it extremely hard to break through, even if they are qualified or capable.

Direct/ indirect taxes are on a par with other EU member states but the government (due to being the major economic driver for so long) has little available surplus value to tax. Note also that the balance of payments has been consistently negative for as long as I remember, meaning that there are more imports than exports. Income is being drained away, and the deficit covered by borrowing.

Unemployment is 10%-20% depending on how you decide to measure it. It's expected to rise (tons of lay-offs in the private sector lately)

The ""protesters"" are feeling betrayed by the government, not only for the austerity measures, but for the fact that the governments of the past 30 years led the country to the edge of bankruptcy and made it the laughingstock of the world. Their preferred solution is that ""the responsible must pay"", or ""those that stole the money"" etc but it doesn't go much further than that.  Most have been beneficiaries of state spending in some way, and usually in fairly reasonable contexts (if you look at it in a case by case basis).

The ""rioters"" on the other hand are kids who use the pretext of antiauthoritarianism to prolong their continuing feud with the police and just break stuff. Makes them feel good.

Frankly I don't see how abortion has anything at all to do with atheism. It seems like the atheism / pro-choice alliance is more just a retaliation against the fact that pro-lifers and religious people tend to be allied.

Anyway, why is it a stupid argument? It's akin to saying a baby isn't an adult. It's just arguing over terminology. Who gives a fuck how we define ""person""? What matters is whether abortion is morally acceptable. And that course is going to be completely dependant on the situation just like anything else we choose to kill. Furthermore, how is arguing over whether an unborn baby is fully a person any different to how Europeans used to argue over whether those African ""savages"" were fully human or not?

But hey, if you want to go the ""define a person"" route, I can argue that too. Assuming by ""person"" what you really mean is ""human"", a zygote, blastocyst, foetus, infant, baby, toddler, teenager and adult all have one key defining thing in common: their human DNA. Each is as completely human as the next in that sense and the only difference they have with each other is their stage of development. Any time you try to pick a point at which all of a sudden it becomes wrong to kill that human is necessarily always going to be arbitrary. When the pro-lifers go on in their annoying way about how you could just as easily define that point as being sometime after the child is born they're entirely right.

All I'm saying is that I feel extremely uncomfortable with most of what's considered a typical Brazilian behavior, and I see that a lot of the shit we have to deal with over here stems from it. I'd much rather live in a place where people are more discreet, reserved, quieter, respected each other's personal space, were more rational, more interested in academics, more disciplined, etc. This is not the typical Brazilian behavior.

Seriously, nationalism is such a dumb concept. There's absolutely no reason to assume that we have to love the culture we came from.

If you can wait, when you are back in Europe, I can arrange to send you some replacement MX-1000 feet. We still have some on stock here.

If you are considering a trade-in, you may want to consider a promotion we are running in the UK. Check it here: http://www.logitech.com/en-gb/349/7016

As for new products, sorry, I cannot comment on that.

I started out as a bio / pre-med major and in my late sophomore year converted to English Literature with a minor in history and concentration in biological sciences.

What killed me regarding science was Organic Chemistry I &amp; II and Physics I &amp; II.  Nothing in my high school prepared me for the rigor of these classes.  They were ""weeder"" classes at my college, and they worked to weed me right out of the sciences.  Admittedly, my college was very strong in the sciences, but my interest could only sustain me to a certain point.

Studying the sciences is a commitment that doesn't typically end with a BS, you'll likely have to go on for a MS or PhD to really do something ""incredibly important"" with biology.  Do you have an idea of what that might be?  Do some research, because the requirements for some careers can be surprising.

While OChem was a big stop sign for me, the idea of spending 4 years in college, 4 in med school, and 2-8 years to specialize was really frightening to me.  Some planning is great, but having to map out over a decade of your life is a serious undertaking.  It's very similar if you pursue a PhD, though the hours may be slightly better.

Don't discount English as a major just because you feel you are bored.  It is partly up to you to make things challenging.  Consider sub-specialties like Public Relations / Affairs or Non-Fiction or Technical Writing.  On top of that, minors may help as well.  There are plenty of jobs out there for people who can communicate effectively via prose, and one or two sub-specialities won't sideline your expertise.

French is useful primarily as a gateway language, but have you considered Central or Eastern European languages, Spanish, Hindi, or several East Asian languages (though not Japanese)?  Look towards newly growing markets for future employment opportunities.  Translator jobs are notoriously difficult to get without near-bilingual fluency, and they are fickle when it comes to steady employment.  Additionally, language teaching jobs are being cut like many ""Non-essential"" classes such as art and music across the US.

You shouldn't feel that you are on the verge of a right or wrong choice, but you do have, hopefully informed, choices to make.  Primarily, it should come down to A) What's going to make me not regret having to get up every morning, and B) How do I keep me and my own fed and sheltered?

In parts of Europe the sales tax is applied before point of sale. This happens when companies sell each other items and such. This means the price is handed down until it's sold to the consumer, but all the taxes have been paid already.

In the US, I believe companies do not have to pay taxes on items sold to other companies. Sales tax kicks in when a consumer buys a finished product. So the price is added at the very end of the production cycle instead of during it.
