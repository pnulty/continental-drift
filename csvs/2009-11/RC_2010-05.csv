Let me ask you, in an economy of high skilled workers, who digs the ditches and lays the railroad tracks? In Belgium's case, it was mostly Moroccans and Turks. Initially, it was about work. When their economy ran out of steam, they were stuck with their migrant laborers. Here are some links:

These immigrants came to Europe in order to build railroads, work in the coal mines, clean streets, and do the jobs that Europeans did not want to do.[2]

To start with, I look German, and though I speak almost no German, my Schwabian-German accent is perfect, and I was wearing European cut clothing.  So you can imagine the raised eyebrows when I blurted out a well practiced pet phrase, to the effect of, ""Pardon me, but I don't understand German very well"", just as someone would have said who lived in that area their whole life.

One of the gentlemen with me was a very dark American black man, with very stereotypical negroid features.  Quite brilliant really, a computer expert before it was fashionable.  He spoke German fluently, but with the heavy upper class French accent of his French German language teacher.  But he could have easily read and discussed Goethe in German, while sounding like a Parisian snob.

This left the Germans perplexed, to say the least.  To the point of demanding that we explain ourselves.  This was done by the third gentleman in our group, who was a professor of German history and language, spoke German in four accents, and had been given an award by the German government for improving US-German relations.

In the twangiest East Texas drawl I have ever heard, peppered with ""shucks"" and ""golly gee whiz"", and other Americanisms, he made a bumbling display of ignorance about everything and anything German.  While we gawked at him with open mouthed amazement.

But this utterly satisfied the Germans.  They now knew that we were all American, and Americans are odd.  So order was restored to their universe.

Fire and Police: Police and Fire are basic services that apply equally to all citizens. This is an entitlement that is necessary and one I support. You assume that these services can only be provided by progressive income taxation. That is just not true. Many Fire services are voluntary in rural areas. The best case would be this: a town of 10,000 has a police department that costs a million dollars a year. Every citizen would get a bill for $100 dollars a year. A family of four would pay $400.

Yes, it does sponsor outside groups, but this is nothing new in that region. For example, compare the biggest foreign influence that Iran has leveled against other countries, versus that what other countries have fielded against Iran.

Hizbollah is arguably the biggest foreign group sponsored by Iran. They are theocratic (though not even half as much as some other groups by western countries, for example during the Afghan-Soviet conflict), they are a bunch of thugs and murders too, and arguably the biggest obstacle to having the first truly democratic state in the Middle East (Lebanon).

However, they also fought a legitimate war against the occupation, and won. (Compare this to the rhetoric of the Arab states, who then turn around to oppress or even massacre the Palestinians in their own lands). And they pretty much limited themselves to one country, and the aggressor against that country.

Field this against instigating Iraq to attack Iran, once known to us as the Gulf war (The Imposed War as the Iranians still call it). Not only was Iraq supported by billions of dollars from all the states in the region that now cry the hardest about a nuclear Iran, it was also supplied with weapons of mass destruction by both the Europeans and Americans, that killed over 100.000 Iranians (by comparison, the Nagasaki bombing killed 60,000–80,000 according to sources you can find on Wikipedia). The US had it's own particular role in this, supplying not only the chemicals (for farming, of course), but also the delivery weapons (helicopters, for crop dusting of course), and planning the actual strikes using US satellite data (they didn't bother to come with an excuse for that one).

And of course there was the diplomatic support, in particular again by the US; like refusing to recognize the Iranian peace offer of ending the war after the conquered back all their own land (and actually halted at the border) in exchange for reparation payments. Or trying to blame the Iranians when Saddam started gassing the Kurds (later of course used as the excuse to invade Iraq.. who knows, maybe they'll switch back again when it's time to bomb Iran). Top that off with direct military involvement during the tanker wars, contentiously supplied intelligence, etc 

Ironically about the only country that sided purely with Iran was Israel, by selling them and directly shipping them crucial high tech weapons like anti tank and anti air missiles, and mediating the ""contra"" arms sales. Israel at that time of course considered Saddam's Iraq their existential threat, not Iran. (since this post is idiotically long already, I might as well include this little fact; the Iranians bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq before the Israelis did)

So if we're going to apply the words ""terror-sponsoring, genocidal, oppressive, brutal"" or ""monstrosity"" to governments in the world, you'll have to make a pretty long list if you want to include Iran as well. This is the point Chomsky is making, Iran does not have a history of aggression against other countries, if we compare it practically every other country in the region or even the world.

&gt;what's the point if they've already landed on us? Satisfaction that other, innocent people are suffering?! And why would we do it first? Vaporise thousands or millions of innocent people? What possible justification could any sane person give?

This is the usual issue with deterrence, for a deterrent to be credible the UK must be seen to be in a position to retaliate against a first strike, whether the UK would is another matter entirely.  That said in the event of all out nuclear war, nothing really matters, everyone is screwed, but when looking at states with a limited number of deliverable weapons, deterrence is still valid.  

&gt;And besides, take a look at any number of countries - especially in Europe - that don't have nukes. Are they any less secure or less prosperous? There is no credible threat to any NATO / European country - with or without nukes. The times have changed. :)

The point there is that most European nations are part of NATO, they are all essentially indirectly nuclear states because an attack on one is an attack on all, and as a group NATO has a nuclear capability.  you are right though, times have changed, it shouldn't be necessary for anyone to have a stockpile of deliverable weapons, they are no deterrence against terrorism (even nuclear terrorism if we ever have to face that).

Long denigrated by US pundits as the land of high unemployment, the EU currently even has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the United States. Indeed, the World Economic Forum in 2008-09 ranked Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands among the top ten most competitive economies in the world. They are also ranked at or near the top of most lists for quality of life, health care and social benefits. That's not a coincidence, since the participation of workers on all corporate boards of directors allows for both economic vibrancy and more egalitarian social policy. And while the United States also ranks high in competitiveness, it is near the bottom among most-developed countries in health care, social benefits and quality of life.

Sweden, Germany and other European countries are proof that you can have it all -- but only if you have the right institutions to facilitate both a powerful economic engine and the supportive institutions and benefits to harness that engine and keep employees and families healthy and productive. These distinctly European advances may be the most important innovations in the world economy since the invention of the modern corporation, since they encourage free enterprise combined with economic democracy and worker consultation that does not unduly burden entrepreneurship and commerce. The advances allow businesses to be both competitive and socially responsible.

In effect, Europe has reinvented the corporation. Yet the latest critiques of capitalism by leading authors like Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky and the producers of the popular film The Corporation tend to view all corporations and all capitalisms as the same. American progressives, while searching for effective responses to globalization, appear to be mostly unaware of these intriguing European inventions. Movements to revoke the charters of offensive corporations, while having gut-level appeal, have failed to recognize that European corporations are fundamentally different animals from their ""disaster capitalism"" US counterparts.

From Wikipedia:
&gt;The English language belongs to the Anglo-Frisian sub-group of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic family, a member of the Indo-European languages. The closest living relatives of English are the Scots language, spoken primarily in Scotland and parts of Ireland, and Frisian, spoken on the southern fringes of the North Sea in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany. As Scots is viewed by some linguists to be a group of English dialects rather than a separate language, Frisian is often considered to be the closest living relative.

&gt;After Scots and Frisian come those Germanic languages which are more distantly related, namely the non-Anglo-Frisian West Germanic languages (Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans, High German), and the North Germanic languages (Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese). With the exception of Scots, and on an extremely basic level, Frisian, none of the other languages is mutually intelligible with English, owing in part to the divergences in lexis, syntax, semantics, and phonology, and to the isolation afforded to the English language by the British Isles, although some such as Dutch do show strong affinities with English, especially earlier stages.

There is even a small chance that the coin could land on its side, offering a valid, though somewhat improbable, third choice. The person tossing the coin could be magician in total control of the outcome, forcing it to land how ever he sees fit. He could make it seem to disappear, change it into another coin or somehing else all together. These things can all be controlled for.

Pascal's wager makes an unjustified assumption that the only choice is the post-Abrahamic God of the Christians and that Christian Heaven and Christian Hell are as equally probable as there non-existance. You cannot observe that they exist while alive, but only after death. That creates another set of unproven and unjustified assumptions.

You could counter and say the God of the Koran is much less forgiving than the God of the New Testament so it is more worth yout while to worship Allah than Jesus.

If you've never had a local free range pig that ate grass and compost for its whole life and acorns for the last summer before it was killed you're missing out.  I know you said that a vegan diet is better if it is organic (which is a bullshit term) and local but that is NOT the argument that vegans make.  They blindly state that eating tofu, made from GM soy in China is superior to local beef, chicken, or pork.  Have you ever heard of Niman Ranch?  Have you been to a local dairy?   I was vegan for four years so my statements about vegans come from personal experience.  Almost all of them are the most close-minded and ideologically-blind people I've ever met.  They are like the tea-partiers of the left.    

The central problem with your argument about the carbon/land use/lifecycle of growing plants vs. animals is that all of this is an argument that is valid when you compare factory farmed meat with factory farmed vegetalbes.  When you compare factory farmed vegetables to local, env. responsible meat the story is entirely different.  This is something no vegan I've ever known has been able to grasp, even when they admit they eat Chinese GM soy all the time, and even when the jobs they work at serve local, env. sustainable dairy and meat.  

Veganism is not a choice people make to be env. responsible.  It is a religion they join and a lifestyle choice they make for either misguided reasons, out of some desire to be a radical, or because they don't like meat, or don't want to hurt fuzzy, cute little animals.

Maybe it is ok. Is it a possibility for you at all?  There are atheists that will teach their children nonsense or  immoral behavior by behaving certain way as there will be muslims, christians and jews. I mean if your children read some of the narrow minded responces to complex topics and insults that you have posted in your responses, I doubt it would teach them good lessons either. 

There are so many things that are wrong with your question that it inherintly prohibits you from seeing another other prespectives and learning anything useful and unbiased. 

It clumps together faith and religion, which are not the same thing at all. You yourself have faith in many things without requiring a proof. If you were to truly examine yout beliefs you would find that to be true.

Your view on the topic also merges religious laws with cultural traditions, which maybe often reinforced by religious views but do not always originate from religion. Such as burka question. You will find a wide variety of views on the topic among the muslims.

From what it sounds like you think your view is superior to that of people who follow anyt religion or have faith in God. This is kind of a view that has no proof and does not require any either. 

&gt;Arabic language does not contain magical properties which cannot be properly translated. The claim that one must be able to read the Qu'ran in its original form in order to truly understand it is nonsense.

It does not contain magical properties you right, but it is very difficult to translate certain things and you inevitably loose something. The english you speak today is the not the english that was spoken by peasants 200 years in Europe. That is the rules in english language were codified by aristocrats and not peasants, as such formatlities were included and constraints were imposed make it less then optimal for certain things. 

There is a question, how does the language that you speak influences how you view and understand the world.  
For example you say: ...things which haven't been proven *real*.

English word _real_ comes from Latin **res ""matter, thing,""**, which is different from **veritas : truth**, while in Arabic world _real_ and word _truth_ come from the same root word Haqq, which is also the in the absolute form Al-Haqq(The Truth) is one of the attributes of God. The Real Reality is Haqqiqa. This is just one examples. If you do not understand that or cannot see the difference you will not be able to understand  why people ""believe in a deity which has never been proven real"". Can you prove to me that reality is real?

Another example is word ""proof"" : Ayat (proof, evidence, verse, lesson, sign, symbol, revelation, etc.). However word _burhan_ is also translated as evidence or proof, but they have very different connotations. There are other words as well. In english it is the same word. 

But even take trying to translate victorian english which you cannot easily understand into modern english, it is no easy task and it is not the same. Or try translating some poetry from another language. 

You try to simplify complex topic to a degree that it is impossible to provide you with feedback that would be useful. 

*tl;dr;* Your question is a fail, your understanding is a fail, your project will also be a fail useful only to those who agree with your oppinions to begin with.

&gt;and a message to the scene
&gt;
&gt;Protection: Ubi DRM
&gt;Date of Release: 25.04.2010
&gt;Type: Read NFO
&gt;
&gt;ÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛ
&gt;
&gt;First of all we would like to thank all people out there that helped us
&gt;beating ubisofts DRM for Assassins Creed 2.
&gt;
&gt;Now to the points of Skidrow which someone pasted us after the scene
&gt;nuked their theft of our work.
&gt;
&gt;1. You are true about how the orbit works BUT you did not even log a
&gt;single value yourself. This is easy proofable to all people that
&gt;would like to take the time and start logging from the very
&gt;beginning. Alot of values, which you recieve while logging we merged
&gt;in our database together into 1 or 2 lines Like 5 values 1 line but
&gt;if you log them yourself, they will never look like the given ones
&gt;from our value.db. Also there are some values which do not exist
&gt;in your released version of AC2. They are russian only!
&gt;
&gt;2. Of course we are not stupid and tagged our value.db. There are
&gt;several values inside that you can never log because they simple do
&gt;not exist. They are fake and used to tag our work from stealing.
&gt;I will not mention which one but as a hint it will be transformed
&gt;a greeting to ru forums as thanks for all our supporters there
&gt;logging values.
&gt;
&gt;3. The way you transformed the orbit is not good. If you want to play
&gt;any orbit game like Silent Hunter 5 or Settlers 7 or SPlinter Cell
&gt;you can not play them anymore even though you bought them. The
&gt;Skidrow crack fuxks up all originals you want to play. How stupid
&gt;is this ""leading force""
&gt;
&gt;4. Just for your info: Settlers 7 will be also tagged with values that
&gt;you can never recieve from the orbit. You might understand how the
&gt;orbit works but you will never understand how cracking works because
&gt;you steal almost everything. Let me proof this:
&gt;
&gt;- securom cracks: These ""cracks"" you supplied had never ever
&gt;the securom VM applied. They even still
&gt;include the debug codes from the times before
&gt;mastering
&gt;
&gt;- starforce cracks: Your cracks are lame. They are made of russian
&gt;cracks and often wrong rebuilt cause russian
&gt;code is different to european code or you
&gt;simple have access to another unproteced exe
&gt;that was never protected by starforce.
&gt;
&gt;- solidshield cracks: Your unprotected exes are super great
&gt;
&gt;5. Steam cracks: Your steam cracks are done exactly the way of
&gt;our russian RE forum. Its ok as its a tutorial
&gt;but if there is something new your fix arrives
&gt;directly after our forum serves the fix.
&gt;Guess the rest.
&gt;
&gt;6. next Ubisoft game: Oh yeah. Silent Hunter 5 without even testing!
&gt;wow. Settlers 7 with incomplete values or will
&gt;you wait till ours are complete?
&gt;
&gt;So at final conclusion to the fuckers of Skidrow:
&gt;
&gt;- Stop fucking around the real crackers if you are not able todo the
&gt;job yourself. Once the greatest cracking group on Amiga and now the
&gt;stupiest group on PC that steals whatever they can catch.
&gt;
&gt;- Stop destroying a name you can not serve proper with your work
&gt;
&gt;- Stop releasing when you can not crack yourself
&gt;
&gt;- Stop talking about other groups work when you dont even understand
&gt;it.
&gt;* Reloaded dll's are simple rebuilt functions
&gt;* Razor &amp; Reloaded Securom cracks are not emu for the protection
&gt;to be continued for all that the Skidrow fuckers do not understand.
&gt;
&gt;- Start thinking before typing bullshit in your nfos.
&gt;
&gt;ÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛÛ

**1999** - US: Controversy Surrounds Evergreen State College Graduation Ceremonies. Governor Gary Locke refuses to speak at 1999 Graduation because Mumia Abu-Jamal, US political prisoner on death row, chosen as Honorary Speaker. 

&gt;In an attempt to stifle freedom of speech &amp; student representation, last week, state troopers &amp; local law enforcement associations pressured Locke to rescind his acceptance of the invitation to speak so as not to share the stage with the controversial figure. 

&gt;The significance of choosing this man as graduation speaker: Evergreen chose to accept the unprecedented opportunity to hear this man speak at graduation. In an historic moment that denies particular people their rights to speak &amp; be heard, Mumia represents the voice of struggle &amp; strength despite the shackles of imprisonment. Committee members cited Mumia's reflections on education &amp; freedom as parallel to the philosophy of Evergreen. 

&gt;The students also wish to publicize his case in order to raise public awareness of the case &amp; the prison crisis in this country. Racism in death penalty sentencing is blatant &amp; shocking. Selecting Mumia Abu-Jamal as the graduation speaker is an historical opportunity &amp; will reverberate beyond the walls of this particular institution.

**2001** - Switzerland: Demonstration in Zurich between a group of globalization opponents &amp; the police. The police tried to control the demonstation with substantial tear gas application &amp; rubber projectiles. 

**2001** - Governments resort to police violence against international May Day protests... 

May Day demonstrations around the world on Tuesday gave voice to growing discontent over poverty, unemployment &amp; the impact of global capitalism on the lives of ordinary people. Alarmed at the rising tide of protest, many governments responded with police violence. 

In England: A massive police presence — according to some reports outnumbering protesters by 2 to 1 — greeted May Day rallies in London. Some 6,000 officers were on duty or standing by, &amp; 30 police vans were stationed in Whitehall to prevent demonstrators gaining access to Downing Street, the residence of Britain's prime minister. 

Several thousand participate in anti-corporate demonstrations organised loosely around the theme of “May Day Monopoly”, with small rallies taking place at several London sites featured in the board game. The protests, organised by a variety of anti-globalisation, anarchist &amp; environmentalist groups, are denounced as “spurious” by Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

In Zurich, Switzerland, police sealed off the financial district of the city from protesters &amp;, at the conclusion of a peaceful march, surrounded 400 masked anti-globalisation anarchists. After the demonstrators threw rocks &amp; paint bombs, police responded with overwhelming force, firing rubber bullets, water cannon &amp; tear gas before launching baton charges. Some 200 arrests were made. 

Riots &amp; street fighting took place between police &amp; demonstrators in Berlin, Germany, following a ban of the annual “autonome” (anarchist) demonstration implemented by city interior minister Eckart Werthebach. A total of 9,000 police were mobilised to stop thousands of anarchist &amp; anti-fascist demonstrators from carrying out a planned march. Street fighting erupted as police used water cannon &amp; truncheons to clear several hundred demonstrators from a crossing in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. 

An estimated 100,000 rallied in Vienna, Austria, demanding job security. Large crowds took part in traditional marches in France, Italy, Spain &amp; other European Union states with concern over unemployment among the main slogans. 

Some 20,000 marched through Istanbul, Turkey, denouncing the treatment of political prisoners &amp; government economic policies. 

An estimated 300,000 people took part in May Day rallies in 480 cities across Russia, calling for higher wages, improved social security &amp; price controls. In Siberia, an area hard-hit by industry &amp; mine closures since the restoration of the capitalist market, over 50,000 were reported to have demonstrated. Throughout Eastern Europe, rallies denounced the vast social decay that has accompanied the return of capitalism. 

In Pakistan, the police &amp; military pre-empted planned anti-government protests by imposing de-facto martial law in Karachi &amp; banning all outdoor demonstrations. Up to 1,000 members of opposition parties were arrested in morning raids. 

In South Korea's capital Seoul, 15,000 riot police used batons &amp; water cannon to block a march on government buildings by 20,000 members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU). 

Indonesian police attacked a rally of 2,000 workers in the West Javanese city of Bandung as they marched on government offices. 

Some 1.5 million people took part in May Day activities in Sao Paulo, Brazil, under banners condemning the free trade agreement for the Americas. The events paralysed the northern sections of the city. 

In Buenos Aires, Argentina, unemployed workers established street barricades in industrial areas to protest against joblessness. In Colombia, rallies took place in 30 cities against the 18.8 percent official unemployment &amp; continuous paramilitary violence. A large rally in Santiago, Chile, denounced unemployment &amp; government steps to freeze wages. Workers demanded jobs in Montevido, Uruguay, where an outbreak of foot &amp; mouth disease has led to mass layoffs in meat packing plants. 

In Long Beach, California, police fired rubber bullets &amp; arrested 100 anarchist demonstrators who disrupted traffic to protest the treatment of immigrant workers. Some 1,200 people marched in Portland, Oregon calling for an end to corporate greed &amp; an investigation into the police shooting of a Mexican immigrant last month. May Day protests focusing on the plight of immigrants in the US also took place in New York, Boston &amp; Chicago. 

Rallies were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver &amp; other Canadian cities. 

Across Kenya, workers boycotted official May Day celebrations en masse to protest the collaboration of the trade unions with the austerity policies of the government. At the conclusion of the official event in the capital Nairobi, riot police dispersed the small crowd to prevent opposition politicians addressing them &amp; criticising the union federation. Riot police also attacked workers in Harare, Zimbabwe, when they tried to prevent groups connected with Prime Minister Robert Mugabe taking over the rally. 

**2002** - England: Anarchists plan jubilee mayhem. Protest groups join forces to disrupt Queen's celebrations &amp; bring May Day chaos to the capital. The Movement Against the Monarchy (Mam) is gearing up for a summer-long campaign, which will include an attempt to take control of London's Millennium Bridge on 4 June while the Queen is attending a service in nearby St Paul's Cathedral. 

**2002** - US: Festival Del Pueblo / Festival Of The People (May 1st - 5th), Boston, Ma. 5-day celebration of resistance, of community, &amp; of freedom inclueds demonstrations, direct actions, community carnival, bookfair, free school, revolutionary soccer tournament, revolutionary music festival, &amp; cultural gathering. Endorsed by the NorthEastern Federation Of Anarcho-Communists (NEFAC) &amp; the Boston branch of the Industrial Workers of The World (IWW). 

**2002** - Australia: Police clash with thousands of antiglobalization protesters. 

**2002** - England: May kicks off with a minor riot in Soho which saw our street blockaded by armoured police while mounted ones charged up London's Shaftesbury Avenue. All this while hordes of unwashed harridans claiming to represent Soho's sex workers danced maniacally to the tribal drumming of anarchist musicians &amp; what appeared to be dressed down office workers armed with flutes. There was still something highly suspect in the sight of a lot of protesters marching in support of sex workers when actually, if truth be told, they would rather close down or censor the strip clubs, sex shops, porn videos, et al, on the grounds that they are deemed to exploit, &amp;/or, degrade men &amp; women. 

**2006** - US: One million protesters hit the streets nationwide, in school walk-outs, &amp; a day of rest for many workers who fail to show up at work, opposing attempts to criminalize some 12 million immigrant ""illegals"" &amp; to highlight rightwing attacks on their civil rights.

&gt;No one cares if their beliefs are true or false. People only care about cultural norms and behaviors. Islamic cultural norms and behaviors are bad, wrong, and incompatible with Europe, regardless of whether their beliefs are true or false.

Part of this I agree with. When Muslims bring the arabic culture to Europe or the United States, it often doesn't work. But adoption of American or European culture can happen while still being Muslim. While none of my Muslim friends wear a burka (they think it's outdated and ridiculous, just like you and I do), the females wear head scarves as a sign of respect, much like Jewish men or Catholic nuns do. Most of my muslim friends are liberal democrats whose political and social views are perfectly compatible with a non-literal interpretation of the Qur'an, just like Christians who don't literally interpret the bible.

In the case of Greece, they received cheaper loans than normal due to their inclusion in the EU - many investors believed that a Greek default would be prevented by other EU members via a bailout, and thus their chance of default was considered low (Hence their original S&amp;P rating). Now that the EU appears to be demonstrating they're not likely to activate a bailout without a default, the S&amp;P rating has been revised to its normal position based on the relative public debt and the chance of servicing it.

For a long time in small communities, churches provided this support for the people. There weren't often these benefits from other sources, particularly outside of cities in the boondocks. The church, particularly the Catholic Church in old Europe, would use excommunication or otherwise ostracize the dissenters, leaving them without support. Excommunication used to be far more serious, as those unfortunate folk would be shunned by society, could no longer do business with the town (or other Catholic towns), and have to fend for themselves.

Those basic values do look a lot like mini-liberalism. Guess what? Our country was founded on responsible government and individual rights.

By your logic then, we should have tax-payer funded schools for religious extremists? How do we draw the line? I suggest we don't. We just stop funding religious schools. If people want to send their kids to Sunday School, or to private religious schools that don't take public dollars, I'm ok with that. But, when you ask me to spend my tax dollars, I expect it will be spent enhancing and protecting the basic minimum guarantees of equality and defending a democratic nation from being pulled apart by anachronistic (ie. theological, racist, sexist, or homophobic) and sectarian beliefs.

I dare you to find one exception or loophole in the Charter. It's a list of rights for each individual. If you're speaking about other parts of the constitution you may not entirely understand the historical context. For one, aboriginal societies were nations that the Europeans made treaties with. They've gotten the raw end of the stick, and whenever they ask our government to honour the treaties, they instead get an earful of ""why are all these exceptions for you and not me?"" Has it dawned on you that if you live in B.C. you likely live on land that was never ceded by the natives and was guaranteed by Her Majesty could only be given up by fair negotiation? You should send them a rent cheque before you start complaining about the exceptions they have.

As for Catholicism embracing homosexuality, you are just splitting hairs. The Church does not allow them to marry and therefore does not welcome their sexuality. It asks them to bury it under a blanket of shame. Meanwhile, you'd like your fellows to gather together to freely associate. Fine, you have that right. But don't use my tax money to do it and don't suggest a Catholic or religious society would be the cure for greed, which you lay on individualism. Catholicism has much to atone for--dare I start: the Inquisition, the denunciation of Galileo, the banning of literature, the oppression of French Canadians, the tacit support of the Nazis, the rape of children. Good luck with that religious society of yours.

OK, but why would we have any restriction at all then? what is the limit.

&gt; ...but I hope that so long as we enshrine personal liberty it will
&gt; eventually secularize those living here. 

The only issue, is that nothing seem to indicates that path of events. We have third generation Muslims here. Still they prefer Mohamed over free speech and democracy. They still oppress their women, indoctrinating little girls to wear veils. Demanding halal food in public schools etc. etc The list if endless.

&gt; That is all we can really do. Banning a piece of clothing does nothing
&gt; but galvanize them, though.

Not at all. I makes perfect sense to ban it. They need to become part of our way of life. Not the other way around. When women travels to the middle east, they have to wear the veil, and when Muslims settle in Europe they have to not wear it. 

If anything, allowing them to wear it, so they can see how many followers of evil there really is will galvanize them. 

&gt; I am guessing that none of the people who posted that stuff actually
&gt; read the bill.

Point taken, sad as it is...

&gt; I really don't have a solution for that but banning clothing is not the
&gt; answer.

No, but IMHO its a good start. We need to make clear, that there is nothing moderate about Islam, therefore it is no more acceptable to wear those outfits than it is to wear a Nazi uniform in public. 

Today, the only real difference is that the Neo-Nazis know that will get attacked if they try to wear shit like that. Unfortunately most citizens in the western world seem to think that Islam is kosher... 

&gt; Badly, I am sure.

But you could prevent some of it, but clearly showing that Islam is not acceptable and that you wont accept Islamic schools, where kids are told that Islam is great and filled with various lies.

c0pa186,True,0,,t5_2qyt6,"&gt;The idea that a nation might restore itself to greatness by emphasizing, even “celebrating,” weakness may seem 
counterintuitive. After all, why would any leader seeking to gain global respect want to constantly remind his 
people and the world of his country’s former humiliation? Perhaps Chinese leaders (both Nationalist and 
Communist) calculated that if Chinese could become sufficiently aware, even ashamed, of their weakness, they 
would be goaded into rising up and reclaiming their national greatness.

I have never seen somebody comparing China to Israel, but this looks quite similar to me.



&gt;Thus, we feel sensitive to any kind of slight and often have a very sharp reaction to perceived unfair 
treatment or injustices. On an emotional level we cannot help but associate treatment in the present with past 
injuries, defeats, invasions, and occupations by foreigners. There is something almost in our DNA that triggers 
autonomic, and sometimes extreme, responses to foreign criticism or put-downs. 

&gt; ...

&gt;In any event, since 1949, a significant part of China’s effort to create a new national identity has been based 
on the dream of restoring the country’s territorial integrity, 


What is that something? Does China have to unify its territories first or can it be 
transformed by other means? Otherwise, this is a guaranty for war.



&gt;And in the film, Liu Xing’s American Ph.D. adviser is arrogance incarnate. When Liu arrives in his lab, he is 
smugly told, “Well, feel free to challenge me all you want. Just keep in mind, I’m always right!”

&gt;When an assistant reminds Liu’s adviser that his student has “been pulling a lot of all-nighters” doing 
research for him, he contemptuously replies, “Oh, come on! These kids are grateful for whatever work I give 
them. They come from a place where astrology is considered a science and toilets a luxury.” 

&gt;Such exchanges in the film echo a kind of condescension that has historically marked many kinds of 
relationships between the West and China and slowly formed a kind of “dark matter” that continues to exert a 
powerful, if unobserved force. 


It's funny, because the relationship started the other way round:

&gt;[This stemmed from the traditional imperial world view of seeing China as the centre of the world and viewing 
all foreigners as uncivilized barbarians unworthy of equal diplomatic status.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty)

If the Chinese actually feel humiliated by America, then they don't like their own food and I think it is 
especially painful as they don't objectively perceive the Western attitude but project their own arrogance onto 
the Westerners and believe that Westerners think about them in the same way they think about their neighbours.


&gt;A particularly important element in the formation of China’s modern identity has been the legacy of the 
country’s “humiliation” at the hands of foreigners, beginning with China’s defeat in the Opium Wars in the mid-
nineteenth century and the shameful treatment of Chinese in America. 

I think it's a mistake to start history with the Opium Wars because China's situation is not only the result of 
European aggressions. History would be different if China hadn't turned down [the Macartney Embassy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macartney_Embassy#Outcome) or [ hadn't scuttled its Pacific fleet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_history_of_China). 



Another neglected point is the missed opportunity to turn into a modern society on its own:

&gt;[Cixi then consolidated control and established near-absolute rule over the dynasty. She installed her nephew 
as the Guangxu Emperor in 1875. A conservative ruler who refused to adopt Western models of government, Cixi 
rejected reformist views and placed Guangxu under house arrest in later years for supporting reformers. However, 
after a humiliating clash with the Eight-Nation Alliance, external and internal pressures led Cixi to attempt 
institutional changes and appoint reform-minded officials. Ultimately, the Qing Dynasty collapsed a few years 
after her death.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi)


One ""funny coincidence"": Japan initially did not try to conquer entire China but Manchuria, the origin of the 
last dynasty, [the Qing Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty). Ignoring later Japanese expansions, 
that looks to me like native Americans, complaining that England gets annexed by the European Union.


Chinese position to their Manchurian heritage looks especially strange when compared to [Nanking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre): 100,000 to 300,000 died there, but the Manchus killed up to 
800,000:

&gt;It also involved huge loss of life, including the infamous Yangzhou massacre of 1645, when a ten-day rampage by 
troops in the city with the permission of Prince Dodo resulted in an estimated 800,000 deaths. 


It gets extra  strange as China is [turning Manchuria into ""The Northeast""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria#Origin_of_the_name).

It may be recalled in this context that the Warsaw Pact plan for World War III was to invade Western Europe. The devastation suffered by Russia in World War II meant that the Kremlin planned to wage war on enemy soil, hence the emphasis on nuclear weapons in the Warsaw Pact plan to be used as super-artillery that would smash through NATO defenses. It was the deterrent strategy of NATO that spared Europe from a nuclear nightmare. But Obama’s divergent strategy is not merely to appease Muslims but also to circumscribe Israel with his determination to create Palestine state, knowing full well that such a state will be a haven for Hezbelloh and Syrian terrorists. The recent Muslim summit convened by Obama is to consolidate Muslim power worldwide. He has arranged the next summit in Turkey. Immediately after the summit Obama has called on Billy Grraham probably to cover up his Islamic ties and to  entice  Americans. The Russian-Ukrainian naval base agreement is a setback to U.S. efforts to establish control of the Black Sea, which is a gateway to Russia and the Caucasus. During the five-day war with Georgia in 2008, Russian warships based in Sevastopol sank a Georgian missile gunboat and played a key role in ferrying marines and weapons to the war zone A Navy source said Russia would now strengthen Sea Fleet, consisting of about 40 combat vessels, with new surface warships and submarines. China is emerging as a dominant power in Asia, and its economy has sprung back to life with remarkable speed. The much ballyhooed stimulus plan of Obama has so far yielded little measurable benefit, save putting some spark back in stock markets. Americans will soon feel crunch of the much trumpeted Obama’s health care. Moscow and Beijing are now extending their tentacles even into South America and have signed treaties with countries in the exclusive U.S. turf because the White House has now become effete. Instead of concentrating on these vital issues, Obama has been diverting the attention and twisting American foreign policy by focusing on non-existent Muslim priorities.  He and Hillary are bent upon humiliating Israel, a loyal ally in the Middle East, just to appease Muslims.  Awash in petro products, Putin is acting with a swagger and assertiveness, taking advantage of the impotence and weakness of Obama. If the creation of Palestine state will put an end to Islamic terrorism, why there are bomb blasts in Mumbai, Madrid, Moscow, Islamabad and other places? Obama is a novice in foreign policy. And Hillary is playing second fiddle.

We have had massive migrations in the past.  First there were the Italians, and then the Irish.  We had a huge wave of eastern europeans as the soviet empire fell.

Why does the united states not have the same problems that Europe has at integrating people into society?  It's because the united states doesn't have the same luxurious welfare systems as Europe.

Muslim child goes to France with his family.  His family is paid to stay on welfare.  The welfare is given so that immigrants don't take the high paying jobs that French unions worked so hard to get high salaries, and benefits for.  Once you are employed in France it is against the law to fire someone for anything but the most extreme circumstances.

Businesses in France wont hire someone on a whim.  When you hire an employee in France, you are making a full lifetime commitment for that employee.  They will, by law, work for you for 30 years or more years.  Regardless of if they are a good worker or not.

For that reason, you don't hire new employees unless you are absolutely sure you will need a new employee for 30+ years.  And you're sure as hell not going to hire some Muslim immigrant who doesn't even speak French.

So the Muslim family gets welfare.  The parents never learn French, thus never become employable.  The children, while they do learn the language, wont get hired because again, when you're making a 4 decade commitment to hire someone, you don't hire children.  Children are irresponsible.  You hire a man who's over 30 and has a wife and is settled down.  Not some 22 year old who still goes out drinking and dancing every night.

Now look at the united states.  We have shitty welfare.  You come here, you either work or starve to death.  And despite what the democrats tell you, a human beings desire to survive is extremely strong.  So they get jobs.  And they learn the language.  And their children can get jobs because in the US companies hire and fire on a whim.  If a company only needs work for the summer, they'll hire high school kids just for the summer.  It's not a life long commitment to hire a teenager.  If he's good, he may stay on the job for a whole lifetime.  Hell, he may end up owning the place.  If he's bad, he may not make it through the full first day.

So the reason you don't have to worry about a massive influx of Chinese Communists is because they will become culturally acclimated just like the Irish, the Italians, the Ukrainians, the Africans, the Mexicans, the Japanese, the Armenians, the Iraqis, the Christians, the Jews, the Buddhists, the Athiests, the blacks, the whites, the browns, and even the Chinese already have.

**B)** in addition to point A also own the commercial banks that sell the bonds at a fee. (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan etc)

The way I explain it is heavily simplified for the sake of conversation, because the chain of ownership of central banks is often obfuscated by many links in the ownership chain, but the core of it still stands.

In short, that small group of people owns for the most part the entire chain of money creation, meaning that a great part of the taxes you and I pay flows to them.

&gt;Much of what I mentioned isn't payed out of the federal budget. There are local taxes, you know.

Local taxes are still pocket change compared to the large expenditures you see on the chart.

&gt;but that's a defect of the US system

Large interest payments to central banks and big defense budgets aren't unique to the US unfortunately. There are quite some EU nations that have an even bigger debt proportionally to their GPD and while they might have smaller defense budgets compared to the US, in terms of their budget their defense spendings are still quite large. Meaning both Europeans and Americans pay a lot of taxes for banking interests and the military industrial complex. 

I would say western Europeans have it even worse considering the percentage of taxes they pay over their incomes, see: http://imgur.com/qnbxH.jpg",1426295229,0,True,0,t1_c0pai77,1,,TyTN,1272831411,1,Economics,t1_c0pahg5,False,t3_bywge,

&gt; [Zionism is an] international *nationalist* political movement that, in its broadest sense, calls for the existence of a *sovereign, Jewish* national homeland. 

&gt; In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl infused Zionism with a new ideology and practical urgency, leading to the First Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897, which created the World Zionist Organization (WZO).[16] *Herzl's aim was to initiate necessary preparatory steps for the attainment of a Jewish state.*

Hertzl wrote [*Der Judenstaat*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Judenstaat), for Dog's sake!  He wrote a book ""The Jewish State"".  How can you claim ""The original aim of Zionism was not to establish a Jewish state"" and cite Herzl when he wrote a book the very title which shows you to be wrong?

&gt; It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century. He argued that the best way to avoid anti-Semitism in Europe was to create this independent Jewish state.

Nope:  It's just the media trying their usual to tell only a tiny fraction of what happened to get people *interested*, with claims of greed, etc., grabbing people by the gut so that the media can get eyeballs for ad revenue and now also to pursue a partisanly political agenda.

So, the media likes to cry ""Wolf!"", greed, evil, sin, corruption, etc., and trigger false alarms in people's danger detectors.  That has been the main technique of the media going back for well over 100 years.

They also want to bash large corporations and push DC owning essentially all the means of production, transportation, finance, energy, communications, and health care -- essentially as in Communist China.  Yup, sadly, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, and LAT are so far *left* that they are at least communist if not Communist.  Sorry 'bout that.  How?  Why?  One claim is that in the 1950s the US Communist Party decided to go *stealth*, join the Dems, and concentrate on the media.

What actually happened recently with GM is simple, **dirt** simple, with **nothing** wrong at all:  GM had a loan from DC for a few billion and paid it back early.  Simple.

I know, I know:  ""But, but, but what about the huge, taxpayer **BAILOUT** of those ugly, greedy ....????""

More media nonsense.  Again, it's simple, **dirt** simple:  GM sold a LOT of common stock to DC, enough stock that DC is now a majority owner of GM which it is fair now to call *government motors*.  In time, the price of GM stock will likely increase.  Then GM will sell some new stock to the public and take the cash and buy back the DC stock.  If this works as intended, then the US taxpayers will make at least a small profit, maybe even a large profit.

This stock buyback has **NOT** happened yet; it was not planned to happen yet; no one in a responsible position is claiming that it's happened yet; but the media want to sow confusion to grab people by the gut to get eyeballs for ad revenue, pursue their bash large corporations political agenda, and to keep some favorite, easy to write, *stories* going to make it easier on and on to get eyeballs, ad revenue, political progress, etc.

GM blew it.  One reason:  In the 1950s GM had nearly a license to print money.  They had to be careful not to sell more than 51% of the cars or risk anti-trust action.  Soooooo, the UAW saw a big chance -- dream jobs with lifetime financial security, health care, job security, etc.  Then the UAW also insisted on lots more jobs than GM needed.  GM was so rich they put up with it.  The Dems liked the UAW donations and went along with it with labor laws, etc.  So, maybe GM didn't have a monopoly, but the UAW did and, then, made Ford, Chrysler, etc. go along also.

Accidentally and/or deliberately, the US let in Japan and Germany, and they went to *right to work*, aka, anti-union, states in the US South and started making solid cars for less money.  Detroit slowly suffered.  They began to move jobs out of the big three and into *suppliers*.  So, get seats from Lear, many parts from TRW, etc.  Then they moved jobs to Canada and Mexico.  Sometimes they tried bringing in parts from car companies they owned in Europe, etc.  The UAW membership shrank.  Labor employment in Detroit shrank.  Detroit was nearly destroyed with large residential areas deserted.  Finally with the financial crisis of 2008, Chrysler and GM were bust.

So, if only to slow down the crash, DC helped Chrysler and GM.  Actually likely DC will show a profit.  I'm not up on Chrysler, but GM can survive and do well:  The number of UAW employees in GM is down from a few hundred thousand to maybe 35,000.  Michigan as a state still just loves labor unions, but GM is now mostly out from under the UAW labor monopoly.  The UAW may have a good friend in the White House for now but has nearly no friends elsewhere in DC.

Looks like GM will survive, be a strong company again, and leave DC with a profit.

So, who loses?  The old GM stockholders, **NOT** likely the taxpayers.  Who were the old GM stockholders?  Individuals in *index* (aka *market average*) mutual funds, IRAs, 401K programs, university endowments, life insurance companies, employee pension funds, etc.  They worked hard, made money, and to have financial security bought stock.  Then the Dems in DC set up the UAW as a labor monopoly and greatly weakened GM.  Then DC told Fanny and Freddie to make bad housing loans and caused a housing bubble.  When the bubble burst, the economy was so sick that weak GM went bust.  In fixing GM, the old stockholders lost, essentially everything.  At one point, could have bought all of GM for, what, about $1 billion?  With its pension fund liability, GM was seen as having deeply **negative** net worth.  Only the bankruptcy let GM get back to, say, zero net worth.  Now GM has a chance again, but the old stockholders lost.

If want to write some media *stories* about big loses, then write about the old stockholders.  Much the same for the stockholders in AIG, Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and so far at times even Goldman Sachs.  E.g., due to more silly yelling and screaming in DC, Goldman Sachs stockholders just lost about 30% last week.  Isn't DC wonderful?  Don't we want so **MUCH** more DC?  Instead, the media writes about DC losing money, which they likely won't do on the GM deals, maybe even on the AIG deal, and certainly not the TARP deal.

Even worse the media writes about the TARP money *given* to the *greedy ....*.  Goldman Sachs didn't need or want the TARP money.  Secretary Paulson **ordered** them to come to DC, sat them on the other side of a table, and ""made them an offer they couldn't refuse"":  ""You **WILL** sign this term sheet before you leave this room.""  They signed.  Why did Paulson do this?  Likely he wanted to stop *runs*, that is, to make public that all the large US financial institutions **DID** have money.  Then GS paid back the TARP money, **WITH** 12% per year interest, as soon as the term sheet said they could.  The taxpayers made a profit, actually a nice profit.  Goldman Sachs paid the money back and didn't complain.

Don't hear this on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, LAT, etc.  So, who are you going to pay attention to?  When you curse, spit, and raise your longest finger, who will you aim at?

As long as those newsies still get eyeballs and ad revenue while doing their old stuff, now heavily partisanly political, they will continue to do so.  So, I'm doing my part:  I pay **NO** attention to ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, NYT, WaPo, and LAT.  Also *Time* and *Newsweek*.  I **never** take seriously **anything** they say.

c0pawdi,True,0,,t5_2qhqb,"Oh come on, there is nothing bad about joining the EU other than irrational fear of giving part of our own governments powers to other countries (most of which would do the same thing as us anyway). But the truth is the EU is essentially a cost saving excersise.

Looking at the economy as a prudent example, historically each country would have to negotiate its affairs with every other country on its own terms. Every time we set to do business with a foreign nation we'd essentially have to negotiate a new treaty with them, trying to impose our trade laws on to them and vice versa. With some nations that could be quite an expensive process, and in some cases even mean that we cannot do business with them. 

Now businesses are generally free to trade in whatever countries they wish, but the security that comes from these treaties accomodates a compromise between cutting cost and low risk.

With this in mind, would it not make more sense to negotiate a single treaty with as many countries at the table at the same time, rather than have them resolved individuallly? (see addendum)

Not only that, but if everybody is working to playing the same sheet of music it becomes even cheaper to run your business. If you know a foreign state addequately certifies its business practices then you know you don't have to run as extensive background checks. For example, if country X works to ISO standard 321 for smelting metal ore A in to metal alloy B (which cannot be found in england), then your company can make substantial savings by not having to send out inspectors and perhaps do less quality assurance checks. In terms of labour, perhaps this decrease in risk would bring jobs back to europe rather than see chips of lead paint inside your chinese made baby formula ^_^

Anyway, I've digressed. The reason why a lot of advocates think we should stay involved with europe is that if we ignore it, well eventually it's going to succeed. Germany, France, Italy and Spain are the big players (in terms of GDP and population) and that gives them a lot of sway in what rules the EU adopt. If we sit aside while they create rules and regulations for its member states, when it comes to us doing business with the EU we **will** have to compromise to their will else they will go elsewhere (26 countries have a lot more bargaining power than england, take the united states for example). Not only that, but we'd find ourselves having to adopt all the regulations and ""best business practices"" they choose, just for our companies to stay competitive. However, if we continue to work with them then perhaps our existing influence can mean that our regulations won't have to changed at all, and at worst only compromised.

That's ignoring the potential the EU has as a forum for other matters. Like bring global warning and polution to the agenda of lesser developed countries. And ignoring the fact the increased bargaining power the EU state has with existing supernations (the US/Russia/China), in the same way the UK would struggle to influence the EU from the outside.

And back to my insinuation that the UKIP are similar to the BNP, well if you think the above makes sense then don't the entire arguements of ""Saving money"" and ""National Pride"" really not translate to ""Ignorance"" and ""Xenophobia"" which are essentially both points on the same axes of ""Stupidity"" and ""Racism"" the BNP are reknowned to campaign on?

And lets not forget the UKIP party's MP's often have roots from within the Conservative party. I happily make digs about the elitist nature of the tories as any other man, so I'd like to make the point that the connection is quite unnerving. Letting my inner conspiracy theorist run wild, it wouldn't surprise me if a number of the parties founders had close ties to people who run successful businesses that are dependant on some caveat of current trade agreements. That if changed may adversely affect their businesses (accepting more eastern european countries in to the union and having to enforce the EU minimum wage etc). But of course that's purely speculation, I'm sure they're all just doing it because they just ""know"" its right and/or for the chance to partake in the glamorous spectacle that is British politics! ;)

Addendum: Just to show how expensive it can become to work in such a method here are some examples:

Three countries A, B and C want to set up individual trade agreements. This requires 3 agreements (A+B, A+C, B+C or 2+1=3)

Four countries A, B, C and D want to set up trade agreements. This requires 6 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, B+C, B+D, C+D or 3+2+1=6).

Five countries A, B, C, D and E want to set up trade agreements. This requires 10 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C, B+D, B+E, C+D, C+E, D+E or 4+3+2+1=10)

Six Countries A, B, C, D, E and F want to set up trade agreements. This requires 15 agreements (5+4+3+2+1)

There are 27 states in the EU, every time that an issue should arise if we were to discuss it individually then there would potentially be 378 negotiations (27+26+25+...+2+1=378). Should it be a matter that concerns all 50 european states then there would have to be a combined effort of 1275 negotiations.

Because the notion of one group of ""founding fathers"" who were unanimous on all issues pertaining to the Constitution and its interpretation is a *big fucking myth.* There were two large contending groups and several smaller ones. Some of their controversies survive today.

The two big groups (the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists) however agreed that it was necessary to form *some* kind of union in order to present an allied front against the British and other European powers. In order to do that, they pulled off a bunch of logrolling and compromising, the result of which was the Constitution.

Germany is paying the *most*, not just because we're the biggest country in the EU but because we're the baddest. We have more money.

c0pbvks,False,0,,t5_2qh61,"Yes, see I disagree with the notion that May Day only ""really kicked into high gear during the cold war as the USSR/Marxist states used it to celebrate the worker"". May Day was celebrated by socialists and social-democrats long before the Cold War, long before the Eastern Bloc came into being. 

In the Netherlands, May Day is not (and I suppose never was) a national holiday, but in Utrecht, where I last lived before emigrating, social-democratic and union workers would, back in the day, march down from the workers' neighbourhoods towards the city center with marching bands and banners and the lot - and that was long before the Cold War. It has a venerable tradition that, while definitely ""red"" in nature, was in no way tied to the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Hell, I played in a May Day play in the local neighbourhood center when I was eight, back in the seventies, in a West-European country, as the child of a social-democratic family that wanted nothing to do with communism.

&gt;it's actually because the US is more advanced than the May Day celebrators in recognizing worker's rights.

But this again only works if you define ""the May Day celebrators"" as Eastern Bloc countries, which despite all their rhetoric were lousy with workers' rights in practice. But since May Day was (and partially is) a holiday across much of the Western world outside America too, in particular in countries with a long social- or christian-democratic tradition where workers rights are definitely better guaranteed than in America, I don't agree with this either.

&gt;So initially the US didn't celebrate because they already had labor day. Later they didn't switch (like other countries) because May Day was associated with communism / Warsaw Pact.

OK, fair enough, that's straightforward enough, from the US vantage point, and I realize that really just was your original point.

For the record, if this wasn't clear from my post, I in no way implied that communists and social-democrats formed a *front* against the Nazis. The Volksfront as a particular alliance against the Nazis did only materialized late, only in some countries, and did not last for long once Stalin ordered another course reversal when he worked together with Nazi Germany to occupy Poland.

No, and I'm sorry if I was not clear, I did not try to create a Volksfront. The communists and social-democrats were often bitter enemies. But they were, both, at the forefront of resistance against the Nazis, fighting them when the conservatives ended up striking a deal with Hitler and helping him into power. I don't think that a cherry-picked strike where communists and Nazis worked towards the same ends is much of a refutation of that. 

It had been communist youth groups that battled the Nazi ones on the streets, it had been the social-democratic leadership that had warned against the Nazis from the start and refused to ever deal with them. While both social-democrats and communists loved to paint the other black, they both identified themselves as the Nazis' main opponent - and were identified as the left end of the axis with the Nazis at the right end of the axis by contemporaries. And it was the socialists and social-democrats who were the first to be sent to the camps and prisons after the Nazis took power; and it was, across most of Europe, communists and socialists who were the most active in the anti-Nazi underground resistance during the years of the occupation, and gave their lives for it. That makes the equation between socialists and Nazis distasteful to me.

&gt; Ulbricht thought of the GDR as a socialist country of German nation (see constitution until 1974) and reunification was one of his goals.

c0pc0y7,False,0,,t5_2cneq,"&gt; If you do not have a society of mutual agreed interaction and benevolence, 

That is the definition of trade according to Menger, that people will trade only when mutually agreed upon interaction behooves them, and no longer. Diminishing marginal utility means their valuations are subjective, but remember, it's separate valuations that cause them to trade *at all*. To regard an trade as occurring at a point of equal valuation leads to absurdities. If two people trade when they consider the value of what they are getting to be equal to the value of what they are giving up, there is no reason that they shouldn’t simply reverse the trade a moment later.

&gt; The state is the only entity with the power to stand up to modern transnationals.

No it isn't, and without removal of state assisted corporate personhood through the act of incorporation, transnationals will only grow in importance.

Going back to Ostrom's prize this past year, where she studied the commons, the study concludes of course that commons are almost always better when managed by private interests ... but she says she ""despairs over the oceans"". that any current form of management could never work.

Extrapolating out her work, and work of someone like a Hayek who finds that humans always find a most efficient way to manage things eventually, we'll likely end up with multi-nationals literally running the world so long as powerful state influences assist it. There really is only one eventual option, should corporations continue to recieve the protections they do (and they will, SCOTUS just affirmed personhood, and the EU treaty did as well). 

People making hundred year predictions often look foolish down the line, but I'm pretty certain that we'll eventually see transnationals managing the commons by way of representation. Whether it's through bought politicians (likely), or a more seemingly ""market"" approach (scare quotes because it's important to remember that I describe a likely outcome, not an endorsed one where incorporation is stripped and companies therefore limited to employee levels in the hundreds by marginal utility and reduce barriers). 

I think eventually unless the power of corporations and nations are disentangled, the only manageable outcome is oil, fisheries, shippers, tourist interests, etc, managing the oceans by way of a ""board"" of sorts, or bought politicians as their actors. I'd prefer a board I suppose, since reality is people are going to continue to argue for ""more regulatory framework"", and that always assists big business.

A board getting restitution from oil by way of the ire of fisheries, tourism, etc is probably going to be the outcome of national incorporation. We'll probably se an ""Oceancorp"" of combined interests in 2100, unless the wheels come off before that and people are eeking out mid 20th century productivity existences. 

It's frustrating people like yourself (no offense, I swear) don't realize they are *assisting* these corporations with arguments like yours above, but I really don't blame ""everyman"". This is incredibly complicated and no one of us, including anti-capitalist or market libertarians, truly understands the scope and lessons here.

Every government that spoke Latin sided with the Pope in Rome, every government that spoke Greek sided with the Patriarch of Constantinople. I doubt 1 in 1000 people would have guessed that. 

As for the Protestant Reformation, within 100 years every country which spoke a Germanic language (including English) was officially Protestant, or, in the case of Germany itself, over 90% Protestant (and this includes the Teutonic Knight run Baltic-speaking state of Livonia), all the Romance language countries stayed ""Roman Catholic"" and the two states in Latin Christendom which were neither Romance or Germanic speaking, Poland(Slavic) and Hungary(Finno-Ugric), were the most tolerant countries in Latin Christendom until the French Revolution, nearly 200 years later.

As for Islam, the main split right now is Sunni/Shia, and the seats of the two cross the major Islamic linguistic divide, Afro-Asiatic/Arabic vs Indo-European/Iranian.

Buddhism, too. The Tibetan Buddhists are only 5% of the total, but they live where people speak Tibetan. The Hinayana/Mahayana split I don't know enough about, but it sure _looks_ like Mahayana ""stayed"" in Dravidian speaking lands in India, while Hinayana ""progressed"" in Indo-European/Indic lands.

Africa or Europe is not isolated, those are huge areas.  There are many different climates and conditions in each area and intelligence would be favor in different areas.

This has been done. Like i said, the results showed theres more diversity within a race than across races.

The truth is the entire country is held hostage by a very small elite very connected, bought and paid for group of @ 500 some odd people in Washington DC, not you and me.

I reject their welfare just as much as I reject their warfare as they go hand in hand.  One is the price you pay for the other.


The corporate spokesmen you speak of are very much in support of the government however on the subject of our military, war, and global imperialism in general though, yes? So in that sense they don't want their listeners to run from the government, quite the contrary, they want them to join up and start shooting for the good ol US of A!  Very unlibertarian, my friend.  No, I read Limbaugh's first book way back in high school and knew something was amiss.  He was partially correct in some of the things he said, and I suspect that's why he has so many followers, but his philosophy is inconsistent.  I then began to open my mind to what those on the left had to say, some of social freedoms they seemed to be for intrigued me.  I then realized much of what they said about ""evil corporations"" had a bit of truth in it as well.  But the thing is, the more government = more power to the wealthy corporations, not the other way around as you describe it.  Why do you think the big oil companies have been behind so much regulation in their industry?  Why do you think Big Pharma and the big insurance companies are so in favor of Health Care Reform?  It's because they own the politicians!  They write the regulations themselves to effectively box out the competition and give themselves favor.  Much political rhetoric over the past decade has centered over whether a particular policy is “favorable to business,” or whether a candidate is “pro-business.” In earlier years, I rooted for any “business-friendly” policy move, and supported conservative “pro-business” politicians. But, as I learned over the years, “pro-business” ideas are all too often inconsistent with “free-market” ideas.

When politicians speak about being “pro-business,” they try to create the impression they will do things to benefit the business climate. That help, however, can come in two forms. One form is in the promise of deregulation, or a promise to fight new regulations or taxes that will potentially harm the economy, an industry, or a firm. This is generally all to the good; the help is “negative”; that is, the politician will focus on what the government should not do regarding a business’s activity.

But the second form of “pro-business” help is “positive,” that is, the state takes some action that specifically helps a business or an industry, usually at the expense of other people. The government creates some law or regulation that allows a business to do or have something it could not otherwise do or have in a true free market. It grants what amounts to a privilege.

When people are not oppressed and generally doing better religion as a whole is less important in their lives, and Christianity in particular seems to do worse.  There is an inverse relationship between quality of life and faith.  The European nations with the highest quality of life have the lowest rate of Christian faith.

Therefore the fact that Christianity is thriving in China, where it is oppressed, and in Africa where quality of life is low, while it's doing less well in areas where it is freely practiced and where quality of life is higher is exactly what I'd expect.

We see this in the USA as well: the areas of the nation with higher quality of life have fewer Christians, the areas with lower quality of life have more Christians.

Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to have to face -- **because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It's a biological fact.** Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that's used in the Old Testament is ""the Abomination."" Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And **there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew,** which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together.

Having spent many many months in brazil over the past 22 years staying with family and friends I can tell you that Rio, though perhaps not as safe as a small town in the upper mid west, it no more dangerous than any other large city in the US or Europe if you dont put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation. dont walk into a bad neighborhood at night etc. 


you DO NOT NEED A GUN. First of all as a foreign worker in Brazil you dont want to be dealing with getting stopped by the police and carrying a gun in your pocket. Kidnappings do not happen as much as the media says. again if you just take basic precautions you will be fine, if its late take a taxi, if you dont know the safety of a neighborhood avoid it, basically dont be a dumb wide eyed tourist and your will be find. I mean you survived Angola you can deal with Rio no problem. 


There is NO NEED for a body guard what so ever (i mean its not like you guys are worth millions of dollars). That being said definitely hire a maid/nanny if you feel you need it. Ask your employer and coworkers for advice as to hiring help so you get someone reliable. The culture of hired help in Brazil is quite extensive, even lower middle class people have a maid come a few days a week. At the upper levels it is not uncommon to have a driver, nanny, maid, gardener/handyman and cook. Some of the help stay on for years and become part of the family, in fact when i go back my family makes a point to see the former cook of a family friend of ours. 


As far as staying up late you can choose to go out at 2am or go out at 9pm both options exist, though the clubs/bars are going to be more fun towards midnight but you dont NEED to change your sleep schedule if you dont want too. 


&gt;5. Hospitals there are not so great (relative to good hospitals in the US/Canada). 


This blanket statement is categorically untrue. you will receive all the care that you need there if you find yourself in an emergency. Especially in Rio there are excellent hospitals on par with what you would find in the US and Europe. There are some hospitals that are not as good but they exist in the less populated areas of the country. Again i can not stress to you enough that Rio is a modern city with everything you would expect to find in any other modern city around the world. That being said you should find your own primary care doctor that you like and trust as you would in any other country in the world. My uncle is a surgeon in BH (the third largest city in Brazil) and i have been to one of the hospitals he works at and I it was just like any of the hospitals i have been to in the US.

The Israelis don't want peace, but they don't want to admit that, so they claim that the Palestinians don't want peace. I'm calling bullshit.

I agree that the reason the Palestinians want peace isn't (just?) because they are inherently better people, but because they're suffering from the conflict, whereas the Israelis are gaining from it (few casualties, and opportunities to steal more land).

The obvious conclusion is that the only way to get to peace is to put intense international pressure on the Israelis, through boycotts, divestitures and sanctions, so that the benefits of peace outweigh the benefits of prolonging the conflict.

&gt; The richest countries in the world are ""on the side"" of the Palestinians

As far as I know, the richest country in the world is the U.S., which AIPAC has wrapped around Israel's finger. Canada and much of Europe blamed the Gaza War on Hamas terrorism rather than IDF terrorism, even though the war started not with Hamas rockets but with an IDF invasion of Gaza.

Well, the education system in the backwater shithole that spawned you is inadequate if you don't see the glaring errors.

*nissan leaf and bmw miniE. the cars are coming out. i already proved that. they would have come out earlier is my point.*

And they will be unavailable in the US? That was the point you were trying to make.

*and yes, american car makers chose to not invest in alt fuel cars. you can't deny this. they had some 30+ years to figure out that the usa can't rely on oil.*

Not investing in a technology that won't make your company any money for the foreseeable future is not the same as suppressing it. Furthermore, battery tech only recently got to to the point where such things are possible and they committed no error in not investing in alternative fuel cars before the 2000s since such investment made **absolutely no sense**.

*and your argument that the tech wasn't there is bs. the fact that toy-onda is at least 10 years ahead in alt tech proves this point.*

The tech wasn't there. Toyota didn't get started on hybrid vehicles until well after the point where the oil crisis was in the works. But those are hybrids. All-electric vehicles, the ignorant fantasy that you've been going on about, still aren't feasible because the tech **still isn't there**. The pathetic range of the best electric vehicle today proves that point.

*road standards? does the usa have magical roads or something? they are being kept out of the market with regulations established by lobbyists.*

No, we do have different standards on what is street-legal. If there was a car that was street-legal in Europe and not street-legal in the US, it is because it is essentially a golf cart. The Mini and SmartCar made their way over here just fine, what car were you referring to?

*so you go on 100000000 mile trips. congrats. electric cars aren't for you, don't buy one. you do know that projected plans include battery swap stations that take less than 5 minutes to give you a full battery. of course you did.*

So you failed English and math? 300 or 600 miles are quite different from 100000000. The former are quite normal for me and everyone else that uses a car. I'm guessing that your inability to understand the simple impracticality of the electric alternative is related to your educational deficiencies in other areas. Did they just stop trying to educate you at some point in your youth?

*just fyi, person A's observations are backed by zero sources. whereas person B's observations are backed by a documentary. although you may say the documentary is 1 sided, it is completely backed up with sources.*

Zero sources? Every non-electric car on the road backs up my side. The limited range of the state of the art in electric cars backs up my side. What you have is a propaganda piece made by a similarly uninformed and opinionated nut.

*just to re-iterate because i'm standing firm on this point: american car companies chose to make gas guzzlers and not invest in green tech. logic dictates that if you don't invest in tech, you've effectively killed it. i don't see how you can disagree. i've made this point a few times and you've never addressed it.*

No, logic dictates that if you don't invest in green tech, you didn't invest in green tech. If it was viable, and if there was a market for it, they would have invested in it. If they didn't some other actor in the market would have invested in it. One company not investing in something doesn't prevent all other companies from investing in it.

&gt;myth of the genocide of the Jews

I've seen that actually translated as **legend of the genocide of the Jews**, which is a reference to the way the holocaust as taken a ""legendary"" role in western culture, as opposed to him referring to it as a myth, which would mean he was saying it didn't occur.

&gt; They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets. The West has given more significance to the myth of the genocide of the Jews, even more significant than God, religion, and the prophets, (it) deals very severely with those who deny this myth but does not do anything to those who deny God, religion, and the prophet.

As I mentioned, it doesn't appear he was questioning the holocaust, but rather pointing out how it has taken on a legendary status and its victims focused on more than the 10s of millions of others that died in WW2, and second, I do not think it is blasphemy to question the holocaust, or question why it is used as a pretext to create a Jewish state. People shouldn't be going to prison in Europe for denying the holocaust. When a Lancet report said that 1 million Iraqis died since 2003, Bush denied it as said only about 50,000 died. So it's ok to question how many died in the Iraq war, which occurred in a country where international medical teams have had access continuously from the start of the war, and have had access to 21st century surveying techniques, yet it's not ok to even say something that could possibly be interpreted as questioning any aspect of the holocaust, an event that occurred behind enemy lines 65 years ago.

&gt;   Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism? You should know that this slogan, this goal, can certainly be achieved.

When I was a kid in Toronto I liked Liverpool because my best friend who'd emigrated from Warrington did. As the years went on, and more and more of my friends picked teams and got into the game (after the '94 world cup, probably) they'd start with the banter 'We beat you on Saturday' or  'see you next round in the Cup' and all that, but none of us had been there to see 'our' teams play, and all the while I felt like we were faking it.  Where did I get the nerve to count myself among those that stood in the Kop on a Saturday? How can you call yourself Spurs when you've never been to England?  
 
It was only when I got old enough to start going to games on my own  - and I did, to the Toronto Lynx, such as they were - that I felt connected to a team and felt that I belonged as a supporter.  They represented my town, which I believe is the most important factor in 'picking' a team.  Even if the quality wasn't great, at least the will to win feels genuine. 

I don't mean any disrespect to anyone here that supports their European team from another continent, but I suspect at the end of the day, deep down, if they've just picked them from watching them on TV, they can't truly feel connected to those clubs.  At least I didn't anyway.

Actually I don't believe in the concept of racism. I believe it to be a manifestation of ethnic group conflict. Thats certainly a more robust way of looking at it.

Your ""racism"" implies large groups of people consistently acting out purely psychological motivations. I don't think thats very likely.

""by doing experiments and examining the genes themselves. When you're sitting there in Britain talking to your neighbor, and he's short and has red hair and blue eyes, and you're tall with green eyes, the fact is you're more likely to be different from him than you are to be different from a black person, when you examine the entire genotype. In other words, if you take a whole mess of people and segregate them by whether they have these location-specific ""race"" genes (for example, separate them into the blacks and the whites), there is more variation within the groups than there is between the groups.""

Sorry, I'm afraid someone has been lying to you. First off, very simply, the people who most resemble you in general looks and behaviour are those most related to you. Secondly, this idea that somehow everbody has all these jumbled up genes isnt supported by any historical record whatsoever. If at any given point in the last 1,000 years most of my ancestors have been living in the same region of Europe how, in any practical sense, could I end up being more closely related to some guy whose ancestors spent the last 1,000 years in the middle of Africa. When did the interbreeding neccessary for that happen?Thats what you are implying - more closely related. Yet everything else about behaviour, appearance etc says thet we are not alike. Which says that these random genes you are setting so much store by are our old friends the junk DNA. They are there, but they are not doing anything.

Plus that brings us into the old favourite; we share 99% of our DNA with all other humans. But we also share more than 90% with mice. Clearly those 10% that differ are doing a lot of heavy lifting. You could use that to argue that as I and mouse share more DNA than I do with any other human that I am in fact a mouse.

The, for lack of a better term, national mythology is that America is defined by principles like ""freedom and justice for all,"" not the Anglo-Scotch culture of the first colonists, or any of the cultures of the people who populate it. 


Obviously, this being mythology, it isn't literally true. A lot of the reasons for the Revolutionary War were about people wanting to make money. Wherever the newest wave of immigrants are from, they're discriminated against by all the previous waves. Slavery. Racism. Backing dictatorships because they're favorably inclined to us or our business. The list could go on.


But that core idea is still what defines us in our hearts, and I think it might help those not as familiar with U.S. culture in understanding it to say that most of the real movements, right or left or whatever, are about people trying to come to grips with the fact that that idea of America as the good guys (yes, that pretty much is how it goes) doesn't mesh very much with the reality of the U.S. as just another country (one that is in fact responsible for quite a lot of very bad things). 


Unfortunately, sometimes people try to make their principles a reality, and sometimes people rationalize that their principles already are a reality, by saying ""those people don't count."" 


No, I'm not suggesting that the United States is somehow unique for cherishing ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" (as I hope my choice of phrase proves) or holding those principles dear. As you said, pretty much all of Europe and the Commonwealth nations, off the top of my head, are at least as free by any measure you'd care to use. But we don't really *have* a national identity except for those principles (regional identity being another story).

tl;dr: ""Land of the free"" is the point of the U.S. We use the term even though it's not, because we honestly believe that it should be, and it hurts to see it not living up to that.

The nice thing about hard numbers like this is that you can't really dispute them easily. The US has major problems with access to medical care - if you have money, it's available and you tend to stay healthier. Visit a doc once a year for a checkup and physical, and you can find small problems before they grow into bigger and more serious ones. If you can't afford to see a doctor... or a dentist, for that matter, you end up with bigger, more expensive problems in the long run. The advantage of easy access to medical care is evident - longer lives, healthier population, more spending on maintenance and preventive care and far less on the expensive care needed to take care of chronic conditions.

Of course, we have a lot of people here who think that people don't ""deserve"" health care (or other public services) and instead should ""earn"" it. The problem is that the people who cannot afford the cost of preventative care instead tax the public system later with expensive maintenance and ""repair"" care instead. Let's say you have a blood pressure issue. for $40 a year, you can get generic pills to help keep it down. This will lower the wear and tear on your circulatory system, and lower the risk for arterial and heart problems later on. If you don't monitor and treat the blood pressure problem from and early time, you run a much higher risk of having a heart attack, stroke, etc., each of which can cost $100K+ to treat in a hospital. The preventative costs are much lower than palliative costs in the long run, but the savings aren't instant, and they aren't as obvious for a while, but more than worth it in the long run.

This was in 2006, two days after the UK's terror plot bust that started the whole ban in the first place. I was living in Prague, Czech Republic at the time, but it was right before I was flying back to the states. The ban took effect, and at the time it was a complete liquids ban--no liquids were allowed at all, even sealed bottles, things you bought at the airport, etc. At the airport in Prague, you go through security right before you get on the plane and the security personnel went through everything that you had on you, so it took about two hours to board the plane. 

So our entire plane was standing in line, and word started to spread that we couldn't bring any bottles of alcohol on board, duty-free or otherwise. Some people forfeited their bottles, while the rest of us said ""Fuck it. If we cant carry it on with us, we might as well drink it."" Suddenly there were dozens of bottles getting passed up and down the line of passengers. Pretty much a spontaneous open bar. There was every type of alcohol you could imagine from French and Hungarian wine, to whiskey and scotch, to champagne and cognac. Everything under the sun, and more than you could ever drink. Everyone was taking large swigs of whatever came their way and passed it on. 

Two hours later, we've finally boarded and most of the adults on the flight are completely lit. A group of Italian guys are singing soccer chants, a bunch of college-age Americans are joining in despite not knowing any of the words, and everyone is in a really good mood despite the insane security headache we just passed through. Once the plane is in the air, things quiet down and everyone passes the fuck out. It went pretty quickly from the loudest, most ridiculous airplane to the quietest. It was the first and only time I've slept solidly during a transatlantic flight.

Cities are generally more liberal because people are exposed to more variety by virtue of the denser population (since a person's everyday life usually only involves a small number of square miles, the more people in those square miles, then the more exposure to variety they will have.)

Exposure to variety is also correlated with education, awareness, understanding, and intelligence.  There is an element of competition, as persons need to be smarter, faster, and more accepting to stand out in a crowd (a city) when it comes to landing a job or landing a date.  (There are also other factors: competition/interaction between cities encourages progress and the exchange of new ideas that doesn't happen in small towns, accumulation of wealth and resources in cities creates economies of scale in education, research, and technology, etc.)

Europe has more population in a smaller area, and has had many more centuries to build up and concentrate that population into cities and large towns.  Since liberal culture also tends to radiate from these population centers, and there are far more such centers more evenly distributed in Europe than in the U.S., you also find that even the European countrysides, though relatively conservative in European terms, are more liberal than the average American since the greatest mean distance from small town to big town is much smaller.

Europe's closer proximity to and physical connection to moderating influences from a variety of cultures to the east (Asia) and South (Africa), and the great number of fragmented cultures and languages that exist within Europe's borders, also created inevitable pressure towards understanding and acceptance.  Generalizing, America's East coast is probably more liberal because of Europe, and its west coast because of Asia, but it is still isolated by a vast ocean on both sides.

There are no colonists going there in order to set up a new life.  There are temporary workers, but these are not colonists.  Second, the US is not extracting wealth from Iraq in the way required by the term colony.  Were this the case, we would not expect French oil companies to get significant shares of rights to extraction.  Yet they do.  Thirdly, the Iraqi political system, while designed at least partially by Americans, is not controlled by Americans.  One need only look so far as the close relationship between the current ruling State of Law party and Iran to get that much information.  

To be more blunt.  Is Germany a US colony?  They were occupied and had US military bases (still do I believe).  What about Japan?  Same story.

The Romans took Spain because they were fighting the Carthaganians and there were silvermines there. They took Gaul because Caesar needed military glory and slaves to become rich. 

The continually waged war in the east to get those rich lands. The Daidochi Alexandrian lands of the former Persian and Macodonian Empires were rich in their own regard.

It was really the Mongols, then the Timurids that fucked the Middle East over. The Ottomans were good at picking up the pieces and gluing them together again, but when they started declining, the Middle East was fucked.

A good example could be the Crusades. Basically France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the Byzantine Empire fighting against Syria and Egypt - the rest of the Middle East had been ravaged by the Mongols. And the western Europeans and Greeks lost.

We both do get allot of the system and because I have kids in a real way I am investing more into the system than you are - my kids are the future taxpayers.  Those without kids are not making that investment - they are not raising future taxpayers.  This is probably something else we probably don't agree on, but in general childless people get more than what they ultimately put in.

I am not spending your money on religious schools, my kid goes to public school because I cannot afford the expense of a private school.   And as stated, the Ontario system allows someone like you to know that your money is not going to religious schooling - so only those who specifically choose to will fund the school system of their choice. I like publicly funded essential services - they suit me fine, you misunderstand my position.  My argument is that an essential service like education can be publicly funded but not state-run!  I don't see why that is hard to grasp.

Your arguments about health care, roads, ICBC, ...are ridiculously unrelated.  But if you are interested in my driveby opinions on some of those here goes: 
* health care: public and private options are fine with me as long as there is universal access - some European models seem more appropriate than our current system.  **Universal access is all that matters to me.**  And no, just because I don't like our system doesn't mean I want an American system with tiers of care.
* ICBC: don't really care, i lived in provinces with private insurance as well as here in BC obviously - I don't see much of a difference.  I just have to ask why have state-run care insurance and not house insurance or life insurance - what is it about car insurance that was so special in BC.  On the principal, I'd like to object to ICBC but this seriously isn't anything I really care about.   I don't know the true cost of a crown corp running the insurance system - I don't care enough to know.  If i thought I was paying more or even less i would look into it.  I suspect the crown corp is more expensive but I don't know that as a fact.
* roads: funding should come from a mix of property and fuel taxes, not income or corporate taxes.
* tax subsidies: I don't actually get that much, when i read the forms I tend to think trades people and home business people get the lion share of subsidies - and i don't mind that if that is what the government is trying to promote and feels its in the best interest of the economy.  If a government would like to encourage the raising of future taxpayers so be it - makes sense to me.  Subsidies should be given to those who help our economy;  so like children, students should get a break.  i'm also for helping the less fortunate so I am fine with the existing tax breaks for dependents.  I'm fine with tax breaks for charities and giving to charities - in fact I'd rather have these type of tax breaks than have the state decide where this charitable money should go (it becomes too political when states are involved) - why give foreign aid to country A and not country B? I want to give to B damn it.  *(just keeping with my tradition of letting people make decisions).*
* Hydro: i live in BC now and when I was in Ontario it was privatized.  Again I don't really notice a difference so i don't really have an opinion as to whether a crown corp is a better option.  But again on principal, a choice is generally better - i admit I'm ignorant as to whether it really is in this case..

If you watch _City on Fire_ you'll see some similarities with _Reservoir Dogs_. But it's all in the third act, the big climax. Outside of that, the two movies have little to do with one another beat for beat. To label it as stealing is thin.  

Anyone who was watching Hong Kong movies in the late 80s and early 90s saw a lot of similar themes and plots -- the brothers in arms, buddy movies about two guys on opposite sides of the law, mutual respect and admiration all around, etc etc. Hell, John Woo practically made a cottage industry out of it for awhile with stuff like _A Better Tomorrow_, _The Killer_, and _Face Off_. 

_Resevoir Dogs_ is just an extension of that kind of film making. Where you take a single element or a core idea of one guy's movie and then run with it. 

It's not altogether dissimilar from taking Dashiell Hammet's _Red Harvest_ and making _Yojimbo_ in Japan, and then a couple of years later making _A Fistful of Dollars_ in Europe. Although in that's more of clearcut case because both of those films mirror Hammet's plot and characters a helluva lot more than Tarantino mirrors anything in Lam's work. 

Yet another disclaimer: It pains me to say this, because I'm not a Tarantino fan. I think a lot of his stuff is juvenile and one-note and that he made an enormous mistake by distancing himself from Roger Avery after _Pulp Fiction_.

When humans have reached 0% growth rate this will probably mean that all usable land is now used for accommodation.

Russia will probably just be like 'whatever' and Australia will be like 'double you tee eff, mate?'.

Just to be clear, I am not one of them!  I am with you, I believe we can and should radically transform our grid to use only renewables as soon as possible.  It's the very reason my research is on this topic.  I'm not a denier at all, I'm just adamant about being very realistic about what the challenges are so that we can work on solving them more quickly.

So, as far as your points about the countries that already have high penetration, two things:  First, be careful when using those figures from individual countries.  I consider examples like Denmark and Spain to be great political achievements (good regulatory climates that led to using more wind), but totally irrelevant from a technological perspective.  The reason is that electrons do not care about national boundaries.  Most of Europe is all synchronously connected (one huge grid), and the wind penetration across the whole grid is the only thing that matters.  Interestingly, Texas and Ireland actually have higher wind penetration levels over their entire grids (neither shares a grid with anybody else).  So, always look at the entire grid.  Second, I am not at all concerned about what happens at 15% or 25% penetration, because that is not the goal.  I am concerned about what happens at 75% or 80% penetration or higher, because that is what I want to achieve, and that's also where the challenges are enormous.

I actually live in Texas, and this is a huge issue here.  There have already been several very close calls on the grid due to the wind suddenly dying off or suddenly picking up (wind turbines are designed to shut off when the wind blows over a certain speed to protect themselves, so excessive wind can also cause wind power to disappear quickly).  Recently the grid operators were even forced to shed load as a result (basically a controlled and selective blackout).

By the way, just thought I would mention one last thing:

&gt; it would mean tens of thousands of scientists, engineers and investors were badly wrong.

The engineers and scientists and investors are the ones worrying about these problems and trying to fix them.  They see both the potential and the challenges.  If the very well intentioned people who are saying there are no problems at all (like the cartoon's author) were correct, there would be no need for the scientists and engineers! 

Edit:  On my last paragraph:  Of course, the anti-environmentalists are also ""worrying"" about these problems, but not in a constructive way.  I am not saying that everybody who worries about the technological challenges is doing so for the same reason.",1426298077,0,True,0,t1_c0pgiez,3,,[deleted],1273057956,3,environment,t1_c0pgh86,False,t3_bzt36,

Australia also has a *much much higher* population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million as percentage of total population than the United States'.  From this we can infer that Australia's population is actually more densely situated, and that population density figures are simply skewed by the overwhelmingly large uninhabited Outback.

Hell bomb some Somali warlords too - make it clear that if they don't do something about piracy they are the enemy too. Don't send in in Blackhawks that might get shot down, just pound them from a safe distance.

Here's how to do it

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War#Aftermath

&gt; In early 1816, Britain undertook a diplomatic mission, backed by a small squadron of ships of the line to Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers to convince the Deys to stop their piracy and free the Christian slaves. The Deys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was more recalcitrant and the negotiations were stormy. The leader of the diplomatic mission Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, believed that he had managed to negotiate a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, due to confused orders, Algerian troops massacred 200 Corsican, Sicilian and Sardinian fishermen who were under British protection just after the treaty was signed. This caused outrage in Britain and Europe and Exmouth's negotiations were seen as a failure.
&gt;
&gt; As a result, Exmouth was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five ships of the line, reinforced by a number of smaller frigates, later reinforced by a small flotilla of 6 Dutch ships.
&gt;
&gt; On the August 27, 1816, following a round of failed negotiations, the fleet delivered a punishing nine-hour bombardment of Algiers. The attack immobilized many of the Dey's corsairs &amp; shore batteries, coercing him into accepting a peace offer of the same terms as he had presented the day before. He warned that if they were not accepted that he would continue the action. The Dey accepted the terms, not realising that they were a bluff as the fleet had already fired off all of its ammunition.

Oddly enough Edward Pellew was a distant relative of Thomas Pellow, who was famously enslaved in Algeria

And improving the Greek economy is not the intention of the austerity measures now being imposed. The program is intended to pay off the creditors. Simple as that. Today the chief economics commentator of the Financial Times wrote about the EU/IMF program:

""it is overtly a rescue of Greece, but covertly a bail-out of banks.""

Martin Wolf is saying this. Hardly a red-flag waving anarchist.

By the way, does anyone remember the rules of capitalism? In that game the lender charges interest in order to compensate for risk. Namely the risk of default. So the lender loses if it turns out that the borrower can't pay. Now the banks will get their loans paid back anyway, although they miscalculated the risks and lent too much. Under capitalist rules, they should take the blow.

So what the Greeks are doing is exactly right. They *should* protest the way this is being handled by the EU/IMF, because this program will sacrifice the Greek economy at the altar of the international financial community.

This means that there is no real way to pay for sex in the UK now without risking arrest, as it is impossible to know if you are breaking the law when doing so.

This law is a stealth law. Harriet Harmen and other feminist elements in the government were unable to outright ban buying sex because doing so did not have wide public support. This law, therefore, was a stealthy way of almost achieving the same thing.

They used the trafficing angle to get this law passed. It is worth noting that sex trafficing to the UK has been blown out of all proportion. If a woman comes to the UK to be part of the sex industry, this fits the UK governments definition of being trafficed, and is another tally in the count of women 'trafficed' to the UK.

The truth that some people cannot see is that being a prostitute in the UK can, financially speaking, be a very good choice for many eastern European women. Some people just refuse to accept that women enter this profession out of choice. The fact is that prostitution is usually driven by economics rather than violence and intimidation.

The only reasons feminists in the UK government wish to ban prostitution in the UK are these:

1. Another way to criminalize law abiding men
2. Further criminalization of male sexuality
3. Increasing women's power by removing cheap sex from the market. For women sex has always been a huge bargaining chip.

c0phbc6,True,0,,t5_2qh61,"I am an ESL teacher (I teach adults at a local community college) and the short answer to your question is that there is no single answer to it.  Among linguists the prevailing wisdom is that English is easy to learn but very difficult to master --witness, for example, how few of us native-speakers are truly good at writing in English.  

But here's the thing, English is odd in a lot of ways.  On the one hand, gramatically it is simpler than all the other Germanic languages --with the exception of Afrikaans which is also gramatically stripped-down for similar historical reasons that I won't get into-- and in its modern form is much simpler than it once was (Old and Middle English were both more gramatically complicated), while on the other, it also has some very odd features like the progressive tenses and meaningless ""do"" that it borrowed from its Celtic neighbors and that have no corollary in any other Indo-European language.  

Virtually all of my students struggle with the progressives and meaningless ""do"" for the very good reason that as far as I know, they don't exist outside of English and the Celtic languages and the overwhelming majority of Celtic speakers are also native English speakers --the exception would be Breton, the few speakers of which are presumably native French rather than English speakers, but I've never had such a student and don't ever expect to.  (As an example, in answer to the question, ""what *are* you doing?"" --instead of ""what *do* you do?"" which is what you'd ask in any other language-- in English and the Celtic languages we say ""I *am* writing,"" instead of ""I write,"" which in English has a completely different connotation that is weird and to my students seems totally arbitrary, but they have to know it if they want to pass the TOEFL and go to university in the US.)

Another thing that sucks about English for learners is the spelling which, as you are no doubt aware, is very complicated and can only really be learned through memorization.  Most languages have a set of rules that govern how things are spelled such that if you know how to say a word, you'll have a pretty good idea of how to spell it.  For a variety of reasons that I won't get into --most of them have to do with quirks of history-- this is emphatically not true of English which has few consistent phonetic rules.  

A final personal observation is that for the most part people are highly unwilling to admit that their native language, or a language they have learned, is relatively easy.  I'm an exception; I speak decent Spanish and will tell you right now that it is a very easy and straightforward language to learn.  

Arabic is a great example, I think because people get confused by the fact that when we say ""Arabic,"" what we really mean is a group of languages that are at least as diverse as are the Latin or Romance languages.  In fact, linguists will tell you that basic Arab dialects are among the easiest languages there are, while knowing them all, as well as the classical Arabic in the Koran, is near impossible.  

Nevertheless, and despite the protestations of linguists, for the above reason Arabic is often considered difficult when in the grand scheme of major world languages, depending on how many dialects one wants to learn, on the scale of dificulty it's somewhere between English and Spanish and definitely not even close to Russian or Mandarin.  (Although it should be mentioned that if you already speak another East-Asian tonal language, Mandarin isn't that hard either.  Tonal languages are notoriously difficult for those who weren't raised to think of tone as imparting meaning, but for those who were, they are far less daunting.)

&gt;Today, the site still teems with 4,000 workmen on round-the-clock shifts. Banners from dozens of subcontractors around Europe flutter in the breeze above temporary offices and makeshift canteens. Some 10,000 people speaking at least eight different languages have worked at the site. About 30 percent of the workforce is Polish, and communication has posed significant challenges.

&gt;Areva has acknowledged that the cost of a new reactor today would be as much as 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, double the price offered to the Finns. But Areva said it was not cutting any corners in Finland. The two sides have agreed to arbitration, where they are both claiming more than 1 billion euros in compensation. (Areva blames the Finnish authorities for impeding construction and increasing costs for work it agreed to complete at a fixed price.)

&gt;Areva announced a steep drop in earnings last year, which it blamed mostly on mounting losses from the project.

&gt;In addition, nuclear safety inspectors in France have found cracks in the concrete base and steel reinforcements in the wrong places at the site in Flamanville. They also have warned Électricité de France, the utility building the reactor, that welders working on the steel container were not properly qualified.

&gt;On top of such problems come the recession, weaker energy demand, tight credit and uncertainty over future policies, said Caren Byrd, an executive director of the global utility and power group at Morgan Stanley in New York.

&gt;“The warning lights now are flashing more brightly than just a year ago about the cost of new nuclear,” she said.

&gt;And Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager at Olkiluoto, said, “We have had it easy here.” Olkiluoto is at least a geologically stable site. Earthquake risks in places like China and the United States or even the threat of storm surges mean building these reactors will be even trickier elsewhere.

I have always paid all my taxes, declared everything to the state. I work part-time in a second job to make a living - I teach SQL to the local technical institute of my town. I have never voted for the 2 dominant political parties of my country.
Since I graduated and finished my military duty, I've been working my ass off to make something in my life.
Now I have virtually nothing to do as there is no state money for public works and people in the private sector are too afraid to invest in constructing anything. Haven't been paid by the technical institute since November '09 (yes, that's right, I still live with my parents...).
The current economic crisis in Greece is mainly due to the lack of funds to pay the civil servants. We will borrow money from EU/IMF to save their asses and they are complaining about it. 3 bank clerks were killed yesterday after protesters threw Molotov bombs to their bank because it was still open - didn't participate to their strike. Initially, they wouldn't let the firefighters come close to the bank to put out the fire (they let them eventually, but it was too late - the 3 people suffocated).
Everyone here blames the EU, the IMF, Germany, USA, the banks, Bin Laden, Pinocchio, Super Goofy, Woody Woodpecker, etc. about our current situation - it's everyone's fault but ours.

Let me explain. Our discredited voting system garuantees a virtual hegemony between Labour and the Conservatives.

In our proportional European elections, they consistently gain the aforementioned vote share).     

What I'm trying to say is, if our voting system was fair, the Green Party should have something like 30-60 seats in our parliament.

It's pretty difficult to creat an offence, people will mock and joke and we don't need any PC to tell us what is funny and what is racist for example. Also, the whole pedophilia fear is new to me, parents don't get creeped out if a guy stops to chat with their kid or play with them a little. Also, the mix of cultures and races doesn't bother anyone. True that we don't have issues with mass immigration and the Burka. But we are an immigrant country, my family is Polish, Leebanese with some Portuguese in the mix. Though funnily, the poles are always the but of the jokes in the south too. I think the difference is that in Europe stereotypes are offensive whether in Brazil we mock them, embrace them and know they're not the reality. Apart from the Argentinians, we all hate the Argentinians ;)

2. Food, food, food. I love the food in Brazil and I miss it A LOT. I can get some in Geneva but in Brazil I normally have to import it. I put on loads of weight when I go visit because the food is delicious! I particularly love how everything is cooked from fresh, no microwaved vegetables or half baked chicken. Yummy.

3. Shopping and prices. There's plenty of shops and everything is relatively cheap, particularly electronics. The welfare system is amazing and I think the good national pride are cool too. The political awareness of many is also a really good thing.

4. Quality of life in general. Things are more expensive but people live well, eat well and pay for the quality of things. They are also very cultural, healthy people who enjoy being outside, going to expositions, museums, etc much more. I think the biggest proof of that is that celebrity culture is pretty much non existent here.

I personally didn't find that to be true at all. Most people speak English and though they don't make me speak French they encourage me with my little basic sentences, words and attempts at speaking. I found Parisians in particular to be the opposite, if you make the effort they'll give an exhasperated sigh and speak in an english which is just as bad as your french while thinking 'Stupid foreigners'.

The biggest for FPP is the workable majority. Being able to do something to solve problems is better than nothing generally I feel. I acknowledge that overly fractured governments are not a good thing when things are not accomplished and allegiances are made solely in the pursuit of power. 

I don't think it's accurate to suggest UKIP holding power in that way. True, it can lead to disproportionate power (although the current system allows for disproportionate power in favoour of con and lab) but Lib Dems will hold the balance. Looking at the BBC forecasts, Conservatives were short by a good 40 seats, which would not be enough for a coalition to be formed with the minority parties to. Lib dems might have 80 and there the balance of power lies. In this election, we will not have those allegiances-it will depend on the lib dems. I personally love the idea of the economic pragmatism of labour allied with the social progressiveness of Lib Dem. In any event, I don't think Conservatives would agree to withdrawals from Europe, even if it was just an example.

I can see the argument that the least offensive candidate could be favoured by STV, leading to dullness...however this need not necessarily be the case and in any event, in recent years the two main political parties have wanted broadly similar things and policy has been dull and generally a constant infringement of civil liberties.

On the party poltical issue, I agree...clearly those with the power to make the decision have very clear vested interests based on what would be good for them. However, the current system massively favours 2 parties and potentially allows governance with far less than 50% of the vote, which is hardly democratic. Political scientists already consider the issue and will be v. interested in the coming months although an independent body to press this through would be useful.

Although there is the potential for dull candidates are stagnant government, against my better judgment, I would trust the electorate to evolve with the system and learn to vote in a way which did not favour dullness. No other country in Europe uses FPP anymore and they manage to function fairly well.

There are reasons for FPP but I want a more democratic option that favours 3 party politics and encourages engagement by voters (as opposed to voting for the lesser evil/feeling votes are wasted).

The public sector accounts for a very large portion of GDP (~40%) and employment, and usually state jobs don't produce much surplus value (especially exportable value). This is a result of ""pro-voter"" policies over the past 30 years. 

At the same time, it's generally hard to start and run a business, mostly because of bureaucracy, administrative costs and uncertainty, so people are simply discouraged from enterpreneurship even when they have some capital set aside. Usually they spend it on assets such as real estate or consumer products/services. That's the same reason for the large amount of self-employed individuals, it's easier than starting a ""real business"" and there are (relatively) few corporate jobs. That also means that Greece is a bad environment for high risk, high added value activities (high-tech, manufacturing etc). Meanwhile there is still a lot of farmers, low tech industries, commodities etc, that are unsuitable for a western/first world economy. Value creation suffers on that front as well. 

So, in a way, yes, it's failure to modernise, especially since modernising the economy would change the status quo and put pressure various professional or social groups (farmers, unions etc). The government either backed down or avoided the issue altogether. Protecting various professional groups from new entrants also created a situation were there are people ""in the system"" and people ""out of the system"", who find it extremely hard to break through, even if they are qualified or capable.

Direct/ indirect taxes are on a par with other EU member states but the government (due to being the major economic driver for so long) has little available surplus value to tax. Note also that the balance of payments has been consistently negative for as long as I remember, meaning that there are more imports than exports. Income is being drained away, and the deficit covered by borrowing.

Unemployment is 10%-20% depending on how you decide to measure it. It's expected to rise (tons of lay-offs in the private sector lately)

The ""protesters"" are feeling betrayed by the government, not only for the austerity measures, but for the fact that the governments of the past 30 years led the country to the edge of bankruptcy and made it the laughingstock of the world. Their preferred solution is that ""the responsible must pay"", or ""those that stole the money"" etc but it doesn't go much further than that.  Most have been beneficiaries of state spending in some way, and usually in fairly reasonable contexts (if you look at it in a case by case basis).

The ""rioters"" on the other hand are kids who use the pretext of antiauthoritarianism to prolong their continuing feud with the police and just break stuff. Makes them feel good.

Try importing a European car to the US, you'll find it's not road legal over there, similar applies to Japan, Australia and any other large industrialised country we'd want to trade with.

We probably could get ourselves a little seat at the WTO, but without the backing of the EU, who the hell would listen to us?  We aren't important enough.

The only stupid thing about the UK and the EU is that the UK arrogantly imagined we didn't need to join because we had an empire, so when we did want to join they extracted fairly punitive terms out of us.

As I've elsewhere on this thread, the EU is flawed, and does need further reform, but to do that it actually needs to become more rather than less powerful.  I wrote a 20,000 word dissertation a decade ago on the expansion and further development of the EU, it's not like I haven't spent probably a lot longer than you thinking about it and an awful lot longer with my nose deep in turgid EU policy documents.

the EU has ensured that Europe has not had another industrialised continental war since the European Coal and Steel Community was formed with that aim as its expressed intention.

Unfortunately, it's dangerous nonsense, because of the privileged status we give religion out of respect for the spiritual is always exploited politically; especially by the two fascist religions of Christianity and Islam.

I refer in particular to his comments about how all bloodthirstiness and war-like behavior on our part ended in the West with the Middle Ages and ""we moved on"". Really?

You mean, like . . . we moved on to the Hundred Years War, the Napoleonic Wars, the War of the Roses, the Crimean War. (All of these wars happened AFTER the Middle Ages.)

African slavery happened *after* the Middle Ages, as well. As did imperial conquest of the planet [a la Spain in the New World, and the British Empire in Asia].

The Christian West did a whole lot of killing since the Middle Ages—culminating in the bloodiest century ever: the 20th Century.

I take it Bill Maher thinks Muslims started World War One and World War Two. Or that their body-count even remotely matches that of the West.

No, Mr. Maher, the Christian West didn't ""move on"" after the Dark Ages and get civilized while those dusky desert savages gave into their dark bloodlust. Statistically, their death-count isn't a fraction-of-a-fraction of a sliver of the West's.

I hope everyone is ready for this kind of volatility because thanks in large part to the designs of financial engineering it has become more a reality than fantasy. 

""buy and hold"" died when it became easy and affordable to short the market, which can easily be done with ETF through ProShares or Direxion funds, or any handful of funds. Now, who cares if the market goes up or down, so long as the trend is long enough to profit off of?

I was personally already positioned for a down trend with shorts on Europe and the VXX and saw them blow up from a mere 5.00% up today to 30%, settling around 15% up. Whereas long-term savers in 401ks have no such access to these investments, I can profit in any climate and get in and out of funds at the click of a mouse. 

The ""true"" value of a business does not matter to Mr. market and the traders do not care. ""A fool and his money is lucky enough to get together at all."" - GG. 

My advice to people is...learn the markets, get conservative, or find someone who does. Stuffing money in mutual funds that when coupled between expenses and fees rip 2-3% of your earnings right off the top in good or bad markets is sad. Most people that put such money into the market can ill afford to lose it, let alone come home from a hard day of work and see there savings shaved by 10-20% in one day, while guys on Wall Street made 500,000$ in one day using margin + leveraged etfs, etc.

You're not asserting that we've interbred with mice in the recent past, are you?

From this article:

from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_genetics

Human to human total genetic variation is approximately 0.5%. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single base-pair DNA differences accounting for 0.1% variation. Of this 0.1% difference, 85% is found within any given population, 7% is found between populations within a continent and only 8% is found on average between the various continental populations. Based on this observation, evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin has claimed that accurate racial classification of humans is impossible and can have no taxonomic utility.

Of course if you read the article you'll see different opinions on it, because there are scientists who want to spin it the same way you do, but no, nobody has been lying to me, the data is there and has been studied and analyzed.

Or maybe you left your hairs on the sink and you annoyed her or him?

So get some social skills and start communicating with your roommates about what you like and don't like.  And, while you're at it, why don't you try really listening to that Salsa music again, instead of just dismissing it as noise?

Anyway, you think it's okay for Mexicans to be nationalistic but not Americans? Jesus christ, how the fuck is wearing an American shirt blatantly nationalistic anyway? The simple act of wearing a shirt is somehow an affront on your beliefs? Get a fucking life if that's so because, honestly, this whole story makes me sick to my fucking stomach. 

The idea of multiculturalism and diversity--in the abstract--obviously don't bother me; how could they? I am, what thin-skinned liberals would call, an ""African-American"". However, the current conventional wisdom of leftist ideals in America don't call for any actual sort of egalitarian and harmonious representation of races and ethnicities, but rather an implementation of a Marxist narrative within the so-called ""subjugated culture"", telling them to in turn subjugate their oppressor. I'll get to the hypocrisy of this notion later on.

Now, you will notice--in the video--that girl says, ""This is a Mexican holiday! We would not wear Mexican shirts on Independence Day, how dare they offend us by wearing American flag shirts on Cinco De Mayo!"" But this whole notion is just utterly ridiculous, not to mention fleetingly subjective. No one is saying that Cinco De Mayo is wrong and shouldn't be celebrated, no one is trying to strip the Mexicans of their culture, but yet they still assume the position of the victim: why is that? Why is it that despite going to going to an American school funded by American tax dollars, learning about subjects mandated through the American Department of Education whilst wearing clothes and other products they bought with American currency from American stores, from which they managed to be transported by some type of American transportation system, whether it be bus or car, to and from home, school and the mall, why is it that they still assume the position of the victim? When and where, in this school, were these proud Mexican-Americans subjugated and stripped of their right to appreciate their important Mexican holiday? And with all that said, how does the symbol of everything that they now possess; freedom, liberty, and economic mobility; somehow present an aberration in regard to what they presume to be important, old-world nationalist sentiments?

That girl they interview say it's disrespectful for kids to wear clothes with American flags on them because it is a Mexican holiday today. Never mind the fact that we do in fact live in America, but what about the holidays of any other ethnic group: would wearing an American flag shirt be ""disrespectful"" on Yom Kippur? How about St. Patrick's Day? God forbid if you don't wear green on St. Patrick's Day, don't these people know that if you don't wear green on St. Patrick's Day that you're disrespecting the....Irish. I'm not making a slippery slope argument, I'm just merely pointing out the arbitrary and blunt manner in which this order was executed. If you think this event today is anything but a ridiculous ship of ignorance riding on the glorious wave of white guilt, then I believe you might want to consult with your doctor about a possible chromosome count.

I've already talked about why it's inherently irrational and hypocritical to support the nationalism of one group but not the other, especially when group-X is a victim of circumstance and group-Y has some members who believe they're being subjugated but actually aren't. When you distill the current situation regarding America and ""multiculturalism"", what we have are schools which are receiving a high influx of students from other countries, and instead of the students remembering where they came from and vis a vis embracing an America which is more than happy to take them in, thereby creating an enriching experience for all of us, the new students think they can just create Mexico in this new area. But they aren't in Mexico anymore, they're in California. As the old song goes, this land was made for you and me, okay? That means if I wear my American flag shirt, you don't come up to me and say, ""Excuse me sir, but that's very disrespectful"". It's like if I were in France during the month of July, and when July 4th came around, I see someone near the Eiffel Tower wearing a Francois shirt and I scold them for being disrespectful towards me, an American, who is very proud of his culture, or whatever. How ridiculous would that be? Or even more germane, if I'm going to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, and I'm in a class that is 60% American and 40% British and Australian, and Flag Day comes around and 2 of the Blokes are wearing British flag shirts. ""Well how dare you disrespect this honorable American holiday, you should be wearing AMERICAN flags!"" Now imagine if more and more Americans were going over to Europe, and causing this sort of fuss...

I agree that nationalism is sort of antiquated, but it's just so...surreal...that you people honestly believe that wearing a SHIRT that happens to have a certain symbol on it, an accepted symbol in the country's canon, could have a harmful effect on someone else.

Investors currently see everything European as being too risky.

Thinking about all of that, if Europe stays in crisis mode for a while, which everything indicated that it will, then we'll continue to see money get ripped out of that continent and placed in anything that is safer. Gold will probably make further gains tomorrow, closing at a record high. What does this mean for the U.S.? It means we're safe for now. But once Europe is resolved and money starts going back in to their markets, then the strength of the dollar will come more into question.

The practice alternates some chants with a meditation that teaches you to ""send"" your consciousness through the top of your head.

Whether you believe in Phowa or not, the point is to teach you what to do when you are dying, and to teach you how to recognize the signs of death.

Naked shorting is prohibited in the United States. Initially the SEC required deliveries (the borrowed stock) to arrive within 3 days of the short, so you could naked short for up to 3 days. In 2005, the SEC prohibited naked shorting - those going short have to identify or borrow the stock to be sold, with a few exceptions. In 2008 the SEC issued stronger regulations removing some of the exceptions.

Many other countries have similar prohibitions. Off the top of my head, I think India, Australia, Japan, and a handful of countries in Europe. That isn't to say naked shorting never happens, but that it is much less frequent within these countries, and poses much less of a problem.

Yet another arrogant redditor who thinks they know exactly what happened in Greece. 

Firstly, Greece and Enron have a lot in common. 
For one, they both enjoyed (I hope past tense is the correct form in relation to Greece) a culture of corruption. 
Greece did enjoy a long period of economic growth, however it did not have the framework or foundation to deal with a modern-economic system. So not only were businesses, individuals and governments prone to corruption already; they were practically invited to carry it out by the lack of proper reporting and assurance measures. 
I might add, while the EU continues to bitch about Greek corruption; German companies, amongst others, like Daimler-Benz and Siemens saw fit to take advantage of it, offering bribes to secure sales. 

Your point about taxation doesn't stand because governments budget their spending based on revenue, revenue comes from taxation and if the budget comes up short because of tax evasion - the government has less money to pay back loans than they budgeted for.
Also, the shortfalls compound. For example if a wholesaler buys X for 80€ from a Greek company then sells it to a retailer for 100€ who then sells it to a customer for 120€ and we assume VAT of 10%, the Government loses: 8€  + 10€ + 12€. Tax credits are ignored because if you claim the credit, the income is implied, when most Greeks simply leave it out of the books entirely. So the Government have high uncertainly in forecasting for the budget. 

However, I will concede that this is the Government's fault for allowing corruption to continue and not implementing proper measures such as audits to create a more stable and secure economic environment. I will also concur that the major cause for the crisis is exceed borrowing by Greece over the past 15 years. 
But do not forget that other major factors are at play, for example: 

* the existent of somewhat militant worker unions who must be appeased to get elected
* a long culture of corruption
* tax evasion
* cronyism 
* over-sized public sector
* excessive military spending (IMO)
* tendency to lose the best people to other nations (brain-drain). 

Greece needs to do some belt-tightening over the next 5 years and starting making massive structural reforms to the finance, banking and taxation sectors.

Thing is, and I say this as someone who has lived in poverty for years (largely by choice), much that makes poverty injurious in this country is a function of poor choices made by those in poverty.  Rich white people aren't forcing my white and black and hispanic neighbors to buy ridiculous things on credit or do drugs.  Rich white people don't force my neighbors to smoke cigarettes and gamble.  Rich white people didn't make any of my neighbors stop attending school or have children outside of marriage.  So it's great that Wise helped defeat David Duke and it's great that he educates people about part of history, but what actually helps people isn't promoting class warfare or a neo-Marxist agenda.  Furthermore, those called poor in America aren't poor in an absolute sense, only a relative one.  I'm poor, yet have central air conditioning, high speed internet, two vehicles, abundant choices in food, access to amazing natural resources...  There aren't many poor people in America when you consider how most of the world lives and the fact that a poor person in the U.S. today lives better than just about any king or queen of previous centuries.  
 
He's seriously misguided when it comes to the issue of illegal immigration if he doesn't think that capital expoloits illegals to keep wages below their normal level.  There's a reason Cesar Chavez and his allies kept illegal aliens out of California.  Yes, the rich would not gladly give up profits to pay better, but I've experienced firsthand the effects of a glut of easily exploited labor depressing wages in the construction industry in southern California.  Capital and goods do flow over the border, but work done on homes still has to be done on site.  How do rich people avoid paying decent wages when they can't outsource the labor?

This doesn't change what we've already discussed.

&gt; No, Neanderthals sites have only ever been found outside Africa.

You misunderstood what I said.  I said how do we know those genomic sequences weren't from a common ancestor of Neaderthals and humans.  You said those genomic sequences are not found in Africa but were in non-Africa, implying that the non-Africa humans got them from Neaderthal.  Again, I'm suggesting those genomic sequences were being eliminated in both Africa and non-Africa humans, but intermingling with Neaderthals in non-Africa helped keep them around.  This doesn't mean those sequences could not still have originally come from a previous common ancestor.

&gt; These findings just show that some of the diversity in non African populations was from Neanderthals - there are plenty of genes in non African populations that don't exist in African populations.

And again, those genomic sequences could have been eliminated from Africans specifically because of unique environmental pressures.  If gene A is found in Asians and Europeans, but not Africans, we don't conclude that gene A is from Asians and Europeans must have gotten it from them; instead we conclude that gene A was originall in Africans, passwed down to Asians and Europeans, and later eliminated in Africans.

I know the genetic map is far more complicated than this, so I'm not trying to overly simplify the issue.  And I entirely believe Neaderthals interbred with us.  I'm simply trying to understand why other explanations for the small commonality in genomic sequences in Neaderthals and humans isn't possible.

To look at it from another perspective, how do we know the Neaderthals didn't get those genetic sequences from the non-Africans?  Again, those genetic sequences could have developed unique to non-Africans, and then given to Neaderthals from us.

That is not how sexual selection/evolution works, populations are not
linked that way - if a genetic change works for whatever reason, it
stays in the population.

No - if Asians and Europeans have a gene and Africans did not, there
is no proof to say that Africans *ever* had that gene unless a deletion
point can be found.

Asians and Europeans come from a small African population that under
went sexual selection and other changes - these pressures were not
on the African population.

Because real free trade, which the EU is trying to obtain, requires supranational political control. Creating an inner market simply isn't possible without.

When people say they like the idea of an EU as a free market, but don't like the political system it has become, they're saying that they want to have the cake and eat it too.

You can google his name.

As for why the people he has met glorify aggression and violence, well isn't that what you assume to find amongst violent criminals? When I grew up the skinhead subculture was very popular, and they took pride in aggressiveness and violence, was it their Protestant, European upbringing that made them like that? Of course not. 

I believe most criminals come from broken backgrounds, in what way can vary wildly, sexual abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse in the family and so on. I don't believe that this must be the case for every violent criminal, I think that some where brought up in a loving, caring environment but they went wrong anyway. But I do think that a broken upbringing is a quantifying mechanism to explain most criminals choices. 

As for honor culture, saving face and so on, I think this is a component in all cultures, but some people from certain cultures like to think of themselves as being above such ideas. I have not met any person that when insulted did not react with anger, given that the reaction can take different expressions. From red faced storming out of a room, to violence. I have seen this range of reactions amongst both white and brown people, those with Christian background and those with Muslims background. What is a grave insult do vary between cultures, but in my experience most people do react with anger when insulted regardless of background.

Further I think that the lower on the society's ladder a person is situated the more likely he is to react aggressively when he perceives that he is oppressed. 

And after that mass of text I will address your specific question. Firstly there is no one Muslim culture, but just as for instance most Europeans have been shaped to some extent by Christians values, so have most people from Muslim countries. You can't even say Arabic culture, or Pakistani culture and so on. The Arab Algerian culture is very different from an Arab culture from Saudi Arabia. Even within a single country, like for most of the North African countries, there are several ethnic groups and cultures. 

As for anger in islam:
Abu Hurairah, radiyallahu 'anhu, reported that a man said to the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam:
""Advise me! ""The Prophet said, ""Do not become angry and furious."" The man asked (the same) again and again, and the Prophet said in each case, ""Do not become angry and furious."" 
http://fortyhadith.iiu.edu.my/hadith16.htm

Allah ta3ala says: “Those who spend (in Allah’s cause) in prosperity and in adversity, who repress their anger, and who pardon men, verily, Allah loves the al-Muhsinun (the good-doers).”
[Surah Al-Imran (3) : Ayah 133-134]

In another hadith, Abu Hurairah related that the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, said:

""A strong person is not the person who throws his adversaries to the ground. A strong person is the person who contains himself when he is angry."" [Al-Bukhari; Book 47, No. 47.3.12]

And from the du'a (supplications) of the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam:

""I ask you O Allah, for truthful speech during times of pleasure and anger"" [Nasaai and Ahmad]
As for pride in Islam:

Allah ta3ala says: “I shall turn away from My revelations those who show pride in the world wrongfully.” (7.146)

Muhammad (SAWS) said: [“The one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Paradise.”] 

He (SAW) was asked: “[But] O Messenger of Allaah! A man likes to have fine clothing and footwear. Is this included in Kibr?” He responded, “No. Allaah is Beauty and loves Beauty. Kibr is the rejection of truth (Batrul-Haqq) and condescension of others (waa ghaamtun-naas).” [Muslim]

Maybe. I personally believe that the parties who started and supported the killing in Iraq are uncivilised and do not deserve a place in civilised discourse.

If major parties stop starting new wars and address urgent and important domestic issues (such as immigration, the European Union, etc…) then maybe people would not feel the need to vote for the BNP.

The fact that I was making generalized comparisons to each of the *political entities* in Europe as a whole is something that any sensible reader could infer.

Add to that simple inference the fact that, as I've already discussed, when Americans refer to ""Europe"" in a political context, they are usually making generalizations about either:

* The Big 4: the U.K., Germany, France, Italy
* Western Europe: Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the U.K. etc.
* Western and Eastern Europe: with some notable exceptions this would roughly correspond to the members of the E.U.

In most discussions of European politics, Russia is not included as a member of that ""scene"".  They certainly have a long history of influence in European politics, but also of being sidelined and of excluding themselves.  Similarly, they cannot be classified as a member of the Asian poltical spectrum or the Middle Eastern political spectrum, even though they are half in Asia and have had much influence in both regions.  *Politically*, Russia is its own region that straddles three *geographic* regions.

My *main* point was that population density creates political and social liberalism.  This is such a nitpicking tangent about *geography*: I don't know why you are so obsessed with it.

As a *supporting* point (not a ""main point""), I was trying to illustrate that in any *arbitrary* slice of Europe, you will find more people in any *arbitrary* larger slice of the United States.  How you define Europe doesn't matter to my ""main point"" because, however you want to redefine or nitpick my statement, the supporting point that there are more people in less space still stands.

Finally, I have explained to you that, no matter what the technical definitions of Europe are, geographically or politically, *I* was not referring to Russia when I was speaking of Europe, and I was not speaking of Europe as a geographic entity either.  I was, in fact, referring mostly to *the individual countries* of Western Europe (as a generalized whole), and, to a lesser extent, the Eastern European countries.  That is to say: take any *single* European nation and compare it to any random, similarly-sized but slightly larger sample portions of the U.S., and you will generally find more people in the European nation.  Now do this for all of the European nations and you will find that this generally holds true for each nation.  Now we can generalize this, for simplicity's sake, to just ""Europe"".

I have already conceded to you that, from a strictly geographic standpoint, Europe is indeed, barely, larger in land area than the United States, even including Alaska.  What more do you want?

Now that you understand *what I intended* when I wrote *my own post*, then perhaps you can focus on whether the reasoning makes sense, and not worry about how our definitions of Europe differ.

Having a system that promotes coalition governments creates an environment where people have to get used to negotiating deals with wider public support, or perish.

------------

Overview of main British parties for you. It's late and I'm not going to be overly specific, so anyone feel free to criticise/correct any of this please. I've tried to be impartial, but this is also probably biased towards my own left-wing views, so take that into account.

LABOUR - current ruling party, has been in power since 1997. They are supposed to be centre-left, but have been drifting rightwards since the past election, and now some (not all) would argue that they are centrist, or even (slightly!) right wing. Historically, they are the socialist party, and stand up for working class rights, and the power of trade unions. They are centrist, and stand between the social justice of the left and the fiscal conservatism of the right. They are deeply unpopular after taking us to war, presiding over the recession, and choosing an uncharismatic and widely disliked leader, and came in second in the election. 

CONSERVATIVES (AKA TORIES) - I guess your standard conservative party - though a hell of a long way more sane than the republicans - and the main opposition to the ruling Labour government. They tend to believe in private industry as superior to state control, for example they privatised the (previously nationalised) railway system, and are in favour of bringing in some measure of privatisation into the NHS. They are 'tougher' on crime than the other 2 mainstream parties, and are in favour of somewhat tougher immigration controls (though see UKIP/BNP below). Came first in the election, but didn't get enough seats to have a majority. Politically, roughly the same as the Democrats.

THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS - Our mainstream left-wing party. They are in favour of large tax cuts for the poor and better public services, funded by substantial tax hikes for the most wealthy. They are seen as lenient on crime, wanting to abolish prison sentences of less than 6 months in favour of rehab/counselling, and are in favour of some drug legalisation. They were also the only party to oppose the Iraq war. They have historically been the third of the three parties, and normally get ~25% of the vote (but have been making gains in recent years). They also get a very small amount of actual power, due to the vagaries of the British voting system - they were expected to have a record amount of support, and in fact lost seats. 

UKIP (UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY) - A less mainstream, more right-wing party. Essentially based around the idea that the UK should not be part of the European Union, and should go independent. In favour of tough crime sanctions, and essentially stopping all immigration. Obviously I'm showing my biases here, but they are generally regarded as a somewhat 'racism-lite' party by some, and don't have much support. Didn't get any seats. 

GREEN PARTY - A less mainstream, more left-wing party. Historically just ran on an environmental ticket, but have recently reformed into a super-progressive, social justice party. In favour of making the NHS even cheaper (so we don't even have to pay ~£7 for prescriptions), and substantially increasing the minimum wage to ~£8 p/h. Kind of a 'hippy party', I guess. Won their first seat ever this election.

BNP (BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY) - Far right, pretty unashamedly racist party. IN favour of 'financial incentives' to encourage all non-whites to go back to their country of origin, stopping all immigration into the country (even for skilled workers), support the repealing of human rights legislation and anti-discrimination laws. Also want to bring back capital punishment for murder and rape, and corporal punishment in schools. Wants Christianity to play a big part in the public school system. Fucking nutjobs, in other words.

Did I once say that the Iranian government was moral and just? No, so you can take that entire argument and shove it up your completely dishonest arsehole. 

The election results correspond fully to the demographic make up of Iran. The protesters were at their largest still a very very small fraction of the population. Deal with it. The same happened in the US in 2000, lots of people weren't happy with the result. Ditto 2008 where protesters are still demanding birth certificates two years later.

Now, imagine the tea party protests if spun to be genuine political unrest. Imagine how Iranian state TV might report it. Can you see how piss-easy it is to do this? And you fell for it, lulz. I bet you believed Saddam had WMD, in fact I bet you **posted it in bold all over the place** back then like you did above.

All of what I'm saying is well documented. Deal with it.

&gt; You know those videos you've seen, of crowds of people running down the streets of Tehran in the post election riots, while at the same time isolated passer-bys were randomly massacred? 

Yes, and I linked you three separate videos of the same thing happening in Europe within the last 12 months. What's your point?

When crowds start throwing petrol bombs the police break out the tear gas and live ammo. You don't need to be a rocket scientist work that out. 

&gt; I have friends who were in that crowd.

I too have been a part of such crowds. Why were your friends down their risking their lives while you were giving armchair commentary? What does that make you?

Tell your friends that if they want to avoid heavy handed government responses in future, try to cut back on the incendiary attacks on the police, m'kay? There's a reason Gandhi got results while Timothy McVey went to prison behind a failed cause. 

The problem in Iran was that the US government was given official mandate in 2007 to create unrest in Iran, so they encouraged the protesters to be violent. They distributed mobile phones and fed people with false information to make them riot. They fucked over your friends to make the whole country look bad on TV for our benefit. USA! USA! USA!

Except that in civilized countries what it *actually* means is that the governing party will instead realize it can't just write laws without paying attention to people other than their own voters,  and so have to consult people and propose legislation that actually has support of the representatives of the majority of voters. That is a *good* thing for democracy, even if it means nobody will be perfectly happy.

&gt; The current problem for the Labout government is that the maths doesn't quite work out for them... to get a majority, they actually need to form a coalition with several other parties. To find consensus between several parties is very difficult, compared with finding consensus between two parties.

It's not as bad as it sounds. SNP and Plaid Cymru find a Conservative government unthinkable, and SNP have good experience at working with Labour. Unless Sinn Fein take up their seats, SNP + Plaid is all Labour needs on top of the Lib Dems. If Sinn Fein take up their seats, it'd be unthinkable for them to support the Conservatives. Labour can also pretty much assume support from SDLP + likely one independent unionist. Overall, on top of the Lib Dems they'd just have to make some minor concessions to SNP, Plaid and/or SDLP to cement support.

We'll see - who knows how far Cameron might bend over for the Lib Dems to prevent them from going to Labour.

&gt; It is important that a hung parliament is resolved quickly so there is strong leadership in the country;

They form blocs which vote for legislation other people want so that they will vote for theirs in return.

They vote so often most of the legislation goes unread by the whole.

No, it's fundamentally different.  Each of the 27 members nominates a commissioner who is then appointed.  They are not MEPs.

One of the most important jobs in Europe is the trade commissioner; both Karel de Gucht, Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Peter Mandelson before her got the job by either stepping down from their own governments amid scandal or by *losing* an election!

Tony Blair appointed her to the House of Lords, Gordon Brown appointed her to Head of the House of Lords (where she helped pass the Lisbon Treaty) and then she was appointed High Representative of Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of the Commission.

You might get the odd person appointed into a national government cabinet as posts are created but it will always be filled in the main with elected officials.  It's actually a point of current controversy and lack of depth when an elected parliamentarian isn't promoted, as an elected official is more accountable.  The opposite is true in the commission.

The fact is that most acorns do not become trees, most eggs do not become chickens, most silk worms do not make silk for dresses, and most human conceptions do not become humans. And the last is not because of abortion, but because of miscarriage of fertilized eggs prior to women even knowing they are pregnant. Further, most ""young"" of all species do not survive to adulthood to also reproduce. 

This was true of human infants prior to the last 100 years and is still true in some places, due to disease, starvation and, in still-extant human cultures, differential investment in offspring (e.g., infanticide, through abandonment or withholding of care rather than outright killing, which was still common in Europe, even a few hundred years ago). Many infants were sent to wet-nurses or given to Foundling Homes, where infant mortality was as high as 95%. 


The reproductive strategies of most life forms include overproduction of potentials with very few becoming new individuals. 


Primate females of all kinds, including humans and with the blessings of cultures, have evolved to make differential investment in offspring based on multiple factors, including maternal, infant, social, and environmental conditions. There are male primate species in which males have evolved to stalk and kill infants they could not have sired. There are extant human cultures in which warring tribes kidnap females and kill their young nursing children in order to allow ovulation, so as to promote pregnancy with the kidnapping males' offspring. Rape in wartime is not new.

Especially in Greece, I see the potential for free market groups, through existing unions and work force to take direct control of food, housing and other standard of living industries at the very least and start producing for themselves, essentially excluding the weakening state and those who would hold those resources hostage from society.

That is what I thought was going to happen in Greece back in 2008. Iceland has done a more impressive job of this. Their strike on the banks by refusing to pay mortgages by 1/4 of its population was a productive move that had and still may have the potential for real change. Greece however, is going to play out in a daunting and predictable fashion.

The EU will have no choice but to bail them out in an effort to save their Euro that they are all tied into. Eventually, they will get their social programs back, and what could have been something great will go down in history as a scary hiccup that was resolved thanks to the great and benevolent state. The EU will find a european version of Ben Bernanke to credit for ""saving the economy"" through the state and a centralized bank.

Taking advantage of anything that the state provides will only give it a reason to keep on existing, and perpetuate the myth that the people can't live without it.

That being said, since the Greek government does exist, it makes me wonder why social programs are being cut at such a hard economic time for its people. Surely they didn't have to cut spending all across the board. why then should these be the ones to go? I am not sure how the greek government spends their money, but I have a hunch that there are other ways to cut back on spending that do not involve cutting benefits for the poor.

I am Siim Tuisk, aka luuletaja, check the facebook, small photo album is public and also in orkut and etc. Matude is designer, www.matude.com, albeit unfinished gives some ideas about his previous work experience. We would be willing to take the full public inquiry and willing to foot the bill for the corp(750 $ or llc 275$) or what legal system shall be decided upon, give full info disclosure and id and background checks. We would set up the system for email and Reddit account verification for following members and then if you still trust us you could donate to Matude's paypal and be part of it. Now, I understand that the fact that we are from Eastern/Northern Europe, Estonians and brothers will ring many bells but you would not be risking with anything before its set up, and after that you have the full idea, what you would be supporting, if at all. Also, the extarnal and internal systems can be different, ie, we may look to the outside as a corp, but are inside more like co-op, with majority voting and trying to achieve consensus and etc This is an idea, a proposal, to be discussed and voted on.
So after the mission statement voting, we could do this.

There would be database for info gathering among the members, recording their specific wants and skill sets and they will be encouraged to join the research committees so they plus SC can deal with the plans and problems ahead of us.

 
There wont be any kind of stakes given out or financial reimbursement later on for the 10 $, this is purely for the setting up of the organization and should there be more donations than needed, the amount will be transferred to the organization back account.

I live in Europe so I am active in transatlantic council and it helped me keep in touch with the american side of me. Not to mention the resume benefits.

As far as Atheists and Homosexuals not being allowed you can blame the Mormon church. the Mormon church uses scouting as the activity branch of their religion. I think statistics say that somewhere near 1 in 3 scouts is mormon. The mormon church gave an ultimatum saying that if they were not barred they would split off and start their own organization, not something an already shrinking orginization can handle.

It seems I am not bright enough, so can you clarify this for me.
Does this mean that if country has any threat thoughts it might act as it wants and all its actions are justified?
I mean, if we look at the level of threats and justification, well the USSR won the prise of All Saints. Where Vietnam is on the map and where Afghanistan is? What do you know about narcotraffic and the USSR borders? What do you know about radical movements there? Have you heard about the number of civilian buildings and factories built by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan? (Hint:Hundreds) Do you know any numbers which can tell us what has the United States built besides military bases and bridges between them?

About Georgia:
Georgia attacked peacekeepers base and killed 69 soldiers, not talking about shelling the city. Well It gets even better, here we have just 100 hundred percents of justification!

Question: What do you know about the first Georigan-Abhkasian war or Georgian-Osetian war? Are they justified?

&gt;I agree that US policy towards the Middle East

Middle East only, right? So serbia's bombings in Europe trying to cover president sex scandal is okay?

&gt;If Saddam remained in power, the costs would have been devastating.
&gt;it was moral.

The crusaders killing the infidels can't be wrong, yep? They have that special Moral standarts.

BTW, Saddam was convicted to death for that case of killing 200 hundreds people with gas. But there is no single evidence that he sanctioned this. As I remember the US changed his judge about 4 times. The last one who sentenced him, has run to England after the process. Talking about moral standarts. Talking about WMD. Talking about moral standarts. Talking about torture.
It is like, i don't know. Ah! Catholics can rape children, they have standarts for god's sake! I don't know, enlighten me.

Am I right?
Humanity has elites that hire special people to justify their deeds. Those people work for money, they tell people that moral and what is not. The masses listen to them and then write on the forums about moral deeds and justification of bad ones.

Is it moral to invade country on false evidences and sentence to death ""seems bad dictator"", killing hundred times more, blowing up a region, provoking religion war, justifing all those actions by the statement that it could be worse?

&gt;Russia was the aggressor in South Ossetia, not Georgia,

Such movements look back to the Caliphate as the last era of Middle Eastern political self-determination, and look on the establishment of an Islamic rule as the only sure indication that Western influence has been expunged.  To that end, the more contrary to Western ideals a given cultural practice appears to be, the more the Islamists can trumpet it as the return of an authentic Middle and Far Eastern political culture.  Hence the elevation of the burqa/niqab from an isolated cultural practice to an emblem of Islam.  Hence also the opposition to equality, liberty and the rationalist tradition -- all of which have, at different periods, emerged in Islamic society independently of European influence, but which, because they are now claimed as part of the ""Western tradition"" are opposed as an act of cultural and political defiance.

The Maya creation date, which corresponds to the Western date August 13, 3114 B.C.E."" (Lynn V. Foster, Life in The Ancient Maya World (2002), p. 172). Our creation is the fourth creation in the line. Now there's nothing saying that or how this world will end. The Popol Vuh merely states that the past creations have been destroyed by (if I can remember correctly, it was many many years since I read the Popol Vuh, and I don't presently have it at home, if I could be fucked I'd look through The Chilaam Balaam of Chumayel, but I can't so, there you go...)

Kenyon's comments about them going being the biggest club in the world by 2014 rankled with many people.

Japan for the first time, you lucky thing. I have been maybe 40 times and its still my favourite place in the world. I've done a lot of things and rate the following as highlights. Im sure you will find your own.
In Tokyo: Stay in the homeikan Ryokan in Taito - its relatively cheap and lets you see an amazing place, kind of like a hobbit house - its a traditional Japanese hotel
Go to harajuku on Sunday and cruise around, amazing place to see youth trends of tomorrow. Good place for your birthday - funky restarants and great fashion.
Cosplayers on the bridge near the ueno train station, take a walk into the park near there and see the temple
Go to kiddyland toyshop and Oriental bazaar near Harajuku to buy gifts and funky stuff for yourself.
Visit the national gallery in ueno park - samurai armour, amazing artwork. Marvel at how sophisticated Japan was when the europe was in the dark ages Go to the fish market early and have sushi there. It will be the best you will have in your life
Near tokyo Go to Nikko and take in the shrines and the original three wise monkeys. Stay at the turtle inn with hot baths fed by natural vocanic springs
See the big Buddha (Daibatsu) at Nara and look into the face of god
A bit further away Go to Kyoto and visit Ryonaji, the famous stone garden (I've returned to this place 5 times and each time I see something different in it), also do the philosophers walk and go to the temple of Inari the fox god
If you want to get really off the beaten path go to shikoku and see the island which is devoted to art, west of osaka. You wont see any westerners but you will see kleins, pollocks, manets etc in a purpose built gallery, plus whole villages given over to experimental art. Its mind blowing
See the giant octopi and giant spider crabs at the osaka aquarium. These things live at great depths, so I dont know how they keep them alive in the aquarium. The spider crabs are 5 feet accross
Stay in a zen monastry at koyasan. Get up at 5 am and join the monks in zazen
Go to Hiroshima and go to the museum, be sobered as you see railway tracks tangled like spaghetti and the shadow of a human vapourised on a wall
But mostly, be prepared to go back, it is the most amazing place on earth.

Antanta invasion. Most of the capitals fled to foreign lands and West is highly agressive towards you. You have a militaristic Japan on one part of the country and  nazi's Germany on the other. You know that Britain and France without blink in the eye allowed Germany to occupy Sudetenland. You know that Britain and US are feeding germany economy. You know that if you are attacked your country is still most agrary one and not ready to defend.

And how about spy data about all those german activity in Caucasus, how about Italy, Hungary, Romania and France. The whole Europe fell to Hitler's hands without significant efforts. One third of the forces which invaded Soviet Union in june-july of 41 weren't German. It was countries allied with Germany.

It is clear that communists were his mortal enemies and the pact was some temporal form of tricking Stalin. Maybe those hundreds kilometers of Polish land have bought hundred thousands lives of Belorussian and Ukrainian people, it bought some additional time for regrouping and evacuating. So how can we name them allies if we know that 85% of nazi's forces there destroyed by the Soviet Union. 8 of 10 axis soldiers were killed by the soviet soldiers. Little country Georgia lost more soldiers than the US and Britain together.

It is not secret. At all. But nobody needs it. Is it obvious? Who needs some alien heroes? It is better make some monsterous sensation in case of Stalin and make some TV show and write a book.

Following massive detentions by the British and huge numbers of Kikuyu deaths - mostly from British soldiers and their African loyalist homeguards - the Mau Mau was a major contributor to moves for Kenyan independence. By the end of the rebellion, the British had taken the lives of over 11,000 rebels and detained around 100,000 people under force - in contrast with 200 Europeans and 2,000 Britain-loyal Africans lost lives. Many of the Kikuyu leaders including Jomo Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Kung'u Karumba were imprisoned for lengthy period by the colonialists. Other prominent non-Kikuyu personalities who ere imprisoned include Ochieng Oneko (Luo) and Paul Ngei (Kamba) The Mau Mau war is considered to be the first great African liberation movement and probably the most grave crisis of Britain's African colonies.

I'm from Europe (Croatia) and I went to a four year high school. I was at home for six months during the third year. I finished it in time with the rest of my class mates. all the teachers kinda met me half way and I had exams for the whole six months I missed. the second half of the third year I attended classes as well as the whole fourth year. I worked for a year after my high school graduation and finished two years of university after that while working. 

&gt; How much help did you get from your family?

I got a lot of help from my parents even though they were shocked after they found out about the pregnancy. my mom took care for the baby while I was in school, and they paid for most of the stuff my daughter needed. I did work at a gas station washing windows for a month before she was born so I also gave some money and purchased a crib but the rest was up to them.

&gt;I have a family member who went through this. Her kid is now in his 30s and in a successful career. It worked out well. I hope everything goes well for your baby too. :)

The thing is that the Soviet Union and the the US were in cold war. For the the US it was a comparable showcase and a chance to prick the soviets. the US has the Gold Standart, they didn't suffer from war, but the half of the SU was destroyed. All the capitals fleed to the US. So I even don't know how we can compare something there. And it is not topic of our discussion, but we can see that such brutal shallow comparement had its effect on you.

Secondly, as I said, having those countries was some kind of obligatory trouble. What do you expect after such terrible war? Leave those countries, so the states can place rocket shafts and military bases there? 17 million of innocent soviet people were killed during the war! What they will do if Hitler-2 will appear on the horizon? Those countries will never be defending themselves. They gladly welcome new conquerer and walk with him to the east to get some piece for themselves. Do you have any thoughts on that? The United states still has a military base in Germany and in Japan, so  what about are we talking here? Though, I can't exclude the statement that Soviet regime could slow down their development but on the other hand look at them now after 20 years. Do you see any other picture?
