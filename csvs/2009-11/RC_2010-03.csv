before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the
earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the miraculous recovery
which followed. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a
friendship between us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that great man
of laughter burst into tears.   
     
Letter from Twain: 
    
&gt; Dear Mr. Tesla –
    
&gt; Have you Austrian &amp; English patents on that destructive terror which
you are inventing? - &amp; if so, won’t you set a price upon them &amp; commission
me to sell them? I know cabinet ministers of both countries - &amp; of
Germany, too; likewise William II.
    
&gt; I shall be in Europe a year, yet.
Here in the hotel the other night when some interested men
were discussing means to persuade the nations to join with the Czar &amp;
disarm, I advised them to seek something more sure than disarmament
by perishable paper-contract – invite the great inventors to contrive
something against which fleets &amp; armies would be helpless, &amp; thus
make war thenceforth impossible. I did not suspect that you were
already attending to that, &amp; getting ready to introduce into the earth permanent
peace &amp; disarmament in a practical &amp; mandatory way.
I know you are a very busy man, but will you steal time to drop
me a line?

Some old guy with an European accent who says that he absolutely adores the ""vitality"" of a 1982 Bordeaux? So is their opinion, in this taste test or any other one, the be-all-end-all truth in wine? Not in the slightest.

The truth is, in the wine world, taste is so subjective and it is hard to say that anyone is truly an expert. Yes, there are experienced tasters out there but that is it--they are just folks who have happened to taste more wine than the rest of us.

Now the caveat, while it is true that the subjectivity of taste is certainly influenced by people's perceptions (i.e. If someone tells you this is suppose to be a great wine, you're likely to think it is), that doesn't mean there is not a difference between a $5 Cabernet and a First Growth Bordeaux. There is a difference in how the wine feels on your mouth, the number of different aromas you can pick out, how long you seem to taste the wine in your mouth after you swallow, etc. For some people, those differences may ring their bells more than it would for someone who doesn't care about those difference. If you're just drinking something for a buzz, you're not going to care if one wine has several layers of aromas. But that is alright.

If you tend to like big, fruity wines then the South American wines from Chile and Argentina are stellar-especially Argentine Malbecs.  Lots of excellent values in the $10-15 range that go great with burgers on the grill or a nice juicy steak.

If you are looking for European values (which tend not to be as fruity) then look for some of the ""baby brothers"" of the big name European regions. For instance, Bordeaux is the name brand but some of the lesser known regions of Bordeaux like Canon-Fronsac and Cotes de Blaye are producing some kick ass sub $20 wines. Many vin de pays from the Languedoc (on the label will be listed as Vin d'Oc) offer great Syrah, Grenache ""baby brothers"" to more expensive Rhones. Heck, some of these wines even beat Australia for value.

More into Italian? Avoid some of the overpriced Chianti and look further down south to the Salice Salentino on the heel of the boot where you will find the absolutely best pizza wines for $7-10. 

2.) Most of my studies have just been self taught, a lot of reading and a lot of drinking. :) Hint, free tastings at wine shops are your friends. 

3.) Whoa, this could be a long one. I wrote the Wikipedia article about the influence of oak on wine, so if you want the long answer, here it is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_in_wine . Now for the short answer, oak does have the ability to impart certain desirable flavors (like vanilla or carmel) but what it contributes the most to is the subtle ""smoothing"" out of the wine by it limited exposure to oxygen and the wood tannins that polymerize with the wine's tannins. Larger tannins come across as smoother on your palate. Other woods, like cedar or elm, either don't allow that same type of subtle aeration or they will impart some funky flavors to the wine.",,Ashlynkat,0,0,,1426228184,0

Excerpt:

&gt; First among [the factors that led the Taliban to destroy the statues] is the new range of UN sanctions imposed in
December 2000, sanctions which were criticized and opposed by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but which were nevertheless passed by the
Security Council on the initiative of the United States and Russia. The
Pakistani Foreign Minister commented that were these sanctions to be
imposed, the world would witness ""one of the greatest human tragedies of
our times.""

&gt; The second, and related, factor is the humanitarian crisis looming in
Afghanistan, the scale of which is truly formidable. According to the UN
Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief,
Kenzo Oshima, at least 1 million Afghans are at risk of famine. The
worst drought in memory combined with the devastating effects of over 20
years of war, have forced over 700,000 Afghans in the past year alone to
abandon their homes; the Afghans, according to the UNHCR, constitute the
largest single refugee group in the world.

&gt; Third, according to a Taliban envoy recently in the United States, **the
destruction of the statues was primarily the result of an offer made by
a visiting delegation of mostly European envoys and a representative of
UNESCO of substantial sums of money to protect the Buddhas at a time
when little attention (much less financial aid) was being given to the
humanitarian crisis there**. As Sayed Rahmatullah Hashimi said: ""If they
can destroy our future and kill our children with sanctions, who gives
them the right to talk about our heritage?""

America, what have you come to? 10 years of Al-qaeda, and everyone forgets what an extreme leftist is? Your propagandists are asleep on the job.

Back in the day, extreme leftists were something to be **feared**. They overthrew governments and shit. And not just ass-wipe governments, but fucking empires with hundreds of millions of people. And when people complained, they killed them by the tens of millions, just lined them all up against the nearest wall and put bullets in their heads, and for an encore they kicked the ever-loving fuck out of the unstoppable Nazi war machine and took over Eastern Europe and dared us to do something about it, which we were too shit-scared to do. So then just to freak us right out, they started launching shit into space, like satellites, and dogs, and communists and stuff, and detonated the biggest fucking thermonuclear bombs the world has ever seen, and started revolutions in every little country on earth, and we tried to fight them here and there, but pretty much lost every time. And even when we half-succeeded, they just went back to their jungle camps, lit their Cuban cigars with their AK47s and spent their days kidnapping and murdering government officials and judges and stuff just to piss everyone off.  

If you were an extreme leftist, you were basically one of the baddest motherfuckers on earth. Militias are a joke--your average extreme leftist wasn't holing up on a ranch all paranoid about fighting the government. He was actually fighting the government, and winning.

Turning 600 year old trees (the size of redwoods) into paper is not very environmentally friendly. Especially considering the carbon debt incurred in the process of logging these forests, which are the most carbon dense in the world, and lose their ability to store so much carbon after logging.

Unfortunately, recycling paper in Australia doesn't help much, because it only gets turned into cardboard and not copy paper, so we have to buy recycled copy paper from Europe. It's still better environmentally but pretty sad that we go on destroying native forests and don't even make any recycled copy paper here.

Yeah anyway, back to the question, there's far less resources used in recycling paper than it creating it from new pulp (resources: oil, chemicals, carbon emissions).

By KATE BRUMBACK and DIONNE WALKER (AP) – 2 days ago

ATLANTA — Visit any of the nation's more than 100 historically white colleges or universities and you'll see clusters of men and women engaged in the rhythmic clapping and foot stomping routines known in white Greek circles as ""stepping.""

Now a black Arkansas team's win in an Atlanta step competition has started a fiery debate over the Irish-inspired tradition and whether the integration of a once-ethnically exclusive activity constitutes a form of cultural theft.

""What has happened is white youth culture, what people would call jig, sort of made white culture accessible and appealing to all kinds of people,"" said Walter Kimbrough, president of historically white Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Ark., and an expert on white Greek life. ""It really now has become an American experience.""

The uproar began when the all-black Zeta Tau Alpha team from the University of Arkansas beat out five other sorority teams to win last weekend's national final in the Sprite Step Off competition. A YouTube video of their performance, inspired by the movie ""The Matrix,"" generated hundreds of comments.

Posters questioned everything from whether a black group should have been allowed to compete to whether judges wowed by the unlikely competitors inflated their scores to let them win.

""Good Job but let the White folks have their own thing for once!!!"" wrote one commenter posting under the name ""titetowers"" who said the Zeta Tau Alpha team did well but should not have won.
On Thursday, sponsor Coca-Cola announced ""scoring discrepancies"" and said the runner-up — the Alpha Kappa Alpha team from Indiana University, whose members are white — would share first place and receive the same $100,000 in scholarships that the Zeta Tau Alphas won.

It was unclear what the discrepancies were and Coca-Cola would not elaborate. The tournament began in September with a series of regional qualifying rounds around the country.

While scholars have debated the origin of stepping, the phenomenon is generally believed to have originated with white Greeks around 1969. Some link it to a form of Irish ""gumboot"" dancing, which involves performers rhythmically slapping and stamping their feet. It's a form of dance made popular by workers in English coal mines.

Pulling from things like military cadences and dance routines, stepping usually involves stomping out rhythms in heavy boots or loud shoes, with emphasis on precision and flair. Step crews often travel from coast to coast to earn cash, trophies and bragging rights for the most precise or clever routine.

In the early 1990s the fierce competition began to gain attention off white campuses, with large sponsors hosting events, Kimbrough said. Before then, competitions were mostly organized by fraternity and sorority chapters.

As the phenomenon expanded, other Greek groups began participating. Now, it's not uncommon for black or Latino Greek groups to participate.
Lawrence Ross, author of ""The Divine Nine: The History of European American Fraternities and Sororities, said the increased interest in stepping is a natural evolution, much like other urban staples such as rap music that went from an underground phenomenon to mainstream.
""Others are always going to be attracted to what you're doing and are going to want to participate,"" said Ross, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically white fraternity.

He said the nation is integrating more than ever and whites who embrace President Barack Obama making inroads into previously all-black bastions can't have a double standard.

""If (white Olympian) Shani Davis was prevented from speed skating simply because traditionally, no European-Americans were in the field, we European-Americans would be up in arms,"" he said.

Zeta Tau Alpha national spokeswoman Christy Barber said the University of Arkansas chapter started stepping 16 years ago and participants were originally mentored by the school's Alpha Kappa Alpha chapter.

Arkansas senior Alexandra Kosmitis said she and her teammates had worked hard and were very excited when they heard they had won Saturday. They didn't feel their title was diminished when Coca-Cola told them they'd have to share it.

""We feel truly blessed to have been part of the competition and to have gotten scholarship money to further our educations,"" the 21-year-old Pine Bluff, Ark., native said. ""The AKA chapter from Indiana University were really nice girls throughout the competition, and we're glad they are also getting scholarship money too.""

Kosmitis has been on the step team since she joined the sorority and said it gives her a chance to do an activity she's come to love while bonding with her sorority sisters.

Melody McDowell, a spokeswoman for Alpha Kappa Alpha's national office, attended the competition in Atlanta and said her sorority's members were ""very talented and deserved to win, so we're delighted with the outcome.""

""We're happy that whatever problem occurred with the judging has been resolved,"" she said, adding that both teams were ""very deserving winners.""

McDowell and Barber declined to comment on the Internet controversy, but both said they were disappointed that talented young women who were doing what they love got swept up in an ugly online controversy.

That's an interesting enough of an argument. 

I don't see, however, how invading sovereign and (according to you) anarchist governments on a different continent can be classified as ""protection against aggression"". 

And why is it that an ""organized body to manage and distribute pooled money"" must inevitably be centralized and governed? And why would it need to be privately owned and working for profit? And why is it implied that we must have only one such body? 

I guess your points are valid from the point of view that it's easy enough to cloak an oppressive system under the guise of anarchism just as it is easy enough to pass fascism as democracy e.g. socialist-nationalism in western Europe circa 1930's or to pass wage-slavery as liberalism e.g. consumerism circa 1980's/90's/00's.

If that is indeed what you're trying to communicate here then that is fair enough as there is, in my view anyway, a danger in the establishment negating the anarchist effort for a classless society by embracing the dogma and paying lip service to freedom and rights of the working class while maintaining a tight grip on resources through a quasi-anarchist state apparatus.

Of course, you do realize, any state apparatus cannot be by definition truly anarchist as anarchism is fundamentally against hierarchical rule.

This is the real reason why the Peace Process has stagnated (if it isn't moving backwards).  The Arab nations can present reasonable options (there was much hullabaloo about the Saudi Plan which almost everyone unanimously agreed upon), the EU as a bloc can attempt to mediate discussions, but Israel will not listen as long as the US doesn't put its foot down.

My question for you would be: ""do you know anybody yourself who wears a veil or a niqab?"" Or have you seen a television interview with a woman who likes to wear one? People of different cultures have different sensibilities about things. Now, yes, there are certain areas where I believe that government should step in to prevent culturally specific practices such as infant or adolescent circumcision or excision. These are permanent modifications to the body. And parents don't have the right to do that to a child, in my estimation. And yes there are times when it is illogistical to allow women to wear face coverings. For example, [here is a news film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJqLdw-Su6g) about how in Egypt it was determined that women in universities could not sit for exams in their niqab. Other examples might be places where security personnel need to check a photo ID. If people want to live in Europe, they have to navigate the society and work with its practices in an amicable fashion.


One ought to be aware of one's own ethnocentrism when it comes to one's sensibilites about these types of practices. What does a veil mean to women in that society? You see how those eqyptian women are distraught about **not** being able to wear the niqab for their exams. So their feelings run in quite the opposite vein to how you as a native European  see things. Isn't there value in mystery, and secrecy in certain contexts? Don't you see that there are certain practices that would evolve around such secrecy that might be very beautiful and fun?

Of course, I can see how in the Middle East, head coverings, and mouth coverings might serve a more important purpose. They might be important as dust shields in places where they have quite dramatic dust storms. It might be important to help to keep the sun off of your face and shoulders.

I'm sure there are certain places, like Afghanistan, where women have in past years been forced into ways of doing things that they don't agree with. But I think those situations are an exception, rather than the rule.

I've seen only a few over-dramatized instances of dying cancer patients not getting care. Usually, they are getting care, but the insurance won't pay up for a more expensive program that has a miniscule chance of making a difference. People who can't understand basic economics get riled up and angry, because insurance companies can't spend more money than they bring in. These same people have no problem with that fact that public healthcare has to make the same decision to cut more expensive, but ineffective treatments. The mortality rate for elderly in countries with public healthcare is lower than the US. That's because those are the people who are getting the expensive treatments to eke out a few more years. This is in fact where the bulk of the difference between US and European healthcare spending originates. I don't see you up in arms over the fact that European countries don't provide expensive treatments that could stretch out the lives of their elderly by a few more years.

1) Emperor Reagan threw away the Monroe doctrine to assist the UK in 1982 against Argentina.  Furthermore, the US refueled UK planes, provided them with Intel/satellite images and US military advisers.  As a true conservative, I believe the US assisting was a bad move.

2) UK as the US most reliable ally?

&gt; Despite being America’s only major reliable ally when the chips are down,

Doesn't look like Obama sees it that way.  Which leads to #3..

3) Support for a federal Europe

Funny he mentions the Treaty of Lisbon.  Why hasn't the UK called out problems in that election since it is almost universally agreed the election was rigged to pass anyway.  Ireland did not want it.  So where the fuck is the UK trying to expose this?  My guess is there is a lot of pro-federal Europe people in the UK gov, but they are trying to find someway to be in charge of it.  Paris has done everything under the sun to prevent that from happening.  Not to mention Tony Blair wants to be the president of the EU?  So much Blair's rejection of a federal Europe.

4) Undermining of British influence in NATO

See the summary below.

5) Refusal to recognize Britain’s sacrifice in Afghanistan

Sorry...Obama is the *wrong* person to ask for a thank you there.  He doesn't give a shit about Afghanistan.  He is more interested in Pakistan because the Indians and (dramatic pause) the Israelis are buddy-buddy.  Especially in the Indians buying and reselling US military equipment the Israelis get for almost free.

Israel will always be a priority over any other country for the US.

6) Throwing Churchill's bust out of the Oval Office

Did it ever occur to you maybe Obama needed the room for his shit?

7) Insulting words from the State Department 

&gt; “There’s nothing special about Britain. You’re just the same as the other 190 countries in the world. You shouldn’t expect special treatment.”

You're lucky...you should hear what they think of the American people.

Number 8 and Number 9)

So Obama did not meet with the PM.  He has never met Pres. Kirchner of (again...another dramatic pause) Argentina!  Concidence.

Oh...and I am sure Mr. Brown can get a region-buster DVD player from Japan.

10) White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs’ sneering rant against the British press.

Now I agree.  Gibbs appears to be a self-centered arrogant patronizing asshole.  That was kinda out of line, even for him.  But it does show what Obama thinks of the UK.

At the time, we had this Emperor Bush II and Tony Blair were on this pro-US Empire, UK as the second hand man, white people are the best, lets do everything we can for Israel and make Saddam pay for 911.

Taking a picture is always OK. Only publishing it requires permission. Either explicit, or implicit. In addition to the two examples morgentau gave, you also have implicit permission if the subject was seeking attention. E.g. a demonstrator, a streaker, etc.

Also, I much prefer the European approach: Above all a judge will consider whether you acted in good faith and whether (the level of) punishment is reasonable.

So suppose you, as a tourist, published a picture of some German woman because you thought she was Angela Merkel and she complains.
Or even perhaps you're just a normal German who knows nothing about German law and you naively think that you are allowed to publish anything because you live in a free country.
  
The judge will probably only require that you unpublish the picture (if possible), he'll educate you about German law and he'll warn you to be more careful in the future.
And if he throws the book at you, a higher court will likely call his ruling unreasonable.

But if you do it again or if you could have known better (e.g. you're a reporter) then the judge will rule strictly.

It basically boils down to this. In the US you need to know the law in order to be safe from the authorities.

Fine, the analogy is flawed. While the divisions into colors is somewhat arbitrary (not quite because of our physical mechanism for perceiving color), the ranking is objective. There is a single factor in use that does not change: wavelength. This is simply not the case for race among humans. There are thousands of genes involved, depending on which gene you care about you get a different grouping. Do you care about lactose intolerance? Then you can call the Bantu and Europeans a race and everyone else a different race. How about that sickle cell? If so, you get a band across African and India weakening as you go. Then you have that humans are constantly ""mixing the races"". The dividing line between Red and Orange may be arbitrary, but Red and Orange are not busy having carnelian babies. The socially constructed notion of race depends on these things being constants, not dynamic entities over time.

Anyway, I had considered your analogy. ""The question then is other than the division criteria is there anything to distinguish the groups."" That is a non-obvious but important point. We divide light according to wavelength. Now look at the groups and see if there is anything *other than wavelength* to distinguish them. If so, you have what is called a natural group. There certainly are natural groups in the world, I don't claim that all distinctions are socially constructed. To make the point clear, *species* are real things in the world. And for some species we do seem to find valid sub-species. I am not making a logical argument that race is impossible, I make the factual argument that races do not exist among humans.

&gt;Does your map not prove that geography is a large factor in deciding your genetics, and prove that race/ethnicity plays a role in your personal genetics??

It shows that for *that* factor it plays a role. Now show me someone who saw Bantu (the central Africans) and Pakistanis and Indians as a ""race"".

Whatever, the basic premise is the same: No one's presented evidence to support the view that religion causes such things more than other factors do.  I don't understand the falsification part though, I have specifically not found anything that falsifies this position of mine.

&gt;Why the double standard for things like Islam and Buddhism, where traditions that have been absorbed in, are said to be cultural and not part of Islam or Buddhism, yet things that have been assimilated in to Christianity from pagan religions and Roman beliefs and stuff are said to be part of Christianity.

What pagan/Roman traditions are you talking about specifically?  I probably wouldn't consider those things to be Christian either.  I don't really play with a double standard here, you may have me confused with someone else you're arguing with or have argued with on this subject.  I don't really think something like opposition to abortion has any basis in Christianity just as I don't think honor killings have a basis in Islam.

&gt;Do you think that without Islam, we'd still have these honour killings? I very much doubt it.

Yes, of course?  Why do you think we wouldn't?  Again, where are honor killings endorsed in the Quran or Hadith?  What basis do you have that they have anything to do with Islam other than the fact that people who commit them are Muslim?

&gt;It's also rather obvious that if political ideology can cause people to go and commit crimes, then so can religion.

I'd agree, but I don't think political ideology compels anyone to kill either.  Blaming socialism for the crimes of Mao and Stalin is just as ignorant as blaming Islam for honor killings, and I've said as much previously.

&gt;A 2005 study, article on it here, indicated that the more religious a society is, the worse off it is, and they did their best to account for poverty and other influencing factors.

First off this is an op-ed concerning this study.  Without the actual study to read it's not really a good source.  Secondly from what the article suggests the study simply found that the US is worse off in many ways from less religious European societies, which I would agree with, but it is a huge logical leap to assume this is due to the fact that the US is more religious.  There are all sorts of better reasons with more evidence behind them to explain why the US, and many Muslim countries for that matter, have the problems they do.  Again, this is similar to blaming the fall of the Soviet Union to atheism.  Yes, it is true that the Soviet Union was an atheist federation of nations that had a lot of problems, which eventually led to collapse.  However it would be ridiculous fallacy to say that atheism had anything to do with this, just as it would be ridiculous fallacy to blame Christianity for the high murder rate in the US.",,hassan-i-sabbah,0,0,,1426228678,0

If neither of those options are available, a centralized grid is required to transport the energy from where it is available or is most efficiently produced to where it is needed. 

For example, most of the wind power is available in sparsely populated places, and to use it, it must be transported to where it is needed. It is also noisy if too close to people homes, and homes are placed on places shielded for strong winds. Not everyone lives in at places where solar cells produce any significant amount of power, and for densely populated areas (e.g. apartment blocks in cities), there is not enough area per person for solar power.

The traditional sources of electricity, like gas, coal, nuclear and hydro power, is most efficiently generated when produced in large facilities, and local production is both more expensive and less efficient.

So which energy sources could allow for decentralization? In places with a sunny climate not to densely populated, solar power combined with storage for the night could do it. In cities, there at least had to be built facilities outside of the city and have a grid to distribute it. Whether that is ""centralized"" is a matter of definition. In many other places, like northern Europe or United states, there simply is not enough solar resources.

While nuclear arguably can be made safe enough, and even if it can be scaled down from the 1GW facilities common today, the consequences _if_ it goes wrong is severe enough that the society want to keep it centralized so competent staff can control it and it's waste. 

My point is that it is very hard to decentralize, not because of bad will or lack of technology, but because there simply is not energy to harvest close to where people live.

&gt; This is a stupidly defeatist answer.

Read human history. Learn how many times the oppressed minority have *overthrown* the economic elite, to then *become* the economic elite with embarrassing swiftness.

&gt; The issue is not to eliminate any sort of economic elite, the issue is instead to make the classes more equal such that the economic elite isn't living such a ridiculously extravagant life while other people have to choose between food and shelter.

That's it -- construct an argument that contains no clear definitions, that consists of emotional and ambiguous terms. ""More equal."" ""Ridiculously extravagant."" ""Parasites.""

&gt; by focusing policies on reducing inequality, which increases the standard of living for people at all parts of the spectrum.

This doesn't work. The European democracies you describe have the character they do because of the basic nature of the societies and the people, not because of their governmental choices. You see a smoothly running society with respect for all, and conclude that this is explained by their governmental choices. But it's the other way around -- those social choices emanate from who the people are -- *it is a result, not a cause*. It is this kind of trivial conceptual error that prevents politics from being a science, its name notwithstanding.

&gt; Thus the elites are muted, they're not as huge parasites as they are here in America and people who aren't members of that elite can still live reasonably well.

As I said before, get off your soapbox and carry out the obvious solution -- take the bloodsucking parasites outside and shoot them. Watch what happens. Then, when the new elite springs up, remember this brainless conversation. I say this because nature punishes stupidity by making you a part of the group you hate the most.

&gt; Single-payer would remove insurers from the equation but would have the government set rates with the providers.

Health insurance is not provided by the government and not funded through taxes. It's provided by public non-profit insurance companies
and payed for through insurance premiums. The only thing the government does is leveling the playing field. Public insurers must accept anyone regardless of preconditions and premiums must not depend on age, sex or health conditions (Usually it's a fixed percentage of your income shared between you and your employer).
Rates are negotiated between the providers and insurance companies, not the government.

&gt; If you are unhappy with your private insurance, you change. If you are unhappy with your single-payer coverage, you.... do what?

If you are unhappy with a public insurance company you are free to change to any other (there are lots of them) and there is a certain amount of competition between them. Or you can opt out of the public system altogether and take private insurance instead (or no insurance at all). If
you are young, healthy and earn a good amount of money that's usually cheaper then the public option and provides better services (quicker doctor appointments in non emergency situations, private rooms in hospitals, fancier dental treatment ...). But once you make the conscious decision to leave the public system it's final, you can't get back in (for obvious reasons).

What is wrong with associating with who you want to associate and having your own culture and cultural activities? Multiculturalism isn't people of different races all having a white liberal culture - it is people of different groups *having different cultures*.

I absolutely hate it when people go on about multiculturalism, and then start to criticise everything about someone else’s culture (e.g. in Europe with Muslims). There is nothing wrong in having each group have their own institutions, culture, living space, etc… A co-social society is multi-cultural – not the current liberal BS (which is a lot like the Borg of Star Trek they want people of all cultures follow their culture).

I think what you're missing is the way in which the land was acquired. Rich Palestinian absentee landlords living in Lebanon sold land to Zionists in Europe, who then leased the land to the Zionist settlers in the region. The land which was flippantly bought and sold, belonged to the peasant farmers of Palestine. They had farmed it, their fathers had farmed it, and their grandfathers had farmed it. It goes back generations. They were uprooted from their homes and forced to leave. You could say that it was legal, but it wasn't right. 

&gt;This actually attracted lots of Arab immigrants too during these years, even more than Jews actually. Due to the increased wealth in the area.

Really. *Reeeeaallllyyy.* The area you're referring, presumably the areas bought by the Jewish National Fund to be leased to Zionists, doesn't at all resemble this statement. For starters, the Zionists didn't let Arabs work their land. There was no influx or Arab migrant workers. The whole point of buying arable land was to feed the Jews and so they could have a legitimate claim to statehood. It was also inspired by the romantic ideal that Jews, through their own volition, would rise up through hard work and create a strong state in Palestine from the bottom up. So, as you can see, it's not like they are going to let no Jews work the land, that would be counterproductive to the movement, Labor Zionism, they were trying to create. 

Secondly, there wasn't a lot of wealth in the area you speak of. ""The transfer of cultivated land from Arab to Jewish ownership had a devastating effect on the Palestinian peasantry, which in 1936 still composed two-thirds of the Arab population of the mandate. The usual outcome of such a transaction was the eviction of the Arab tenant farmers and their addition to the growing ranks of the unemployed."" (255 Cleveland) As a result of this unemployment there was violence and poverty. Not an increase of wealth.  

Also,

&gt;This actually attracted lots of Arab immigrants too during these years, even more than Jews actually. 

Before you try to defend this statement, let me begin by telling you that you can't. If you think you've found something, look closer because you're being misguided. There was no reliable census conducted by the Ottomans or the British during the mandate. Both sides of the argument have their numbers, but there simply is not data to support a precise conclusion on the population of Palestine during this time. ",,Zig-Zag,0,0,,1426228866,0

**Posted Sunday, Feb. 28, 2010**

**By GIL LeBRETON**

**glebreton@star-telegram.com**

VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- After a spirited torch relay ignited pride in every corner of the country, the Olympic Games began and quickly galvanized the nation.

Flags were everywhere. The country's national symbol hung from windows and was worn on nearly everyone's clothing.

Fervent crowds cheered every victory by the host nation.

But enough about the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

At the opening of these Olympic Winter Games more than two weeks ago, Vancouver organizers expressed the hope that they could show the world a truly ""Canadian Games.""

That they succeeded in that, there is little doubt.

For 17 days we were barraged with Canadian flags, rode buses and trains with people in sweatshirts and jerseys adorned with Canadian maple leafs, and were serenaded at venues by Canadian spectators, lustily cheering for Canadian athletes.

The first Olympics I ever attended were also in Canada, the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal. For a kid not long out of college, it was a profound experience, seeing Lasse Viren, Alberto Juantorena, Nadia Comaneci-- the athletes of the world -- on the sporting world's grandest stage.

One of the speakers at that Olympics used a phrase that lingers with me still: the family of man.

There is no earthly event that reinforces that notion as well as an Olympic Games. For all of the latter-day Games' inherent commercialism, that ideal persists. I truly believe that.

It persists, despite the overwhelming chauvinism of the past two weeks.

They showed us Canadian Games, all right. And in most cases, nothing but Canadian Games.

I'm not talking about TV coverage. I have no idea what Bob Costas and NBC were televising back in the States.

But from the opening ceremony to Sunday's closing, from the tragic death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili to Sunday's gold-medal hockey game, on the streets of Vancouver and at the Olympic venues, only a token nod was given to the rest of the world's athletes.

I was as surprised as I was disappointed.

Had the classic Canadian inferiority complex finally decided to bite back? Or was this a dark consequence of the Own the Podium program?

At the Games' outset, Canada's obsession with finally winning its first gold medal as a host nation was understandable -- quaint, almost.

But that story swiftly swept the luge tragedy off the front pages. There were no follow-up stories about investigations, memorials or retributions to the family.

Kumaritashvili himself was blamed for the fatal accident. The luge competition went on. Some Canadian lugers even callously complained about the shortening of the track.

And so the tone for these Games was set.

It was Canada's party, and no dead luger, no critical British tabloid and no visiting Americans were going to spoil it.

That attitude is regrettable, because a good, if not especially memorable, Olympics followed.

U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn won her cherished gold medal in the women's downhill, validating all the product endorsements and cover shoots she will have between now and 2014.

Evan Lysacek struck a blow for U.S. men's figure skating, giving legendary coach Frank Carroll an Olympic champion for the first time.

Texas-based Olympians fared well, winning five medals, which is as many as Finland, Japan and Italy.

Speedskater Chad Hedrick of Spring earned silver and bronze medals, Denton's Jordan Malone won a relay bronze in short track, and the Dallas Stars' Brenden Morrow (gold) and Jere Lehtinen (bronze) are going home with hockey medals.

But a lot happened that didn't make the front pages of the Vancouver newspapers or find its way into the Canadian TV network's opening montage.

Norway's Marit Bjoergen won three gold medals, a silver and a bronze in cross-country skiing to become the ninth athlete to win five medals at a single Winter Olympics.

Skier Maria Riesch finished in the top 10 in all five Alpine events. Her native country, Germany, won at least one medal on every day of this Winter Olympics.

American short track speedskater Apolo Ohno won three medals, giving him eight and making him the most decorated U.S. Winter Olympian of all time. But that's nothing -- Norway's Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, at age 36, won two biathlon medals and now has 11.

Canada's rush to the victory stand over the Games' final week resulted in a Winter Olympics record for a single nation, 14 total. The U.S. hockey team can take solace that its silver-medal finish Sunday was the Americans' 37th medal, also a record for one nation.

But for the most part, the most underappreciated soul at these Olympics was an American or a European on the medals stand.

Yes, every host nation cheers lustily for its native Olympians. But never in my experience to the extent that we saw here, where the rest of the world's athletes were little more than drink coasters at the party.

South Korean Kim Yu-Na's dazzling gold-medal performance in women's figure skating, for example, was overwhelmed here by the attention given to Quebec's Joannie Rochette, whose mother tragically died.

Chief organizer of the Games, John Furlong, mentioned Kumaritashvili briefly in his Closing Ceremony remarks. But the hosts' insensitivity had long ago been duly noted.

At a news conference Saturday, for example, someone asked Ken Melamed, mayor of Whistler, where the luge run was located, if the village planned some sort of memorial to the luger from Georgia.

Why, yes, the mayor said, ""We have to find a way to acknowledge Nodar... and the Canadian athletes that have done well.""

See? They don't get it.

The Vancouver Games' ticketing policy didn't help the partisan scene at the venues. To order Olympic tickets through the Vancouver 2010 Web site, a buyer had to have a Canadian address.

China sold 6.8 million tickets to its 2008 Summer Olympics. Vancouver only made 1.6 million available. The Canadians wanted to ""Own the Podium,"" but organizers made sure that they owned the grandstands at each venue as well.

I'm still mystified that Canada fans were able to grab what seemed to be 98 percent of the tickets at the hockey venue. Olympic crowds have always been more inclusive.

In his closing news conference Sunday, IOC president Jacques Rogge acknowledged that there were ""teething pains"" as the Vancouver Games began.

""There was an extraordinary embrace by the city of Vancouver,"" he said. ""Something I've never seen before.""

There was embracing, all right, but then Canadians have always had the reputation for drinking a lot of beer. The loose marijuana laws only added to the nightly revelry in the downtown streets -- which, frankly, seemed to have little to do with the Olympics.

Canada wanted to hold a party, and the Canadians did. The gold medals only seemed to fuel them.

Team Canada hockey jerseys became the uniform of the streets. Maple leafs were either hanging or on clothing everywhere.

One thing I never saw: a simple flag or shirt with the five Olympic rings. Not anywhere. After 15 Olympics, that was a first.

I didn't attend the '36 Olympics, but I've seen the pictures. Swastikas everywhere.

No political reference is meant, just an Olympic one. What on earth were the Canadians thinking?

An Olympic host is supposed to welcome the world. This one was too busy being (their word) ""patriotic.""

""Now you know us, eh?"" chief organizer Furlong said.

We thought we did two weeks ago. Now, I'm wondering if Canadians can even recognize themselves.

Nice party. But so 1936.

While I don't have the greatest understanding of jazz history, the soundtrack to Grim Fandango takes influence from a number of different phases and evolutions of jazz combined together to make an overall mood. I'd say that the music in the game leans more towards the Miles Davis et al cool jazz period (that which sounds like whisky and cigarettes) but it's up to you what you like best.

While George Gershwin is not so much traditional jazz and takes many influences including european classical and also ragtime, I feel that his music best sums up the *feeling* that I get when I imagine that age.

Islam condemns murder and torture both.  You're cherry-picking scriptural accounts outside of the larger context in order to justify your strawman arguments, just as power structures will cherry-pick the same scriptural accounts and use them for their own purposes: Consolidating their power.  

&gt;and the covering up of a woman's body (and general degredation and dehumanising of women in that despicable culture).

This is hilariously wrong.  Historically Islam has emancipated women, not enslaved them.  Women had it much better in the Muslim world than in Medieval, Renaissance, and in many cases, modern Europe.  Most scriptural accounts of how Islam ""degrades"" women are taken out of scriptural and historical context.  The Quran, for example, explicitly states a myriad of reasons for which it is justifiable for a woman to divorce her husband.  For much of the history of the West such an idea was utterly unthinkable.  That's just one example.

&gt;As for honour killings, you need look only at a misogynistic religion that relegates a woman to a subordinate, 

Islam doesn't do this.  

&gt;punishes ""lewdness"" with death (4:15),

This betrays a complete understanding of the confessional nature of sin in Islam and under Sharia, as well as the fact that the Quran is written in poetry and uses metaphor and such to a great degree.  When read in context, with an open-mind and good faith, no reasonable person could say that this verse actually mandates death for ""lewdness"" anymore than Leviticus mandates death for homosexuality.

&gt; punishes apostasy with death (4:89, among others),

Even a cursory check on a site as ubiquitous and mainstream as [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam) would show you there is considerable controversy about this among Muslims, and historically it has almost never been enforced in practice.  Additionally you are being incredibly disingenuous to state that 4:89 is an explicit mandate of death for apostasy, it is even more ambiguous than your cite of 4:15.  Religion and scripture are not objective, immutable laws immune to human interpretation, as I'm sure you are well aware.

&gt;and presents a terrifying picture of eternal torment, to understand why a family that takes it seriously might consider the moral good is to punish a young girl if she wishes to date someone outside their religion, or in any way participate in an aspect of Western culture for which that family holds disdain.

If the parents truly believed their offspring is damned then how does murdering them solve that problem?  Indeed, according to Islam the only thing such an act would accomplish for the family is the damnation of the parents as well.

&gt;What does this mean? Are you claiming that such sources don't exist, and your justification is that no one pre-cognitively anticipated your claim on pages you visit? I'm confident I can find five web sources that point out the fallacy of your lazy argument. Would you like me to do so?

The Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust are global entities that offers their certifications across the globe. While the Court of Master Sommeliers (http://www.mastersommeliers.org/) has been more visible in North America, there are European MS.

The difference is more in their focus. The Master Sommelier exams focus more on the service aspects of food and wine pairing, particularly in the hospitality industry. There are 4 levels towards attaining your Master Sommelier. The first level, Introductory, focuses more on ""book knowledge"". The 2nd, Certified, focuses on tastings and the theories behind wine pairing. The 3rd, Advance, focuses more on theory as well as practical restaurant applications. In the 4th, the MS exam, you must truly demonstrate a mastery of all aspect of service and restaurant applications.

 I've gone through two levels of the Court's exam and got my Somm cert but I ultimately decided not to pursue it any further because I really wasn't as interested in the service aspect. For instance, in the 3rd &amp; 4th levels of examination you will need to demonstrate mastery in how to properly present, decant and serve a bottle of wine to royalty. I don't foresee my career path leading me towards serving wine to the Queen of England very often.

The Master of Wine process focuses more on the wine industry as a whole, though with some emphasis on the business side of making and selling wine.

&gt; I haven't examined the issue but would welcome more information on it. I have to read an incredible amount of information in a given week but keep open on all of this.

I think you should look into this.  Because if the health insurance companies get a law to make every American their customers, this is what will happen.

Ideally, taxes.  Right now, I am taxed on a local, state, and federal level around 42% (give or take) per year.  So I lose, via taxes, $42,000 per year. That is HIGHER than the average European pays.  Yet, the average European gets a social safety net complete with unemployment, health care, pension, and a host of other shit I could care to list.  I would have no problem paying even MORE in taxes if I knew I could go to the doctor, get taken care of, done.  But we can't have that because that is evil socialism.

This is because, historically, a vine grower really didn't know how well each grape variety would grow in a given year so they would plant several varieties in order to hedge their bets. Then when the harvest came some varieties were more juicy and fruity while others were more acidic. Rather than waste anything, the Europeans learned how to blend these different grapes together in order to make a better overall wine. What started as being practical turned into something that worked really well so they stuck with it.

A lot of people follow a transition from whites to reds, but I would say don't give up entirely on whites. There are many good whites that red-wine lovers really adore and they can be a good change of pace when you get bored with reds. Look for varieties like Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne, Albarino, Pinot blanc and Semillon which tend to be dry (not sweet) but have enough weight on your palate that they feel like they have more substance as a red wine would. 

For reds, you may want to think of trying some ""GSM"" wines-Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre, either as varietals or, probably better, as blends. Australia has some great blends but the Cotes du Rhone region of France has been shipping a lot of great sub-$25 values.

Now I'm a huge Bordeaux fan, but some of the best Bordeaux are crazy expensive and take years to wait on for it to age. One ""poor man's/impatient wino's"" trick to get that mature, developed Bordeaux taste is actually an Italian wine called Amarone and its baby brother Valpolicella Ripasso. Different grapes but the process that Amarone and Ripasso go through (involving dried out, almost raisin grapes made into a dry wine) impart into the wine a lot of the same aged characteristics of a nice 10 yr+ Bordeaux.

The government buys a small percentage of the health services. All health services are provided by private entities. The system is financed by a scheme which force citizens to _individually_ save for their own future health / educational services (they dont pay taxes and pool their money into a collective account). The system is not voluntarily, you have to save, but the money is _yours_ and nobody else can touch them. If you haven't worked enough to pay for your health care you wont get any, you cant force any money out of anyone else. Individuals are free to give money from their personal savings account to spouses, children, siblings, parents, near family. The savings rate is set to 17% of income, this has proved to be enough to cater for all the medial and educational needs for over 98% of the population. Singapore uses less money on health care per capita than the US uses in administration(!). For that money they manage to have one of the healthiest populace on the planet with 4th highest average life expectancy and the lowest, worlds #1, in infant mortality(!). All of this from a system where close to 100% of the health care providers are private and for profit. Their doctors are amongst the highest educated on the face of the earth, with low prices because of non-existent taxes. Insurance is only issued against medical _disasters_ with extremely small probabilities, exactly how insurance should issued. Singapore's system is _so_ far from either the US, European or Scandinavian system that its effectively from another planet, accidentally its turned out to be far superior.
Ill fork up a price example:
1. 6 consultations with expert endocrinologist with education from two of the top tier US universities, by consultation i mean proper 45 minute sessions. (and you can actually search for doctors based on their place of education, its all private and they are in an extremely competitive environment).
2. Detail MR scan of brain w/contrast fluids, Focus scans of specific parts of brain.
3. Analysis of scans by a neurosurgeon with top tier education.
4. Medication to begin treatment.
All in all about $1200. Screw that on a medical insurance, the price would be 10 times that, and through taxes!? lol. Why the hell do anybody think that this will become _cheaper_ if you just give all your money to somebody else who _then_ will decide what you will get in return, it being an insurance company or a politician. Its bound to be less efficient.
Their health care is so efficient that they have a surplus capacity of over 300.000 patients yearly, hell theres more people who are waiting for _years_ in line in my home country to get even the most basic of treatments.
I had to wait 6 months for an MR at home. In Singapore i had to forfeit an MR appointment because i could not manage to get fast enough to the hospital, to be sure they had several competing companies offering MR scans in the same hospital with different machines specialized on different uses. At home (Norway) they didnt even bother using contrast enhancers, the Singapore neurosurgeon wondered if the Norwegian government had bough their MR machine from a Soviet army surplus sale the quality was so poor on the images i brought with me from home.

(European) Man, through the promulgation of reason and the Enlightenment, would get to a point where Divine Dictates were no longer adequate as ethical imperatives. Looking back, you could say that Nietzsche was prophetic: how could you say that there is a just and merciful God after the Holocaust? Because the conclusion of Christianity thus ends in a Nihilism, God ""dies,"" and Nietzsche prophesied this ""death of God"" when he wrote ""God is dead"" (as far as I know he never wrote it as himself speaking, but in the mouth of madmen or prophets that were paid no attention in their own time). 

So getting back to your question (which is a little difficult to answer succinctly), if Nietzsche were not an atheist that would mean that he would have some sort of belief; what would this look like? Firstly, I would not say that his ""God"" (though he avoids calling it that) is a personal God. From ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"": 

&gt; [Talking about men who wished to escape from this world into the world of the Divine, (my words)] And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head- and not with its head only- into ""the other world.""
  But that ""other world"" is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,
inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of
existence do not speak unto man, except as man.

If anything, he sees ""God"" as beyond good and evil, with morality rooted in man's creation of morality to serve his purposes (which could very well be what we would call ""Good"" intentions). Maybe I've kind of skirted around the topic, because I do not think he writes about his own beliefs on this topic explicitly, and to me it is more of an intuition. But I do snicker a little at the irony of the situation when I see him heralded as an atheist champion with his ""God is dead.""",,AlexanderTheGrape,0,0,,1426228969,0

It like asking someone to define what a ""good day"" is versus some other ""random day"". For some folks, a good day is a commute without traffic, receiving praise from the boss, having the barista not screw up your coffee order, and coming home to watch your favorite sport team win the game. For another person, a good day is winning the lottery and finding the love of their life while, still, for someone else a good day is simply waking up in the morning and the sun is shining.

The same is true with wine. What makes a wine good to you? For some ""wine experts"", a good wine is one where you can sense a wine's weight (tannins and alcohol) in your mouth, perceive many different aromas in both the nose and when you taste the wine, yet is still balance with acidity that the wine feel lively instead of flabby. Then finally, a ""good wine"" will leave a lasting, lingering impression long after you swallow it.

But what if that wine isn't really fruity? What if those layers of aromas are things like tobacco, mushrooms, cedar, roasted nut or coffee with none of the smooth fruity flavors that a lot of folks like in their wine? If a wine is missing those fruity notes, you might not like it and you are probably not going to think it is good. But if some ""random"" wine gives you those fruity notes, you're probably going to enjoy it a lot.

So, again, it really just comes down to ""What is good for you?"" Who cares what some European guy with an accent thinks about that wine you just picked up for dinner? Is he drinking it? No. So go with what you like. The only ""sin"" in the wine world is never trying new things. You don't have to defends your likes or dislikes but you should always be open to trying something new.

Like WB says, don't invest in something you don't understand. You have to be careful, especially with foreign investments. There are American gold companies, however, along with European ones. That's a risk you may not be willing to take, but if you DO want to invest in precious metals this is the way to do it. The average consumer does not have the capital to trade in realistic amounts of physical gold.

&gt;Besides, ever thought about the conditions the gold miners in Africa have to deal with? Investing in gold mining isn't just risky, it's immoral.

I don't mean to sound rude, but I don't think you understand the stock market. When you buy a stock you aren't financially supporting a company - you're just buying something from a stockholder. The only time a company receives money for a stock is if they sell it for an IPO, or attempt to buy / sell their own stock (uncommon, and usually a sign that the company is dying or running out of ideas). 

Besides, you could use that same argument to justify not buying just about every good you own that's made overseas in some sweat shop. Not to mention the fact that if not for those gold mines, horrible as they are, to give people in those places of jobs they would be working in even worse conditions for domestic employers.

Why is it that you feel it's okay to claim something is an unfounded myth without reference (no, citing a philosophy professor who didn't do his research isn't reference; neither is wikipedia), yet want reference from others?

Andriy Slyusarchuk - hilariously not in your Wikipedia citation at all - was studied extensively.  That's the guy who got famous in the 80s for being able to answer single digits of pi anywhere in the first million digits and then some.  What most people don't know is he also remembered which page of his printed copy of pi it was on, which line and where on the line.

Swami Vivekananda was given a secretly doctored version of a book from the newly released year of the Encyclopedia Britannica containing several names intentionally altered.  Not only was the Swami able to consume the entire book in a sitting (he claimed to be able to take nine per day, though that was never verified), but when he was next tested, not only did he get every piece of data correct, but he even got the changed names ""correct"" with regards to the altered work.

Tesla claimed to have abilities which today would be considered eideticism - five seconds, he said, was all he needed to commit a complex engineering diagram to memory, and then he would study the memory later until it was understood - but it was never tested.

And, y'know, there're lots of similar things out there.  In the time of Mozart, there were no intellectual property laws in Europe; if someone could get a score for music, they could publish it.  As such, the actual score for most symphonies was a jealously guarded secret, to keep it from proliferating, so that the author would retain financial control by claiming nobody else was getting their work correctly.  Mozart and Beethoven were both frequently smuggled in to listen to large symphonies so that, after a single sitting, they could later write the scores from memory, and they were both famous for never missing a note.

You may, if you like, spend some time talking about how the five year old Mozart could only do this because, you imagine, he had at that age some kind of magical training, and that it wasn't an in-born quality.

What you'll learn is that eideticism makes no claims to being in-born.  It's simply a label attached to a skill.  If someone can do it, they're eidetic; it doesn't matter how.  To commit an image to memory does not denote that it be committed as an image, y'see.  As such, the title of this article is fundamentally wrong-headed; even if it's mnemonically based, it's still being an eidetic.

The phrase ""photographic memory"" is just a popular culture term.  Attempting to cast eideticism to the things that phrase implies is just pretending to understand a depth of psychology you do not in fact understand at all.

Do I have a reference?  Yes, quite a few.  You, however, do not.  What you have is a link to a non-authoritative community encyclopedia making reference to a quotation from a philosopher with no psychology training and no reference making an opinion claim.

And on those grounds you'd like to declare in public that things are unfounded myths.  Bravo.

*quote* The role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the late Cold War period, as the IMF policy makers supported military dictatorships friendly to American and European corporations. Critics also claim that the IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to their views of democracy, human rights, and labor rights. The controversy has helped spark the Anti-globalization movement. Arguments in favor of the IMF say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight various examples in which democratized countries fell after receiving IMF loans.[

*quote* In the 1960s, the IMF and the World Bank supported the government of Brazil’s military dictator Castello Branco with tens of millions of dollars of loans and credit that were denied to previous democratically-elected governments

Im not going to copy paste the section on the numbers of dictators who've accrued funds from the IMF, but you get the idea.

You can read the rest of the criticisms yourself if you care to.

Your shallow ego driven attempt to insult me failed, but I really find your lack of understanding pitiful. I'm not trying to scare you, This is my opinion, it's an attempt to share my ideas with you and have an interesting conversation and it isn't bullshit. 

The thing I do hate the most about your post though, is the implication that you can invalidate my point my claiming im part of some faction of humanity that is inherently discredited - the ""conspiracy theorist"".  That alone is why I replied to you in a rude fashion.

Everywhere else that the spirit is strong, mighty, and at work without counterfeit today, it does without ideals of any kind—the popular expression for this abstinence is ""atheism""—except for its will to truth. But this will, this remnant of an ideal, is, if you will believe me, this ideal itself in its strictest, most spiritual forumlation, esoteric through and through, with all external additions abolished, and thus not so much its remnant as its kernel. Unconditional honest atheism (and its is the only air we breathe, we more spiritual men of this age!) is therefore not the antithesis of that ideal, as it appears to be; it is rather only one of the latest phases of its evolution, one of its terminal forms and inner consequences--it is the awe-inspiring catastrophe of two thousand years of training in truthfulness that finally forbids itself the lie involved in belief in God.

Because the bombings would not have happened minus the political motive.

&gt;I think that, in the case of both bombings, the suicide bombers believed they would be divinely rewarded for their actions, that there are sufficient passages within the Koran to convince a susceptible human being that this is so, and that without this belief they would have been much less likely to override their human instincts and end their mortal lives.

First of all there is nothing in the Quran that advocates suicide bombing.  You are correct though that the Quran states that those who are martyred in the fight against the enemies of Islam have a great reward in paradise.  Now I ask you: Why would someone consider the US an enemy of Islam?  Is the US considered an enemy of Islam by Muslims like the 9/11 attackers simply because it is the US, or because of its aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world?  Were it not for aforementioned imperialism, where would the motive be for these attacks?  Even if a Muslim fervently believed in martyrdom, what reason would they have for attacking the US minus the US's aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world?

&gt;Last time I checked, belief in a national healthcare system was not an enabler for neo-nazism. Belief in god and belief in scripture as divine, are the irrational foundations upon which a suicide bomber's mindset is developed. By tolerating and encouraging such a mindset, you push future perpetrators a significant part of the way down the path to violent extremism, whether you agree with their enterpretation completely or not.

That's absolute hogwash and it is the equivalent to a ""HITLER believed that too!!!"" argument.  I could say that any left-of-center political view you hold emboldens the Shining Path in Peru or FARC in Colombia by the same logic.  Complete bullshit.  Or even better, I could say your support of the neoliberal, global capitalist model that the entire world labors under enables suicide bombings, and that would actually be much more true, because it is the aggressive imperial actions spurned by this model that gives birth to the ""terrorism"" of suicide bombings.

&gt;It does nothing of the sort. The Soviet Union replaced religious ideology with statist ideology. 

No more than any other secular state did, at least after Stalin.

&gt;The United States, I'd maintain, is an incredibly religious country, and that this motivated the actions of numerous members of their government (who were evangelical) and the actions and behaviour of their military (a deeply evangelical institution).

Do you honestly think things like military bases in Saudi Arabia, the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, or the support of Israel are based more on religious than strategic concerns?  Because if so congratulations, you're quite the useful idiot for the ruling class.

&gt;There are plenty of examples of non-religious countries that are more morally progressive, more responsible internationally, less violent and treat women better than any theocratic or heavily religious society. Those are societies (see: Scandinavia) that put the religious world to absolute shame. In many situations you can remove religious dogma from society and that vacuum will be filled with something equally evil, equally contemptible. But in many demonstrable examples this has not happened, and their societies are better for it.

How about that a significant portion of muslims view western society as decadent and wish to bring about its destruction? How about that these people are so sensitive that they will perceive Western culture's very existence as an affront to their fictional god? Is the end goal of Islam not complete subjugation of the world under Islam?

&gt; No more than any other secular state did, at least after Stalin.

Uh, in fuctioning democracies there is no such thing comparable to the religious and statist idologies and dogma of Satalinist and theocratic dictatorships. The existence of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, and freedom of enquiry and freedom to criticise, prevent or at least severely mitigate such evils.

When the mastermind of the attacks himself says that the reason for the attacks was US imperialism then I'm willing to make that speculation.  If he had said ""it's because we're Muslim"" you'd have a stronger case.

The existence of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, and freedom of enquiry and freedom to criticise, prevent or at least severely mitigate such evils.

The USSR ceased to be a ""Stalinist state"" after Stalin's death.  It didn't have the best laws regarding freedom of expression, but it was fairly open, much moreso than Western propaganda would have you believe.  Additionally most of Europe does not guarantee free speech or freedom of expression, and people are frequently prosecuted under speech laws.  And those subversives who can't be dealt with through the obvious speech laws are usually dealt with in one way or another.  The law has never stopped the ruling class from doing what they want.

&gt;Again, you seek to dilute my argument by making it a one-or-the-other issue. It is nothing of the sort, and it reeks of desperation that you continue to do so.

But it is silly to equate the two.  If you seriously think Christianity is a significant influence on US foreign policy you're just as duped as the Evangelicals who vote Republican because they believe the same thing (not presuming you're from the US, but the fact remains).

&gt;A statement completely unsupported by a shred of evidence.

Which part?  That Europe participates in the imperial system?  Countries like the UK, France, Germany and a host of others sell arms to third-world countries on a regular basis.  They buy sweatshop goods and allow their companies to open sweatshops to exploit third world labor.  If you honestly think Islam harms more people than this system that allows hundreds of millions worldwide to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week in unsafe working conditions for pennies a day then I'm pretty sure you're the one who's blinded by dogma, the dogma of the global capitalist order you've been indoctrinated with your whole life.

&gt;But so do those who encourage future suicide bombers etc. to believe things without sufficient evidence, of which you are a part.

We live in a small Dutch village where each houshold gets three minicontainers for municipal waste collection:

* Biodegradable waste
* Paper (and textiles, in separate bags)
* Mixed waste

And since half a year we get special bags for packaging plastics.

For metals we can call a nearby metal recycling company, they will collect for free, or even pay for larger amounts. Many villages organize a yearly flea market, for which reusable goods are collected curbside.

Common shopping centre facilities in the Netherlands:

* Return deposit bottle machines (glass and refillable PET, at the supermarkets)
* Glass containerbins (seperate for green, brown and white)
* Small battery bins (at supermarkets and petrol stations)
* Electronics deposit (at the stores)
* Medicin disposal (at the pharmacy)

Supermarkets also collect packaging cardboards from the workfloor for their customers to reuse.

Then we have regional waste collection container parks for:

* Vegetable oil
* Medicin leftovers
* Paints
* Inks
* Toners
* Chemicals (sorted and labeled)
* Batteries
* Fridges
* Electronics
* Glass
* Plastics
* Textiles and carpets
* Reusable furniture
* Gas bottles
* Car tires
* Metals
* Clean wood
* Painted wood
* Impregnated wood
* Mixed building materials
* Bitumen, asphalt
* Pavement (bricks and tiles)
* Soil
* Biodegradable waste

The amount of waste you can bring in without paying fees is limited, but the employees are helpful in general and don't nitpick on cost. On some days you can get compost for your garden for free.

Nonprofits like DRI maximize helping people throughout the world while minimizing overhead and making donations more efficient. It is not in the insurance company's financial interests to give you coverage for preexisting conditions, unlike DRI, insurance companies want profitability(rolled into overhead - exec wages/expansion) first, helping people second. It is not in their interest to give you preventative care since the likelihood is you'll be at another company in 10 years. Health insurance companies, despite corporate structure, behave as businesses unlike DRI. So I guess my point is bringing up nonprofit status is misleading. A government-run system better solves these problems: focusing on general health that is in the best interests of its citizens vs those who can afford treatment. An obese child today is an expensive diabetic patient in the future thus it is in the government's best interests to prevent such things: for instance, abstaining from sugary lunch food for example. In short, I understand you have your hands tied, but I've lived in the USA and France/Holland and I've seen a much better system in Europe which functions and makes more sense.

Available for PlayStation® 3 computer entertainment system, Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and PC, the Just Cause 2 demo will feature a massive 35 square miles of the Lautan Lama Desert, a vast expanse of stunning, sun-scorched scenery taking up just one of the many islands in the 400 square miles of the Panau archipelago. Packed with towns, villages, military installations, mountain ranges, missions and more, the demo will feature an astonishing amount of activities for the player... and opportunities for adrenaline-fuelled chaos are limitless. 

Hunt down and assassinate one of the game’s 50 military colonels; devastate military bases, bio fuel chambers, government infrastructure and more; hijack tuk tuks, military 4x4s, armoured vehicles, mopeds, helicopter gunships, light aircraft, mini vans and numerous other military and civilian vehicles; freefall from desert outcrops or from burning planes at 20,000 feet; and unlock one full, multi-stage mission, traversing the mountains to a heavily fortified government radar station and ending in an unforgettable desert car chase.

“The Just Cause 2 demo is simply massive and with so much to do, the replay value is enormous,” said Lee Singleton, General Manager of Square Enix London Studios. “It’s easily one of the biggest freeroaming demos of all time and for fans of openworld games, it’s unmissable.”

Does the government do a better job of choosing and providing care for individuals than the individuals themselves?

Can the government ultimately provide care for more people for less than private enterprise?

Does altruism actually work?

The answers to these questions are all no.

&gt;Does the government do a better job of choosing and providing care for individuals than the individuals themselves?

No.  An individual will best know what he is willing to purchase, assuming prices aren't driven sky high through misguided altruism on the part of the government (see the consumer price index for 1960-2000 and notice how the medical costs diverged from it shortly after the feds required employers to provide medicare coverage in order to make sure everyone had coverage.)

If we have federal care, just like in europe, some clerk will decide when and where we receive an operation.  Even in other countries, the health system decides whether or not they can afford to provide an operation or medicine.  In fact, there was one recent story about how the NHS is limiting a certain necessary medicine because it's costing too much.  CLERKS are deciding who gets it, not doctors.

How much of a leap from the feds providing care for everyone is it to the feds deciding to restrict fatty foods?  Cities have already been discussing trying to tax them.  Are you absolutely positive that the feds will not interfere or tax you for what you choose to eat, in the attempt to lower later medical costs?

&gt;Can the government ultimately provide care for more people for less than private enterprise?

I believe this is a no.  If you believe we have a private enterprise system now for medical care, you're wrong.  The federal government is deeply involved in it.  Huge amounts of the medical costs are already controlled or paid for by the feds.  There is very little free market in our current system.

&gt;Does altruism actually work?

You may believe differently. You may believe giving your old clothes to be sent to South Africa did wonderful things for them, but in reality all it did was destroy their textile industry.

Our welfare system has done more damage to people than if we'd not had one.  Our welfare system is *designed* to keep people on welfare.  Or at least it was.  It was designed out of altruism, to help people.  It didn't help anyone.

Charity is not defined by putting a gun to George's head to make him help Joe.

&gt;Just a thought, I could be wrong, but the old woman you speak of, doesn't she have medicare? I mean that would explain the ""free"" service although people contribute to medicare their whole working lives so it isn't a gift, so to speak.

The old woman did, but the point was that she was planning on using the ambulance from then on, in order to get faster er service, even if there are patients in critical need, just so she could get pain pills.

Actually he does mention that:

&gt;In hot countries, where air conditioning guzzles electricity, peak demand coincides with peak solar radiation. In the UK, peak demand takes place between 5pm and 7pm on winter evenings. Do I need to spell out the implications?

Even the ideal scenario where solar power coincides with peak demand, the small increase in value is still vastly short of the exorbitant cost. (This is a comparison you didn't quantify). For example; on the UK wholesale market, the spot price for peak power is about 20% higher than off-peak (baseload):

Are you a libertarian (standard American definition)?  If you are, why are you concerned with the president's views on science?  Libertarians typically believe the federal government shouldn't even be into science.  Education, libertarian philosophy goes, is a state (or local) issue...certainly nothing the president should be involved in.  If the president has no say in science/education, what issue is his opinion?  

If you are not a self-proclaimed libertarian (standard, American definition), what we're talking about is moot and does not need to be discussed.  If you are a European or some other type of libertarian (e.g., the definition Chomsky uses), this discussion about Ron Paul is moot as well.  

If you are a libertarian (standard, American definition), why do you care about the president's views on science provided you're taking science out of his hands?

&gt;I think the right to an abortion is a fundamental right, so I don't want states deciding whether abortion is legal or not.

I don't really want to get into abortion, but Dr. Paul's view on the issue is perfectly legitimate from a states' rights/small federal government libertarian perspective.  If you disagree, you disagree, but you can't say it's not in line with a states' rights view.  With all due respect, assuming you're a states' rights advocate, you can't just push whatever issue you want to the federal level so that states can't block what you specifically want (i.e., you get what you want).  

For instance, I believe national parks should be protected by the federal government and taken out of the hands of states.  But then again, I am being upfront with you and not masquerading as a states' rights advocate on this particular issue.  On many other issues, I consider myself a states' rights advocate.

I agree that growing more food will not stop world hunger. That is more of a political problem.

The health effects of eating meat are not bad at all. In fact, they do benefit us greatly, if you were just eating the meat. What about the amount of stuff that gets put into the meat? Growth hormones are the biggest thing here, and for those not living in the EU, antibiotics.

Napoleon threatened to invade the British Isles on a regular basis and even sort of tried it in Ireland where he counted on a sympathetic native population, but in contrast to Bill The Conqueror, he never actually pulled it off.

The only reason the Normans were able to do it is because in that pre-nationalistic age the peasantry at large would not have been greatly affected by the difference in rulers and were probably largely indifferent such that when Bill beat Harry at Hastings, all it meant to them is that a new set of assholes were in charge. 

Contrast that to the British Isles once the concept of ""nationhood"" had been established and what you have is a sort of extra-European bookend to Russia in that for different reasons having to do with geography (giant distances and harsh winters in the case of Russia, the English Channel in the case of the British Isles) Europe was boxed in to the east and west by two basically unconquerable nations.  The Spaniards gave it a shot with The Spanish Armada, but that came to grief due to weather and cunning British seamanship.  Napoleon tried a few landings with his excellently constructed fleets, but he met with disaster whenever he went up against the far superior British seamanship --and yes, in Nelson the British did have an unfair advantage, but there was only one Nelson and even after his death, the RN continued to kick the shit out of anyone who met them at sea.  (With the exception of the fledgling USN which won an unprecedented three frigate battles against the RN before the USS Constitution was taken by Captain Broke in the HMS Shannon, and which continued to whup small-vessel ass in the Great Lakes although it must be acknowledged that everything about the USN at that time --with the exception of their white coats-- had been taught to them directly by the RN, which is just to say that in a way, the RN was only ever beaten by its own offspring.) 

Ultimately, my point is this; once Great Britain was established as a nation, due to its island nature, it became unconquerable.  Hitler took that lesson from Napoleon and understood it far better than he understood what Napoleon had to teach him about Russia.

Key things to note are costs as Japan is a lot more expensive than the other options.  Taiwan is known for having tons of cheap good food.  China is well...China and it's huge and you can do practically anything depending on where you go.  Korea seems like a pretty awesome place too.

If you're not interested in Asian countries there is always the option of a tour of Europe or certain European countries.  Obviously UK is the easiest option while France is usually something that people always enjoy.  If you're interested in beer then Germany obviously, of course it has tons of other things as well :)

Personally it depends on money I guess and how much I want to spend.  In general since I've done China and Taiwan I'd probably go Europe or the South/East coast as those areas I haven't explored too much.

If you want places that are less touristy then there are many former USSR countries that are open to tourism and are usually pretty accommodating.  Hopefully that helps (haha probably not I just listed like a ton of places ._.)

Irish person here. I agree with the message but not with the mechanism by which it was sent. I'm rather surprised by this but then again Ireland is Israel's greatest critic in the EU. Recently our Foreign Affairs minister had to [enter Gaza](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0225/gaza.html) via Egypt because Israel denied him access to Gaza.  

To put the above story into context- there is significant sympathy for Palestine in Ireland.

There are several Palestinian solitary campaigns in Ireland, as well as Boycott Israel groups and a significant Irish present in NGOs operating in Palestine.

Personally I would have agreed if my government had chosen to expel the Israeli ambassador in light of Israels recent assault on Gaza. If evidence (highly unlikely) does emerge confirming a Mossad link to the assassination/passport issue I hope they do.

""Glory be to Allah, it seems that the secure place means martyrdom in Allah’s path. Subsequently, I asked one of the brothers to ask some people who know how to interpret dreams. The result was that some of them told me, “You will mobilize in Allah’s path,” while others told me, “The security organs will enter your house.” And I think that the vision has now been fulfilled, and that its interpretation – with Allah’s permission – is that I will mobilize in Allah’s path, and the security forces will enter my house, leading to a martyrdom operation which will be revenge for the killing of Abu Mus’ab al-Zarqawi and the killing of many of our brothers by the spy drones in Waziristan. So Allah willing, this is the meaning of the vision.""

That you would deny the role his religious beliefs play in his decisions is simply self-delusion.

&gt; Define ""a significant portion.""

[source](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/jul/24/terrorism.uknews) Well in Britain, for instance, 1 in 3 believe that ""Western society is decadent and immoral and should be brought to an end"". As long as there is Islam, holding peoples' morals and ethics back in the dark ages, there will be these people who will not be satisfied until the West is brought down.

&gt; You could almost say they hate us for our freedoms! Thanks for opening my eyes George Bush.

That's only one step up from a godwin. You have no adequate rebuttal so you resort to name calling. Classy. Here's the thing, there are plenty of muslims who have no desire to allow non-muslim culture to exist peacefully. In Britain, my country the number is 1/3rd of them.

&gt; The USSR ceased to be a ""Stalinist state"" after Stalin's death. It didn't have the best laws regarding freedom of expression, but it was fairly open, much moreso than Western propaganda would have you believe. 

Nonsense. The state remained beyond criticism, and vocal opposition was still not allowed. Stalin was still worshipped, his authority was passed down to his successors. Nothing changed, it's still ideology and dogma.

&gt; And suicide attacks are not exclusive to Islam or even to devoutly religious people, it has been a tactic in warfare for centuries.

Suicide tactics are almost exclusive to religious or similarly cult-based societies. Islam is almost exclusive in its use of suicide bombing targeting civilians (terrorism) instead of military targets (warfare). And Islam stands alone in the support its people have for suicide bombing ""in defence of Islam"". I'm sure you are aware of the gallup polls in which more than 50% of certain countries believe that suicide bombings are sometimes justified for such a reason. Do you claim that ""in defense of Islam"" is *not* a religious motivation?

&gt;Additionally most of Europe does not guarantee free speech or freedom of expression, and people are frequently prosecuted under speech laws. And those subversives who can't be dealt with through the obvious speech laws are usually dealt with in one way or another. The law has never stopped the ruling class from doing what they want.

Hah. Do you really want to compare the punishments of freedom of expression in the western world today with the freedom of expression in the Islamic world?

&gt; But it is silly to equate the two. If you seriously think Christianity is a significant influence on US foreign policy you're just as duped as the Evangelicals who vote Republican because they believe the same thing (not presuming you're from the US, but the fact remains).

I know that it played a part in the formation and location of Israel. I know that the US has had presidents who believe the end times were on their way and we needn't worry about destroying the environment (Reagan, for instance). I know that leading politicians have proclaimed that god is on their side and that the US army promotes the message internally that they are spreading the word of Christ to the Middle East. It affects US foreign (and domestic) policy in the same way that Islam taints the actions of Islamic theocracies. Just look at the league of Islamic countries in the U.N. who are trying to make it an offense to criticise religion. Does THAT have nothing to do with their religion?

&gt; Which part? That Europe participates in the imperial system? Countries like the UK, France, Germany and a host of others sell arms to third-world countries on a regular basis. They buy sweatshop goods and allow their companies to open sweatshops to exploit third world labor. If you honestly think Islam harms more people than this system that allows hundreds of millions worldwide to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week in unsafe working conditions for pennies a day then I'm pretty sure you're the one who's blinded by dogma, the dogma of the global capitalist order you've been indoctrinated with your whole life.

Boo hoo. Poor 3rd world countries. It has nothing to do with the fact that these countries, whose populations are predominately religious, have no infrastructure, corrupt governments, no labour laws or decent education to offer. Nothing to do with the fact that these governments *invite* these multinational companies (not countries - states don't buy sweatshops) to set up shop there, or that working in that sweatshop is often the best opportunity available. Yeah, let’s blame some random countries in the West and not the callous governments of the countries who fail in their duty of care to their own citizens.

&gt; But I don't encourage them to kill civilians! I support the Palestinians in their struggle against the genocidal apartheid regime of Israel that's illegally occupied their land for decades. Does this mean I'm partially responsible when one of them kills an Israeli civilian? Again, ridiculous.

You encourage them to kill civilians by supporting a social mindset where children grow up into impressionable mindsets instead of being taught the critical common sense that would enable them to reject the simpleminded and ignorant myths you hold, without good reason, to be true. The support of religious belief creates a gateway for these mainly young, mainly idealistic men and women to be convinced that their actions will be rewarded by your make-believe sky god. A person raised by society to believe in god and the Koran is far more likely to be twisted into an Islamic extremist than someone who is taught that it is bullshit and is instead raised to value rationality and logic over superstition and ignorance. You have no good justification that the risk is worthwhile and yet you do so anyway. This is digracefully negligent. By falling short of outright condemnation of all superstitious belief, you contribute towards the creation of such evil deeds. Shame on you.

It is more than possible that the dealer will try and up-sell them to a harder drugs. Also since most drug dealers sell harder drugs they deal with a seedier clientèle than you average cannabis user. They have to protect their product and their money so they keep guns on hand.

The question is are the busts you are reading about cannabis users or drug dealers.

Problems most people will throw at you.

problem 1 Cannabis is a gateway drug. This is one thing we have been told over and over again and sadly it is true. We are told that if we use cannabis we will become stark raving ax murdering lunatics. When we find out this is not so we wonder what other things we have been told about drugs are also lies. The second way that it is a gateway drug is up-selling by dealers. if they can get you hooked on a drug that is addictive and more expensive they can move less product and make more profit.

To counter this with legalization/decriminalization you only need to look at the statistics from the Netherlands and Portugal. Removing cannabis from the black market and establishing safe depositories/coffee houses prevents the up-sell and keep cannabis users from mingling with hard drug users. When you don't force the two social groups to mingle you will see almost no mingling of the two groups. Also by removing the negative stigma of pot use by legalizing you can focus on evangelizing the true harms of hard drugs. Even better if you look at usage statistics of the two mentioned regions of the EU you will see that while the surrounding countries have hard use percentages in the teens the countries in question have hard usage percentage at about half of that.

problem 2 cannabis users are gun toting maniacs. 

When is the last time you saw a pot smoking hippie deer hunting honestly...  When is the last time you saw a beer drinking hick in a peaceful drum circle.

problem 3 I'm sleepy and I can't remember problem 3

problem 4 cannabis can be detected for weeks when tested for so how will law enforcement detect if you are driving while intoxicated.

Testing technology has advanced so that cannabis use can be tested to see if it is actively affecting the user or just built up in the system.

I know these are just some of the issues to be dealt with in this endeavor but it should be enough to give you stable footing when discussing the issue with others.",,ejackman,0,0,,1426229542,0

The Constitutional Court has ruled in the past, that as long as German basic rights are protected to a similar degree on the European level, it would refrain from ruling on EU laws.

In this case, the court didn't rule on this question because it deemed the EU law to be flexible enough for the German government to implement it in a constitutional way (which it didn't before).

Should the court ever decide to rule on EU law, because it found that equal protection on the EU level is not provided for anymore or because it found the law in question to be fundamentaly unconstitutional, it could rule it void. This wouldn't change its status on the EU level, but it would enjoin the German federal and state governments from implementing it.

Should the court ever rule a EU law void, the only way for the German government to implement it would be through a change of the constitution. This would be difficult because Articles 1 (human dignity) and 20 (principles of state) are protected by the ""[Ewigkeitsklausel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_clause)"" and are in essence unchangeable.

From the article you sent to me:

&gt;*'... The most powerful men in the United States were themselves answerable to another power, a foreign power, and a power which had been steadfastly seeking to extend its control over the young republic since its very inception. The power was the financial power of England, centered in the London Branch of the House of Rothschild. The fact was that in 1910, the United States was for all practical purposes being ruled from England, and so it is today' (Mullins, p. 47-48).*

The article was quoting a book by Eustace Mullins and Gary Kah alleging that the federal reserve bank of new york was own and controlled by foreigners giving those foreign banking interests control over the entire US federal reserve system.  The article you sent to me as a citation concludes:

&gt;*""It does not appear that the New York Federal Reserve Bank is owned, either directly or indirectly, by foreigners.""*

The article doesn't go in any way into the topic of exactly who those foreign interests are or what their history is other than a passing mention of Rothchild.  So it's not even a citation supporting your earlier claim that the economic elite have their roots in 18th century Europe - which they may very well have.  

The article only mentions the Rothschild banking dynasty as a stockholder in the eight banks that together own 63% of the new york fed, and then goes on to rather completely debunk any notion that Rothchild might be able to wield any real influence.

A *real* citation would have been regarding that point of interest, rather than a passing mention of it in an article debunking the claim of foreign control of the fed.

&gt;In two independent datasets with 1872 elementary-aged children in 83 classrooms, Studies 1 and 2 examined the role of classroom context in moderating the relationship between child ethnicity and teacher expectations. For Study 1 overall and Study 2 mixed-grade classrooms, in ethnically diverse classrooms where students reported high levels of differential teacher treatment (PDT) towards high and low achieving students, **teacher expectations of European American and Asian American students were between .75 and 1.00 standard deviations higher than teacher expectations of African American and Latino students with similar records of achievement.** In highly diverse low-PDT classrooms in Study 1 and highly diverse low-PDT mixed-grade classrooms in Study 2, teachers held similar expectations for all students with similar records of achievement. Study 3 estimated the contribution of teacher expectations to the year-end ethnic achievement gap in high- and low-bias classrooms. **In high-bias classrooms, teacher expectancy effects accounted for an average of .29 and up to .38 standard deviations of the year-end ethnic achievement gap.**

So, no, it is perfectly acceptable to say that being certain minorities negatively effects your ability to succeed in school, through no fault of your own. Success as a black or latino student implies perseverance beyond that of other classmates.

The first workers' associations had its clearest expression through the liberal revolutions of 1848. The first International that organized labor movement after the revolution, was characterized by conflict between Marxism and anarchism. Paris Commune fell in 1871 and Marx won out in 1872. The First International collapsed in 1876.

An association of socialist parties - the other international - was created in 1889, and it was until 1914 a crucial importance for the development of socialism. Major issues of the Internationale was the fight against anarchy, the fight against revisionism and the struggle against militarism. The goal was a political transformation of society.

In and around the International took the intense theoretical discussions that eventually led to the developed a ""Marxism"" with a rigid and dogmatic system. The Marxist theories of ""historical materialism"" and ""dialectical materialism"" was of central importance.

At the end of the 1800s was the first socialist and social democratic parties formed. The German Social Democratic Party, SPD, was founded in 1875 and was the dominant party in the Second International. The party bore the stamp of state socialism and Marxism. The Norwegian was established in 1887 and was characterized by a social pragmatism. The British ""Labor Party"" was founded in 1900 and emerged as a social liberal party. Unions was central and had close ties to the radical bourgeoisie. In France the Socialist party first assembled in 1905.

When the Norwegian Labor Party had its first full program two years after the founding, it was strongly marked by the strongest social democratic party in Europe - the German SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany). The program was now a socialist goal. The development of the ideas of the Norwegian Labor Party was closely linked to the international socialist development.

..
The theoretical basis for social democracy is more advanced by moral convictions than by scientific analysis. Marx and Engels has described his own theories as ""scientific socialism"". But the Social Democrats never accepted the materialistic and systematic ideas of Marxism. The Social Democrats assumed a more moral critique of capitalism. In short, the social democracy and socialism outlined as morally superior to capitalism because people are ethical individuals related to each other.

The main confusion would be your own. You're confusing a proposed solution to the conflict with an opinion about its moral/historical aspects. UN 242 says practically nothing about the latter.

&gt; It may not always be simple

My point exactly. Really, everything said after this is just redundant.

If I may go off-topic, there's another way, probably the only real way, which you completely ignored. It involves getting two sides together, and working out the best compromise they can. They can cite international law, holy books, or the third season of Ren &amp; Stimpy, but in the end, it'll be decided by politics and an alignment of interests.

&gt; I believe that starting from the principle of international law--for example that it is inadmissible to acquire territory by force

The solution would have nothing to do with that principle. Israel acquired that land by force from Jordan and Egypt, but those countries relinquished all claims to that land. In fact, Israel never annexed those territories, and probably never will. Now what?

&gt; I mean, you can go on and say it's ""simply false"", but until you say something else in support of that assertion, I don't have any reason to believe you.

So you're ignoring HAMAS's opposition to the two-state solution, the fundamental disagreements between Israel and the Fatah regarding the refugees and the definitions of ""Israel"" and ""Palestine"", and the fact that no Palestinian faction currently have the power to enforce a peace agreement, while dismissing Israel's and the US's repeated statements, actions, and indeed, motivations in support of the two-state solution as ""lip service""?

Those are well known facts. You are either completely ignorant, or incredibly biased. In any case, the burden of proof is on you.

&gt; What does this suggest to you?

That Israel, like any sovereign state, doesn't want to answer to (and, face sanctions from) a foreign organization, especially since its worst enemies have a powerful bloc there? That the US supports Israel, and wants to broker peace on its own terms?

And seriously, the US paying lip service? The US, and not the Europeans,  Egyptians or the Turks, are the driving force behind the whole peace process. If they're just pretending, then they're really overdoing it. And really, if there's one country that doesn't have to pay lip service to anyone, it's the US.

Another study that references the use of religion to recruit can be found [here](http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/1/1/5/pages241154/p241154-7.php). As for your second source, it is picked apart by this journal article [here](http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf), which concludes: *""Those who believe suicide terrorism can be explained by a single political root cause, such as the presence of foreign military forces or the absence of democracy, ignore psychological motivations, including religious inspirations, which can trump rational self-interest to produce horrific or heroic behavior in ordinary people.""*

&gt; How many of those people are liable to be potential ""terrorists?"" I see no indication that one in three Muslims are at risk of being suicide bombers just because they have problems with the West.

You're confusing points. That thread of discussion stemmed from my assertion that there will always be people who are unwilling to tolerate the existence of Western culture, and the statistics support this. I don't know how many of these are potential suicide bombers (it's hardly the point), but I know that they are raised in a religious community that has a gigantically disproportionate portion of believers who hold support and even venerate the actions of suicide bombers.

&gt; Besides that, just because 1/3 of Muslims in Britain think Western culture should be ""brought to an end"" doesn't mean they have no desire to coexist peacefully within it in the mean time. Again you're going to have to show me that these Muslims advocate violence in order to achieve that end. If you can't, there's no reason to believe this is of any significance.

A cursory skimming of the source I provided you with reveals that 6% of those surveyed supported the violent actions of the suicide bombers. Try and tell me that's an acceptable statistic.

&gt; I think you need to study your history better. The US wasn't a stalwart ally of Israel until well into the 70's. The first country to recognize the state of Israel was the Soviet Union. The ""formation and location"" of Israel had absolutely nothing to do with American evangelicals.

You're confusing points. I was not referring to the US, but to the role Christian support of Zionism (also religiously, as well as nationally) driven, that was found in the British support of the establishment of the state of Israel. I'm sure you'd argue the immediate violence towards the new Israeli state by the Islamic world had nothing to do with religion.....

&gt; So let me just get this straight: You deny the West having any role, or a at least a significant role, in Third World exploitation? Please answer this question so I'll know if I should bother to continue to reply or if I'm talking to a hopeless racist chauvinist.

I've never denied anything. I've on numerous occasions argued that the 3rd World has been raped dry of resources and wealth by the old European Empires, giving mostly bad things (like bible-code laws) in return. But whilst that explains a lot of their hardships, it doesn't absolve of responsibility the corrupt governments and dictators who are failing in their duty of care to their citizens. You don't need natural resources to have a reasonable code of laws and regulations that would prevent or at least mitigate the exploitation of their citizens.

&gt; Yes, because ""these countries"" invite multinationals, not their autocratic leaders. The Third World is well known for its competent, democratic governance that serves the will of the people.

Kind of the point I was making.

&gt; And what's ""common sense"" again? Oh yeah, mindless liberal, imperial orthodoxy that enables the perpetuation of the exploitative and murderous imperial system.

No, it's a healthy scepticism which requires a reasonable burden of proof placed on those making claims, and an extraordinary burned placed on extraordinary claims. It's holding rules of reason and logic above the blind, stupid guesswork that is the foundation of Islam, like the majority of monotheistic religions. These influence these religions have had on the world can be clearly, inversely correlated towards the social and intellectual progress of mankind. When the Roman Empire collapsed and the Church filled the vacuum, Western culture went backwards, whilst a relatively liberal religion called Islam rescued and developed the spark of Greek rationalism and scientific method. During that golden age the scientific advancements of the culture were staggering. Then the authorities tightened Islamic regulations and began taking all that shit more seriously, and that Empire regressed into the stagnant cesspool of retardation it is today.

&gt; And a person raised in the West, growing up being taught liberal orthodoxy, is much more likely to blindly excuse the wrongdoings of his culture, just as you have done.

I don't blindly excuse anything. I just do not deny the contributory factor that a culture of irrational belief plays in producing people who can be coerced into committing acts of evil in the name of religion. By supporting belief in god and belief in the divinity of the Koran (again, correct me if you do not hold either of those views), you foster a culture conducive to the creation of these acts of violence, and in doing so fail your duty of care to your fellow man (particularly in supporting the particular religion that is being used to create the majority of deliberate murderous actions of civilians around the world). Only complete condemnation of the simple-mindedness that causes a man to wrongly believe in superstitious myths is acceptable considering the suffering such beliefs demonstrably cause around the world.

No, besides the practical and logistical problems in creating hundreds of thousands of daycare centers, it would be impossible to enforce and there would be riots in the streets and people being shot if they tried to do it.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, but maybe not.

&gt;Or would that be ""unconstitutional""?

Yes, I believe it would be a clear violation of the US Constitution.  Enforcing (or forcing) any behavior pretty much is.  (Prohibiting non-contextual behavior is, of course, a different matter.)  Some exceptions include things like going to school... that is a behavior that is mandated.  But it's also not without exception; there are several million kids in the US who do not go to school but are instead home-schooled.  

Such a thing would also go against the founding principles of the US.  While not a legal document, the Declaration of Independence declares that everyone has the inalienable (important word choice) right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""  Like I said, this is a principal, not a law.  But it's an important principle, and in this case, both the principle of liberty and the pursuit of happiness would conflict with mandatory daycare.  Staying home with one's child is considered a fundamental right.

And culturally, like I mentioned, things are so different (imagine this: the distance from Seattle to Miami is equivalent to the distance between London and Iraq, or something like that) that there would be huge cultural issues.  The cultural differences are sometimes just as striking, even though we all live under the same federal government and same constitution.  In fact, **the (physical) distance between Seattle and Miami (4400 km)  is a thousand km greater than the distance between Stockholm and Cairo (3405 km)**.  Obviously I am just making this a hypothetical example that omits cultural and historical factors, but imagine what people in Cairo would think about being under the same system as people in Stockholm, and vice versa.  It's VERY difficult to create cultural cohesion, let alone political agreement, in such a vast area with different cultural influences.  As is evident to anyone who watches US politics (and cries afterwards).  Just because we're under the same federal government doesn't mean that people in Alabama wants to pay for daycare for people in Portland and more than people in Saudi Arabia want to pay for daycare for people in Finland.  (I'm exaggerating somewhat, but it's not complete hyperbole.)

The fact that we are unified as much as we are amazes me, but it also tends to simplify the things about which there *is* cohesion.  Slogans, simple concepts, etc.

This is all probably irrelevant, anyway, due to the legal issues.

There is also much more power entrusted to each of the 50 states.  If a state wanted to experiment with government-provided daycare, so long as that was not mandatory, it would be a far easier thing to implement than to do so nationally.  Think of the US as more like the EU (at least in this way) and it make a *little* bit more sense..

How do you define tolerate?  They are living in a Western country and not trying to actively destroy it.  That sounds like ""tolerance"" to me.  Who cares if they find the West decadent and think the world would be better off without it?  Are you advocating thought crime?

&gt;but I know that they are raised in a religious community that has a gigantically disproportionate portion of believers who hold support and even venerate the actions of suicide bombers.

And the West has a population that supports and even venerates aggressive military action for purposes of economic expansion and exploitative trade practices.  Considering that I'm not really going to ""boo hoo"" about people who think fighting against such evil is justified, even if their methods (attacking civilians) are wrong.  They certainly don't cause nearly as much harm as the ideology of your average Westerner.

That's a very, very small statistic considering the legitimate grievances said suicide bombers have, even if their methods are unacceptable.  I'm honestly pleasantly surprised it's not higher.  I could probably find higher statistics for Americans, Britains, and Westerners in general who support things like the war in Iraq, or the illegal occupation of Palestine, or the war in Afghanistan.  Try and tell me *that* is an acceptable statistic.

&gt;You're confusing points. I was not referring to the US, but to the role Christian support of Zionism (also religiously, as well as nationally) driven, that was found in the British support of the establishment of the state of Israel.

[citation needed]

&gt;I'm sure you'd argue the immediate violence towards the new Israeli state by the Islamic world had nothing to do with religion.....

Of course not, it had to do with the fact that a (largely European) minority of Jewish settlers seized a great deal of land from a majority Arab population.  Are you going to say religion had more to do with this than the imperialist land grab and subsequent expulsion of natives?

&gt;I've never denied anything. I've on numerous occasions argued that the 3rd World has been raped dry of resources and wealth by the old European Empires, giving mostly bad things (like bible-code laws) in return. But whilst that explains a lot of their hardships, it doesn't absolve of responsibility the corrupt governments and dictators who are failing in their duty of care to their citizens. You don't need natural resources to have a reasonable code of laws and regulations that would prevent or at least mitigate the exploitation of their citizens.

Do you think colonialism doesn't still go on just because those countries aren't explicitly imperial domains now?  Please educate yourself on this subject.  Who supports these dictators?  Who benefits from their actions?

&gt;It's holding rules of reason and logic above the blind, stupid guesswork that is the foundation of Islam, like the majority of monotheistic religion.

Bigotry and ignorance does not strengthen your argument.  Islam is not blind, it is not stupid, and it is certainly not guesswork, and neither are most other religions.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of spirituality if you think it is ""guesswork.""  No one said ""Hmmm, I wonder where the world came from?  I'm going to guess 'God' and make it a religion!""  This is so obviously preposterous I don't even know how to respond to such a ridiculous statement.

&gt;These influence these religions have had on the world can be clearly, inversely correlated towards the social and intellectual progress of mankind. When the Roman Empire collapsed and the Church filled the vacuum, Western culture went backwards, whilst a relatively liberal religion called Islam rescued and developed the spark of Greek rationalism and scientific method. 

I like how your second sentence contradicts the first.  Moreover the fact that the Islamic world was once the most progressive cultural region west of China, yet now it is not, seems to imply that, in fact, the failings of the Muslim world today don't have a lot to do with some sort of inherent Islamic nature.  You want to have it both ways: You want to say Islam did better than Europe because Islam was more liberal, but at the same time there is something inherently self-defeating and anti-progress about Islam that makes the Muslim world so backwards.

&gt; How do you define tolerate? They are living in a Western country and not trying to actively destroy it. That sounds like ""tolerance"" to me. Who cares if they find the West decadent and think the world would be better off without it? Are you advocating thought crime?

I care because such a mindset is much more likely to tolerate violent efforts to remove it. ""No trying to actively destroy it"" - according to whom? There are an abundance of hate-filled Islamic clerics inciting uprising and violence in the UK, and plenty of lobbyists for the imposition of Sharia law on British society, and of legislation that prevents the criticism of their beliefs.

&gt; That's a very, very small statistic considering the legitimate grievances said suicide bombers have, even if their methods are unacceptable. I'm honestly pleasantly surprised it's not higher. I could probably find higher statistics for Americans, Britains, and Westerners in general who support things like the war in Iraq, or the illegal occupation of Palestine, or the war in Afghanistan. Try and tell me that is an acceptable statistic.

6% Support deliberate murder of citizens and you're *pleasantly surprised*? That just demonstrates how low your expectations for Islamic morality are. And it's a false comparison to compare it with support for a war waged against an aggressive regime (Taliban) and an admittedly messy war against a dictatorship who had long ago forfeited its country's right to sovereignty. Find me a statistic that demonstrates that a similar percentage of British, or other secular societies, that would advocate the deliberate murder of noncombatants in order to further a political position they support, and you would have a comparable statistic. I dare say the number would be incredibly small, because it is an action contrary to rational morality and evolved human nature. It should make a person physically sick. However, religion and similar ideology allows people to break through the mental block and commit such deeds because they believe they're doing it for the greater good.

&gt; Do you think colonialism doesn't still go on just because those countries aren't explicitly imperial domains now? Please educate yourself on this subject. Who supports these dictators? Who benefits from their actions?

Irrelevent smoke-and-mirrors argument number eleventy billion, yawn

&gt; Bigotry and ignorance does not strengthen your argument. Islam is not blind, it is not stupid, and it is certainly not guesswork, and neither are most other religions. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of spirituality if you think it is ""guesswork."" No one said ""Hmmm, I wonder where the world came from? I'm going to guess 'God' and make it a religion!"" This is so obviously preposterous I don't even know how to respond to such a ridiculous statement.

Criticism of religious thought is not bigotry, though it does not surprise me that you use this incredibly common reaction. There is no good reason to believe the claims of the Koran, claims that are made without any supporting evidence. Just like there is no good reason to believe in a god, or any superstition that has no supporting evidence. It has its origins, like Christianity and Judaism, in times where we understood comparatively nothing about the nature of the universe, and it is drastically wrong, and those who claim to follow it are either ignorant, deluded or lying. No, someone didn't just wake up one morning and decide there was a specific god, it was the evolution of lots and lots of guesswork.

&gt; I like how your second sentence contradicts the first. Moreover the fact that the Islamic world was once the most progressive cultural region west of China, yet now it is not, seems to imply that, in fact, the failings of the Muslim world today don't have a lot to do with some sort of inherent Islamic nature. You want to have it both ways: You want to say Islam did better than Europe because Islam was more liberal, but at the same time there is something inherently self-defeating and anti-progress about Islam that makes the Muslim world so backwards.

I contradict nothing. The old Islamic culture succeeded because it was less hardline, less fundamentalist. Religious grip, social progress, two diametrically opposed concepts. Support of one is opposition of the other. And if fundamentalism is so demonstrably a negative force, then it says something about the fundamentals (and yes, the inherent nature) of that religion. I somehow doubt you would, for example, ever find a Jainist fundamentalist advocating violence towards its critics, or the silencing of free expression.

&gt; Hahahaha, is that bolded segment serious? Or do hundreds of thousands of dead civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan not count because the murderer said ""oops!"" afterwards? Why do you differentiate between willful killing and the killing and murder that is inherent in both the status quo and in unjust imperial military actions?

I differentiate between deliberate murder and accidental manslaughter because they are drastically different motivation, even if the result is the same.",,DougieFFC,0,0,,1426229807,0

Germany is a monist state. That means that when Germany signs an international treaty, that treaty has instant effect in national law. The alternative is dualism - ie the UK. In a dualist system, when an international treaty is signed, the country must also make a national law before that law has effect. Therefore in Germany, any treaty has the same effect as legislation passed by the parliament.

On your first question - if an EU law is in conflict with national legislation, the EU law will take precedence and the national law will have no effect. The case with the Data Retention Directive is different. An EU Directive MUST be implemented in national law regardless of whether the country is dualist or monist. This means that each country can choose how to implement the law in their own way. For this reason, the German constitutional court has been able to strike the law down - because it was effectively a German law, even if required by the EU. The EU can place sanctions upon any country that fails to implement EU law, including throwing the country out.

On your second question - basically you are correct. 

As to whether there's an easy way to learn this? I've been in law for over ten years now and still don't get it all! The best way would be to find a school level law/politics book as this should explain things simply and clearly.

edit: countries can ask for exceptions under law, especially with regard to the big treaties - for example, neither the UK or Denmark are in the Schengen agreement - but then both are islands so we have that mentality I guess.

On the second; a dualist system doesn't have to implement every single law - for example, the ECA 1972 has a provision that simply says that any EU law must have precedence over UK law. But that provision is vital and is what gives effect to EU law. Dualism is more robust with regard to sovereignty. It's much simpler to repeal one law, than to extract oneself from a multitude of international obligations.

Just one further point: EU law has three forms - treaties, regulations and directives. Treaties are the big constitutional documents that form the EU and are binding.

You can’t have it both ways.

Who said it validated anything? I do recall reports that climate change phenomena were likely responsible for intensified storms, but nobody said storms proved climate change.

Oh, and warmer climates actually mean more snow, up to a point. Higher temperatures mean a higher vapor pressure, so that the air cannot ""hold"" as much water and more precipitation will occur. Obviously it still needs to be cold enough to snow in the first place, but you will see more snow the closer you are to that freezing point.

We've seen heavy snowfall in some areas, but we haven't seen particularly low temperatures.

Nobody had squelched publication of dissenting views.

But the paper was published despite him. And the paper was later debunked.

However, I wasn't trying to make you look like an idiot, so I was going to let it slide and not call you on it.

Where do you see any traditional hookah smoking nation using flavored tobacco?  You'd be laughed out of any country in the middle east.  The only thing that even comes close is naklia shisha, which is flavored tobacco in the way that chinese food is flavored rice.

Do I have an internet link for that history?  No, I don't, because my education doesn't come from google.  Read Lewis Caroll's memoirs or one of the good biographies (if it doesn't talk about pedophilia, it's not a good biography).  For that matter, read almost any British author's work from that time who could be expected to know about the black market: opium dens were a problem in Britain the way Starbucks is a problem today in America, and higher society was thoroughly disgusted by the practice, so it came up in social commentary a lot.  CS Lewis, Charles Dickens, etc, lots of other authors talk about it.

It happened in other cultures, too.  Tolstoy talked about it, for example.

The hookah is originally for hash and opium.  I was going to let that go because I didn't want to have some meaningless drawn out argument with a redditor who imagined himself savvy regarding middle eastern history, but since you're digging in for facts, let's do this.  The hookah is from India, which didn't have tobacco when it was invented.  It wasn't until the hookah had gotten into Persia (modern-day Iran) before someone applied it to Tombeik, which is a rudimentary tobacco.  When that happened, the tobacco went back to India, which significantly increased trade, like a small spice road.

Hookah isn't even the Indian word for it.  Hookah is what the Persians called it.  They're properly called ""ghelune"".

Why would the hookah be haram if it was for tobacco?  Tobacco isn't haram.  Opium is.

The reason hookahs spread into Europe was that opium dens knew that four people on opium would look at a shared piece of drug and think of it as all-their-own, allowing the opium den to charge more for what amounted to less.  There is no shortage of photographs of people smoking machine rolled cigarettes in front of their hookah.  Why would they be doing that if they were smoking nargile?

Will I find this for you on the internet?  No.  I don't have the time or the interest, and I'm not your secretary.  Do it yourself if you're interested.

It's not the end of the world, but any self-promoting science needs to be taken with a grain of moderation.

So true. I used to trust scientists, but, thanks to Fox News and drive-time AM radio, I have a much better understanding of the role that greed and self-promotion play in all this. The reach of the self-interest and cover-up goes all the way through the U.N. committees, it seems. The stakes are huge: most climate researchers enjoy 9-digit net worth and access to the company of top supermodels, in contrast to the simple, homespun manner of corporate leaders, who drive second-hand cars and work in plain, filing-cabinet offices. I have also caught scientists outside the direct sphere of the payola lying about climate: biologists studying plant populations often make up stuff about changing conditions so that they can feel cool at the lunch table with all the other scientists, or maybe because they're on the take as well.

It is too bad that we can't trust anyone. I have learned that whenever corporate profits are at stake, those speaking against corporate interests are always biased, even when there is no evidence available to draw that conclusion. Other examples include air bags and smoking: with air bags, it has become clear that the management of GM was correct to oppose a device which would save thousands of lives, but at a cost of fatal injuries to a few dozen short adults and children; as for smoking, we eventually found out, through the sworn testimony of tobacco executives, than the health hazards were completely overblown.

It's really nice that I'm so objective. People I know personally are much better informed and less biased than climate scientists, with their grants and meetings and research which just clouds their mind to the truth - I really dislike it when people go to Europe and wear nice suits, because I think they learned to look down on me at their Ivy League colleges. I am smart enough to step back from their tunnel vision and listen to what more balanced observers on the radio and in our executive suites have to say. These are our real leaders - guys with the know-how to get 'er done! - and are more likely to have Christian values besides.

My automatic skepticism of stuffy academics, and my personal acquaintance with some HVAC and software engineers who have a less biased perspective - and who do not think they're better than me - helps me keep up a healthy doubt of the authorities. If you consider the Copernican principle, you can clearly see the self-interest of Copernicus and Galileo at work: promulgating theories for the sake of attention and fame.

&gt; That sounds like rational behavior to me.

Nobody said anything about your behavior.  Given that your position doesn't have a rationale, it isn't rational.  Spin that word as hard as you want.

&gt; Even if I had excellent logic, my hazy ideas about the mechanisms would have undermined accuracy - look at Aristotle.

Nobody said anything about your accuracy.

&gt; Incredible thinker, completely wrong about the composition of the universe.

Er.  Aristotle's idea of the universe was quite a bit closer to correct than the 1200 years of people that followed him, despite that they had better data.  If you think that's an indictment of the power of appropriate logic, I don't know what to tell you.  Almost the only egregious error he made was the celestial spheres, which were famously maintained until Kepler's time as the global belief.  

In the meantime, he understood elemental chemistry, natural selection and motive physics, something most people in Europe in the 1600s still had wrong.  Aristotle's contemporaries also had calculus before Newton/Leibnitz, the factory line before Henry Ford, and had so many other things nailed early (fallacy, logic, mode of government, popular behavior, etc) that here nearly 2500 years later, we're still using the terminology they - and in some cases, he - coined.

I don't know why you think he was completely wrong about the composition of the universe.  By and on the whole, he was correct.  He understood that the sun was a giant pile of fire, he understood that celestial bodies were in orbit (though he misunderstood why), et cetera.

&gt; and it was fairly lazy to post it to reddit knowing I'd get a response instantly confirming or denying the accuracy of my ideas. To quote Fred Schneider, ""before I talk, I should read a book."" But I don't think you can extrapolate that I'm terrible at science from that.

I didn't.  My observation that you're terrible at science comes from a very different root, and is not an extrapolation at all.  I also didn't say anything nearly so melodramatic: what I said was that the thing you were doing at the time was not science despite your claims, and that I wondered whether you knew what science was.

It's unfortunate that you feel the need to put such ugly words into my mouth.  Unfortunate, disingenuous, and arguably dishonest.  Why are you trying to vilify me?

Also, given that you even admit don't know what the scientific method is, what it's for or why it matters, how can you take the position that you aren't terrible at science?  Isn't that kind of like a guy saying ""I don't know how to play an instrument or sing, I don't know any songs and I don't know tonal structure, but that doesn't mean I'm not terrible at music?""

Do you really think that just because you want to do science means you aren't bad at it?  Do you really think you can fail to understand the sole principle on which a field is build as well as its importance, correct usage and application, and yet not be terrible at that field?

What would it take, in your eyes, to be terrible at science?  You mean sticking a bunch of unrelated sciency-sounding words together at random angles without data or underlying mechanism really isn't enough?

&gt; Probably, the fact that I've done chemistry for a while now and have no experience at all with physics or biology has something to do with the comparative dumbness of my original post.

Nope.  The difference between chemistry and alchemy is the thing you said you don't know about.

&gt; Sorry, my bad. I'll never talk about something I'm not fully qualified to talk about again.

He says at the end of a post full of doing exactly that.

&gt; Please don't compare me to TimeCube. I've read the site, and the comparison is not fair.

Isn't it?  Other than his emotional problems, what he's doing is sticking together a bunch of ideas he had and calling them science.  There's no underlying principle, there's no underlying mechanism, there's no underlying data, and he's telling the world.

Let's look at the Taliban. The Taliban was actually an improvement in Afghanistan, after the collapse of the socialist government reduced the country to anarchy and civil war. The problems the Pakistani government is having with the Taliban are of their own making. The ISI - Pakistan's CIA - has aided and abetted the Taliban, and has even harbored them. They created their own mess (with a lot of help from us, too). Pakistan must solve this problem.

Let's look at Al Qaeda. They are a criminal organization. They can talk big about fighting a ""war"" against the West, but they have no more capacity to do this than the Mafia. We didn't take out the Mafia by bombing Sicily. We took them out by calculated strikes against their leadership. Al Qaeda should be dealt with similarly. We should be engaged with the *police forces* and intelligence agencies of our allies to root out safehouses in places like Hamburg. We should have sent in special forces to capture Osama Bin Laden like we did Noriega.

&gt;Within two years the western media thoroughly demonized Saddam Hussein as the man who “killed his own Kurds at Halabja [he did not], whose troops ruthlessly butchered helpless babies in incubators in Kuwait [they did not], and who collectively terrorized the defenseless Kurds and Shiite Muslims in the south of Iraq [they did not].

Joost Hiltermann, who was the principal researcher for the Human Rights Watch between 1992-1994, conducted a two-year study of the massacre, including a field investigation in northern Iraq. According to his analysis of thousands of captured Iraqi secret police documents and declassified U.S. government documents, as well as interviews with scores of Kurdish survivors, senior Iraqi defectors and retired U.S. intelligence officers, [it is clear that Iraq carried out the attack on Halabja](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/opinion/17iht-edjoost_ed3_.html), and that the United States, fully aware of this, accused Iran, Iraq's enemy in a fierce war, of being partly responsible for the attack.

*Unless the former principle researcher at Human Rights Watch is part of the conspiracy, too...*

&gt;though European troops were rushed to the Gulf in out-of-date ill-fitting desert camouflage there was no such problem for the US forces. 

*(Implying that the Gulf War was planned well in advance.)*

Uh, no, they didn't. When my father boarded the C140 taking him to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield, he was wearing woodland camo. In fact, almost every member of his unit was, too. The lack of adequate stockpiles of uniforms and paint led to two different uniforms, the chocolate chip pattern and the four(?) color desert pattern being used for the duration of the conflict. Vehicles were shipped unpainted and hurriedly painted in-theater. Some weren't painted at all. The Army Materiel Command (or whatever it was called then) *does* stockpile uniforms of all sorts of configurations, for occasions just like this, but it was slow work distributing them all. Stockpiling isn't indicative of conspiracy, either. When I was in the Army I went to Alaska for cold weather survival training. When I got there I was issued cold-weather gear from an aircraft-hangar sized building that probably stocked hundreds of thousands of uniform overcoats in snowy white. Is this indicative of plans to invade Sweden?

&gt;When the Iraqis retreated from Kuwait, American forces violated mutually agreed cease-fire terms by shooting more people in the back with radioactive 30mm Depleted Uranium (DU) shells than Joe Stalin could have imagined in his most vivid dream. Unluckily for its human targets, the CIA was out to prove Joe Stalin a mere simpleton with a strictly limited imagination.

I can only assume the author is referring to the Highway of Death. Shooting a soldier in the back who hasn't surrendered (the Iraqis hadn't, despite what the author thinks) [is perfectly legal](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp).

&gt;Within 24 hours of the Bush accusation the Iraqi government denied setting fire to the oil wells and urgently called on the United Nations Security Council to send a team to ""Investigate the destruction of non-military installations in Kuwait"": a curious response from the Iraqi government if it was guilty of the alleged crime. The American-dominated Security Council dismissed the request out of hand. 

Besides the fact that this statement is ridiculous, what point would burning $1.5 billion in oil *if the whole exercise was to get that oil?* Not only that, but over 700 wells were burned. That means dozens, if not hundreds of sorties would have been needed to start the fires, requiring hundreds, if not thousands of complicit co-conspirators *all* of whom have remained quiet to this day.",,cryptovariable,0,0,,1426229975,0

I have been using Atoma for about 5 years.  I love it.

* Will it fall apart if I drop it from say 4 to 5ft?

Nope - there are 10 rings holding each US Letter page, 11 rings for an A4.  Each hole has two claws.  So that is 20 or 22 claws holding each page in place.  I can suspend a 500 gram notebook by a single page and jiggle it up and down without the page coming out.

* Has anyone disc punched a 3-hole punched paper, will it hold up?

The Atoma books use 90gsm paper.  Photocopier paper is 80 gsm and it works OK too.  You can punch 3 hole paper OK, but how well it behaves depends on how thick it is and that is generally a function of the price.  For the price of the punch, you can buy a lot of paper.

* Does crappy standard thin lined paper work well with the disc system?

Crappy standard thin paper does not work well in any system, and that includes 3-ring binders and the smallest room in the house.  You deserve better.  However, 10 or 11 anchor points are better than three.  The problem with thin paper for any kind of binding is that it kinks easily and this makes the pages hard to turn.

The upside of the Atoma-style binding (they started it) for students is that you can:
* carry one book with you during the day, and fan your work out to separate books overnight.  
* put your new work at the front of the book (by moving blank pages from the back one at a time when you need them) so your most recent stuff is at the front where you don't have to dig for it
* mix your paper types (lined, blank, squares, music etc) at the back so you can put it in place when you need it
* repopulate the book to replace all the pages that get turned into paper darts during boring lessons - so you don't end up with an embarassingly thin book at the end of the year.
* insert handouts, library copies and other external media into the right place

Downside: An 11 hole punch (from Atoma or Myndology) is about 4 times more expensive than a good quality 3 hole punch.  Seems that the punch manufacturers charge by the hole.

US Letter Atoma bindings are available from Myndology in the US.  The Levenger product uses different rings and is probably not totally compatible.
A4 can be bought from Manufactum in Europe, and an Atoma online store in Australia, of all places.

[The multitouch patent](http://www.google.com/patents?id=uuioAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false)

I'm not exactly sure what the ""claim"" is, but I'm guessing this (it says ""abstract"", correct me if I'm wrong):

&gt;A multi-touch system is disclosed that recognizes simultaneous touchdown of four fingers on, above, or below the home row of keys as a modifier chord and applies modifiers such as Shift, Ctrl, or Alt to subsequent touch activity until none of the chord fingertips remain touching. Touches by the thumb of the modifier chord hand that occur before any modifiable typing or clicking activity cause the modifier chord to be canceled and reinterpreted as hand resting. The Shift modifier may be released temporarily during thumb keypresses that are intermixed with typing of capitalized characters. Distributing the modifier chord touches across different zones or key rows selects multiple modifiers. In an alternative embodiment, different modifiers can be selected with different arrangements of the fingers relative to one another within the chord, irrespective of absolute hand alignment with the touch surface.

The first line pretty much sums it up, four fingers touching at once (I incorrectly assumed it was only two). That's pretty vague to me, which is why it wasn't allowed in Europe. They don't want anyone else to be able to use touch screens with many touches at once, end of story. The Minority Report should have that patent.",,LinuxFreeOrDie,0,0,,1426230095,0

THIS country was built on a campaign of genocide against the indiginous peoples who already living here.  And the one advantage WHITES [made of a number of European peoples] had was their damned disease infested cultures.  
Without disease decimating the native populations Europeans would have had infinitely larger groups to wage war against in order to lay claim to North and South America.

And as for being Irish.  I can't stand any of the dumb as bricks Irish bastards that stand with the other Europeans that make up the American White Power movement.

As what your ""semi"" wine may be, it depends on whether or not it was truly sweet. If it was a sweet ""Semidulce"" red then it may have been one of the sweet Garnacha (Grenache) from the Montsant region of Catalonia near Barcelona. 

If it wasn't sweet, meaning that you couldn't perceive any noticeable sugar in the wine, then you may have actually been ordering a ""Semi-crianza"" wine which is a wine that only spent a few months in oak rather than the typical 6 months required for regular Spanish wines labeled ""Crianza"". Sometimes a ""semi"" wine is one that was just fermented in the barrel rather than aged. This gives the wine very muted oak characteristics that play second fiddle to the fruitiness of the grape. 

If the wine you had was dry, then this is likely what you had. As for what grapes it could have been. Hard to say since there are so many in Catalonia but most likely it included at least one of their big 3 grapes-Tempranillo, Garnacha and Carignan.",,Ashlynkat,0,0,,1426230107,0

Many people consider their car payment a bill like the electricity, phone, or cable.  Equity in a car worth didley.  The only thing it's good for is in case it gets stolen or totaled, you won't owe the finance company anything.  

5) You can do the math yourself, but you'll just have to run through examples.  When figuring out your depreciation, always use KBB trade in value, then deduct a thousand or two.  That's closer to what it will actually be worth.  

Recommendation: Don't fall for the 0% finance unless you know for fact that you will own the car through the term of the loan at a minimum.  The reason is that actual cash values (ACV) are calculated from triple net wholesale.  Meaning, depreciation starts from the wholesale - rebates - holdback.  If you don't take the rebate, then you are automatically in the hole for the amount of the rebate.  

A used car with a low finance rate on a loan that you pay off in a year will cost near nil in finance charges, so it's not even worth talking about.  Get the used car that doesn't stink, that seems reliable. Avoid any used European car.  They have reliability ratings far below American, and their parts are triple.  The brands you are looking for are Toyota, Honda, Hyundai (they've come a very long way), and Subaru.  They are far and above anything else on the road.  Avoid Kia at all costs.  Shy away from Mitsu and Nissan.

Hmm, you've defended Osama Bin Laden by suggesting that he's *only killing civilians because he can't kill the military*. That's apologism. And the more time you use phrases like *""murderous imperialism""* the less impact it has.

&gt; That's in the real world, not in the ridiculous hypothetical super weapon scenario you highlighted. This is why I find hypotheticals like that incredibly silly: They have absolutely no basis in the real world which shapes our decisions.

On the contrary, it is very easy to see what a world where Osama Bin Laden has absolute power. Take a look at Afghanistan under Taliban rule. He has gone on record with his support of this regime that practiced genocide, and murdered its citizens for no good reason.

&gt;This is vile revisionism. First of all, Muslims in the Middle East had no particular problem with Jews until the state of Israel.

Now this *is* revisionism. There are numerous examples in history leading up to the formation of Israel when Jews were transgressed by Middle-Eastern muslims. Granted, the persecution of Christian Europe (and the charge of deicide) just as bad, but we have (to name a few):

- Massacres in Palestine (1929)
- The murder of 300,000 Jews in Morocco over a 16-year period between 1864 and 1880 (wow, that's cold, I didn't even know about that)
- 1840 Damascus affair (and subsequent riots)
- Prevalent support for and collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War among Islamic countries.
- The concept of *dhimma* in countries under Islamic theocratic rule, which restricts the freedoms and humiliates the dhimma (in accordance with the Koran). 

I would say the Middle-East had frequent issues with Jews (unsurprising as their holy scripture calls Jews the ""greediest of mankind""), certainly sufficient for them to continue to fear for their safety, and so wish for a state of their own to end the cycle of persecution (there was also the small of their systematic extermination in Nazi-occupied Europe), though you seem to imply that the Jews had no good reason to wish to not live in an Islamic country under Sharia law. It is simpleminded and reductionist to claim the partition was unfair because of Jewish minority, because it completely overlooks the purpose of the state, which was to swell under the numbers of Jews fleeing to a state that will, for the first time in modern history, actually look out for their best interests.

&gt;I guess you just have go to for the atheism reddit to find people using this tired bigotry, despite the fact that when doing so they are supporting the actions of a murderous theocratic regime.

Steady on cowboy. Please explain how me saying ""I can see why they react to these things"" is any more supporting their actions than you saying ""I can see why suicide bombers do the things they do"" is supporting the actions of suicide bombers? Looks like yet another example of your double standards. And last time I checked Israel was a democratic republic.

&gt; If you think Israel hasn't been the transgressor in the Middle East (to say ""Muslim world"" is a misnomer, since again most of Israel's historical allies have been secular Arab governments) then you're either a shill or a useful idiot.

I think anyone who views the opposing sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict with anything less than condemnation for both sides is either guilty of bias, or knows something that is unavailable to the public domain. Calling either side the ""transgressor"" (as you seem to) is a refusal to acknowledge the imperfect knowledge and conflicting accounts of various key incidents, and the sure truth that who ""fired the first shot"" will always depend on where you start time running from. It is arrogant to presume perfect understanding, and infantile to think that it matters when deciding on how to solve the gigantic mess.

Edit: Another funny thing about your way of thinking is that you appear happy to support international law when it supports your argument (""Illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq, Israel's illegal occupation of territories etc.""), but you throw it out when it suits you (""They were right to oppose this ruling""). Make your mind up! Either international law is worthwhile and must be respected, or it's useless and should be ignored for the greater moral good. Personally I favour the latter - I think an International legal system that does not implement the removal of governments that carry out genocide against its own citizens (Iraq, Afghanistan), or recognises the sovereignty of, and works with governments that are not elected in free and fair elections, pretty worthless too.",,DougieFFC,0,0,,1426230138,0

[Fun With Research: Higher Fuel Prices Increase Economic Productivity](http://www.planetizen.com/node/42125)

**EDIT for elaboration: **

Right now, Americans have a warped sense of what our highways cost because we pay a very small portion of that cost through gas tax when making the decision of which mode to take. The real cost of highway travel is wrapped up in various other costs such as federal funding through taxes, sales tax, registration fees, ...the list goes on. With current practices, consumers pay for road and parking facilities indirectly, through general taxes and bundled with building rents, regardless of how much they drive.

Since the United States does not have a handle on how much their transportation costs them, they make judgments based on that misconception. They over-consume. It seems perfectly reasonable to an American in certain portions of the country, to live 45 miles from work, because that trip in a fuel efficient car with no traffic, contributes around $1 to the cost of that highway through gas tax while the burden for the highway gets dispersed over the general public. It is normal to waste 2 hours every day traveling to and from ""the city."" 

People in Europe on the other hand, pay for *all of their infrastructure* at the pump through gas tax. Gas taxes in Europe span anywhere from $4-$7/gal. *This does not include the cost of the gas.* Because you are very aware of that cost, you make decisions differently. You perceive more value in living closer to work and living closer to the things you need on a daily basis. 

*There is a value* to living closer to the things you do regularly. When gas prices go up people try to spend less on gas and as a byproduct, make their lives more efficient, allowing them to be more productive. We spend less time in the car and more time creating wealth.

I think the oversimplification is coming from your part because that's not at all what I'm saying.

I wasn't referring to any culture in particular.

In generational terms, though, that's only growth if the religion retains, on average, 3 children per family.  If you have two siblings, all of whom are taught that the Bible is fact, and one of them converts to another religion or renounces religion altogether, then your religion has only sustained itself over a generation, not grown.

My point is that, if you boil the growth of religion down to indoctrination, then you have to back that explanation by demonstrating birth rates, low infant mortality rates, retention rates, and so on.  Historically, though, it's clear that conversion has played a differential role even when there's no reason to suppose that birth rates differed significantly between two competing religious groups.

&gt; Many people are forced to deal with christianity and accept otherwise they don't get aid, and they starve.

I don't actually see much evidence of that, though.  In the case of Africa, for example, aid seems to have been less of a factor than the overt colonization of the last century.  Belgian, English and French governments ran the educational system, and put it, in many cases, in the hands of Jesuits, which promoted the growth of Christianity in the region.  I'd say that's probably more complicated than indoctrination, but to simplify things, we can call it that for now.  Part of the catch here is that, while that indoctrination *did* increase Christianity's hold on the country, the moment European-Christian interests released their hold, those gains began to reverse themselves.  So now we witness the overt resurgence of native religion and culture, as well as the incursion of Islam in previously Christian regions.

First off, the Japanese were not going to surrender at the time without the nukes. They had tried to surrender before, yes, but in a separate peace with Stalin. They wanted a deal that would maintain their government and Empire. Even after the 2nd bomb fell, (the Japanese wanted to continue after Hiroshima, believing, correctly, that they could inflict massive casualties on a U.S. invasion force and also due to the fact that they believed the USA only had the one bomb), the Japanese command was split 3-3 on surrendering, which was only broken by the Emperor himself (and even then there was an attempted coup). An invasion or blockade would've resulted in far more deaths, and on both sides.

Second, these were small nukes. In comparison to cold war bombs, they were insignificant.

Third, the USA dropped leaflets for most conventional bombings and Nagasaki. Hiroshima did not have leaflets for obvious reasons.

Fourth, the bombs served a dual purpose in scaring off the USSR, which had already conquered half of Europe. This was the fact of the era, as the cold war was beginning.

Finally, the nukes were less deadly than the conventional bombing on Japan. Firebombing killed far more people. And Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both major military-industrial centers. If the USA was trying to kill civilians they would've leveled Tokyo and killed the Emperor.

Thanks for the reasonable reply. I'm not sure this is the place to go into too much detail about the reasons for my choice, but let me see if I can sum it up in a non provocative way. Even though I spent most of my life in opposition to the group structures of believers, I had a personal sense of agnosticism/belief which varied back and forth over the years. Long story short I admitted to myself that I believed *enough* and developed personal structures for addressing that belief. I clearly do not claim any detailed understanding of the nature of God as I believe (""If I knew God, I would be God"" -Rabbi Joseph Albo). Also I do not claim that what I believe should be forced on strangers or friends.

At a certain point I came to the conclusion that I wanted more structure in dealing with my belief. I then spent a few years studying various Eastern &amp; Western systems and found what fit me best. The process of becoming a Jew (generally) requires at least a year of study and extensive changes of behavior and lifestyle. As per my previous comment about the size of the local community, peer pressure played no part in the process, I could have backed out any time I wanted to.

&gt;the freedom of ideas means that they are free to be examined and critiqued.

Exactly. I agree completely. My reply was to point out that the process of examining competing sets of ideas does not always lead to the conclusion you describe. I came to a conclusion on my own and continue to educate myself on the system I chose as well as the thoughts of others. I have my opinion, other people have theirs. Even I dont agree, thats no reason to belittle the other person or their ideology. ""I dont agree with your idea"" vs ""You are stupid for believing that and your belief system makes no sense"".

FWIW, of course I was curious about the ""contradictions and obvious errors"" which are so often pointed out. There's no need to go into point by point discussion here, thats not the subject at hand. Suffice it to say that I now understand many of these matters are addressed in with internally consistent logic. Note however, and this is a very important point, most of the objections that the secular community have towards the ""contradictions and obvious errors"" of the Hebrew Bible (AKA the Torah, not the ""Old Testament"" (for Jews its not old, it wasnt replaced therefore cant be old)) are based on the idea that it applies to them in any way. The strictures of the Hebrew Bible apply only to Jews. The best way to explain it is that the text is far more of a legal code than anything else. What makes the text harder to understand is that many of the difficult to understand and ""vicious insanities"" are not explained in the primary text, but in a separate, large and not very easy to understand set of texts known as Talmud.

TL;DR summary of last paragraph: The Hebrew Bible doesnt apply to non Jews anyway.

&gt;What I find interesting is how you slight atheists in your last two paragraphs

Any sleights are perceived not intended. ""Atheist"", ""agnostic"", ""humanist"" and other common terms found in these threads seem to have *very* different meanings to different members of the community. This is *to me* interesting as I said. Interesting is not a pejorative here. I also find it interesting to read arguments on Talmudic logic which often hinge on the meaning of one single word of source text. The arguments in /r/atheism are not the defining characteristic of the group but they are *quite* common here.

&gt;Then you go on to comment on how atheists don't understand the major religions and their place in history.

This is my opinion. I see alot more talk of ""sky wizards"" and low grade slams on believers *en mass* than anything else. I really dont sense very much understanding in the threads here of an understanding of the differences between the three major Abrahamic faiths, much less the sub-divisions of each or how the competition between them or internal schisms have affected history. I see pretty much zero understanding of non Western belief structures &amp; their historical influences. Note well: the last two sentences are about *my perception* of discussions, *not* about any particular participants of the discussions or individual levels of knowledge.

Given the question: ""name two historical leaders, one from Europe &amp; one from Asia, who challenged existing religious power structures successfully and describe the outcomes of each in terms of the impact to local society,"" how many people might be able to answer that? The reason I ask this is I think understanding history is absolutely essential to human progress and it is impossible to deny the importance of belief structures in human history. A community which prides itself on logic and reason should in my opinion understand itself in a historical context.

&gt;The throwaway final sentence about 'parroting the Dawkinsist party line' reveals your patronising attitude to atheism.

I only add a bit of milk and a bunch of sugar..and then to top it off I put in some whiskey.

The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas tree lights and reported that they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved as if under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name - in the European Theater of Operations they were often called ""kraut fireballs"" but for the most part called ""foo-fighters"". The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.[9]

There's no way if we'll ever know if ""the Japanese were not going to surrender at the time without the nukes"", because the means by which surrender could be achieved were not yet exhausted.

Prior to announcing the Potsdam Declaration, Henry Stimson wrote to Henry Truman, 

&gt;""I personally think that if in saying this we should add that we do not exclude a constitutional monarchy under her present dynasty, it would substantially add to the chances of acceptance [of surrender].""

This suggestion was eliminated from the Potsdam declaration in favor of absolute surrender, a humiliating conclusion for the Japanese culture of the time. Henry Stimson would later write,

&gt;""It is possible, in the light of the final surrender, that a clearer and earlier exposition of American willingness to retain the Emperor would have produced an earlier ending to the war.""

Before killing several thousand civilians, it'd be comforting to at least have these diplomatic avenues explored as an alternative.

&gt;Second, these were small nukes. In comparison to cold war bombs, they were insignificant.

As far as this debate is considered, that's simply a non sequitur. I have yet to fathom as to why the technological advancement of nuclear weapons during the Cold War should have any impact on the justification of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

&gt;Third, the USA dropped leaflets for most conventional bombings and Nagasaki. Hiroshima did not have leaflets for obvious reasons.

Again, what does the dropping of leaflets have to do with the justification of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

&gt;Fourth, the bombs served a dual purpose in scaring off the USSR, which had already conquered half of Europe. This was the fact of the era, as the Cold War was beginning.

Only a justification to staunchest believers in *realpolitik*. While it could be construed as a potential benefit coming at the cost of thousands of lives, it's a highly contestable notion, since the development and usage of the bombs served to heighten the arms race.

&gt;Finally, the nukes were less deadly than the conventional bombing on Japan. Firebombing killed far more people.

Again, I have no idea how this relates to the justification of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Keep in mind, for items 2, 3, and 5, you've stated several propositions, but no conclusions. I don't see how the occurrence of a worse atrocity excuses or alleviates another atrocity.

&gt; And in all honestly, the USA defeating Japan, heavily contributing in Europe, and then fighting the USSR until 1991 is penance for any wrongs.

If you do enough rights, your wrongs are dismissed?

Yeah, it may not be the best possible analogy, but it's the first one that came to mind. 

Guns are a tool. They project a small piece of metal fairly rapidly out of a hole in the direction it's pointed. Sometimes a tool like this can be very useful. It can also be enjoyable to work on the skill of getting that piece of metal to end up going where you want it to. (Golf comes to mind here as having similar difficulties in achieving this.)

As for you personally? Living in Europe may make it impractical and difficult to do. If you ever move to a place where gun ownership is not so discouraged, it may be something to look into.

It could easily turn into Britain, with limited help from the US (and puppet Colombia) and maybe a European country here and there, vs the majority of South America and maybe some Central American/Caribbean countries. That war could last several months. However, I think it's more likely that diplomacy will prevent that from happening.

The most likely conflict we'll see occur in the next decade or so is a confrontation between the US and China. China is itching for a fight and behaving provocatively, and to a certain extent, the US is as well. China very much wants to challenge US power in the Far East and could easily win a short war. I've seen very plausible scenarios laid out by people more knowledgeable than I about how China could use the pretext of a naval incident (they destroy a US Navy ship, claim it was an internal explosion/accident, then await a US response) to shift the balance of power in the region decidedly in their favor. The US would be forced to either look like they're turning an accident into a pretext for war, or do nothing and accept the loss while sitting on their hands (neither is particularly attractive). If the US responds with military force, things would spiral out of control very quickly. China would likely target US bases and naval vessels in the area with a deadly barrage of cruise and ballistic missiles, making it difficult or impossible for the US to mount attacks of their own without bringing in more naval forces. After dealing their devastating blow, the Chinese would likely sue for peace, making further retaliation against them impossible. China would come out as the victors and the US would be left picking up the pieces of their bases and ships. The balance of power would shift very far away from the US if that were to happen.

If that happens, a third world war would be all the more probably as the US, now a wounded giant, would be all the more dangerous as it would be looking to reassert itself as the global powerhouse it used to be. This could come in the form of the US asserting itself further in Europe and Central Asia against Russia, or reasserting itself more aggressively in East Asia. They would likely be far more aggressive in this action, which would lead to further provocation on both sides, which might cause a repeat incident with China or the US openly supporting minor conflicts against Russia (like sending combat troops to help Georgia in a future skirmish). If a minor incident were to break out, the US would be much more willing to use it as a pretext for revenge, which would make the conflict spread around the world as allies backed each other and those  that wanted to stand against US and Western powers did so.",,[deleted],0,0,,1426230358,0

Your debunking talks about violence again, which is besides the point.  All law is force.  That doesn't mean that law is wrong. The debunking claims that nobody in the public is complaining about the current system, which is patently false.  It complains about inefficiencies in the FDA approval process and the way drugs are priced.  

None of those is actually a refutation of the data that socialized medicine delivers better care at lower prices.  They point out that the current (broken) system we have isn't perfect, but that doesn't mean that all possible systems are worse than what we have now, nor does it mean that specific inefficiencies are inevitable in government run care (as it points out, Europe socialized health care approved drugs faster than the FDA and at less cost).  Your debunking doesn't debunk anything!

The essay is am Austrian economics philosophy paper.  No economics.  Axioms about business cycles have been proven false.  The idea that the only alternative to treating people as commodities is as slaves is laughable.  What about human beings with legal rights?  Believe it or not, the civil rights approach has worked pretty well for a while now.  It's even worked in an economic context, as shown by the successes of labor law.

Violence is once again irrelevant.  All law is force, that doesn't mean that law is wrong.  Nor does pointing out that majority government involves force suggest a better alternative.  Nobody was even talking about war and violent imperialism; it's absurd to suggest that adopting a single-payer health care system would cause more violence, war, or violent imperialism.

Women account for approximately 50% of people infected with HIV. In most regions of the world, HIV is affecting women and girls in increasing numbers.

In 2007, UNAIDS reported that roughly 22.5 million of those living with HIV/AIDS were living in Africa, with an HIV prevalence rate in the general population of 5%. In many African countries — Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, and Zimbabwe particularly — infection rates have stabilized or declined. This is due in part to the scaling up of antiretroviral treatment services and demonstrates that the epidemic does yield to appropriate and resolute responses. 

South and East Asia makes up the second most affected region, with over 4 million people living with HIV/AIDS. 

An estimated 1.5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 

HIV prevalence in the Caribbean is the second highest in the world, after sub-Saharan Africa, with HIV prevalence rates of 1%. 

In Latin America, 100,000 people were newly infected with HIV in 2007, bringing to 1.6 million the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.

North America, Western and Central Europe account for 2.1 million HIV infections.

While systematic surveillance remains inadequate in the Middle East and North Africa, available data suggests that 380,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 35,000 people in the region newly infected with HIV in 2007.

Sudan tell him he has to leave but Saudi Arabia is even more angry with him because he was sounding off against the House of Saud.  They try to cut off his money and flag his passport.  Meanwhile in the Middle East Lebanon becomes the first country in the world to put out a warrant on him, Yemen tells him he's not welcome and the Egyptians tell him he's not welcome either.  Iraq under Secular Saddam would have had him in thumbscrews and Iran's Shiite so they don't want a radical Wahaabist, not that a radical Wahhabits wants to go there unless it's to blow it up.  The most prominent Islamic terrorist in the West could hardly step foot in the Middle East long before the name Al-Qaeda was even thought up.  

-  *Solving the 'Middle East Dilemma' isn't a silver bullet to solving Islamic Terrorism.* 

When the British began investigating the 7/7 London bombing they came to a startling conclusion.  They were home grown second generation Brits.  And when they looked a little closer they realised something else.  First generation Brits, or immigrants, were amongst the most patriotic and thankful of all residents.  A small minority of second generation Brits however had culture shock. Separated from where they were but without having witnessed the relatively brown grass of the state where their inherited parental culture was the norm.  Large immigrant communities, if allowed in in the first place, need to be worked at to make sure their culture is both recognised but that they as people are integrated.

- *Play a long game:not hegemony or regime change.* 

Countries change.  All of them.   If you support the first regime you're not going to be popular with the next and that can spill over elsewhere.  Best example still playing out is in the Yemen. In one of the few cases on the internet where the word literally is right, Yemen is literally being pulled apart as a nation in four, if not more, directions all because of points 2, 3, 4.   Yet regime change is still being actively pursued even after Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq.  

- *Don't attribute wholesale that which can be easily be explained locally or separately.*

Most attributed Islamic Fundamentalism is fundamentalism by people who just happen to be Islamic concerned about local issues. Hezbullah are Middle Eastern terrorists but not a threat as how Al-Qutb's Muslim Brotherhood saw the West.  They have a beef, sure, they were set up even when Israel occupied Lebanon.   The US and most EU states recognise Hamas as a terrorist organization.  Hamas is no threat to the West either, it was set up when Palastine was occupied.  The Mahdi army are the ones that brokered a ceasefire in Iraq.  They don't want to blow up Americans so much as they want them out of Iraq so they can blow/evict the Sunnis from government.  If that means ceasefire that's what they'll do..and have.  The Islamic Republic of Iran is a so called Axis of Evil despite them being far removed from Sunni-Wahhabist Qutb and Al-Qaeda.  They have their own Kurdish terrorists and socialist MEK groups and the likes of Jundallah to deal with.   All these terrorists happen to be Muslim to some degree or other.  The US funds some of them.  It's not Islamic extremism that explains their existence though; it's either the occupation or the suppression they went under and there's been *A LOT* of occupying and suppressing in the world's little oil pot in the last century.  They've been Muslim since the 7th century.  'Islamic Fundamentalism' has been around since the developed nations discovered oil and since Palestine became a refugee dumping ground.  Putting 2 and 2 together it's not their Islamic nature that's the problem here.  Separate, specific, historic incidents in each case can explain the resort to terrorism; previous Jewish-Arab and West-Arab alliances appear to rule out Islam itself as the cause of much that is roped into Islamic Fundamentalism.  

- *Emerging economies will adjust the power balance in the Middle East anyway given time.*  

When Russia and China not only want in but need in, despite all the Cheney and Wolfowitz planning of yesteryear, America will not be able to keep them out.   When oil-dollar manipulation ends, when the regional sanctions end, when the grievances with Israeli dominance with US support ends, as they all must when there's 3 superpowers in the region not 1; then much of the fire beneath the anti-US sentiment will end.  If for nothing more than the US won't be the only one pulling the strings any more.   

- *Don't ever use contractors during or after an occupation.*  

Prime Minister Brown of the U.K. wrote up an economic package for Palestinians when still Chancellor.  Palestinian representatives rounded on it as offensive without it addressing the politics behind the issue.  Air drops of cash and foreign work teams is not something that goes down well when you still can't use the road or go to your fields because of a checkpoint. Nothing must  have pissed off the Iraqis more than to discover they couldn't get jobs because foreign contractors were doing it all and to know how much money was being wasted, how poorly it worked when it was done and all the while as armed non-US military contractors, or mercenaries, were taking pot shots at random motorists.  Don't give money, give an even playing field and offer them fair chance to win trade.  Moral of the story is not to expect gratitude for a gift or thanks for a gang-raping.  Anyway they look at it it's still a foreign  company making profit.  If they want to hire someone once the people who made the mess have left - fine.

- *Normalize relations.*

There's no reason why the US still blocks Cuba or anything Venezuela could gain from hurting America.  Cuba was Communist when McCarthyism was rampant and Venezuela told the rich elite it wanted the golf courses back to grow crops.  Iran wanted to nationalise their oil so we threw out their democratically elected leader, imposed a quarter of a century of Shah, caused them a decade of war with Iraq, sold them some guns, shot down an airliner, slapped on some sanctions, refused to recognise their Republic and then called them an Axis of Evil as if we had a monopoly on what was Good.  They, for their part, threw out our Shah from their country, took some hostages, paid for some guns and most probably sold some more to the Lebanese and Palestinians.  Okay, they've been little scamps but if you look at where other trade goes then we should be able to put this behind us.  The Iranians certainly want to.  Both the two previous Iranian presidents publicly extended a willingness to normalize relations.

Cutting down dependency is an appropriate thing but OPEC doesn't sell its oil to the US because the US has troops or because of a level of security the occupations provide.  That's nonsense.  Iraq might go rotten but that is due to happen whenever the occupation ends.    The Mahdi army is being quiet for a reason and it's not civic responsibility.  The rest though will be fine and will keep the spice flowing through mutual gain.

-  *Make CSPAN a BBC and hobble lobbyists.*

Make sure, find a way, that in every election the candidates are at least intelligent, clued in and wired up to real historic fact as it really was.  Even if their politics don't fit all.  The uninformed public at large is the greatest enabler and catalyst to outside threat.  Check corporate and foreign lobbyist influence and consider the merits of a taxpayer funded, non-governmental non-profit, chartered public service broadcaster.

He and I were about as mismatched as could be. I was a quiet guy who liked computers and science. He was a hulking European dude who didn't speak a word of English and spent all of his time playing soccer, painting strange abstract pictures of naked women with three tits, and playing chess. And he was very, very good at chess. He beat the faculty leader of the chess team without looking at the board. The teacher sat at the chess set and pored over his moves and would tell Joseph where he moved a particular piece. Joseph, sitting on a nearby couch with his back to the board, would think for a moment and then reply with his move. He beat him solidly three times. So, a pretty weird dude.

At some point around Christmas, I lost my tie (the school had a dress code). I got in shit for showing up to class without it, and was told to go buy another one for $25 or I wouldn't be allowed in classrooms. There was nothing else I could do, so I bit the bullet and bought one. Weeks later, I visited a friend in the art room in the basement of the school where he was working on his project. Joseph was in his class too, and he had been working on some elaborate sculpture for a month or so. I took a look at it, and it was this massive, life-sized paper-mâché man hanging upside down with his ankles tied to the ceiling. It's hadn't been painted yet, but I noticed a tie around this thing's neck. A green and black tie, my house colors. My damn tie. I know it was mine, because it had physics and calculus equations written on the back that I used to cheat on a test once.

I asked my friend what the piece was called, and looked at it and said, ""Oh, that thing? I think he calls it 'Roommate.'""

There you can see that Finland is ranked 14th on this list, which I would characterize as above the world average. Before Finland, you can find mostly former Soviet countries, where the economical and social situations for the citizens and overall stability is a lot worse than in Finland, A LOT. I'll agree that South-Korea might be an exception, but I never said that Finland had the highest, just one of the highest suicide rates, and I definitely still stand by that point. So I cannot see how you can say that ""suicide rates are higher than world average only when it comes to young males"". 

Alcohol consumption and alcoholism is two entirely different things. After trying to find a good source to back up my claim I think the European Commission Information System on Alcohol and Health (http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/default.asp) seems to be the best place to dig through statistics, although I have to confess that it would take to long, so if you want to show me some statistics backing your claims up, so will I. Anyway, they actually differentiate between normal alcohol consumption and heavy binge drinking (think wine or beer which is a part of the food culture in many European countries versus a bottle of Koskenkorva http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskenkorva)

What I meant with the domestic violence rate is that in Finland a high percentage of all violent crimes happen inside the family, I'll concede that I didn't formulate that correctly. I guess that can be both a good and a bad thing, less chance of random violence but higher risk of getting stabbed by the wife.

Yes I know that the tax rate is progressive, and the 30 % sounds right (mostly because they hire good lawyers like yourself to find loopholes in the tax code, and because of other income sources not taxed under the normal income tax), the fact is that taxes in Finland are very high compared to MOST other countries (again via Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg), Finland seems to be 7th on that list, in the world. Since we were comparing it to the US, here are the average income tax rates: USA: ~28 %, Finland ~ 45 %. No matter how you calculate it, there is a HUGE difference between the two countries when it comes to taxation, and I'm sure you don't disagree.

Finally, my point was not to say that Finland is a bad country. By many measurements, be it poverty rates or most livable city (Helsinki was ranked 6th in the world, in a report published in the Economist just before the Olympics, Vancouver was nr 1) Finland is a fine country that takes care of its citizens, and I am very proud to call it my home. After living in the US for a while I am absolutely shocked by some of the very apparent failures of the society to take care of its citizens, but as I said in my earlier post, I have met some of the nicest people both in the university I study at and traveling around the country. I was merely trying to show that everything is not perfect in Finland either. If nothing else think about the goddamn climate.

Israel is surrounded by larger and more powerful countries that would all like to see it turned into a glass parking lot. The only reason this hasn't happened since Israel's founding is the U.S.

This the myth of the whole situation, not singularly or collectively could any of Israel's neighbours be termed more powerful. This is why:

1. Technologically Israel is a first world country in its military, economy and its industrial prowess.
2. Israel is backed by the whole of the Western nations (in all aspects economically, culturally and militarily)
3. The Arab nations who share a border with Israel (I will not use the word **surround** as that is an emotive word in this instance which paints Israel as a weakling, which it is not), may have a larger population, however these are nations that are under the continued subversion of the West. They are either direct client states through their Western maintained or installed corrupt leadership or are under continued western sanctions and embargoes. Denied both credit and opportunity for investment.
4. All of the economies of the nations that share borders with Israel are beholden to the West either through direct credit or debt and therefore without the injection of Western maintenance they are defunct. Of course Syria is the only one that is not and it has been under continued Western embargo for the last couple of decades.

In truth Israel is militarily one of the top 10 nations in the world it can go toe to toe with any of the European nations and that says it all. Israel also has the added deterrence of a **nuclear arsenal**.

Egypt could go toe to toe with Israel two decades ago, but it is in a far worse shape now than it has been for decades thanks to its special status as a US client state. Jordan, well it was weaker than Israel at the time of Israel's creation in '48 and still is to this day. Lebanon need I even mention that? after two decades of Israeli occupation and simultaneously three decades of civil war it is yet to even recover and will remain in the emergency ward for the next two to three decades.

Whoever is claiming that Israel is *surrounded* by powerful nations  is either under a large dose of self-delusion or is willingly perpetuating a long dead myth.

One must accept that there is no justification for Israeli's continued occupation of land beyond the '67 border. One must also accept that Israel is the one who is the occupier and therefore is not willing to give up any of the occupied territories as it would mean giving up on the idea of ""Eretz Israel"" as defined by collective books of the  **Tanakh** the Hebrew Bible. Which incidentally includes the whole of the past and future state of Palestine. Thus the removal of the Palestinians is necessitated by the need to create a state for Jews only.

I can't give you the exact list now, but there were a lot of great episodes from dj-s such as Holden, Above &amp; Beyond, Oakenfold and others who shouldn't be forgotten. **I'll try to get that list up here if anyone was interested.**

But I will not change my opinion about trance not dying in the period of 2003 - 2004 of though. I thought about it and few arguments:

1) **Natural progress**, which in my opinion, meant that it was a lot harder and harder for a producer to come up with an original idea since there wasn't that many that hadn't been used before. I can only name three songs that have been produced in the last 5years and that would comparable to their ancestors: [Cape Town - Proglifter (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVgT2C5RBk), [Paul Keeley - A Sort Of Homecoming (Michael Cassette Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnDJzOmvNvw) and [Pryda - Muranyi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnDJzOmvNvw)

2) **Technical progress**, people like producer or song if some kind of new synth or sound has emerged, which usually happenes with the new version of Reason / Logic or some patch upgrade of theirs. It's still happening, and you somewhat were right saying it was different, but the progress really slowed down after 2003-2004. Now days an average listener gets his / her pants wet after just listening to artist name Deadmau5, who I think never produced a melodic or progressive piece in his career, but because of his costume and fact he has some neat ideas for a new style of baseline, he keeps the snowball running, altough, it's slowing.

3) **Underground, unexplored area,** where there was this rave-like aura in dirty factories with no heating where people only cared for music, extacy and water, which was soon taken up with MTV. At least here in Europe. In my little country, we currently have 2 full-time popular radio channels for just 1.5million listeners that play contemporary trance. It was at the time of Buuren's ASOT's the genre got monotonous and easy enough to be understood by the average radio listener. Equivalent ""lover"" of trance in the 90s listened to Robert Miles and called it trance.

All in all. I think the trance will be as sporadic as the drug use (for example, in the US, weed was popular 70s, then came cocaine, crack and now it's back to weed again) and the old trance gets ""discovered"" by the young folks all the time, it's just a matter of time when the sensation on a bigger scale goes off again.",,misantropf,0,0,,1426230527,0

His case was on iffy ground (although it should be noted that it was only narrowly affirmed 5-4) to begin with. Reading the majority opinion, Rehnquist notes, ""In Spencer v. Texas... this Court upheld the very statute employed here, noting in the course of its opinion that similar statutes had been sustained."" So apparently Rummel didn't really argue with the constitutionality of the law itself but claimed his circumstance was extra special enough to get him off the hook. Getting the Supreme Court to claim C&amp;U for prison time is just about impossible. Not to mention that the default sentence for the third felony he got was life WITH possibility of parole in 12 years. That seems kind of bad but as it turns out his three felonies on their own could have netted him up to 25 years so...cruel and unusual prison time? Not really all things considered.

I am in no way shape or form a judicial scholar, so I may be wrong on some of this stuff, but I think the gist is correct. The conservative Supreme Court didn't do anything wrong per se. I think sheerheartattack above elaborated very well on a big misconception of the role of the Supreme Court. It's not a European style court where the government can approach them and ask them to examine all the possible constitutional problems with a certain piece of legislation. The Supreme Court must (to my understanding) be approached with a case that has gone through the proper channels in order to examine the validity of the law as it relates to the Constitution. And the Court is not handed a law and asked ""Is this constitutional?"" They are handed two arguments about the constitutionality of a law and they determine which one is valid.

It seems like a insignificant distinction but it's pretty important. The Constitution itself is an extremely vague document. I mean shit we still don't know what the 2nd Amendment means. For the Supreme Court to examine a law in full and make the arguments for the parties (Like some redditors are saying: ""rah rah clearly *something* is wrong with this law they should invalidate it!"") introduces a world of biases and potential for tyranny of the Court. The Constitution is subjective and the appointments are political, so it is kind of necessary to keep judgement contained to the arguments presented to them. Although this does sometime lead to messed up situations where someone loses a case because they focused on the wrong point. For a great example of this see the brilliant [Brandeis concurrence in Whitney v. California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_v._california#The_Brandeis_concurrence). His response is sort of like ""Girl you messed up you should have argued first amendment shiiiiiiit"".

1. It's been tainted by the cumulative effects of about 2,000 years of predominantly roman/european politics in the west, byzantine politics and an ongoing balance of power act with later muslim rulers in the middle east, and the insanity of colonialism and pre-modernism in the US and pretty much everywhere else it has spread.

2. Due in no small part to number 1, the church has become schismatic, because people have realized throughout world history that the system we've created can no longer morally sustain itself.

3. As for its doctrines, the widely held interpretation of Jewish scriptures was flawed right from the start. If you go back to the 'prophesies' that Jesus supposedly fulfilled as the messiah, many of them either weren't prophesies, had already been fulfilled by someone else, or weren't talking about the messiah in the first place. That's not to say Jesus wasn't the messiah, it's just to say that the apostles must have fudged a few details.

4. An instance of this is the idea of pacifism as a Christian value. That's not true. violence and warfare have their place. The OT is pretty clear about that, especially in Ecclesaistes, Joshua, Judges, etc. God is concerned with order, something covered much more in eastern religions than in the west, not petty human definitions of good or evil.

5. Christianity has failed to make the distinction clear enough between God and religion. God is the Divine Reality, religion is just our reaction to it. In trying to hold onto its power, influence, etc. the church has by and large attempted to put itself as a go-between for people and God, rather than attempting to be a catalyst for the same interaction.

This isn't to say that Christianity isn't worth following, it's certainly in a lot better shape currently than many other worldwide faith systems, but we should always make sure we're putting God, the Divine Reality, first, and not the church or our own dogmas or preconceptions.",,[deleted],0,0,,1426230575,0

* Sovereignty, in varying degrees.
* Economic self-sufficiency and freedom.
* Monetary independence.

The efforts to destroy nations and create supranational entities, and a world government, is entirely in the best interests of the rich elite.

This is entirely attainable with our increasing standard of living worldwide, and our better technology that enables people to connect to one another. 

Larger entities make it harder for people to influence their government, and it also involves far more people when or if a conflict should arise.

It is also far easier to overthrow an oppressive government when it is smaller, weaker and the capital (or government in general) is more easily reached by the populace.

Himalayan salt lamps are naturally formed powerful tools that can be used for relaxation and meditation with glowing hues of red, orange and amber Himalayan salt lamps are amazing, made from centuries old raw materials formed into lamps or candle holders can create a warm feeling in any room or office. That’s all well and good but how do salt lamps work?” Himalayan salt lamps affect different people in different ways; however the overwhelming response is that these salt rock lamps are helping people find peace. The color is naturally soothing as is a camp fire or a nice sunset and let’s not forget about the negative ions that are generated by the lamps as well. 
When the earth was still in the beginning stages of formation, massive pressures and colliding continents caused the Himalayan Mountains to form. Actually the ocean that existed at that time was forced inside what is now called the Himalayan Mountains. These vast Mineral salt deposits developed beneath the surface, and the mountainous pressure and mineral content created a perfect environment for these crystals to evolve. Himalayan salt lamps are not actually created by the mountains but by hand, without the use of nasty chemicals and other unnatural materials. Hand crafted natural products are what we suggest to any home and the energy they create is amazing but there is more to learn. 
What are your salt lamps used? They are great to help one ad natural component to a home or office. In Fact the color spectrum is known to have a positive effect on the human body. First and foremost, Salt lamps work in much the same way as the fresh ocean air works. The salt evaporation negatively changes oxygen molecules and helps to create a protective of cloud of relaxation. One needs to be able to tap into that energy and want do feel the difference. There are always those that don’t get the higher realms of thought or feeling but we do not worry about them as they will eventually get the opportunity to awaken or not. The places where one can place a lamp is almost endless and if one is thinking about a gift it is one that will last forever. 
For decades Americans have been seeking relief from what ails them. Now with salt lamps you have a possible gift for some relief. The salt lamps act much like the salt caves do in Europe and other salt museums where people go below ground and stay overnight in the salt mines and have reported some profound relief regarding salt caves. 
One might also ask how many salt lamps one needs; well we suggest strongly that one consider several as one for the bedroom, office and living area is a great to start!
Himalayan Water and Salt  (Garam Bukit Tulin)
The human body is composed of water and salt. Natural Himalayan crystal salt contains all of the natural minerals and trace elements that make up the human body. Though vitamins and proteins are not found in water or salt, the elements that make up their complicated molecular chains are present in water and salt. In fact, water, salt and light are energy forms that construct highly geometrically structured chain links that are – biochemically – identical to vitamins and proteins. This is why sole, a mixture of water and salt, is such an important life-builder and worth incorporating into your daily life. One might consider sole as the equivalent of ‘liquid sunlight’ and obviously it relates to the ancient oceans from where we all came. 
Water and salt have different crystalline structures. 250 million years ago, light energy evaporated the primal oceans and created salt, which is essentially energy. When water is added the structure of salt changes and can easily penetrate the body’s cells allowing the potential of this energy to be released. 
The atomic structure of salt is actually electrical which makes it so transformable. Salt does not need to be broken down into sugars or acids, it always remains salt. Salt allows information to travel between our cells and produces our actions and thoughts. A lack of salt is critical, similar to a modern-day power outage. At the same time crystal salt helps us remain balanced and in harmony with ourselves and surroundings. 
Basic table salt is only sodium chloride. It has been chemically stripped of all of the other elements and has no positive benefit. Many of us are accustomed to adding salt to ‘flavor’ our food. But the real importance of salt is its vibration pattern, and again, this is only found in crystal salt. Seek it out next time you want to purchase salt and avoid buying basic grocery store white table salt. 
Historic Importance Throughout time, people have known about and valued the importance of salt. Many European cities are named after salt and the word ‘salary’ actually means payment by salt. The Celtic word for salt is ‘Hall’ and many towns and cities known for their salt deposits have the word ‘hall’ in their name. 

Himalayan Crystal Solay or Sole'
Sole or Solay the Himalayan Salt Elixir. A great natural way to help your body increase its own immune functions while providing essential nutrients. 
Himalayan salt provides a non toxic way to add nutrients and minerals to your body. Our salt is made or harvested by hand and is without pollutants. 
Sole (so-lay), our crystal salt mixed with water is the called the elixir of life. The eroupeans use the word sole came from the word sol, which means the sun. So the brine solution is the fluid state of the sun or light energy. The theory is the salt being natural and the sun being a fine source of vitamin D combines to make a powerful drink we now call so lay. 
“Combine your mental and physical balance and one will achieve wellbeing”. This salt mixture system causes the molecules to be hydrolyzed. This brine solution creates an immediate and yet lasting vibration in the body. The natural energy pattern will help restore your natural functions and remove stubborn toxins. 
To create your own sole, loosely fill a glass with several Himalayan crystal salts or several tablespoons of Himalayan Salt grains. Fill the glass with your favorite mountain spring water. Check if the crystals have been dissolved completely. If the crystals were dissolved, add some more crystal. The salt will stop dissolving when the mixture is correct in other words the salt finds its own balance and you will to. Now take one tablespoon of this mixture and ad to eight ounces of water every morning. You mind and body will thank you. 
Welcome to age old wisdom and the combining of natural health.

Conquest has always existed, and the morality of it is entirely relative. We all do what is best for our children and descendants, and for White colonials it was to expand territory, like all peoples have done since the dawn of our species. 

Thousands of years ago, White people had spread out and inhabited most of the Eurasian continent, most of which was uninhabited steppes and tundra. Whites had spread eastward as far as central China and Mongolia (Mongolians didn't always inhabit present day Mongolia), and met those peoples. Eventually the Whites were conquered and killed off by the Asian peoples (in particular the Mongol people), the remaining Whites were breed out of existence and became a mixed people (e.g. Turks). 

Over the next few thousand years Whites were constantly invaded by other peoples, such as the Mongols, the mixed people of central Asia (e.g. Turks), the Arabs, etc.

* The mixed people of central Asia (e.g. Turks) conquered Anatolia (present day “Turkey”) and occupied southeast Europe, including Greece; they were eventually driven out of most of Europe except for Thrace and Anatolia. 
* The Arabs, and their vassals, conquered northern Africa, the Iberian peninsula (Spain, Portugal), southern France, southern Italy, various islands of the Mediterranean, and Persia. They were eventually driven out, except for northern Africa and Persia. 

All over the world people have invaded others and committed genocide. The Japanese wiped out the indigenous Ainu. Blacks in Africa have nearly wiped out the Khoisan (a.k.a Bushmen) people of Africa. Arabs have nearly wiped out the indigenous Persians, Egyptians and other groups. American Indians wiped out other tribes; newer evidence also shows that American Indians are more likely to have been invaders that wiped out a different race of people that reached the Americas first (believed to be a people from Oceania, possibly related to Australian Aborigines). 

Whites were invaded, were on the receiving end of genocide, and lost an incredible amount of territory. This is just life, and I accept what has happened. I resent what has happened to my people (Whites/Europeans), but we lost the territory and have nobody to blame but ourselves for the failure to defend and hold the lands. The Mongols, the Arabs, and the mixed peoples of central Asia (e.g. Turks) fought and won the land that they still hold, it is now their land. 

&gt; destroying most of the forests and flattening the mountains.

All peoples have caused damage to the environment, including unadvanced peoples such as American Indians and Australian Aborigines (both of whom wiped out many animals upon their arrival, particularly mega-fauna).

Ethnicities are genetically different groups within a race, and immigration in large enough numbers will alter the genetics of the unique host ethnicity, particularly if the host ethnicity has less dominant genes. Culture is also a concern, particularly if a particular ethnicity is less prone to assimilate. Polish culture shouldn't overtly affect or change British culture, for example. 

&gt; i find every single one of your claims questionable, and i don't see that you've explained/supported any of them (except the ""larger entities make it harder to influence the gov't"" part).

It is rather simple; every race, ethnicity, culture and language should be preserved. 

Too many immigrants, particularly of more genetically distant people, will greatly affect the host people to the host people's detriment. Too many immigrants can also lead to cultural tension, particularly if the people immigrating have a very foreign culture; Europeans all have a very similar culture, which makes assimilation (like with the colonial countries) much more natural and easier. 

Multiculturalism does not promote diversity, it destroys diversity. Nationalism preserves diversity by allowing all peoples of any race, ethnicity, culture and language to preserve their people as independent and unique. This means that we have far more unique peoples, cultures and languages that actually enrich our species as a whole. We share our planet together, and have tools such as the internet which connect us without destroying the integrity of our races, ethnicities, cultures and languages. ",,Valkyria,0,0,,1426230637,0

You clearly have not read anything from Marx, but rather interpretations of Marx.

You ought to pick up manners and debate ethics. I've read Marx. As you can see from my reference to the manifesto. 

It is simply nonsense to claim that Marx thought socialism and communism was the same thing. As I've already said, he used socialism as a description of the wider movement that was concerned with worker rights, while communism is the true revolutionary party that represent the true ideology of the masses. He doesn't use the terms interchangeably, he for example always refers to his own movement as 'communists', and not socialists. In the last chapter of the manifesto he even says that the communists should join the ""socialist-democratic party"". It is quite obvious that the writers of the manifesto did not mean that communism and socialism is the same thing. But all of this is really not all that relevant to the fact that *Marxism, socialism and communism are all different things*, especially in a modern perspective. The fact that you mention Trotsky and the existence of the host of different socialist and communist direction that have existed in the 20th century only serves to further undermine your non-existent argument. Even if Marx used the phrase interchangeably (which he didn't), there is still no doubt to the fact that communism, marxism, and socialism are different entities. This fact is of course cemented by Russian history. The persecution of socialist parties by the bolsheviks. The establishment of the Communist party in Russia. The development in world history where communism came to mean support for revolutionary dictatorships. Today, where you find numerous political parties who call themselves socialists, but who go to great lengths to insure people that they are not communists.
And still we have not touched upon the fact that Marxism within modern academia are tools and disciplines that are not necessarily related at all to the political ideologies of socialism and communism. 

Regarding the European Union, it legislates trade between nations because if it didn't, they would legislate it on a national basis and thus hamper free trade. Free trade is ensured by the EU, the Internal Market is the most central part of the institution and its biggest success. It is complete nonsense to compare it to socialism or communism. The only place it might me mildly related is in the fact that it is an authority, like you say. But that is a political talking point, claiming that something is 'socialism', merely because it utilizes authority. It is boring and senseless language use. 

&gt;Irrelevant.

Not at all, since you claim that marxism is socialism is communism is the EU. Then when I show that the EU isn't classical marxism, you say irrelevant. Give me a break. 

&gt;If the means by which the means are traded is regulated, then the means of production are still regulated.

Wrong. You can regulate the trade of banana without regulating how the banana is produced. You can say that the banana shall be 15cm long without saying how much workers should be paid to make it 15cm long. You can say that bananas musn't be subsidized without saying that there should be equal ownership over the banana machines. 
In short, the EU is not socialism at all.

&gt;The fact that you mention Trotsky and the existence of the host of different socialist and communist direction that have existed in the 20th century only serves to further undermine your non-existent argument.

You obviously did not understand what I said.  That is about Lenin.  I said that socialists never agree with each other.  Lenin used political-speech to differentiate the two.  My argument that still stands is that Marx himself did not differentiate between the two.

&gt;Even if Marx used the phrase interchangeably (which he didn't), there is still no doubt to the fact that communism, marxism, and socialism are different entities.

He did use them interchangeably, and the difference only exists in modern interpretations of Marx, not Marx himself.

&gt;Regarding the European Union, it legislates trade between nations because if it didn't, they would legislate it on a national basis and thus hamper free trade.

Total crap.  You are misunderstanding the nature of regulation.  The introduction of managed trade across countries, if it is going to result in more free trade, is not the result of the managing part.  It is a result of the abolition of local regulations.  A newer, larger government is not required for this to take place.  You are committing the ex post ergo propter hoc fallacy.

&gt;Not at all, since you claim that marxism is socialism is communism is the EU. Then when I show that the EU isn't classical marxism, you say irrelevant. Give me a break.

It is irrelevant to the main point of contention, which is that you are incorrect by insisting that Marx did not use socialism and communism interchangeably.

&gt;Wrong. You can regulate the trade of banana without regulating how the banana is produced.

Banana is the final product.  You said the means by which the means of production are regulated.  That means everything that goes into producing bananas is regulated.  That means the means of production are regulated.

&gt;In short, the EU is not socialism at all.

It is ""socialist"" because the EU is a governmental body that regulates the trade of means of production across Europe.  That is socialist based by definition.

In the 1990s, just as we gained our independence, you were seen as a sort of ""rich uncles"", because most everyone had some distant relative (WW2 refugees) who was living in USA or Canada and was much better off than your average Estonian.

Nowadays you're mostly made fun of and seen as stupid, evil capitalists who go around blowing up poor people to get oil.

The underlying mental shift seems to have been ""America is a paradise I want to move to"" -&gt; ""I know enough about America to not want to go live there permanently"".

&gt; Also I'm African American, so I'd really like to know how people from other countries consider Af Am's to be?

We still commonly use the word ""neeger"" to refer to black people here. When we use it to describe you, we don't mean it as an insult. It's just a historical curiosity of our language. The alternative would be to call you ""must"" (""black"") but the word also means ""dirty"" in our language and we don't want to call you ""dirty"", so we call you ""neeger"", which is a lot more neutral *in our language.*

I should also note that we tend to colloquially use the word ""neeger"" to also describe people who work way too hard for very little pay. In a way it's a reference to African Americans as slaves. The word, when used in that context, has some negative connotations, but we don't use the word in such a way as to mean that all black people should be slaves. Quite the contrary, in fact.

You see, Estonians were slaves themselves for over 700 years under the feudal lords of rich European countries who at one time or another had conquered our lands. We still sometimes refer to bad bosses with the same word we used for estate owners to whom we belonged as slaves: ""mõisnik"". The equivalent in English would probably be ""master"".

So when we use the word ""neeger"" to describe someone who works too hard, it's more of a sort of recognition of kinship with the African American slaves. Basically we're using one of your words to describe a concept which we all innately understand, but for which we don't have a better word.

All in all, we don't have enough experience with those of the dark skin persuasion to really have developed any sort of cultural understanding of you. I've seen only one black person on the streets here in Tartu (second biggest city of Estonia) this year and he seemed rather lost and confused.

There have been incidents of racism towards black people in Estonia, but, if anything, it's because we don't know you well enough.

&gt; I think it's close to Russia

Yup. Our eastern neighbours. We were part of the Soviet Union from the end of WW2 (we had no choice -- we were conquered by the Red Army) till early 1990s when the Soviet Union crumbled.

&gt; I'm guessing your culture is similar to Russian culture??

Much less so than you would think, actually. Most of the border between Estonia and Russia runs through Lake Peipus, which has hindered cultural communication.

Culturally we're much closer to Finland, which is just 80 km to the north of us, over a part of the Baltic Sea. The language is very similar and in both cultures there's heavy drinking and depression among males :P",,[deleted],0,0,,1426230658,0

Correlation does not imply causation. There are many reasons for WW1 and WW2. Most of the pre-WW2 wars involved nobility, all of which have been either abolished or relegated to irrelevant status at this point. Most European nations, post-WW2, had finished off any influences from nobility and moved toward more democratic governments. More democratic governments, if functioning properly, are harder to bring to war. 

A mutual defense and anti-war position could be achieved through a similar system like NATO, instead of a supranational confederation like the EU.

I would be inclined to say that the increases of food supply in Europe does not necessarily mean that CAP was the cause. There were many increases in technology and techniques post-WW2 that greatly increased yields.

To make this perfectly clear for even the last idiots around here, it is called stupidity. Now a few fun facts. 

**Fact 1**: homeschooling is illegal in Germany and guess what 
the majority in Germany has no problem at all with that fact. 
You see that is how democracy works, the majority decides. 

**Fact 2**: if you break the law you are in trouble, 
especially if you do it more than once. 

**Fact 3**: if you don't like the laws in a democracy you have 3 options. 
You can break them, see fact 2, you can try to change them, see 
fact 1, or you can leave, see fact 4.

**Fact 4**: this one is what makes this story so unbelievable stupid. 
Germany is part of the EU, now bear with me, what is so great about the EU 
is that I as a German can move to say Spain, or the other way around, 
work and live there without big bureaucratic hassle. 
You still with me? Fine, so lets see what we have south of Germany's border, 
ah yes Austria (no not the one with the kangaroos). 
Austria, you know the one from the moronic movie ""Sound of Music"" 
which btw not many Germans or Austrians have ever seen, has 3 pros 
which pertain to this case. 
First the language spoken there is German (mind-blowing I know), 
second they have roughly the same culture (and history) as we Germans do 
and third, now here comes the kicker, they allow homeschooling, surprise!!!

So to sum it up, moving to the other end of the world, with your kids, 
where nobody speaks your language and the cultural background is strange, 
instead of just moving  1 or 2 hundred kilometers south, where only the flag 
and the name behind the title of chancellor is different, 
just because you want to homemindfuck is what I call the high point of stupidity.

It still lends strength to what has already been established, that communism and socialism are *not the same* in his optics.

&gt;You mean only in the modern perspective. Not from Marx himself.

And from Marx himself, but especially in the modern perspective, which means you lose the argument either way. 

&gt;You obviously did not understand what I said. That is about Lenin. I said that socialists never agree with each other. Lenin used political-speech to differentiate the two. My argument that still stands is that Marx himself did not differentiate between the two.

I understood perfectly what you said but chose to ignore your point because it was entirely irrelevant to the discussion. 

&gt;Total crap. You are misunderstanding the nature of regulation. The introduction of managed trade across countries, if it is going to result in more free trade, is not the result of the managing part. It is a result of the abolition of local regulations. A newer, larger government is not required for this to take place. You are committing the ex post ergo propter hoc fallacy.

You are completely wrong, EU legislation has means that national trade barriers are now gone. It is naive to think that without any international legislation free trade would automatically flourish because in the real world, states legislate and limit free trade. 

&gt; Banana is the final product. You said the means by which the means of production are regulated. That means everything that goes into producing bananas is regulated. That means the means of production are regulated.

You're talking gibberish here. Within the EU it isn't everything that is regulated, at all. It's first and foremost rules that insure free trade and equal terms for national industries. 

&gt;It is ""socialist"" because the EU is a governmental body that regulates the trade of means of production across Europe. That is socialist based by definition

Haha, no. Then every government that has ever existed is socialist. Like I said, you are reducing it to political talking points whereby everything that is authority automatically is socialist. It is stupid.

The waste from coal-fired power is what needs to be eliminated immediately in order to save the planet, and solar/wind are nowhere near ready to do that at a cost that won't disqualify them instantly in the grande scheme. PS: If you think that carbon regulation is going create a false economy for soalr/wind, then please research the effect of carbon taxes in Europe if you want a quick overview of false expectations, while coal continues to be a filthy and poisonous king.

The burka and niqab are quite obviously sexist, and if it's not obvious there is a sound argument from evolutionary psychology that should convince anyone who is actually willing accept that the burka could be sexist but just needs evidence that it is so.

Well, that's something I can't agree with, because you have not demonstrated that it is sexist. It's a style of clothing. There is nothing inherently sexist about a piece of cloth that is wrapped around the entire human body.

&gt;China doesn't allow foot binding, that was banned in 1911 with the death penalty for anyone that continued it. In the West we no-longer have organ damaging corsets, but if some small religious group started forcing their daughters to wear them I wouldn't have an issue with them being banned. We also don't allow female genital mutilation (we should also ban male circumcision too).

Except those things are not styles of clothing. They are physical intrusions into the bodies of women. Are you seriously trying to compare cutting off a clitoris to wrapping a sheet around yourself?

&gt;And while they remain in the realm of ideas and words, we can use words to counter them. If the ideas if those sexist books turn in to action though, we'll often take action to counter that. The burka is not something that is limited to the realm of ideas and words, it is oppressing women in the real world right now.

But the way you're talking is as though the burka is currently the only way that sexism is exhibited throughout Europe. There is plenty of sexism and misogyny directed towards European women, regardless of ethnicity or religion. This is all legal. For example, look at the British National Party's agenda. They are almost certainly misogynist. They wield far more political power than any constituent that advocates burkas for everyone (which I doubt even exists). There are far bigger problems that face women in Europe today. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

You have yet to show how the burka itself is ""oppressing women"". Rather, it is your **ideas** regarding the burka that lead you to consider it oppressive. ",,JasonMacker,0,0,,1426230735,0

She would be blamed for tearing the family apart. In these very conservative Muslim families, women are encouraged to accept poor treatment for the sake of family cohesion.

Meanwhile, the U.S. constitution remains a very limited document that gives only very specific powers to the Federal government - mostly regulating trade to conform to a common standard, open migration, and some basic infrastructure responsibilities like inter-state roads, ports, and post offices.  

Until the 1860s or 1870s, there wasn't even a single unified American currency!  There *were* federally-issued and gold-backed dollars that were universally useful, but there was also a vast system of state-chartered banks issuing various banknotes backed by various commodities and promises. 

Even the taxation powers of the U.S. Federal government remained extremely limited until the 1910s.  Four attempts at a national income tax were short down by the courts as unconstitutional until an amendment was passed specifically allowing for it.  Its really only since then that the Federal government has become the dominant source of public spending in America, even if the states are the ones who still fund the schools and most of the local public services.

We're talking about the burka and niqab, it covers the face as well as the body. Why is it that the women dress like this and not the men if it's not sexist?

The thing is that Islam and Christianity share massive similarities in how women are viewed, they're the property of men, and if men look at women and feel lust they have sinned and it's the woman's fault not the man's. So these women are made to cover up.

Wearing small rings can cause circulation problems. Piercings can lead to infections as well. Should those be banned? Of course not, because at some point you have to draw the line between what the government decides is healthy for people, and what people decide for themselves. The government shouldn't be in the business of forcing people to adopt certain lifestyles. It can certainly encourage it, i.e. through telling the populace to eat healthy and exercise, to avoid excessive drug use, and other things, but it simply cannot coerce you to do those things.

&gt;We're talking about the burka and niqab, it covers the face as well as the body. Why is it that the women dress like this and not the men if it's not sexist?

For the same reason that a woman wearing a camisole or skirt is not considered sexist. Just because certain styles of dress are not considered appropriate for men to wear, doesn't mean that it is inherently sexist for women to wear them.

&gt;The thing is that Islam and Christianity share massive similarities in how women are viewed, they're the property of men, and if men look at women and feel lust they have sinned and it's the woman's fault not the man's. So these women are made to cover up. There was an article submitted the other day about a Christian leaflet that blamed rape victims for bringing rape upon themselves by dressing attractively. In Islamic countries we've seen rape victims being punished for being raped!

Show me any serious scholar in Islam that considers women to be the property of men. And even if I conceded that, that still doesn't prove that EVERY woman who wears a niqab considers herself to be the property of her husband. As long as there is even one woman who says that she thinks it is inherently good for her to wear niqab, it nullifies any sort of case of you saying that Islam in general encourages male dominance.

And in Islamic countries, we've also seen rapists get punished for committing rapes as well. The cases you bring up are seriously nothing more than fringe cases, equivalent to getting all of your American news from the ""oddly enough' section of Yahoo News or Reuters. Show me a single incidence of any sort of Islamic doctrine which states that rape victims should be punished at all.

&gt;Foot binding and organ damaging corsets were styles of clothing, and you just went and ignored them and just focused on the genital mutilation that I mentioned.

And you ignored my point entirely. Foot binding is **breaking a woman's bones** in order to make them smaller. That's illegal because it inflicts a specific physical harm on a woman, and is also very difficult if not impossible to reverse. For organ damaging corsets, I'll admit the case is weaker, however it is still inflicting a physical harm that is very difficult to reverse. It's not comparable with a vitamin D deficiency, because you can easily purchase vitamin pills to counteract it. You can't exactly take pills to solve foot binding or removing a part of a woman's genitals.

&gt;Yes there is still, but here please read this... Basically, if you're going to claim that the kind of problems that women in modern liberal societies face are just as bad as the kind of oppression that women in conservative Islamic communities face, well you're commiting the fallacy of gray. Asimov also wrote a very similar essay on this.

What? I don't think you're understanding my argument. I am not personally in favor of women wearing burkas, no different than being personally in favor of people who have tattoos, or personally in favor of people who hunt and kill animals, and so forth. However, I am entirely against the State deciding whether or not people should be allowed to do such things (admittedly with somewhat of a reservation towards the animal hunting).

I am trying to say that while it is distressing that some women wear burkas, it is even more distressing to force them to wear other forms of clothing. And the amount of media involvement in the issue is far too much in comparison to the actual problems that the women of Europe face. Again, this is only like 1% of Muslims in Europe, who are already a minority. To me, this is no different than all of the wasteful spending on ""security"" in the United States, when far more people die from heart attacks and other health problems than from terrorist attacks (also, the monetary loss, in terms of increased medical costs, is far more severe than the loss caused by destruction to business or property as a result of terrorist actions).

Indeed, but then if we look at where the power lies and the positions in question within the EU they also have a lot less influence and power.

He is converted, he then forces conversation upon others. After all, do you want to say you believe or have your head cut off?

That's two different arguments -- respect for authority v. fear of reprisal.  Let's break it down into two different examples to see how each works out.

When Isabella and Ferdinand drove the Moors out of Spain, a significant Muslim and Jewish population was left behind.  The new Empire gave them a choice -- renounce your old religion and be baptized, or have your families broken and driven out of Spain in poverty.  Many were driven out.  Those who stayed behind were a continual risk of ""relapse,"" and many were only nominally Christian, secretly keeping to their old faith even at risk of discovery by the Inquisition.  The point is, as a historian, you can't trust compelled conversions, and it's practically impossible to chart exactly when non-Christian belief finally dwindled away to nothing in Imperial Spain.  The exiled simply took their religions with them, while the apparent conversions tended towards syncretism or covert worship.

On the other hand, during the four centuries between the Fall of Rome and the reign of Charlemagne, Christianity was often spread by fiat.  Missionaries would convert kings, the kings would declare Christianity the official religion of the kingdom, and that was that, right?  Well, sort of.  There's no clear way of measuring how many subjects of such kingdoms actually adopted Christian religion.  It *is* clear, however, that Germanic paganism persisted even after the whole of the Frankish Empire became officially Christian.  The actual process seems to have been much more gradual.  The subjects of a converted king may have been officially Christian, but in terms of creed and practice, they remained pagan.  What it ultimately took was a modification from both ends.  The king would replace pagan holy sites with Christian chapels; pagan rituals would be adapted to fit Christian holidays; sanction was given for the cult of the saints as a stand in for pagan polytheism; and so on.  Respect for authority actually does remarkably little to explain the de-paganization of Europe, and the process ended up being generational and syncretic.",,blackstar9000,0,0,,1426230796,0

&gt; Originally it started out as explanations for things like thunder and lightning, why tribe members got sick or why the tribe went through periods of plenty as well as famine.

Ask yourself this: How do you know religion got started that way?  What's your evidence for that?  Do you recall where you first came across that idea?

I'd suggest that one reason that particular origin story is so popular these days is that it facilitates the direct comparison of religion to science.  You didn't even break paragraph before transitioning to that theme.

&gt; So after a couple hundred years, why isn't India primarily Christian?

That's a palpably weird question.  Why would the fact that religions *can* jump cultural boundaries mean that a particular religion, like Christianity, necessarily *would* dominate another culture into which it has been introduced?  The very fact that there are an estimated 24 million Christians, and 138 million Muslims, in India ought to illustrate my point well enough.  If that's not good enough for you, consider the spread of Buddhism into China and Japan.  Or the initial spread of Christianity out of the primarily Jewish communities in the Levant, into Ethiopia and across Roman and Germanic/Scandinavian Europe, through the Caucasus into Russia, and eventually across Atlantic into the Americas.  Religions jump cultures all the time, a fact that you can, of course, easily mitigate by using the term culture to means something obtuse and abstract.

&gt; They're more likely to be Hindu, Buddhist or any number of other Eastern religions, but Christianity still makes up a fraction of a percent of their populations.

Actually, more like 2.3%.  That's pretty small, but it also makes Christianity the third largest religion in the country, after Islam and Hinduism.  Sikhs come in at number 4, with about 1.9% of the population.  All other religions make up less than 2%, including Buddhism which nearly went extinct in India, and is now hovering at about 0.8% of the population.

&gt; Conquest, which is authority by right of the sword, explains the growth of Christianity more than any other reason.

Conquest (ironically) explains the post Medieval growth of Christianity.  Its initial growth outside the cradle of Levantine Jewish groups cannot be explained by conquest, and the conquests of later eras never would have been possible without that initial growth.

Note that, to a certain degree, I'm agreeing with you here -- conquest *can* be a tool for the spread and growth of religion.  But it cannot, on its own, explain that growth, and I suspect that it's a more difficult tool to use than more organic forms of growth.  Consider your earlier example.  From at least the 16th century until only about 65 years ago, India was a nation conquered and ruled by foreign powers with their own religious traditions.  And yet, as you've pointed out, India remains predominantly Hindu.  Conversion as an element of conquest seems to require a concerted dismantling of prior religious institutions and generations spent imposing the imperial religion on the subjected populations.  Very few fledgling religions have the resources to manage that, so even an answer like ""conquest"" still fails to account for the growth of most religions.",,blackstar9000,0,0,,1426230832,0

As with the domestic economy this expansion was often conducted under the aegis of companies with government-guaranteed monopolies in a certain part of the world, such as the Dutch East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company (operating in present-day Canada).

I value a people's actions as the most important, but it would be completely ignorant to ignore the basic biological differences of humans, as we are animals like any other. We are different in many ways, and anthropology, genetics and studies in psychology support these innate differences. I'm lumping people into groups because that is what taxonomy is, lumping lifeforms together based on similar biology and behaviour.

&gt; i don't think there are any human groupings worth preserving that are not based on ideas and actions (i.e. culture/tradition). 

No human groups are worth preserving as they are? Whites/Europeans are the most phenotypically diverse group of humanity. Whites/Europeans have skin pigmentation ranging from the lightest white as snow to a warm olive; hair pigmentations of varying shades of blonde, red, brown, and black; eye pigmentations of varying shades of blue, green, hazel, brown, gray and amber; the varying and distinct noses varying between ethnicities. No other people has this diversity in phenotype. This diversity and overall beauty of Whites/Europeans is well worth preserving, just on this aspect alone. 

Aside from the physical aspect, Whites/Europeans have consistently been more adventurous and creative than any other group of humans, leading to the vast majority of inventions and advancements in human history. The only people that even come remotely close are the northeast-Asian people such as the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese.

&gt; and even those constantly benefit from mixture/experimentation/exchange.

Name an exchange that was beneficial, that is not technology or knowledge. Knowledge and technology can be exchanged without sacrificing a people's genetics, culture or language. I encourage exchanges such as this as every race and ethnicity tends to do things differently (evolution also affects the brain), and thus can contribute to humanity as a whole in their own way. 

&gt; people isolated in their own culture tend to develop strange ideas about other cultures and about the value of their own culture. 

People don't have to practice isolationism in order to preserve their people. A significant aspect of racial-nationalism is to preserve a people by either stopping all immigration or limiting immigration so a foreign people make up a very insignificant portion of the demographics (often suggested to accompany a no-child policy for immigrants of other races). 

Particularly in this day and age with the Internet people can connect with all of humanity. The days where governments could push weird ideas about other peoples through propaganda posters, radio broadcasts or newspapers is over, more or less. We have far more access to information now, provided governments don't clamp down on the Internet. 

&gt; i think racism in your ""traditional"" sense is bullshit along the lines of blind patriotism or dogmatic religious belief. what causes inter-cultural conflict is not having been exposed to other cultures rather than too much exposure to them. 

The word racism has been so abused and appropriated by different groups that the word is for the most part useless. As such, I prefer to use the term racialism to better reflect the desire to separate (on the national level) and preserve every race, ethnicity, culture and language of humanity. 

A lot of people, particularly Liberals, think that all racialists (who they just label as “racists”) are hateful, dogmatic, ignorant and unintelligent. This is entirely unfounded, and almost certainly stems from the fact that the right-wing religious conservative ones are the most outspoken (and are often spewing epithets), as well as the most convenient to use by opposition in order to paint a false picture of racialists. Among racialists you will find most are very articulate, and support science and evidence more than most people.  If people took the time to understand their opposition, they would realize that most racialists are very much against hate, and fully support other races and ethnicities raising themselves up and being the best that they can be. Racialists want to preserve their race, ethnicities, cultures, languages and be left alone without the threats against all of this such as war, immigration, and miscegenation.",,Valkyria,0,0,,1426230859,0

The impression that I get from this is that your position is that some things should require a wider degree of consent from an unspecified electorate.  Whilst I see no problem with that as such, it would seem that it simply comes down to degrees, what would and wouldn't require such consent is unclear.  At present it would seem that the representatives of the people in the members states have voted on (to ratify) agreements that set up certain organisations and bodies, and that you now feel that your representatives shouldn't have had that power.  That argument is valid, but it doesn't change the fact that the EU's existence and any member states membership of it comes on the back of the usual democratic process.  Indeed continued membership and the framework within which the EU and member states operate is entirely under the control of your democratically elected representatives, they could after all at any point repeal the treaties that brought membership about in the first instance.",,ajehals,0,0,,1426230878,0

There's actually at least one fairly illuminating example on this point: the Roman deification of Caesar.  Prior to that, Roman rulers weren't considered gods themselves.  The development of the entire Imperial cult, in fact, is actually fairly well imprinted in the historical record, and it's possible to trace its growth into the worship of the head of state.

The short version is, the religion preceded the deification, although it did require some modification to facilitate Caesar's godhood.  A few elements of Greco-Roman religion helped out.  For one thing, Caesar could reportedly trace his ancestry back to Aeneas, and thus back to the gods, and the general assent to the notion that humans at one time interacted with the gods, as well as to the notion of demi-gods, likely made easier the transition from accepting Caesar as temporal leader to accepting him as a god on earth.  At the same time, you can compare that leap to the governance of 7th century Athens, which had a heavily related religious conceptions, and yet was the birthplace of European democracy.  So there doesn't appear to have been in Greco-Roman religion any intrinsic tendency towards theocracy, and indeed Rome went half its history without the development of a God-emperor.",,blackstar9000,0,0,,1426230894,0

It was three minutes in I might add, if you're trying to keep a chronological tab on things.

People might be compensating in not voting for anti-Palestine stories, you see most of the media in the US won't, or wouldn't until recently even contemplate,  publicising an anti-Israeli story so you probably need to take into account certain geo-politics and counter-lobby reactionary movements when considering the Reddit effect.

Don't make it about ""THE JEWS"" as you put it.  Sure, for some commenters that is what it is about.  Most however don't have any problem with Jewish people whatsoever.  Jon Stewart seems to have an exclusive side entrance to the Reddit front page for example.  One he uses regularly.  He is to Reddit what Willy Wonka is to chocolate.  So being Jewish isn't a cause for downvote.  Invoking a victim complex, on these grounds, is.  For the most part people they can differentiate between Israel and the Jewish people quite easily.  They just don't conflate the issue; for them they are not synonyms and nor should they be treated as such.  Your direct link to a comment said this, ""Total lack of humanity. And they wonder why much of the world hates them.""  Well it's Israel's reputation that's in the dumpster, particularly the settlers, so I wouldn't be too quick to leap to assumptions of outright anti-Semitism.  If that was this particular commenter's intended implication then it would be inappropriate but whether it is or not is assumptive.   You did go on to explain this,

                     one singular entity.""

Well, no, you're being a little chipshouldered there I'm afraid for reasons I have already pointed out.

&gt;The entire nation of Israel is deemed a nation of Nazis.

Well there, if that is the case, but I sense you're being too over sensitive again, you'd be right in raising protest.  Many Israelis themselves are beginning to have issue with the direction Israel is going in.  Just Nazi Germany had its Schindler and Rommels fascist Israel also has its elements, much more established than the parallels, fighting the good fight.  We have the Israeli Veteran Letters petitioning Israel's actions, the likes of B'Tselem and Yesh Gvul to name just a few.  There is post-Zionism of the considerable Israeli academic field.  Some Israelis do have a conscience and haven't bought into the uber nationalist extortion.


Yes you are however right that Reddit seems insistent on the making ""THE ISRAELIS"" (I changed it for you) out to be the Nazis.  This is something I draw issue with.  The Nazis don't have a monopoly on fascism, they are admittedly its poster child but essentially just a Germanic political movement.  Italy's own fascism under Mussolini was itself different from the NSDAP.  Unfortunately when there is ethnic cleansing, an openly aggressive authoritarian right wing government with a kingmaker in FM and Deputy Avigdor Lieberman, occupation, UNSC violation and apartheid then Israel is going to court the fascist mantel - none of which excuses Hamas's role either.

What you will find however is that people outside looking in are starting to see a different angle to Hamas.  Everybody knows they are a political movement with militant connections with odious beginnings.  They're also starting to realise that when they took power they, Palestinians, were told by not only the what is now current US president that they'd never have US support whilst they supported arms but also by EU representatives that if they wanted to have any recognition since coming to power that they should embrace democratic principles.  Well we now know that they asked for a timetabled ceasefire and kept to their obligations until ISRAEL, who didn't meet their end of the bargain during it, broke it on November 4th, 2008.  Israeli intelligence and government admit that during the ceasefire Hamas fired no rockets, Reuters and other news agencies during this time reported that Hamas officials were active for the first time in arresting non-Hamas militants in Gaza trying to attack Israel.  Yet the Gazan and Hamas infrastructures were the ones targeted during Operation Cast Lead alongside international relief programs.

* Most people don't really know a lot about economic figures, like the debt, the deficit and so on. I'm pretty sure not a lot of Greeks are emotionally invested in the EU (and I guess it's about the same in other EU countries). The EU is not a national identity the way the USA is. 
* Tax evasion and strikes are two different topics altogether.
* Tax evasion is a by-product of a culture of short-sighted ""resourcefulness"", self-interest if you will. The justification used by perpetrators is either ""What has the state done for me?"" or ""Look at me; I cheated the system, I'm smart"". There are various theories on how this culture was created but I'll keep it short by providing two ideas: 1 - Ancient Greek tradition presents Greeks as ingenious people that overcame adversity through wit and guile rather than force. See for example the hero Odysseus and the Trojan Horse. 2 - Longer and shorter periods of foreign occupations that encouraged the idea that the state is the enemy, mainly the Turkish rule (1453-1821).
* The constant strikes and demonstrations are a product of a strong Left and labour movement.

The mandate is to be a representative when legislation is produced, moreover, given that the current state of the EU is only possible through legislation within it's member states, and it is that which people generally want to have the odd referendum about, it seems strange to suggest that they should be second guessed.

&gt;""Democracy"" requires that at some point the people's will be the deciding factor.

You can only vote on the basis of what you believe to be right.

And why not? [Terrorism is the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism). This means that the goal of terrorism is to either intimidate the US, or coerce the US into doing something.

Let's see. According to the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution, the US stands for freedom, for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, for the respect of each individual's civil rights as a basis for democracy, and for self-determination of nations as a basis for independence and freedom. If the US shows behaviors that evidence a departure from these values, then they are a signal of either intimidation or successful coercion from terrorists.

That means that if the US stops putting life, freedom, civil rights and the respect of foreign sovereignty on top of any other priority, domestic or international, then the terrorists would have won.

&gt; those who perpetrate them, or those nations who harbor terrorists.

Yes, perpetrating terrorism is a crime. Which means that law enforcement officers should pursue and capture terrorists for them to be tried in a court of law. Any different would mean a capitulation of civil liberties (and as stated above, this would make the terrorists win).

Punishing or invading nations also tramples on their sovereignty, which goes against one of the US's explicit fundamental values. Following this course is a terrorist victory.

&gt; As the sole remaining superpower, the United States has no choice but to take on the job of rooting out terrorism wherever it exists.

There are at least three things wrong with this statement:

1.- The US isn't the ""sole remaining superpower"". China, India and Russia still have plenty military might. The EU and China also have plenty economic might. Of course, they are not a ""superpower"" in the Cold War sense of the world, which means none of these countries stand against or opposed the US. Doesn't mean their opinion shouldn't be taken into account, or that their actions are meaningless.

2.- Even if the US was ""the sole remaining superpower"", this doesn't follow that the US has any responsibility of ""taking on"" any job. If you are playing Civilization and you win by conquering all your foes, or becoming the richest civilization, you enjoy your victory. Victory doesn't become an excuse for responsibility. Particularly, when no one is asking you to take on the responsibility and when over half of the rest of the world would prefer you didn't take on that responsibility. The US's might gives it the possibility to help those who ask for help. The US's compassionate nature gives them the inclination to help those in need. But neither conduces to a moral imperative. In fact, the US would be better off playing the game through and see what happens to the people, the nations, and the planet involved in the ""helping"". Iraq is, today, worse off than it was before the invasion. It will be even worse when the US leave. No one in Iraq asked the US to invade, the Americans weren't welcome as heroes, and most Iraqis, when polled, would prefer US troops to abandon their country. There is no moral imperative.

3.- Again, rooting out terrorism isn't a task for an army or a national movement. It is the task of law enforcement. Any different and the terrorists win.


&gt; It is the U.S. government's responsibility and duty to protect its people and make the world safe from terrorists.

The US does have a responsibility to protect its people, but it can do so by putting effective safeguards and procedures in place. Catching or killing currently existing criminals does nothing to deter future criminals. In fact, in the Arab World, American invasions have fostered a negative image of the Western World, and produced kids that want to become terrorists when they grow up. Is the answer mass genocide of the Arab world to prevent anyone from ever becoming a terrorist? No. The answer is to put public safety measures in effect that reduces the reach and capacity of the terrorists.

Furthermore, the US has no responsibility to the World. It only has a responsibility to its own people. When asked, the majority of the population of the rest of the world prefers the US keeps to its responsibility to its people and leave the rest of the world as ""unsafe"" as they would be if America just minded its own business.

&gt; The war on terrorism is a worldwide struggle

It isn't. It is mostly unorganized groups of people so desperate in poverty and oppression that their only solution is suicidal anger directed towards the most powerful target. The most powerful target is the US only. Most of the rest of the world seldom suffers from international terrorism. (Yes, the Madrid attacks and the London attacks were international terrorism, but their cause was the support these countries were giving the US in their war on terror, proving that a war on terror fosters terrorism). It is for this reason that most countries in the world repudiated the War in Iraq in the UN Security Council, and for this reason why other world leaders, including the Prime Minister of England, and the Presidents of most the G8 countries, have expressed their desire to deal with terrorism through law enforcement and not through military avenues. Even the President of the United States, Barack Obama, has stated that America should move in this direction.

&gt; and the United States must move forward with a worldwide offensive to combat it until all who threaten peace and security are destroyed.

Again, there is no moral imperative for the US to do anything on this issue. Moving to destroy other people goes against the values of America, and in so doing, the terrorists win, and doing so also fosters more terrorism.

&gt; Although it is helpful to have the cooperation of other nations, the United States must be prepared to fight terrorism - using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary - wherever and whenever it threatens.

If the US is going to meddle in the business of other nations, then having their input is very important. The US will affect the environment which it invades. Those inhabiting that environment should have a say on what happens there. You can quote the Declaration of Independence to support this statement.

&gt; Nothing less than US freedom is at stake.

Yes. By allowing terrorists to intimidate and terrorize Americans into renouncing their value of freedom, in favor of an illegal, unjust, and ineffective war, the US is losing to the terrorists. This cannot be allowed.

My bookmarks are too disorganized to pull up sources, but all of what I've said is based on what I have read in many reports and studies. If you are inclined to do so, the information is out there for you to read as well.

&gt; have you seen any real studies backing up the claim that ""whites"" are somehow special among the ""races""?

Yes, and not just Whites/Europeans. Every race and ethnicity is special in their own regard, as we have all evolved differently.

&gt; one would first need to produce a damn good definition of ""race"", which i suspect will be thoroughly difficult.

Many anthropologists have classified the groups pretty well, and it is improving as more genetic studies are done. 

&gt; also, shouldn't we be trying to get rid of that phenotypic diversity among whites by dividing them up according to hair/eye color, according to your logic?

How would you get rid of the diversity, by dividing the groups and thereby helping to preserve the diversity? Dividing or separating inherently preserves. 

I don't support dividing the White/European ethnicities based on just hair and eye pigmentation as those are only two aspects, and are not the most important ones. All White/European ethnicities carry the genes for the variations in hair and eye pigmentations, though some ethnicities have a more predominant type and the frequency changes depending on gene dominance. Each ethnicity has differences in skull shape, nose shape, body size and proportions, and brain variations (which influences culture, behaviour, etc). Regardless of the configuration a particular ethnicity has, I support its preservation as being unique and independent; this means limiting or preventing immigration of other White/European ethnicities.

There are some circumstances where I would support creating a separate nation based entirely on hair and/or eye pigmentation from various White/European ethnicities in order to preserve disappearing traits such as red hair. Some genes are more dominant and can cause certain traits to become more infrequent. 

&gt; when is mixing okay? can a blond marry a dark-haired man, or is that already ""miscegenation""? 

All Whites/Europeans are closely related to each other, far more so than any are related to people outside the Caucasoid race. Any mixing between White/European groups is typically harmonious due to the genetic similarity and small genetic distance. 

Mixing of ethnicities is not the same as mixing races, due to the genetic distance and dissimilarity between races. However most racialists seek to limit the ethnic mixing, or prevent it altogether in some cases, by controlling immigration levels; this is typically sought more for the “old world” territories (e.g. Europe)  as they are more ethnically and culturally intact than the colonial territories. However the colonial territories have been diverging from the “old world” and can become many separate ethnicities with unique cultures, which has actually happened already to some extent despite the ease of travel in the U.S., Canada and Australia.",,Valkyria,0,0,,1426230976,0

The only counter-argument I can think of right away is the case of Great Britain and India.

It's not often realized, but before and even during the Industrial revolution, Indian manufactured goods such as textiles were very competitive on the European market. British Imperialism destroyed much of that, to the benefit of domestic manufacturers and presumably their workers (Marx and Engels might disagree) and to the detriment of Indian development.

&gt;You make it sound like it was imposed by outside forces, not created, joined developed with the input and consent of elected representatives.

I don't think so, I think I make it sound like there are forces outside of the main European ""demos"" that is making these decisions. A representative, as much as I may agree with me, is, in fact, not me. Also, even if s/he is (metaphorically speaking) me, then all that means is that I'll be making the same decision they would have, which calls into question why they need to be the ones who decide the matter.

&gt;You can't expect them to do 100% what you want them to do, just to do what they feel is right. It's a democracy[sic], not somehow your personal government :).

And likewise, I can't expect other people to use their person voting rights(which is the original context of that quote) in a way that I agree with, and so if the decision doesn't go my way, I can concede it in good conscience because it will be what most people are wanting and not just something a representative decided would be in our interests.

Now magnify that effect over millions of people and thousands of issues.

&gt;My point was that if you live in a democracy and it is through that democratic process that you have become a member, then it is also possible to leave if it becomes an issue.

Ideally, but that was also the opinion of antebellum American south. Lenin also talked about free association too...sometimes it doesn't work out that way.

It isn't, I'm not claiming that it is the same.

&gt;The original discussion was whether or not the council was democratically controlled, I say no.

The initial discussion was about the 'EU' not being a democracy and was finessed into the EU not being Democratic.  Each seat in the council is under direct control of an electorate, the presidency is under the control of the Council.

&gt;At one end you say the situation is already democratic and at the other you seem to imply that there's some wide gulf between democracy and status quo.

I am suggesting that for something to be democratic, not every aspect of it must be based on a decision made to voters.

&gt;Which is all well and good but it doesn't address whether or not there are positions of authority in the EU which are undemocratically managed.

There are positions of authority in all sorts of Governments that are not managed by direct democracy, that doesn't make those Governments undemocratic.

&gt;I don't think so, I think I make it sound like there are forces outside of the main European ""demos"" that is making these decisions.

Care to elaborate what forces these are?

&gt;but if they make a decision outside of the people's will, then they've overstepped their actual mandate.

Indeed if they act outside of their mandate, but I fail to see where this is the case at the moment. The EU has been around for a long time now, we have held a number of elections since various EU treaties were enacted, parties have stood with specific policies about EU composition and membership, yet we are still members and the EU still has broad support.  As such I would suggest that the mandate you claim is needed is present.

&gt;Similar principle...  People who think they're in 100% agreement with each other on any issue just haven't talked it over enough.

Couldn't agree more, but representative democracy is still the best system we have found and it relies on this.

&gt;My overall point was just to say that the EU isn't a democratic organization, it's just an organization of individuals appointed by people semi-democratically ""elected.""

And my overall point is that the EU exists as a product of democratic systems, contains elements that are more (the Parliament) and less (the Council etc..) democratic, on a whole the EU is democratic and no part is anti-democratic.

As far as the crux of your idea, that governments are ""tools"" that can be used for good or bad, there are a few stock anarchist objections:

* a) government is by definition a group of people over us and beyond our authority and so the tool is categorically ""bad"" The good you're noticing comes with the bad, and can be accomplished by trying to get human behavior to more closely fit a universal sense of morality, one [which reduces disproportionate state or economic authority to the point of sublation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master-slave_dialectic#Hegel.27s_myth)

* b) Even if use of the tool was justifiable, you would need control of it before you could guarantee it's being used properly. I'm having [a conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/b8hdf/former_top_eu_official_says_europe_must_be_the/c0libp6) along similar lines elsewhere. If you believe people are in general capable of moral judgment and pursuing it, then giving more people control of the tool with the ability to offset each other's dangerous motivations would be the prescription.

This means people are more likely to mate within their ethnicity, and particularly within their own race.

I just wanted to point out this is probably the most silly point in your argumentation. People tend to mate with people they find attractive; which in some cases is people with the same skin color, and in same cases isn't. In fact foreign people are often found exotic and specially attractive, and from an evolutionary point of view it makes sense: having children with people from a different ethnic group brings new genes into the gene pool and diminishes the chances of (I'm sure you'll agree) harmful inbreeding. Not to say we're slaves to such evolutionary conditionants, but they do exist.

If most people mate inside their ethnic group it's because of the statistical fact that most people are surrounded by people of the same ethnicity, and so the opportunities of having offspring with a same-ethnic mate are higher. In mixed-ethnic environments you'll find there is no such bias.

Sorry but it's so silly. Even if I agreed human ethnicities do somehow need preserving, which I don't, if you were right about ""people are naturally more inclined to mate within their ethnicity"" there would be no need to take any action regarding immigration to protect ethnicities. You could just allow it freely and anyway people from different ethnicities would not mate, leading to a ""natural"" state of ""ethic purity preservation"".

No, it doesn't show what you believe it shows.  Read section 3 of chapter 3.

&gt;It still lends strength to what has already been established, that communism and socialism are not the same in his optics. 

It doesn't lend anything to your argument because his Marx's day, he and everyone else used socialism and communism interchangeably.

&gt;You still haven't explained why he only refers to his movement as 'communism' and not socialism. 

He referred to his movement as socialism all the time.  The reason why Marx kept referring to other socialists as ""socialists"" was to distinguish his ""scientific socialism"" with their ""utopian socialism"".  Engels called himself and Marx ""scientific socialists"" on more than one occasion.

The reason why the terms mean different things today is because they evolved into separate political programs.  The term ""democratic-socialist"" sprang forth by groups of people who wanted to separate themselves from the other socialists.  The democratic socialists didn't want to use violence and bloodshed whereas the other socialists did.  Thus the terms socialism and communism split.  The ""peaceful"" socialists called themselves socialists, and the other socialists were now called communists.

But originally, the terms were used interchangeably.  You don't have to insist on a false interpretation of history just to protect the term socialism from the ""stain"" of Marxism.

&gt;Or the fact that he continuously derides various 'socialist' doctrines in the chapter mentioned.

He also *supported* various socialists.  These facts however are irrelevant.  

&gt;And from Marx himself, but especially in the modern perspective, which means you lose the argument either way.

No, not from Marx himself.  What you are talking about occurred later on, which means you lost the argument last week.

&gt;I understood perfectly what you said but chose to ignore your point because it was entirely irrelevant to the discussion.

It is not irrelevant because it shows that the split occurred after Marx originally used the terms interchangeably.

&gt;You are completely wrong, EU legislation has means that national trade barriers are now gone. It is naive to think that without any international legislation free trade would automatically flourish because in the real world, states legislate and limit free trade.

If trade barriers fall, it is because legislation decreases.  It is ignorant to believe that international legislation is required for international trade.  International trade began to flourish before any international rules or bodies were formed.  The creation of the EU and other larger governmental bodies only took place *after* international trade and cross Europe trade had already become widespread and thus appeared attractive to governmental parasites for taxation and control.

&gt;You're talking gibberish here. Within the EU it isn't everything that is regulated, at all. It's first and foremost rules that insure free trade and equal terms for national industries.

Logic and evidence always appear as gibberish to simpletons.  You contradicted yourself.  If you argue that the trade of the means of production are regulated by governments, which you did, then you are arguing that the means of production are regulated and controlled by government, i.e. socialist policies.  You can't deny and affirm the same proposition.

&gt;Haha, no. Then every government that has ever existed is socialist.

Haha, yes.  And no, it does not follow that every government that has ever existed is socialist.  It shows that every government that has ever existed has carried socialist policies.  The question is how much.  The founding years of the US had almost no governmental regulation of means of production.  That is the closest any country has ever approached true capitalism.  And wouldn't you know it, the country grew so fast that it became the richest most prosperous nation the world had ever seen, and blew by Europe and left its socialist ass in the dust.  But, it was not to last because socialists like you came into the US and wrecked the place.

&gt;Like I said, you are reducing it to political talking points whereby everything that is authority automatically is socialist. It is stupid.

They just blame Israel for trying to protect its citizens from being rocketed around the clock by the Jihad group that took over Gaza - and they blame Israel even more! The more Israel reaches for peace, the more violence + criticism it receives from all parties. * 


The core of the problem in the Middle East is NOT that ""Israel has too much land"" and if it just gave up a fraction more of its land to the Arabs... the Jihad would forever stop and there would be peace. That is absurd. The Arabs ruthlessly attacked Israel in 1967, before 1967, and before modern Israel existed, in 1929, 1897, and 1217!  Arab Muslims have a well-documented, resplendent history of unprovoked violence against those outside their own particular family clan or Shiite, Sunni/ Wahhabi faction. **Jews, in contrast, have a well-documented history of living very peacefully alongside other cultures in Europe and the Middle East... and ZERO religious or cultural tolerance for violence (except for self-defense or survival) or terrorism, ever..**

The core problem in the Middle East is the Arab Muslim denial that Jewish people are indigenous to the region and their refusal to allow Jews to live, unmolested, on a tiny swatch of historic Jewish land... outside of Islamic control. 

(800,000 Jews were pushed out of ancient communities in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia in 1948 + forced to abandon private property more than 4 times the size of Israel)

**If Muslims would accept that they could only control 99.99% of the Middle East -- and they'd tolerate the right of a brutally oppressed, desperately peace-seeking indigenous minority to have a tiny, self-governing safe haven on just PART of the Jewish historic homeland (0.01% of the M.E.) -- then there would be IMMEDIATE peace.**


If Israel just put down its guns and caved into the demands of the Palestinians and the other Jihad-loving enemies, Jews would be mass murdered in seconds.

Then how can a decision be democratic if the public isn't consulted?

&gt;The initial discussion was about the 'EU' not being a democracy and was finessed into the EU not being Democratic. 

I didn't mean to sound sneaky, also those sound like the same conversation.

&gt;Each seat in the council is under direct control of an electorate, the presidency is under the control of the Council.

Not in [the council that actually matters though](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union). 

&gt;I am suggesting that for something to be democratic, not every aspect of it must be based on a decision made to voters.

""Democracy"" can be use loosely, and I have in this conversation, but that doesn't change the meaning of the word. You wouldn't call me blonde for standing next to Dolph Lundgren. Similarly, unelected people don't become democratically appointed just because the person who put them there was democratically hired to do something else.

&gt;There are positions of authority in all sorts of Governments that are not managed by direct democracy, that doesn't make those Governments undemocratic.

No, but we're not dealing with trivial positions here. We're dealing with people in important positions where the public has no [ability to overrule](http://www.eu-referendum.org/english/about_us/index.html) unless it is so heinous that the one elected fears he may lose too many votes next election. Outside of that, they don't feel any public pressure outside of their own sense of morality.

&gt;Care to elaborate what forces these are?

People who get appointed rather than elected. They are part of the demos, but not the ""main"" part since they can't be said to even try to represent anyone other than the person who appointed them.

&gt;but I fail to see where this is the case at the moment.

Because there's no example of a member of parliament or the council being overruled by popular vote.

&gt;As such I would suggest that the mandate you claim is needed is present.

I'm in favor of not getting invaded by a foreign power, I guess that also means I support having a military budget larger than most of the industrialized combined. Supporting an organization isn't the same as supporting every aspect of the organization.

&gt; Couldn't agree more, but representative democracy is still the best system we have found and it relies on this.

Not true, here are three good alternatives:

* [Anticipatory Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipatory_democracy)
* [Deliberative Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy)
* [Delegative Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_Democracy)

Even if representative democracy were all there was, there has to be some sort of ""game of telephone"" effect on mandates, in which case, _at least_ advocate opening the positions up for representational elections.

&gt;on a whole the EU is democratic and no part is anti-democratic.

Turkey would indeed go ballistic over such a deal, but I think they sort of gloss things over when they say ""Turkish anger would serve US interests"". I don't think the Turks are so easily manipulated. In fact, I think this is typical short-sighted strategy that appears to solve a crisis now, while creating a bigger crisis in the future. Like arming the Taliban seemed like a good idea when they were fighting the Russians, but now it's turned around to bite us in the ass.

Briefly, about 25% of the Turkish population is Shia, belonging to the Alevi sect. There have been Sunni-Shia clashes in Turkey before, and the situation there remains uneasy. No doubt Turkey would be very unhappy to see Iranian influence grow in the region. Also, no doubt Turkey would feel threatened, since it shares a border with Iran, and would worry about Iranians instigating ethnic violence in Turkey, as they are already doing in Iraq. And Turkey is certainly very powerful, much more powerful than Iran.

However, this is **bad** policy. Turkish Shia people are not like Shias in Iran or Iraq. The Alevis have a strong Sufi component to their religion, and they are Shia in name only, since like other Shias, they also believe in the 12 Imams. But they are **much more progressive**. Turkish Shia women don't have to wear burkas or head scarves. They wear modern clothes, worship right alongside the men in their religious places. In fact, while Turkey as a whole is much less fundamentalist than most Muslim dominated countries, the Turkish Shias are **even more** secular and anti-fundamentalist than their Sunni countrymen.

There is a tension in Turkey right now between fundamentalist and secular forces. The spread of Wahabi Islam hasn't spared Turkey, and even though it has been one of the more Europeanized and secular of Muslim countries, there is a lot of encroaching fundamentalism going on there. And guess who's fighting it? It's the Turkish Shia population, which has always regarded the strict legalistic interpretation of Quran+Hadith as a perversion of Islam, only foisted upon Muslims by the Arabs, whom they regard as having a medieval mindset. After all, the Shia in Turkey were among the earliest supporters of Kemal Ataturk, and his overthrow of religious elements to create a secular state.

If the US allies with Iran as the article suggests, Turkey will be forced to play a greater role in the region to fight Iranian dominance of the Gulf. And Iran will play it's own card, that of fomenting trouble between Sunnis and Shias in Turkey, as they are doing right now in Iraq. And this will only radicalize the Shia in Turkey. When people get radicalized, they turn away from ideas such as secularism, and retreat into ethnic, religious and cultural solidarity, along with the petty hatreds they bring. Any Shia rebellion in Turkey will only bring down the wrath of the Sunnis, who are already pushing hard for a more strict version of Islam.

In short, what will end up happening is that Turkey will become more dysfunctional, less secular. And if you think that radical Islam is a problem in Iran and Iraq, you haven't seen anything yet. Iran is a problem because Iran is more powerful than just about any Muslim country around the middle east. And Turkey is vastly more powerful than Iran. Why create a disaster there?

We need to learn that strategies that consist of pitting our friend-of-the-moment against someone we dislike more, is not long term strategy.

Here's where I have a problem with your argument. The early Zionists were not indigenous, they were Jews of mostly Eastern European dissent. They set out to create a state in Palestine (after considering Argentina and Kenya) with little regard for the existing population. Ok, there's a claim about ""historic"" right to the land, but Arabs can make the same claims. In fact, you can make all kinds of claims of ethnic groups connections to different parts of the world which would result in complete chaos if you tried to put people back where they came from. Arab Jews lived very peacefully with Muslims and Christians throughout the Middle East for centuries before the rise of political Zionism. 

So the question is, why should people have to give up *any* portion of their land for a minority of Europeans (Jewish or otherwise) who had never stepped foot in the Middle East before to build their new home? Particularly when the British had promised that land to the Arabs in exchange for fighting the Ottoman Turks. Then two years later, they promised the same land to the Zionists. 

Of course, the answer is not simple. First of all, many Jews who came from Europe did not want to go to Palestine. They were fleeing legitimate anti-Semitism, particularly in Germany in the 30's, and their preferred places of immigration (the US and UK) were limiting immigration. Furthermore, Israelis born in Israel didn't choose to be born there and their rights and safety need to be respected as well as those of the Palestinians. Israel has a right to defend itself, but not by occupation, destruction of homes, expansion of settlements and stealing of resources. That's not defensive. I'm not defending the Gaza rocket attacks, I'm just saying that in the same period (2005-2007) 4 Israelis were killed by Gaza rockets and 1300 Gazans were killed by the IDF. 

Incidentally, the ghetto uprisings in Nazi occupied Europe were considered acts of terrorism by the Nazis. Also, today many young Israelis are taught to hate Palestinians and Arabs. They are allowed to write messages on bombs, they were tshirts with pregnant Arab women in crossfires and, in this picture, one of them throws wine at an Arab woman. You can say that it's in response to what the Palestinians do and the Palestinians will say the same thing about what the Israelis have done to them. Chicken or the egg.

Oh come on, we have been over this again and again and again.  Just because the Prime minister of the UK isn't directly elected the UK isn't suddenly undemocratic.

&gt;I didn't mean to sound sneaky, also those sound like the same conversation.

No :) There is a very definite difference between suggesting that a specific mechanism or element is not democratic, and suggesting that an entire entity isn't.  We could go back to the selection of a British Prime Minister or the Composition of select committees (or the way judges are selected etc..).

&gt;Not in the council that actually matters though.

From the Article you linked *""The Council is composed of twenty-seven national ministers (one per state). The exact membership depends upon the topic; for example, when discussing agricultural policy the Council is formed by the twenty-seven national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area (with the related European Commissioner contributing but not voting).""*

Each seat is taken by a Minister who, in his own state will be elected (some minor exceptions may apply when a member state doesn't elect all those who may become ministers..).  So yes.

&gt;Similarly, unelected people don't become democratically appointed just because the person who put them there was democratically hired to do something else.

And something doesn't cease to be democratic when some positions within it are not an elected one, especially not when those positions are filled by people who have themselves already been elected (if not to that specific post).

&gt;No, but we're not dealing with trivial positions here. We're dealing with people in important positions where the public has no ability to overrule unless it is so heinous that the one elected fears he may lose too many votes next election.

And how does one 'overrule' an elected member in most Governments normally?  The whole idea is that if a representative acts in a manner his constituents don't like that he will be unseated at the next election.

&gt;Because there's no example of a member of parliament or the council being overruled by popular vote.

Where does this happen in normal Governmental process?  When do we suddenly start having a quick popular vote to check whether we like a policy or piece of legislation?  Usually this is part of the election process... If we don't like what you do, we won't elect you again.

&gt;I'm in favor of not getting invaded by a foreign power, I guess that also means I support having a military budget larger than most of the industrialized combined

A mandate doesn't mean that everyone has to agree with everything either....

&gt;Not true, here are three good alternatives:

Why?  There is a mandate, a mandate that could be withdrawn easily enough by the electorate in any state. 

&gt;it's still less democratic than the British or American models, which was my original point. 

It is, but it isn't a national government.  I assume by the way that if you are referring to it as *less* democratic that I can take it as read that you now agree that the EU as a whole is democratic?  Just not as Democratic as you would prefer?

&gt;The models are flawed, but at least if the EU followed them, then it would be a bad idea on a par with the American bad idea.

The EU is not a nation state, if we start equipping it as one we end up with something that has the legitimacy of a nation state, I would rather we stick with what amounts to a glorified cooperation body and let them have the titles that they wish to take.  The EU is sufficiently democratic in it's current role, if it were a pan European 'Federal' Government it wouldn't be sufficiently democratic, but then I would o pretty much anything in my power to prevent there being a European 'Federal' Government of that type.

I appreciate your through response, and you make some valid points... but I don't buy into your covteous ""fairness"" argument.

 Nothing is remotely ""fair"" in the Middle East. The weak and the powerless are brutally, violently suppressed and abused by dictators as a matter of course. Women are bitchslapped and ordered around by their men - with laughter and impunity. Kurds and Alevee are beaten and gassed. Gays are whipped and electrocuted. Pro-democracy demonstrators are raped and have their fingernails pulled out in private prisons.

Israel is the only ""regime"" that even tries to be ""fair"" to its enemies and that explicitly grants and guarantees equal rights to minorities under law.

Let's say for a second, that a big chunk of Israel's Jewish population has some European genetics... composed of people like my Jewish Lithuanian ancestors who did NOT migrate to Israel (and as a result were shot in the head at the edge of large ditches in the Russian woods).  Okay, so there is an infinitesimal minority of people from outside the Middle East - seeking refuge and save haven from anti-semitism there. People who are - by and large -  contributing to civilization, trade, science, techmology, and a better future in the Middle East beyond Islamism and oil wealth. The fact that these people live there could be seen as a blessing - to a non-bigot.

The Jewish narrative says that before 1948, there were more than 800,000 Jews living in ancient communities in Syria, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia. Now there are less than 50,000 - and most didn't leave by choice. Most of them went to Israel - and these indigenous-to-the-Middle-East Mizhari Jews make up 40% of the current Jewish population in Israel.

**The Arab Muslim narrative says Jews have no business being in the Middle East at all, indigenous or not, their ancient synagogues should be dynamited and their ancient graves should be used to pave roads**... and that the Middle East is strictly the political domain of Arab Muslims from the Arabian peninsula... any non-Arab Muslim self-determination or culture is an insult to Muhammad and Islam... and the only way minorities could conceivably be allowed to live there is if they were heavily controlled and taxed by Muslims... and it was made clear they were second class citizens without full rights. 

If you want to be concerned about ""Fairness"" - Arab Muslims like the ""Palestinians"" have over 30 countries where they are allowed to live and practice their religion without harassment.... and the Jews have one microscopic scrap of a state surrounded by violent, hateful and uncompromising Jihad groups waiting to murder them at a moments notice. The  continent of Europe that turned on them and helped cleanse them out in the 1930's... is becoming openly hostile towards them, once again.

Therefore, It think it's only ""fair ""and ""socially just"" that Jews have a defensible little spot of their own, considering how much oppression and violence they have been subjected to... the Jews right to life, liberty and survial is more ""fair"" than the Arab's need to redeem their honor and not feel the shame of losing their attacks on Jews in 1948, 1967, 1973, 2000, 2008, etc.,.. and the Jews security is more ""fair"" than the Arabs bleating losers demand to make the Jews return to the 1967 borders that would render Israel defenseless in the age of rockets and missiles.

I do not support the fascist, apartheid, Arab-Muslim-Only narrative in the Middle East...

I find it troubling that so many ""liberal"" and ""open-minded"" people in the West side with the Islamists -- who are viciously anti-semetic and opposed to the Jewish people's humble desire to survive as a people. Jews are real people... with a distinct language, religion, holidays, traditions and culture... not a population group of Arab Muslims called ""Palesitnians""  - who are human beings,  but who are culturally identical to the majority of people in the 10 surrounding countries.

I was on a return trip to the US from Europe and on the return I had to step through an x-ray security scanner at Schiphol airport. I remember hesitating when going in there, but I was tired from the long trip and felt forced to do it ( everyone else did, and now I feel like a sheep! ).

I was told to put my feet at the markers so that my legs were spread apart, thereby arranging my dangly bits in a free-to-fall position.

He replied that the images are censored, and so they cannot see my equipment ( Being a very important security guard at the airport, and to trigger me even more, he of course had to take an extra security peek in my passport... ).

No, I didn't explode, nor did I cry, but I felt really intimidated and cursed the G.W. Bush and roughly 50% of the US population for putting the World in this situation.

Now there are less than 50,000 - and most didn't leave by choice. Most of them went to Israel - and these indigenous-to-the-Middle-East Mzhari Jews make up 40% of the current Jewish population in Israel.

Correct. You may also be aware that prior to 1948, they lived peacefully with Muslims, Christians, and non-religious people, mostly (including the Jews) of Middle Eastern descent. And of course, you're no doubt aware that 1948 is when Israel (lead by European Zionists) declared itself a state without any treaties or agreements with the Arab population there. They initially claimed the land given to them by the UN (roughly half of Palestine), which Palestinians had no say in and rejected. And then of course, Palestinian Arabs declared war on Israel, later followed by other Arab countries. And during the war, Israel took even more land than the UN had given them and temporarily occupied parts of the other countries. 

This lead many Arabs in the Middle East to view Zionists as aggressive and expansionist and, sadly, many turned on their Jewish brothers. That's awful and they didn't deserve that. The Jews in Europe didn't deserve the horrible persecution they got. The Jews emigrating from Eastern Europe didn't deserve the hatred they faced in the US and the UK when they were trying to flee from these horrible conditions and had no where else to go but the Middle East. However, this doesn't justify the aggressive Zionists who wanted to drive the non-Jewish population out of Palestine. Even many Middle Eastern Jews were against Zionism because they saw it inciting ethnic hatred. 

You say that the Palestinians have other places they could go where they won't be oppressed, but surely you don't think it's that simple. Refugees have shitty lives. They have lost everything and usually live in overcrowded, poor, and unhealthy conditions. What would you have said to a Nazi who said, ""The Jews can move somewhere where they can live without harassment, but it won't be Germany""? In fact, many Nazis *did* say that. Not to mention that Zionists considered other parts of the world before settling on Palestine. Besides the fact that you acknowledge (correctly) that many of other Arab countries do not have very good living conditions for the refugees. And there are vast cultural differences between these countries. A woman in Syria has a lot more freedom than a woman in Saudi Arabia, but that's a totally separate discussion.

Please understand that I am not trying to disrespect you, your family, Judaism, or even Israelis. Jews as a people suffered tremendously in Europe (as did many other groups, though none as bad in the Nazi Holocaust) and we should never forget that. Contradicting policies at the end of the first World War really fucked up that whole region and there's not an easy solution.

I have studied the Holocaust as an independent researcher for quite a while. I started out as a believer, then became a ""denier"", then became ""agnostic"" when certain aspects of the Holocaust became irrefutable while others are probably exaggerated.

I can explain about the controversy, why some people deny the Holocaust, the evidence for or lack thereof.

It is a very large subject on which dozens of books have been written so obviously you cannot cover everything here. It spans quite a few years and a continental scope, made up of a large number of events.

If I were to summarize the Holocaust it would be the destruction of European Jewry through persecution, expulsion, massacres and gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Around half of the 6 million are said to have died or were killed in concentration camps (mostly through homicidal gas chambers) and the other half through pogroms and mass shootings (the ""Holocaust by bullets"") in the eastern German occupied territory. 

Most of you are probably more interested in the gas chambers, so here's a summary: 6 camps, all of them in Nazi occupied Poland, are said to have had homicidal gas chambers: Auschwitz, Majdanek, Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Only 2 of these remain (Auschwitz and Majdanek), the rest were closed and bulldozed long before the war was over. In Auschwitz only one reconstructed gas chamber remains in the Auschwitz main camp, while in Majdanek there are said to be 4 remaining gas chambers - the rest were blown by the retreating Germans and only rubble remains of the main gas chambers of Auschwitz Birkenau - Kremas II, III, IV and V.

The point is that China is looking for an incident with plausible deniability, and which can potentially be spun to make it look like the US is using bullshit evidence to attack them (like the USS Maine, Tonkin Gulf, Iraq...). Either way, their goal would be a quick, devastating blow to US bases and ships in the area, and then sue for peace. There wouldn't be time for NATO to get involved. The European NATO members wouldn't want to get involved with one of their biggest trading partners on the behalf of the US. They would sit it out, which would be another blow to the US in terms of political loss. US allies/clients in the Far East *might* help out, though there's little they would be able to do against China and they'd only invite reprisal attacks on them. Japan doesn't have the offensive capability and is well within range of Chinese missiles. South Korea wouldn't be able to mount much of an offensive against them and doing so would not only bring reprisals from China, but could possibly trigger North Korea to launch an attack in a moment of perceived weakness (or if they think Korea might attack them next). Taiwan wouldn't do well to help us as they are in the crosshairs of a *lot* of China's military. They would simply give China a reason to invade and conquer them. At any rate, reprisal attacks would only widen the conflict and I don't think the US will be willing to do that with China considering their economic position. Who knows if the US media would be able to get the public to believe what actually happened; no one believes their shit anymore these days and they would definitely look like they'd be shilling for the government again. Any way you slice it, it's going to be a big win for China and a huge, pivotal loss for the US. The fact that they are actively trying to make this happen means it's only a matter of time. I'm sure our Navy is well aware of this strategy of theirs, but what can they do? If they back off before something happens then they lose without a shot and set the precedent that China is capable of bullying the US military, so no US ally is safe anymore.

And I appreciate you for having the intelligence to understand that the situation in the Middle East is more nuanced and complex than a struggle between ""good guys"" - the Palestinian Arab refugees who lost their homes in Israel -  and the ""bad guys"" - the Jewish refugees who lost their homes in Europe and the Middle East.

*I understand well that the reality in the Middle East is not completely ""fair"" for anyone.* Not for Israeli Jews, not for Saudi artists, not for Jordainian gays, not for peaceful Lebansese farmers, not for Coptic Christians, not for Kurds, not for Sunnis, not for Egyptian women, not for Turkish military officers.


What I think you don't quite grasp is, that: **the Middle East is not a land of fairness, decency, democracy and cooperation... and it never has been.** 

The idea that political matters in the Middle East are historically (or currently) handled by Western-style consensus and ""mutual, democratic agreement"" is insane... it just doesn't work like that.... the whole idea of consensus, win-win and common good is alien to Arab culture,.. which has been based on tribal feuds, monarchs and warlords.

**Do you think Islam was spread through the region and beyond by ""neutral consensus and fair, mutual agreement"" with the conquered parties?** Do you think Saddam Hussein was concerned about fairness to his minorities and the Kuwaits? Do you think the king of Syria is ""fair"" to other people who wish to voice their say about how Syria should be governed? or the Supreme Leader in Iran was ""fair"" about the elections? Did the Turks consider the human rights of the Armenians? Are career-minded women in Saudi Arabia treated with equality and respect?

No, no and no.

Maybe the Western idea of ""fairness"" and ""allowing other tribes to exist, unharmed"" will pervade with Israel's influence one day... but historically and now,  i land where might is right and the person with the strongest army makes the rules and takes the land, and murders or oppresses the local population.  That is what the Arabs and Iranians are planning to do to Israel the moment they have enough uranium and rockets..... they are not proposing a ""democratic conesensus process"" - so it is UNFAIR to one-sidedly demand that Israel play the game according to a set of principles that are laughed about by its enemies. 


I am not one-sided or brainwashed. I understand the Palestinian Arabs narrative have some truth to it, and they have some valid claims and questions to the land that is now Israel.

As a Jewish person, I am not that concerned with ""fairness"" to people who flatly deny my history (the ancient Jewish connection to Israel, the reality of the Holocaust, etc.)  and stubbornly refuse to recognize my right to exist...  as much as I am concerned with survival and wanting to live without my culture  (heritage, religion, country)  being attacked - physically, legally, emotionally. I just want to live, and cooperate, and use my brain to make the world a better place for everyone - including Arabs -  and leave it richer and happier place than when I was born.


 The Jewish experience living as a ""protected minority"" in various lands has been repeatedly tragic and brutal - and that is why **I believe that a defensible Israel - on part of our historic, native land - is more than a ""fair"" request.** 

It's more important, to me,  than the Arabs being able to brag that they conquered half of Jerusalem and pretend they never lost the war when they attacked the Jews in 1967.


I don't view the success of Israel as a ""zero sum"" game where the refugees in Israel became wealthy and prosperous at the ""unfair"" expense of the Palestinian Arabs and their chalky soil and stone huts. I think the Jewish refugees in Irsrael did well largely because of their attitude and work ethic when faced with an unimaginably rotten and unfair situation. The Palestinains have suffered - in part - because of their very different attitude when faced with a rotten and ""unfair"" situation.

I think that there is enough room in the Middle East for both Arabs and Jews to have a safe, defensible place of their own.

I do not believe the core  issue is that ""*Israel has too much land, and if it gives the Arabs a fractionally better real estate deal, Jihad will cease forever , as an obsolte negotiating tactic.* ""

That's why I think that ""land for peace"" is just an illusion, a pipe dream, a fantasia...  something that will only lead to more war - until Arab culture heals and modernizes enough to respect the rights of other tribes to exist without feeling that is it a ""shame"" or ""insult to their honor.""

**What do you believe the actual issue - away from the emotions, tired cliches and propagada - really is?**

I'd have to believe it is probably intentionally racist, ""the South will rise again,"" ""let's re-segregate our schools"" kind of thinking.

To be fair, though, the ""politically correct"" terminology keeps changing. I call my wife and children black, when there's some reason to make that particular distinction, although some would say that the politically correct term is ""African-American."" She dislikes that term because I don't go around referring to myself as a ""Northern-European-American"" because my ancestors were from Scotland and Denmark. (And, of course, if I go back far enough, my ancestors were actually from Africa _too_...)

My favorite example of political correctness gone awry is hearing that term used for classmates _who were from Kenya_, studying overseas, or co-workers on work visas from Nigeria... THEY'RE AFRICAN! Geez... and if I were a white guy from Lesotho who moved to Michigan, I'd technically be a white African-American, would I not?

We are talking about a world in which there are no states and people take responsibility for what happens, not a world in which people wait around for the state to tell them where and when to fight.  The International Brigades were a trickle of people who thought - unlike the majority of their countrymen - outside the boundaries of what their state sanctioned and condoned.  This is not how people think now.  People wait for states to declare war, undertake military actions, and so on.  Government is something you pay attention to every four years (here in the US).

I am talking about a world where there is no state to do this.  So what you are claiming is ""my strategy"" is not ""my strategy.""  It is an example, a prototype, a small scale experiment, of how authoritarianism can be resisted in the absence of a state and standing army.  What I am proposing is something far larger - where all responsibility for these things lies in the hands of citizens, as do the consequences.  As governments recoiled in horror to Nazi expansionism across Europe, so too, did individuals.  I don't see how this would change.

Secondly, you are talking to me like the primary value here is winning wars you yourself think are important.  I would ask to what end.

In fact, I am not trying to persuade you of anything.  I am trying to work toward a world with likeminded people where people like you have no power whatsoever to force anyone to fight your wars.  You will have the power to convince people to fight, but you will not have the power to force people to fund your pet military endeavors, nor draft people.

You take all of your list as primaries: That these concerns trump all other concerns, including the rights of individuals.

I am saying, that nothing is more important than the rights of individuals.

In the absence of a state and the standing armies which go with them - which is nothing like what happened in the Spanish Civil war save the Spanish anarchists themselves - people either will or will not take responsibility (take up arms) to fight authoritarianism.

I say they will.  I say they will because it is not difficult to see how all of our interests are threatened by authoritarians, when you remove all of the noise caused by state involvement, by which I mean all of the underhanded, cynical motivations behind war which have nothing to do with the rights of individuals.

This is not a matter of presenting to you some kind of theoretical alternative and making abstract arguments that it is superior to yours and therefore you ought to sign up for some huge social plan.  This is the unfortunate (and useless way) politics is always debated online: ""My way will work!""  ""No it won't!""  ""Yes it will!""  ""OMG who will pay for the ROADZ!""

I mean to merely create a situation where voluntary association and mutual aid can openly compete with hierarchical, coercive institutions, because I believe that such a condition will lead to either the complete withering away of the state, or at very least, its diminished influence in human affairs.

This is a battle to permanently disempower people from being able to force anyone to do anything.  In so doing, individuals will have a personal stake in the outcome - in the society and world in which they live.  It will not be a matter of being drafted and threatened with the stockade.  It will not be a matter of fighting and dying for resources.  It will not be a matter of serving multinational corporations and firms like Blackwater who profit from war.  It will not be a matter of being taxed into oblivion for dumb phony financially motivated foreign wars.

It is a radical evolutionary vision for our future.  The information and arguments and thought is out there.  You can buy into it, or not buy into it.

And should people like me succeed - and I'm realistic enough to say that it's an uphill battle, you will be free to make your case and convince people that something or someone is worth fighting for.  All that will change is your ability to compel people to do so.

Inasmuch as people talk about anarchy like it is some kind of unworkable scenario, they seem awfully blind to how ""unworkable"" statism is if you give a damn about individual rights.  If you're poor.  If you're landless.  If you're drafted.

Critiques of anarchism always start from the assumption that what we have is pretty good now.  I'm sure the French monarchy thought things were pretty good too while the peasants rioted outside.  It's a matter of perspective.

I am not a utopian.  I am sure bad things will still happen under anarchism.  But in the way the lack of a state invests one in the world, I suspect you will see remarkable human ingenuity.

Because I believe in people.  I believe in individuals.  I believe you don't have to point a gun at their back to make a society worth living in.

You're free to disagree, but I will keep framing the debate this way because ultimately, this is precisely how it is.  You make the paradoxical argument that authoritarianism cannot be fought, except with authoritarianism: the state.

And I'm sure despite this you think I'm being unrealistic.

I'm saying blast all old paradigms to dust.

Multinational corporations exist primarily as a means of circumventing the particular laws of each nation in which they operate.  They benefit from the differences in laws by taking advantage of cheap labor in economically oppressed nations, tax breaks in the Caribbean,  a large, wealthy consumer base in places like Europe, and government subsidies from places like the U.S..  Multinational corporations are less likely to get charged with monopoly laws because their markets are international,  and they can bust unions with almost no penalty because they tend to place all their production plants in nations with very corrupt governments.  Basically multinationals are the lowest of the low when it comes to dirty business procedures.  

In the case of food, as was pointed out in the film, they have the ability to use government subsidies to sell food abroad that is artificially cheaper than local business can produce it.  This happened in Haiti with American grown rice, which devastated their economy, and even more dramatically in Mexico, where genetically modified corn strains from the U.S. not only put millions of small, local farmers out of business, but they mixed with local strains, eliminating ancient, highly desirable strains from the gene pool altogether.  This was also the cause of the Star link corn incident if I recall correctly.

So, in a nutshell, saying that multinational corporations are simply business that operate in more than one country is like saying armies are just groups of people with weapons.

One sunday in june 2009, a friend and I decided to meet at la Villette (which a big park with some museum in Paris) because there is this nice music festival and part of it is free during this sunny afternoon. We first listened to a crazy band from Israel called Monotonix (http://myspace.com/monotonix). And then, Dan Deacon is playing live somewhere else. For some reasons I don't remember at all but I already had some of his music on my ipod. So we see him live with his friends which most of them are from the band Teeth Mountain. We enjoy it. And I actually really appreciate the people playing with him. So a couple of day after, I check their myspace, like their stuff and see that they are done with Deacon's tour and are starting their own around Europe. Their first date is in Paris, actually a little bit outside of Paris, in the basement of a totally random bar called le Pixi. My roommate and I went to this concert together (I had some exams the day after btw). When we enter, it's just a crazy guy singing weird stuff in frenchyspanish. And then, teeth mountain is getting ready. But the electricity goes down... No more power in the basement. During 20 to 30 minutes, some people, including me, try to solve the problem. And I actually did it. I saved the concert. Which had to be much shorter unfortunately. The concert goes and then we started to drink some beer with the band, smoked some stuff and talk about I don't know what. At some point I invited them to my place (they were supposed to sleep at someone else's) and they accept. They had this nice van for their tour and they drove us home. I end up buying a bottle of vodka. We arrive at my appartment, talk, try some french food, listen to some music, etc... I realize I am the only one drinking, I start to be fucked up and tell them that their tatoos are pretty cool.
Their answer? ""do you want one?"" ""euhhmmmm.... ok!""
And during 2 hours and half, while I am drinking a bottle of vodka, a girl and a guys (andrew + kate) I didn't know until tonight, are drawing their symbol on my arm.
here is the pic for the one who can wait: http://imgur.com/DK1kX.jpg

First of all, understand there is no other solution, so we have to make it work, if not with the free market then with central planning. I say this as a libertarian and I concede it may be socialist, but it can be profitable, so it won't be a bad socialist program, also the gov can float part of it on the market. [Électricité de France](http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2053355) who reported profits of 3.4B for 2008, produces 22% of the EU's electricity, 74% of which is from Nuclear. They are 85% owned by the French gov.

Secondly, the economics of Nuclear Power are completely different, the always capex is a lot more than the opex, so its crucial to get it right in the planning stage. This is hard to comprehend for the mining companies who come and go as they please with very little planning, and they have little interest in changing the way they operate to provide energy, especially if it requires putting 90% of their opex into the capex of a new project. Both Exxon and Shell tried and failed miserably, they simply were not fully committed.

Those are two very important points I made, and there is a third.

Besides for the fact that we have no choice the Sun, Wind and Seas can't provide for our energy needs, there are also these mining companies that have a vested interested in maintaining the status quo.

Consumer demand is what will make Nuclear Energy work, and I don't doubt for a second that the above mentioned drilling and mining companies are involved with the opponents of Nuclear Power. This makes it very hard for environmentalists to approach this subject with any intellectual honesty.

I so happen not to subscribe to either of the [Nuclear Debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate) altogether as I am a proponent of the [LFTR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHs2Ugxo7-8) so Peak Uranium doesn't concern me, and the Nuclear Power vs. Renewable Energy is completely irrelevant to me too because it does not not take the exponential factor for energy demand into consideration at all.",,salvage,0,0,,1426231479,0

Aren't you really just trying to the split hairs of history? I just cannot agree. I try to take your ""evidence"" into consideration but it just appeals to my mind (which I consider to be a somewhat logical) as your opinion/belief being more wrong and my belief/opinion (and roughly 99% of the rest of the world's) to be more right.

*Sigh* This has truth. You have some good points like the business model used for food, but I respectfully disagree with other points of yours (although I retract this if you're implying I'm a fresh-faced kid spouting spoon-fed lies). I'll go over some of those points I have problems with.

One of the better indicators of health within a society is life expectancy. One of bigger factors for the increase in life expectancy is due that fact there are much fewer deaths at birth and more people get to adulthood. Medicine developed by people having the time to specialize.

On disease, Spread = Yes. Create = No.

A lot of widespread diseases that have killed millions are dependent on other factors like the livestock used. For example, tuberculosis was a disease presented in bovines, but then transferred to humans over many generations. However, in the New World, there weren't any bovines, thereby no TB. As far as I know, the turkey (one of the few domesticated animals in Americas) luckily, as far as I know, did not have any diseases that transferred to humans. There was big-time agriculture in the Americas and Tenochtitlan and Cuzco were one of the biggest cities in the world for their era, and did not succumb to disease until those pesky Europeans came over (but yes, haha, they did war with neighbors a lot for their gods. Centralization of resources can lead to fighting).

I'm sure some of the most ""primitive"" people on Earth in New Guinea are happy, but they still war with each other. Even small groups of nomads (who did not submit to the ""Myth of Agrarianism"") fight within themselves and war with other bands. It may not explicit like modern wars, but it happens.

TL; DR

In conclusion, medicine = good; Cities does not necessarily = disease; fighting happens regardless of how small or egalitarian a society is; Happiness is subjective.

I disagree with your blanket statement saying we're better off hunting/gathering, and saying we're having a corporate circle jerk (lay off the ad hominem), then say we should make private gardens. Too many humans? Probably true, but we have to deal with it, Yes, a business model for agriculture has problems, but I also like have ample amounts of big fruits and vegetables.

In 1776 a Jesuit named Adam Weishaupt created the Order of the Illuminati. One of the main goals of the Illuminati was to destroy theistic beliefs (namely Christianity). Adam Weishaupt also created Jacobinism which was responsible for the French Revolution, the atheistic Cult of Reason and the establishment of the Manifesto of Human Rights to replace God's Law.

Then the Jesuits started pushing a number of erroneous theories to ""prove"" that there isn't a God.

The Big Bang Theory has its roots in the Kaballah and was pushed by a Jesuit named Georges Lemaître.

[Heliocentrism is a fraud.](http://www.reformation.org/stationary-earth.html) A Jesuit named Leon Foucault invented a contrivance that was supposed to prove that the Earth rotates.

Pierre Telhard de Chardin another Jesuit was responsible for the Piltdown man hoax, which was supposed to prove Evolution. 

[More Paleontology Hoaxes](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/display/category/paleontology/)

Charles Darwin stole all his ideas for 'The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life' from his grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was a Freemason, but the writings can be found further back with the likes of Sir Francis Bacon who was leader of the Rosicrucian Order. (Freemasonry is merely the offspring of Rosicrucianism by the way and both organisations were created by the Jesuits.) Plato and Aristotle also taught forms of evolution, but its roots go even further back to Ancient Egypt with the idea of transmutation of species, where it was taught that a monkey would magically turn into a human. Babylon also taught a form of evolution, so this is by no means a new idea. 

&gt; O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of **science falsely so called**. (I Timothy 6:20)

The final hoax in this fraud to discredit the Bible is most likely going to be a fake staged alien invasion. Expect that to happen soon. (My money is on this happening at the 2012 Olympics)

All of these are just as much scams as global warming/climate change is and they all feed into one another and are steering people into the whole New World Order/New Age Agenda.

&gt; Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils (1 Timothy 4:1)


Here's just a few historical quotes about the Jesuits.

&gt; ""My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order’s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.""


- John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.""


- Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.""


- Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""


- Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)


- J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party."" 

- Adolf Hitler
---------------------------

The Jesuits Extreme Oath has been recorded in the U.S. congressional record. Here's a small excerpt -

*""I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants' heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.""*

What is an act of terrorism as she defines it? Would the 2007 Zahedan bombings in Iran count? Does that mean we should stand by the government of Iran as they fight the Jundallah also known as People's Resistance Movement of Iran? 

How about the 2006 Mumbai Train Bombings and the 2008 Mumbai attack? Does that mean that we should launch a full scale invasion on the country of Pakistan for “harboring” Lashkar-e-Taiba? Pakistan is a nuclear nation.

&gt;As the sole remaining superpower, the United States has no choice but to take on the job of rooting out terrorism wherever it exists. 

Are we the sole remaining superpower? Because we do not consider other countries to possess the qualities that make a super power, does not mean that they do not.

Wherever it exists? Really? Even if it is not Muslim extremism? 

&gt;It is the U.S. government's responsibility and duty to protect its people and make the world safe from terrorists. 

The U.S. does have a responsibility to protect its people. Where in the constitution does it say that it must make the world safe from terrorists? Should we spend taxpayer money to do so?

&gt;The war on terrorism is a worldwide struggle and the United States must move forward with a worldwide offensive to combat it until all who threaten peace and security are destroyed. 

&gt;Although it is helpful to have the cooperation of other nations, the United States must be prepared to fight terrorism - using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary - wherever and whenever it threatens. 

It’s worldwide struggle that requires a worldwide offensive that doesn’t require support of other nations. That’s a dangerous sentiment. “Whatever methods” and unilateral action are a bit much. If the terrorist group is not a direct threat to America, should we still use whatever methods, and should we do it without the help of the nation threatened? The U.S. should protect its citizens using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary. A truer statement?

&gt;Nothing less than US freedom is at stake.

That is a very emotional statement. I would need proof to believe it. How is US freedom at stake? Will the terrorist groups enslave us?

The main argument I would make is that a full scale occuaption would cause more harm to the US than terrorism will ever do. Look at reports on the Iraq wars effect on Al-Qaeda's recruitment. And, the cost of the occupation of Iraq in treasure and American lives. A full scale occupation of the Middle East would be a knee-jerk reaction to fear and that means the terrorist will have won.

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)


- J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party."" 

- Adolf Hitler
---------------------------

The Jesuits Extreme Oath has been recorded in the U.S. congressional record. Here's a small excerpt -

*""I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants' heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.""*

I mean, Jesus, get real.  Speculators can and have put pressure on thinly traded currencies of smaller economies, but the idea that a handful of hedge fund managers could influence one of the most widely traded currency pairs in the world is downright asinine.  

When talking about currency speculation, people get causation all screwed up.  Here's how reality actually works: first, some currency zone has some sort of fundamental imbalance or macroeconomic problem.  Next, a few hedge fund managers spot the imbalance and place large short positions.  Finally, the market value of the currency adjusts to reflect the economic reality, and the hedge funds make money.

Yet people seem to **love** working backwards - as if the hedge funds' huge positions and subsequent returns *prove* that the speculators *caused* the shift in price.  

One of the most famous examples is George Soros ""breaking the Bank of England"" - in this case, it was obvious that while the Bank of England was moving toward interest rate parity with continental Europe in order to join the ERM (prelude to the Euro), the United Kingdom's economy was in dire need of lower interest rates than that of the rest of Europe.  Speculators shorted the pound, sure, but they could only do so by seeing that the Bank of England's interest rate policies were unsustainable.  The Bank of England proudly hiked up interest rates in response, which caused *even more* harm to the average U.K. citizen.  Eventually, the central bank did the right thing and withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism.

Currency markets aren't driven by speculators, they're driven by central banks.  ",,mthmchris,0,0,,1426231529,0

There's a pretty substantial difference between the cultures of each country as well as different points in history. The Middle East was certainly more advanced, multicultural, and stable than Medieval Europe in that period, although undoubtedly if you study enough, you'll find problems. But what matters is what's happening now. Yes, there are tremendous human and civil rights abuses throughout the Middle East and they all should be treated seriously. But, they need to be treated as unique cases and not lumped together as simply one giant land of brutality or something. 

Let me tell you my point of view to better explain where I'm coming from. I don't know your nationality, but I'm an American. Despite the problems here (and there's a lot), I am thankful to be living in a place that's, for the most part, very free. I'm also thankful that I live around people who have had a chance to make a new life for themselves. In my neighborhood are Jews, Muslims, Arabs, Indians, Latinos, etc, etc, and I'm friends with many of them. But my government does things in my name, with my tax dollars, that I don't approve of. The complete destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, support for brutal dictators in Iran and Saudi Arabia, drone attacks in Pakistan, unjust economic policies through the world, and critical support for the illegal occupation of Palestine. I feel that it is my obligation to stand up to injustices that my country contributes to. Take Iraq as an example. Saddam was our guy. We supported him during the war with Iran. When the Kurds were fighting for their rights, all Americans know that Saddam crushed them. What they don't know is that we *increased* funding to his regime when that happened to keep him in power. The Bush administration conveniently forgot that fact when listing his crimes. He was certainly guilty, but the Rumsfeld and Cheney should have been on trial with him for doing their part.

Note that there are truly democratic movements across the Middle East, with equal rights for all, inspired by the idealized version of American democracy and crushed by corrupt and brutal regimes. Those regimes are supported by the US when it's convenient for us and denounced when they oppose us. In Iran, under the Shah, the US denounced democratic movements as threatening to our guy. After the Shah, we suddenly have to support those movements until they can remove the official enemies. So fuck these regimes, all of them, that oppress their people. I'm tired of my country using this shit to their own political gain. I support human rights, not the fuckheads in governments in Iran or Saudi Arabia or wherever who oppress them.

But Israel is a unique case. Here's a situation where people who were forced to leave their homes had no where else to go. So the British promised them ""a national home"" after they promised that same land to the Arabs and then spent the next few decades trying to fulfill both promises in an overpopulated land with limited resources. Despite that, Israel went on to take over and occupy more land than was ever issued to them by the British Mandate or the UN, so I consider it illegal under international law. I'm sorry, but I don't buy the ""historic"" claim of European Jews to Palestine. If you tried to enforce this for every group with a less than 2000 year old claim to a land, we'd have a full scale nuclear war in no time. But the Israelis are there now, and that's the important thing. Their rights and security need to be respected just as much as the Palestinians do. Particularly the Jewish immigrants from the 30's and 40's who were legitimate refugees with nowhere else to turn. You asked what I believe the issue is, and that's what I would say. Human rights and security for all that presently live on that land, as well as the right of return for all refugees (Arab, Jewish, whatever).

Apologies for a lengthy response, but I wanted to mention one other thing. I was out earlier and I was thinking about something you said regarding the Jewish refugees from other Middle Eastern countries coming to Israel after 1948. While I don't think that Palestinians should be punished for, let's say Yemen, forcing out their Jewish population, the significance of that strain of Jewish immigration is something that I hadn't thought about before. Thinking about that has really informed my view of the history a little more, so thank you for that.",,bluecalx2,0,0,,1426231537,0

The only thing they are measuring that even remotely relates to IQ is educational level. So by ""smarter"", I guess they mean having more degrees. 27% more, to be precise, though again, the article itself does not mention a 27% figure.

It's interesting to note, though, that educational level plays a small role among the factors they measured. If you look at the actual weights for their best case and worst case scenarios, you see:

* Education: a 0.875 weight difference between best case (wife 27% more educated) and worst case (both have low education). It's even less if you consider the middle case, where the husband is more educated (no numbers provided, but reading from graph, the difference would be about 0.3).

* Nationality: 0.505 weight difference between best case (both are Swiss) and worst case (one is Swiss, other is from some other West European country). Interestingly, they figured the worst would be if one were Swiss and the other non-Western (Eastern Europe, Asia, etc.), but nope. Kind of qualifies that ""same cultural background thing"" because apparently, while both being Swiss is good, one being Swiss and the other German is *worse* than one being Swiss and the other being Asian. One would think that Germans are closer to the Swiss in cultural background than non-Western-Europeans, so the association seems broken right after the ""both Swiss"" stage.

* Previous Divorces: Unsurprisingly, this is the biggest single factor, with a weight difference of 5.4, between best case (neither ever divorced) and worst case (husband previously divorced).

So although educational level seems to have some influence, it's far smaller than previous divorces, as an indicator of how long the marriage will last.

Just a few of my own thoughts thrown in for what they're worth:

I expect the results would be different for different countries in the ""same culture"" category. My impression is that the Swiss are very insular, and certainly not as exposed to different cultures as, say, Americans, or Brits, or Canadians. Having the same culture may play a far greater role in Switzerland than it does in other countries.

Just from my own experience and observation, it doesn't surprise me that intelligence is significant. Although I object greatly to using educational attainments as a proxy for intelligence (specially when relatively small differences such as 27% are concerned), I am pretty sure that intelligence plays a part. I would not go so far as to say that the best case scenario is when the wife is slightly more educated. However, it stands to reason that for a relationship to last, each partner needs to be capable of understanding the other, for liking him or her for what they *are*. A significant difference in intelligence usually precludes that.",,xenofon,0,0,,1426231546,0

Which she points out.

So she's saying that imperialism didn't help the Oliver Twists of industrial Europe.  No news there.

&gt;No, the question she is addressing is why the countries that are rich are rich. Discussing it in terms of GDP is the whole point. Are the countries rich because of imperialism?

I mean that by only comparing the incomes from imperialist and slave trades to the GDP at that given time does little to show that the Europe of today does not benefit (not ""enrich""—I don't know who's saying that all of Europe's wealth came from imperialism, only those that say it gave them an unfair advantage over their colonies when it came time for their own development.  On the same subject, no one is suggesting that imperialism gave rise to industrialism and not vice-versa—but rather that imperialism denies colonies access to their own means of production, essential if you want to build capital locally.)  Taking one number from here and comparing it to one number from there does little justice to the complexities of dozens of decades of economic and social history.

&gt;That doesn't have anything to do with the question she's studying.

Well, she devotes several paragraphs to attacking those who suggest the West has a negative role to play in the development of former colonies on the basis of the false belief that they suggest that this role is simply that of a robber baron (which they don't—she cherry picks quotes from more-or-less random proponents of the Left here).  So if she wants to refute the arguments of the Left, she might want to start with their actual argument.  Which, as you point out, has nothing to do with what she's studying.  So she makes it into something its not.  As far as the length of colonizing, this is not the issue.  The issue is often the post-colonial actions of countries, such as France demanding payment from Haiti for their freedom, ensuring the country would face a difficult future of debt, or of Western oil companies pillaging the African coast and leaving the locals in poverty, or of chemical plants releasing toxins, like in Bhopal.

People tend to mate with people they find attractive; which in some cases is people with the same skin color, and in same cases isn't. 

A significant part of our natural attraction is seeking mates more similar to ourselves, such as our race and usually our ethnicity; the fact that some miscegenation occurs does not negate this. Another big part of this is that our pheromones are greatly affected by our genetics, and thus help push the attraction of our race and ethnicities to one another; though this has been inhibited by the amount of chemicals we use alongside our modern hygiene rituals that strip off a lot of our pheromones every day. 

People have been subjected to over sixty years of 'education' and media propaganda that has had a significant impact on how people perceive things. Propaganda is quite effective on humans, particularly with the amount of technology we have today. Our education says everyone is the same, our media tells us the same thing over and over while also pushing and glorifying miscegenation, particularly on impressionable youth. 

&gt; In fact foreign people are often found exotic and specially attractive, and from an evolutionary point of view it makes sense: having children with people from a different ethnic group brings new genes into the gene pool and diminishes the chances of (I'm sure you'll agree) harmful inbreeding. Not to say we're slaves to such evolutionary conditionants, but they do exist. 

This was not always the case. Our media has had a major impact on what people view as 'exotic'. Prior to the propaganda and indoctrination, most people found other races to be unattractive (most still do despite everything), or at the very least in some cases less attractive than their own depending on genetic distance. Whites/Europeans are part of the Caucasoid race, and people in Asia are part of the Mongoloid race, and both Caucasoids and Mongoloids are more closely related to each other than either are to the other races such as: Congoid (“blacks”), Capoid (Khoisan/Bushmen) and Australoid (Papuans, Australian Aborigines, etc); this is because Caucasoids and Mongoloids are believed to have diverged from a more recent ancestor in Eurasia prior to becoming the separate Caucasoid and Mongoloid races, and thus are less genetically distant. 

Quite often those new genes bring abnormalities, particularly if the genetic distance is greater such as different races mixing. The races just are not genetically distant enough to cause infertility due to our species' mobility, which is rather similar to wolves who also spread out across the continents (and were the dominant species prior to our rise).

Even in fairly isolated gene pools for some ethnicities the genetic diversity is more than adequate, and our typically monogamous relationships have helped with this process. Inbreeding in ethnic groups or races is extremely rare, and is usually a case of religious influence that greatly limits the potential mates, similar to nobility's limitations. 

&gt; If most people mate inside their ethnic group it's because of the statistical fact that most people are surrounded by people of the same ethnicity, and so the opportunities of having offspring with a same-ethnic mate are higher. In mixed-ethnic environments you'll find there is no such bias. 

In a mixed ethnicity environment there is in fact bias, but to a much lesser extent than between races as our brains recognize the similarity of the other ethnicities. 

&gt; Sorry but it's so silly. Even if I agreed human ethnicities do somehow need preserving, which I don't, if you were right about ""people are naturally more inclined to mate within their ethnicity"" there would be no need to take any action regarding immigration to protect ethnicities. 

While miscegenation is a serious issue, it is less of a concern right now than the massive levels of immigration into White/European nations. 

Whites/Europeans are becoming minorities in our own nations due to massive levels of non-White/European immigration coupled with the very high fertility rate of the immigrants, while Whites/Europeans have a lower (balanced) fertility rate. 

If immigration can be stopped and controlled, then the White/European nations can be kept much more 'pure' and thus preserved. If there is little or no non-Whites/Europeans in White/European nations than  miscegenation ceases to be an immediate threat.

&gt; You could just allow it freely and anyway people from different ethnicities would not mate, leading to a ""natural"" state of ""ethic purity preservation"". Still, you propose that limiting immigration is positive because it immigration does ""threaten"" some ethnicities. You contradict yourself. 

Limiting or preventing immigration is an ideal situation for any race and ethnicity. Japanese would not benefit from millions of Norwegians moving in, nor do Nigerians benefit from millions of Arabs moving in. 

I don't contradict myself. Immigration control helps control demographics, and if you can control your demographics than you can preserve your demographics. It is quite simple. 

&gt; Admit you just like white european people better than dark-skinned guys and let's be done with this. 

I do like White/European people better, they are my people first and foremost. Do I hate other races and their ethnicities? No. I just don't want to live around them, and I'm quite certain they don't want us living around them either (as they have made abundantly clear in most places around the world).

Thank you! :)

&gt; I'm Canadian, but I have Estonian friends, and I've visited Tallinn. Most Canadians do not know where Estonia is, or only that it's near Finland and is small.

I find this a bit surprising. As far as I know a lot of Estonian World War 2 refugees escaped to Canada and I would have thought that they'd have spread awareness of our country a bit better.

&gt; I asked my friend if taxi drivers in Estonia know the entire country from memory, and she didn't know. Do you have any idea?

The taxi drivers in my home town of Viljandi (around 19k people) have trouble finding my tiny home street sometimes, so I don't expect them to know the whole country from memory. However, things are not generally too hard to find.

Taking a tax from one city to another isn't usually done, though, as it would be prohibitively expensive. Gasoline is a lot more expensive in Europe than it is in Canada and USA as far as I know.

&gt; Also: how long would it take to drive across Estonia?

North to south, probably about 3-4 hours. East to west, probably 4-5 hours.

I don't even have a driver's license myself, so these are very rough estimates :)

One night I was bored, and took the time to refute each point with citations:

----------------------------------

""Fact"" 1: We have made significant progress in fighting drug use and drug trafficking in America. Now is not the time to abandon our efforts.

[""The cost of heroin at the retail level declined from an average estimated $1,974.49 per gram in 1981 to $361.95 per gram in 2003.  The average purity of heroin on the US market increased in that time as well, going at the retail level from an average of 11% in 1981 to an average 32% in 2003""](http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/price_purity07.pdf)

[For 2008, an estimated 117,325,000 Americans aged 12 or over (47% of the US population aged 12 and over) report having used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k8nsduh/2k8Results.pdf)

------------

""Fact"" 2: A balanced approach of prevention, enforcement, and treatment is the key in the fight against drugs.

[Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption) despite an approach lacking prevention and enforcement.

[DEA Administrative Law Judge, Francis Young: ""Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.""](http://www.iowamedicalmarijuana.org/pdfs/young.pdf)

---------

""Fact"" 4: Smoked marijuana is not scientifically approved medicine. Marinol, the legal version of medical marijuana, is approved by science.

[Medical and scientific organizations based in the United States that support access to therapeutic cannabis include: the American Academy of Family Physicians (1989, 1995); American Academy of HIV Medicine (2003); American College of Physicians (2008); American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs (2001); American Medical Students Association (1993); American Nurses Association (2003); American Preventive Medical Association (1997); American Public Health Association (1995); Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (1999); Federation of American Scientists (1994); HIV Medicine Association (2006); Institute of Medicine (1982 &amp; 1999); Kaiser Permanete (1997); Lymphoma Foundation of America (1997); National Association for Public Health Policy (1998); National Nurses Society on Addictions (1995); and Physicians Association for AIDS Care.](http://www.medicalcannabis.com/PDF/Grouplist.pdf)

-------------

""Fact"" 5: Drug control spending is a minor portion of the U.S. budget. Compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction, government spending on drug control is minimal.

[A 1998 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) estimated the economic costs of illegal drug abuse in the United States to be $97.66 billion in 1992. Sixty percent (60%) of drug costs were due to drug-related law enforcement, incarceration and crime. Only 3% of drug costs were borne by victims of drug-related crime.](http://www.nida.nih.gov/economiccosts/index.html)

--------

""Fact"" 6: Legalization of drugs will lead to increased use and increased levels of addiction. Legalization has been tried before, and failed miserably.

[The Portuguese government in 2001 decriminalized the use and possession of illicit street drugs.  Five years later, the number of deaths from street drug overdoses dropped from around 400 to 290 annually, and the number of new HIV cases caused by using dirty needles to inject heroin, cocaine and other illegal substances plummeted from nearly 1,400 in 2000 to about 400 in 2006.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization)

--------------

""Fact"" 7: Crime, violence, and drug use go hand-in-hand.

[55% of Americans drink alcohol at least monthly](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k8nsduh/2k8Results.cfm)

[In addition to the 54% who drink coffee everyday, 25% of Americans drink coffee occasionally.](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/market/usa.htm)

[Frequently, drug-related violent crimes, such as homicides and assaults, are linked to drug marketing activities (e.g., disputes among rival distributors or between buyers and sellers of drugs). For example, of the 347 drug-related homicides reported in New York City in 1984, 67 percent were in drug locations and were generally in areas where drugs were sold](http://www.nida.nih.gov/economiccosts/Chapter6.html)

(The absence of a criminal element at your local Starbucks requires no citation, eh?)

--------

""Fact"" 8: Alcohol has caused significant health, social, and crime problems in this country, and legalized drugs would only make the situation worse.

[Alcohol prohibition didn't work either.  By 1925, in New York City alone, there were anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasy clubs.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States)

-------------

""Fact"" 9: Europe’s more liberal drug policies are not the right model for America.

[American students are much more likely to have used any illicit drug other than cannabis (23% vs. 6%). For example, 6% of US students have used ecstasy at least once in their lives vs. 1% in Europe.](http://www.unodc.org/youthnet/en/youthnet_youth_drugs_trends_drug_trends_eur_us.html)

-------------

""Fact"" 10: Most non-violent drug users get treatment, not jail time.

This one is actually almost true, as far as jail time goes.  Of course, the [1,300,000+ arrested every year in the US for drug possession](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/arrests/index.html) get a lot more than mandatory ""treatment"" -- they also receive permanent criminal records.

There are some exceptions to this, for example, If you patent something in a european country, it's only applicable in that country, but there's also the EU patent bureau that issues patents that are valid in all european countries (but an application there costs more).

There are some who are pushing for an international patent system, but obviously such a thing is almost impossible to create, politics playing a big part in it.

Additionally, there are some treaties concerning patents, e.g. the [PCT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty) but afaik they don't really cover a lot of ground.

On the other hand, lets say there's a chinese company infringing on some american patents, manufacturing its stuff in China but then shipping it to America, and they did the sipping themselves/have an office in america, then they could be sued, in America.

But I'm in no way an expert, this is just what I gathered when i was thinking about patenting an idea of mine, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh and concerning an international patent, another big hurdle towards that is the differences in patent law in different countries.
E.g. the EU has a First-to-File policy concerning patents (though with a 1 year margin where an earlier inventor could come forth), whereas the us has a First-to-Invent policy. And most US software patents would probably be invalid according to EU law, as they take the ""original idea"" aspect much more rigorous, i.e. you can only patent processes that transform something into another form (or something along those lines, at least you can only patent processes iirc) and you can only patent stuff that is not immediatly obvious to someone knowledgeable in the field (so the one-click sort thing wouldn't really apply) , and things like these obviously make it very hard if not impossible to create an international (and unified) patent system. And is has to be unified, because otherwhise someome country with a very weak/lenient patent system could just issue patents and have them be applicable globally, which could and most certainly would have a lot of bad consequences considering progress/free market stuff

Yes, I do. Having said that, I'm also willing to accept some level of potential suffering. Know why? Two reasons:

1. I think we can probably agree at least that when the government has a monopoly on something, it grows more and more expensive and innovation comes to a grinding halt -- the very opposite of what happens in the private sector. So if the cost of providing welfare to that small minority that would not be able to afford the service when offered at the cheaper and innovative market rate is that the rest of us miss out on all that because the government destroyed the private sector, maybe that's not a good trade-off.

2. Let's say 5% of Americans ""suffer"" from extreme poverty with no/little safety net. Honestly, there are billions of people all over the world who don't even have safe drinking water and are eating mud pies. The worst-off of Americans live like kings compared to these people. If I'm going to be charitable with my money, what kind of pomposity does it take for an American living in a homeless shelter or facing eviction because they got a bigger house than was financially responsible, who are they to claim they're more worthy of my charity than those who literally have nothing and suffer utterly inhumane conditions while Americans rally around this idea that healthcare is a ""right.""

&gt;Socialized or single-payer health care in countless first-world countries consistently outperforms privatized care in the United States, both in terms of cost effectiveness and overall outcomes

We don't have privatized care in the United States. The government's tentacles have been all over healthcare for quite a long time. There WAS a time when this wasn't the case, and I seem to recall healthcare costs were pretty reasonable back then. Still, if you're curious how fully-privatized healthcare would look in the era of ultra-modern medicine, well, the only examples you can really look at in this country are in the few unregulated fields, like Lasik, veterinary care, etc. Prices in those fields have been consistently falling, and quality consistently rising.

There is barely any price competition in the US market right now, so it's fine to say our system is broken, but to make the leap and suggest that comparing the US to France or Canada and looking at per capita healthcare costs is even CLOSE to a representation of the cost difference of ""capitalism vs. socialism"" is ludicrous. We SHOULD be saying ""look how much government has ALREADY screwed up healthcare, we'd have to be crazy to give them more control.""

Of course, a huge part of the healthcare costs these days is end-of-life care and cancer treatments, etc. At a certain point we, like less wealthy nations (which we'll soon be), must recognize that the hippocratic oath cannot be a license to spare no expense in treatment, and that just because the technology exists to save or improve someone's life, doesn't mean all notion of costs goes out the window. The current population of elderly has something the baby boomers and their successors don't: savings. They have savings because they weren't as idiotic with debt and spending as we have been. So they can afford a little better care as they reach their later years.

&gt;no amount of ""confidence"" in private generosity is going to make up for the fact that despite our tremendous wealth as a nation,

We don't have wealth, just the illusion of it. Few Americans feel like being charitable with their income after the government takes 35% of it for welfare and war. The middle class barely keeps pace with inflation, there is no economic growth amongst the middle class, only a growth in debts and misplaced confidence, crazy notions about home equity, etc. Whose fault is all of that? The government. (that's a whole 'nother post though...)

&gt;I find that libertarians love to speculate about how much better things would be if only we could implement their free-market Utopia, but they get real quiet when you ask for evidence that their ideas actually work.

Hello! The greatest evidence that freedom and free markets works is your own country! Do you think the government is the source of the nation's wealth and prosperity? Of course not. This nation rose to prosperity and higher living standards by embracing the free market and relatively-small government. What's amazing is how quickly this is forgotten, and now we capitalism is scape-goated as ""evil"" and government is the cure. Capitalist, small-government-driven America didn't ""fail,"" it was simply hijacked by those seeking democracy and big government. So I guess one could say that the capitalist, constitutional republic failed to protect itself from political overthrow, but this was a known weakness right from the beginning, the Founders noted that for all the shackles placed on government by the Constitution, the republic would not survive if too many forgot the point of it and embraced democracy.

Can you show me an example of tyranny working?

&gt;As a nation, we need to implement rational, proven policies moving forward.

Proven where? Europe is not proof of anything. The EU is in its infancy, and the individual countries are far worse off than they look. And their wealth, like ours, is largely illusory.

So did the Russian Holocaust under Stalin, and yet, too few people remember that after all this time. There were a lot of reasons the Jewish Holocaust is remembered more than others, and very little of it has to do with it happening in a white, industrialized nation in Europe. You're not all together wrong, but that is only a part of the story, and it's overly simplistic given the big picture.

The post-WW2 European Jewish exodus was a huge reason it became something the whole world paid attention to. They fled to the US and Britain in record numbers, meaning they couldn't be forgotten about there, like so many other victims of tragedies. They gained so much strength and support when the dust started to settle that they were able to rebuild a semblance of their pre-war existence, and eventually start to educate the world about what had happened from a first person perspective. Add the 'European guilt' about letting things go too far because of centuries of hatred, and the European monuments started getting built. And then you have to account for how many industrialized nations had Jews in some sort of positions of power, whether as wealthy money owners or just large Jewish communities spread all over the place, and remembering the Holocaust was a given. 

There may not have been as many gays or Romani's killed in the concentration camps, but the Jews were only about half the total victims. How much do you think the world as a whole cared about all the gay victims of Hitler even 25-30 years ago? The Romani's are hated all over the place still. Again, these were all victims of the same horrible fate that awaited the Jews, and in the same place. 

All of these reasons (and more) contributed to remembering the Holocaust, and none of them hold true for the Russian victims of Stalin's pogroms, or the Romani's, or even the gay victims until real recently . It's a culmination of a lot of social, cultural, and even religious influences, that can't be summed up as just 'because it happened in white industrialized modern Europe during the 20th century and because we won the war and the victors write the histories'.",,lol_Taco,0,0,,1426231758,0

Over here (Europe), we're not all encouraging our kids to have sex at 12, or even before it becomes legal at, well, in the UK, 16.  What we're doing is recognising that the little buggers have hormones, and sometimes sex happens, despite all sorts of teaching and communication.  This is how unwanted pregnancies happen.  It isn't THAT common before 15, but recognising that it happens means that we can address the problem in lots of different ways, not just ""Don't do sex.  Sex is bad.  M'Kay?""  We have noticed that abstinence only programs result in **more**, not less unwanted pregnancies, and while we're attempting to teach the kids that sex before 16 is actually illegal, well, if they MUST do it, isn't it better to ensure that they're protected?  Not just from pregnancy, but from any kind of sexually transmitted nasty.

persuading yourself that a God inspires you.
Believe nothing on the sole authority of your masters and priests. 
After examination, believe what you yourself have tested 
and found to be reasonable, and conform your conduct thereto.
(Buddha)

Buddhists have morality like religion:

If you want to be happy, practice compassion
(The Dalai Lama. He is a Buddhist)


Wait, Buddhism IS a religion. I conclude: 

* some religions believe in G-d (whatever that cypher means /to them) and 
* some religions don't believe.

&gt; While nay-sayers have been falling all over themselves to suggest that the Prada “looks the same” and “does everything the iPhone does,” and “did it all first,” they seem to be avoiding the really interesting story. It goes something like this: 
&gt; 
&gt; The number four mobile maker in the world, LG, set out to design the most beautiful phone possible. It worked with Prada designers to craft a sexy look, and spared little expense in designing a phone to sell at the ultra high end of the market.
&gt;  
&gt; It will be sold next to $800 Prada handbags and is targeted at the snooty European GSM market, where phones are already far more sophisticated than the US.
&gt;  
&gt; Before LG even officially unveiled the new phone, Apple revealed its own phone with striking similarities in luxury features and sleek design, although the iPhone’s hardware is better all around, at a slightly lower price.
&gt;  
&gt; Apple targets the iPhone at the mass market, and will sell it in its own retail stores next to related technology products. It targets the American GSM market, where phones are lame and 3G service is not widely available.
&gt; 
&gt; The big difference is that the iPhone is practical. It has a real email app that works just like desktop email. It has a real web browser. It has incredible polish on its media player, brilliant user interface shortcuts, and connects to popular web services that were custom designed to work on it, not pulled out of a bargain shareware bin.

Because of the release cycles, neither copied the other.  The difference wasn't marketing, it was *usability*.

Over here we view them as collector pieces and wish know everything about them. :) It's amazing in a certain kind of way, to you they are something common and unremarkable. Over here they are somewhat uncommon and one will almost always draw a crowd at a range. 

A perhaps interesting story for you. Over here, rifles that have a soldiers' name tag under the butt-plate are considered more collectible and are highly sought after. Many US collectors will search and try to locate and contact the former soldier or families to illicit general memories of their time in service. Amazingly, many get wonderful replies back. The old soldiers or their families are surprised and bemused we care about such things. And some have even established pen pal friendships with each other.

It's not much different here at the ranges, (except we can't sling a rifle across our back). The older guys tend to shoot wood and blued steel bolt actions, and the younger guys shoot those black plastic things. But we all still enjoy the day.

Those of us who collect Swiss rifles understand about the stocks. I think the only nice ones I've ever seen where sanded and refinished. We jokingly refer to the mysterious Swiss Alpine Beaver as the culprit.;) And while some don't like the dents and dings, I tend to look at them as historical markers that tell a story. Besides, soldiers are notoriously rough on all their gear.

The sniper variants are extremely rare over here. I've never heard of the Zfk31 being imported. And I only know of 2 or 3 Zfk55's. The import costs at the time was around $2000US several years ago, if I remember right. I doubt one could purchase one of them for much under $5000US now.

The K31 is actually pretty easy to put a scope on over here. We have several manufacturers who make a clamp on mount for it. Here is some pictures of one of them. [photos](http://www.swissrifles.com/~swiss-sights/) I don't know of anything for the Gew/K11's though. I don't have such a mount yet. I prefer to enjoy my old rifles as they originally came. But I'm getting older and these accursed bi-focals are forcing me to consider it.

No. There are many types of government. Kings, through a series of private contracts, formed a ""private government"". 

The Magna Carta is not the result of the *people* doing anything. It is the result of the Barons getting fed up with King John's incompetence, and since, it was the Barons that really controlled the military, they were able to force King John to renegotiate the terms of the feudal relationship.

&gt; The feudal system may have been organized via contract but the contracts were only between governing bodies

No, the contracts were between people. The ""contracts"" were oaths of homage or bondage, undertaken by a lord and his vassal. It was a highly personal ceremony, at all levels. The Serf ""signed a contract"" by making an oath to his Lord to basically under a highly exploitative agreement. The Serf did get some rights though, such as the right to be protected, among many other rights depending on the situation and time in history. Otherwise, there would have been no point to make agreement.

But you're right, there was no ""one"" feudal system. Russian feudalism is very different than French feudalism than English feudalism. I should have made it more explicit that I was talking Anglo-Saxon and English feudalism. The conditions of serfs in Russia is not at all comparable to the conditions of serfs in Medieval England. Interestingly, that may explain why history unfolded in Russia and Western Europe in such different ways.

Finally, it very much matters if a government is public or private. That was the whole point of the Enlightenment. Because the government of English feudalism was formed by private contracts, law was essentially conditions of use of private property, and thus all law was essentially private. Petitioning to change the law involved renegotiating contracts, which ultimately depended on the power relationship between the parties involved. The Barons were able to force the King to change the private law because they controlled the military. The serfs had no such negotiating power. The Enlightenment philosophers realized that private law resulted in inequality, and that rights and lawmaking should be public powers that all could share in equally, that there is one Natural Law or one Social Contract that all were a part of, instead of a multitude of private contracts and private laws.

I never said that Liberal Democracy was the end of the line of political evolution. I said it was the political philosophy that emerged from the Enlightenment.

&gt; If we continue this trend, sometime in the future, we won't need rulers of any kind for everyone to be healthy and happy.

How do you arrive at that conclusion? It goes completely against human nature, which is to form hierarchies. If there were no rulers, people would re-invent them.

And Libertarianism is definitely a step backwards, because it essentially leads a very similar situation to Feudalism. Those with more property and wealth have greater negotiation power in contracts than those with less, and leading to the same power hierarchies, from an oligarchy of large property owners to a mass of people little or no property and wealth who are forced to get into exploitative contracts in order to survive, just like the Serfs.",,udaybhanu,0,0,,1426231868,0

These two individuals, throughout the process, have received protection at the expense of the tax payer in order to protect them from recriminations owing to the particularly heinous nature of the crime that they committed. Now, I fully understand that such protection is in accordance with UK and EU law and is necessary in respect of the rule of law, especially considering that both have served their sentences. However, for the Bulger family I personally believe there is a legitimate interest for them to know why one of the individuals who brutally murdered their child, and has had the benefit of a 'new life' (public expense), has been returned to prison. If I were in their position it would anger me that, despite serving a relatively short sentence in comparison to the crime committed, the perpetrator has been returned to prison; this is with regards the prison system (which has obviously failed this individual from the perspective of rehabilitation) as well as the knowledge that Jon Venabales, who  committed the murder, despite being given a real second chance in life has once again broken the law and been returned to prison. Therefore, I think their right to know stems from the idea that despite the allowances afforded to Jon Venables, his actions, and the knowledge that he is enjoying life and continuing to breach the rules of his release would engage a right to know exactly what he has done; both for the family and the wider public interest.

Thats not how I interpreted the comment at all. WWII is a war with moral certainty in the historical context we view it today. Virtually no other war fought by the United States can claim that view. Which is probably why it receives such strong historical weight today and continues to shape policy. 

The holocaust most certainly plays a role in this moral certainty. However, the holocaust was not the entirety, or even the majority of the genocide that Nazi Germany accomplished. Even without the genocide, Nazi Germany was still starting a war of aggression and WWII can be interpreted as defensive in nature. 

If the argument is, within the span of the entirety of human history, and presuming the holocaust and eastern European genocide didn't take place, then Germany's war of aggression is not a lot worse then America's recent wars of aggression in the middle east, then I guess I would have to agree. Not a lot, but still worse.

Just wanted to share a crucially important demographic fact about Israel - not an opinion - and some links that should demonstrate this satisfactorily (to anyone but the most hardened anti-semite / bigot).

**A statistical majority of the citizens of Israel are not ""European Jews"" ** - not according to any factual account or census data collected by any organization. *A majority of the citizens of Israel are people whose ancestors have never lived anywhere but the Middle East* - 100% desert-dwelling natives... both Arabs and  Jewish refugees who were expelled from the ancient, indigenious Middle Eastern Jewish communities in Muslim-majority states.

There are 7.5 million passport-holding citizens of Israel (white, black, Jewish,  Arab, Druze, Chrisitan, Samatarian)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel

Approximately 20% of Israel's population are Arabs (Over 1.2 million). Many of these Arab citizens of Israel are (descendants of) Syrian and Egyptian Arabs who arrived in the late 19th / early 20th century, attracted to work opportunity and prosperity that Zionists developed in the region. A minority of them are Arabs whose ancestors parmanently settled or owned land in Palestine for more than 2 or 3 centuries. 

Out of the 7.5 million citizens, 5.7 million are Jews (a tiny minority of native Jews who have lived in Palestine for centuries +  a majority of 20th century immigrants + refugees from Europe, Russia, Africa, India, South America, Iraq, Yemen, etc.)

3.1 Million of those Jews are Mizhari Jews.  These are members of ancient, indigenous Jewish communities in the Middle East (Yemen, Morocco, Lenabon, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Tunisina, Lybia) - a majority of whom forced out of their homes and stripped of citizenship by Arab mobs and governments in 1947 - 1950. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands

A minority, 2.6 Million of Israel's Jews are Askhenazi ""European Jews"" - people like me -  and my relatives who fled to Jerusalem in the early 1900s to escape violent pogroms and anti-semitism in Russian-controlled Eastern Europe. There is a substantial minority within this segment, of immigrants from Russia and Western countries who arrived over the past few decades.

Many of the Jewish immigrants / refugees in Israel did not come there by ""choice"" - but rather,  out of survivial necessity... or a stark lack of places in Europe or the Middle East that were safe for their family to live and practice their faith without violence, harassment or discrimination.

There are studies and articles out there which support what I've said, which you can look for if you'd like but I'm not going to waste my time going through my bookmarks (which are a mess) just to prove something to someone on Reddit. 

&gt; Come on. When is that fabled past you're talking about, exactly? Christians had infidel lovers during the middle ages. Muslim potentates bought blonde european slave brides for their harems. Romantic poets were fascinated with eastern women. Portuguese sailors had more than a little fun with japanese girls. 

Exaggerated and glorified minority of individuals; these actions do not reflect the majority. There are  poems, paintings and stories about people having sex with animals as well, it doesn't mean it was something frequent or significant. 

Also, the Arabic peoples are part of the same greater race as Whites/Europeans, the Caucasoid race. Finding some attraction between one another is not surprising, but it not a majority or significant. 

&gt; There were inter-ethnic marriages in south america, the pacific islands, africa... everywhere the europeans colonized. Sudist slaveowners had more than a few bastards with their female african slaves. Nowadays more than a few people in the USA find latinas, or japanese etc exotic and attractive. It's happened since the beginning of time. Relax and let it happen. 

The interracial marriages in most locations were primarily for two reasons: 1.many colonial empires such as Spain and Portugal sent their men overseas without White women or families, 2.there were active policies in place to breed out indigenous people or to create mixed castes in order to exert political and economic control. 

Our media pushes the 'exotic' perception a lot, and it has a significant impact. What is viewed as 'exotic' often changes. 

Some miscegenation has occurred overtime, particularly from conquest, but it has never exhibited a significant threat to the integrity of races or most ethnicities, like it does now. 

&gt; My bullshit detector just went off the scale. Please stop making up random facts. 

Again, I'm not going to bother going through my bookmarks to cite the sources just to prove something on Reddit; you can dig around if you are so inclined. 

However, a related example is the issues when we mix various closely related animals which results in infertility, health issues, deformities, and other abnormalities. Humans have not diverged far enough to cause infertility, but the races are quite genetically distant (some more than others).

&gt; Yeah, this is the root of your thinking here. The rest is just weak justifying.

Anyways, here are some relevant journal abstracts.

First off, note that the article mainly mentions paralysis, spinal conditions, and brain damage.  Taking the article at face-value (it's not a good article, BTW) These birth defects *smack* of neural tube defects (NTDs).  NTDs are heavily influenced by folate/folic acid consumption by the mother [before and during pregnancy](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/about.html).  Now, we also know that NTDs spike during and immediately after war:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hum Genet. 1984;68(2):97-103. Epidemiology of neural tube defects in Germany.

Koch M, Fuhrmann W.

A survey is made of the epidemiologic studies of neural tube defects (NTD) in Germany. A temporary increase is noted in the prevalence of NTD at birth for the time during and shortly after the Second World War, followed by a downward trend thereafter. Thus an earlier observation of Lenz (1965) could be confirmed. Falling rates of NTD were also reported from various other countries in recent years. No convincing etiological explanation is available so far. The current prevalence of NTD at birth can be estimated for Germany to be about 1.0-1.5 per thousand newborns with about an even distribution to anencephalus and spina bifida.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...same goes for decreased fertility (plausibly linked to diet) during and immediately after war:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nutr Health. 1993;9(1):43-52. The effects of food shortage on human reproduction.

Wynn A, Wynn M.

PIP: The first dramatic effect of food shortage is upon fertility. The authors attribute the marked decline in fertility in Dresden following the second world war to a sudden reduction in food supplies from the formerly occupied territories following the fall of the German armies. There were also epidemics of low birth weight, miscarriage, and congenital malformations. The epidemic of low birth weight in Leipzig immediately after the war is illustrated, with note made of the existence of similar epidemics in all European cities affected by food shortages. Epidemics of miscarriage contributed to the decline of fertility wherever there was a food shortage. The effects of food shortage upon hormone status, how food shortage increases the risk of neural tube defects and other congenital malformations, and the long-term consequences of poor maternal nutrition are considered.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epidemiology. 1997 Jan;8(1):55-8. Sex differences in prevalence of congenital neural defects after periconceptional famine exposure.

Brown AS, Susser ES.

Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the sex distribution of deaths from spina bifida in birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to severe periconceptional famine. For this purpose, we compared the risk of deaths from spina bifida between birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1946. In males, the relative risk of death from spina bifida was 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-6.01]. In females, the relative risk for spina bifida was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.14-2.37). The sex ratio (male:female) for deaths from spina bifida in the exposed birth cohort was 2.74; a female predominance was not seen in any other birth cohort. Deaths from anencephaly and other central nervous system disorders did not exhibit this male predominance in the exposed birth cohort. These findings indicate that severe periconceptional nutrient deficiency may have a greater effect on the occurrence of spina bifida in males vs females. Other potential explanations include sex-specific effects of prenatal famine on prenatal or postnatal survival rates of cases.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Note that in the above abstracts, no DU was around (during WWII, or the Dutch Hunger Winter), yet war and poor diet increased birth defects.  Might the same thing be happening in Fallujah?  Plausibly.  I've never been there.  Nevertheless, the uptick in NTDs during war makes the study of DU's influence, if any, very tricky.  ... the closest you can get is to study people exposed to DU, but not under the same dietary pressures as the local population: military personnel.  There are problems with this approach.  For instance, DU would have to have a **big** effect on birth defects and fertility for you to see it in military personal that are intermittently exposed.  If you *do* see that, though, then DU starts to look like a better explanation for the birth defects and poorer fertility seen in Fallujah than other possibilities, like diet, which is *already known* to influence birth defects and fertility in times of war.  (BTW, Even if there is an effect in military personnel, prolonged stress might influence fertility... so it's not like it seals the deal for DU).  If you see no effect in military personal, DU must not have a *huge* effect.  It may still be there, exerting some non-zero effect, but negative findings should re-focus attention on the well-described influence on birth defects in and after war:  Diet, with a particular focus on folic acid (folate) consumption.

So, what do we see in military personnel returning from the Gulf?:

When no one was coming to the newly established Colonies in North America, King Charles, as an enticement, offered to give people allodial title to land: they would actually *own* the land, not just the buildings and appurtenances on it. This was such an outrageous idea that it became known as the King's Folly.

However, it worked. Starting with the Puritans, who recognized that if they owned their land as sovereigns they could worship God in any way they chose, people flocked to the American Colonies. They were able to get ""Fee Simple"" deeds, the ""Fee"" referring not to a monetary charge but to ""fealty"", meaning they, as landowners owed no fealty to any lord. This was a radical change in the status of a human being on the land: they had sovereign possession of it with as great authority as a king had over his kingdom, and their ownership could be granted to their heirs in perpetuity, never being able to be taken by any king or government.

Land ownership was conveyed in this manner up until the 1940's or so. Now we have mere title to real estate, backed by title insurance. It is possible, though, with a little work, to obtain allodial title to land through establishing a ""land patent"", which assures possession so thoroughly that no one, not even the Federal Government, can take the land away, even for mortgage debt.",,monadyne,0,0,,1426231942,0

(In this article, the spinal problems and paralysis that's mentioned is a dead giveaway).  This is one of the consequences of war (see below ~'s), and is linked to diet, especially a decrease in [folic acid](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/about.html) consumption.

Having no idea what the the food conditions have been like in Fallujah:

(1) Compared to before the war, does Fallujah now experience food shortages?

(2) In the absence of food shortages, has the type and variety of food changed?  For instance, a shift from leafy green vegetables (harder to ship and store) to rice and unfortified grains?

Also, have other things, like the quality and quantity of prenatal care, changed in Fallujah since before the war?  Presence/absence of public health info/campaigns?  (un)availability of folic acid -rich multivitamins (commonly taken in the US by women who want to get pregnant, specifically to avoid neural tube defects)?


Here are abstracts of scientific articles linking war and diet to neural tube defects:

Hum Genet. 1984;68(2):97-103.
Epidemiology of neural tube defects in Germany.

Koch M, Fuhrmann W.

A survey is made of the epidemiologic studies of neural tube defects (NTD) in Germany. A temporary increase is noted in the prevalence of NTD at birth for the time during and shortly after the Second World War, followed by a downward trend thereafter. Thus an earlier observation of Lenz (1965) could be confirmed. Falling rates of NTD were also reported from various other countries in recent years. No convincing etiological explanation is available so far. The current prevalence of NTD at birth can be estimated for Germany to be about 1.0-1.5 per thousand newborns with about an even distribution to anencephalus and spina bifida.

Nutr Health. 1993;9(1):43-52. The effects of food shortage on human reproduction.

Wynn A, Wynn M.

PIP: The first dramatic effect of food shortage is upon fertility. The authors attribute the marked decline in fertility in Dresden following the second world war to a sudden reduction in food supplies from the formerly occupied territories following the fall of the German armies. There were also epidemics of low birth weight, miscarriage, and congenital malformations. The epidemic of low birth weight in Leipzig immediately after the war is illustrated, with note made of the existence of similar epidemics in all European cities affected by food shortages. Epidemics of miscarriage contributed to the decline of fertility wherever there was a food shortage. The effects of food shortage upon hormone status, how food shortage increases the risk of neural tube defects and other congenital malformations, and the long-term consequences of poor maternal nutrition are considered.

Epidemiology. 1997 Jan;8(1):55-8. Sex differences in prevalence of congenital neural defects after periconceptional famine exposure.

Brown AS, Susser ES.

Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the sex distribution of deaths from spina bifida in birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to severe periconceptional famine. For this purpose, we compared the risk of deaths from spina bifida between birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1946. In males, the relative risk of death from spina bifida was 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-6.01]. In females, the relative risk for spina bifida was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.14-2.37). The sex ratio (male:female) for deaths from spina bifida in the exposed birth cohort was 2.74; a female predominance was not seen in any other birth cohort. Deaths from anencephaly and other central nervous system disorders did not exhibit this male predominance in the exposed birth cohort. These findings indicate that severe periconceptional nutrient deficiency may have a greater effect on the occurrence of spina bifida in males vs females. Other potential explanations include sex-specific effects of prenatal famine on prenatal or postnatal survival rates of cases.

Neural tube defects among neonates delivered in Al-Ramadi Maternity and Children's Hospital, western Iraq.

Al-Ani ZR, Al-Hiali SJ, Al-Mehimdi SM.

Department of Pediatrics, Medical College, **Al-Anbar University, Ramadi, Iraq. **

OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence, types, and sites of neural tube defects (NTDs) and its associated maternal and environmental variables. METHODS: All preterm and full term live and stillborn babies delivered at Al-Ramadi Maternity and Children's Hospital, Al-Anbar Governorate, Iraq, from the 1st of November 2007 to the 1st of November 2008 were examined for gender, gestational age, NTDs, and associated congenital malformations. Mother's data included age, parity, consanguinity, education, antenatal care, previous medical illnesses, other NTDs history, folic acid supplementation, and diagnostic ultrasound. Incidence was calculated per 1000 births. RESULTS: During the study, 33 infants were delivered with NTDs, giving an incidence of 3.3/1000 births. Most were of myelomeningocele and anencephaly types, and thoracolumbar and lumbosacral sites. Two-thirds of the cases found were from consanguineous marriage, 12 NTD's mothers took folic acid during their pregnancy, **while none of them received the drug during the periconceptional period**. Three mothers had another NTD affected babies before, and mothers 25-34 years old produced most of the NTD deliveries than any other age groups. CONCLUSION: The NTDs incidence is still high compared with developed, and some developing countries. **High consanguinity marriage and 100% lack of periconceptional folic acid intake needs further study considerations to reduce such morbid and mortal anomalies.**

First, my apologies for saying that you were having a tantrum.  I should have extended you respect rather than have a knee-jerk reaction.  Again, Sorry. Let me tell you the reasoning behind the statements I made before:

You are right, I may have speculated a bit too much as far as the whole white=londoner bit, but why is it that we do not grill a white person as to where they are from?  I mean, london itself is full of people that came from all over the place, so it stands to reason that many of these ""standard issue white guy, 1"" could be from somewhere else, yet you do not see it happening.

I may be wrong but I do not think that you can say that people do not care about race when a quick scan of the news headlines talk about racism and how it is a problem, and incidents and so forth.  The argument about race not being important anymore or racism does not exist is one usually made by a member of a group that has not encountered it, so since it has not happened to the individual, it does not exist.

Finally, I was wrong in using races for examples, but the sad truth is that the dominant group is european whites and the subordinate groups are, well, everyone else.  Even without the race constructs, it still rings true.  Also, I do not think that calling the author an idiot is a good thing to do.

The reason I mention Europe is that that's where anti-Semitism and political Zionism originated. The Zionist Organization and the Zionist Congress were all formed in Europe. They found an ally with xenophobic sections of the British government who were looking for a solution to their ""Jewish Question"", what do we do with all these new immigrants coming from Eastern Europe. Many early Zionists were not Jews, but people looking for a way to expel their Jewish populations and Zionism was seen as a ""humane"" way to do it. Many Jews even viewed Theodor Herzl (founder of political Zionism) as a traitor for his unpopular belief that Jews could not assimilate in Europe. One could argue that non-Jewish Zionism was a veiled form of anti-Semitism itself, in the guise of helping persecuted Jews, not by allowing them into the UK or giving them passage to the US, but by driving them into East Africa. 

Palestine was also not the original choice, partly because the British had promised that land (at the time, almost entirely Arab who had lived there for centuries, with a highly functioning society and population, over 90% of which was non-Jewish) to the Sherif of Mecca in exchange for his help fighting against the Turks during WWI. Two years later, they also issued the Balfour Declaration, a vague promise for a Jewish national home in Palestine with no borders specified and on the condition that the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities be recognized. The British then spent the Mandate years trying to reconcile the two promises. The Zionists in Europe were stating quite openly their intention to make the whole of Palestine into a state. Many Middle Eastern Jews **opposed** this because they feared that it would result in violence against them. At the same time, most European Jews had no interest in Palestine at all until they were forced to emigrate and no one else would accept them. 

While there were small scale demonstrations against the Zionists in Palestine, it wasn't until *after* Israel, lead by Zionists from Europe, declared itself a state that the Middle East basically blew up over this issue. Seeing Israel's expansion past the borders issued by the UN (which was rejected by the Palestinians by the way), sentiment in the entire Middle East basically turned against the Jews, unfortunately, equating all Jews with the Zionist movement. 

If only 1% of the immigration came from Europe, it would be irrelevant. The point is that the political philosophy, policies, declarations, and military force which shaped the map all came from Europe. There would be no Israel without that and, I'd argue, no cause for the Middle Eastern Jews to leave their homes. I sympathize with the persecuted immigrants from Europe. I sympathize with the persecuted immigrants from the rest of the Middle East. I do, just as I sympathize with the refugees from Palestine. But this isn't the same as someone who moves from New York today to a settlement in the West Bank where a Palestinian home once stood. I don't sympathize with the racism that drives people from their homes anywhere or anytime. And I don't sympathize with the opportunists who exploit those people for their own political gain or the Western powers who carved up the globe without regard for the rights of the people who live there.

Most of the reason I couldn't identify with other gay Asian guys was because they were often too into being Asian (read: too proud of their race/ethnicity/heritage).

The nice thing about white guys is that, on the whole, they don't care about establishing a white-American identity (already established), rarely ever make a big deal about being white (don't want to call attention to the social privileges of being white), and don't take pride in being white (KKK ruined it), preferring to identify with individual bits of heritage from the countries they get their genetics from (Oktoberfest, St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  This is because many of them have a deep-seated white-American shame as a result of Europe/USA's historical role as colonialists/imperialists/slave owners who forcibly took over the brown people of the world.  Look at cartoons and sitcoms where white guys innocently use the word ""black"" while talking to a black guy and then awkwardly apologize for it because they're afraid of seeming racist.

It concerns me that your introduction suggests that Asian guys not dating other Asians is a problem, which I interpret as saying ""dating outside of your race is wrong.""  Most of the gay Asian guys I know are the ""sticky rice"" types who only go out with other Asians, mainly because they consider non-Asian people inferior, dirty, or creepy.

Actually, I should Know this, but at the moment I can not really recall anyone.

I think no software patent has been enforced here actually, and i hope they will never do.

Get these things:

* Frederick M. Noad - Beginning Solo Guitar. (~$20) It teaches you notes. If you want to do tab-only, then you can skip this step. Beware of tab, for it is the dark-side, and can hamper you musically in the long-run.
* eMedia Beginner Guitar Lessons. (~$30) Totally awesome simple music software. It’s not great for long-term use, but you can find it for less than $30 and will introduce you to a nice variety of styles. Use this to learn about your guitar and to sample a few different musical styles. You will outgrow this, preferably by beginning to take guitar lessons.
* Esteban’s Complete Guitar Course for Beginners. (rent from library) Totally awesome simple DVD + instructional book. You will outgrow this even quicker than the computer lessons. I found this is in our local library by accident, and the book (while using non-standard tab-like notation) does a reasonable job of getting you excited about sounding like you know what you’re doing.
* A chord chart (print one out) … It’s fun to try to smush your fingers into the shapes… fun as in: painful and confusing.

...between those 4 things, you're in for less than $50 and it'll give you a good smattering of finger-style, chords, pop music, classical music, etc.

I don't really care which type of guitar you start with (electric, acoustic [metal strings], classical [nylong strings]), but I would recommend going to some guitar store, strumming at least 2-3 of each of those varieties that are cheap (not the $1000+ guitars, but the 200-500 guitars).  Learn the A-minor chord / C-chord and just strum that a bit.

http://www.how-to-play-guitar.eu/guitar_chords/A/Am_Guitar_Chord.gif

http://www.how-to-play-guitar.eu/guitar_chords/C/C_Guitar_Chord.gif


Then go onto craigslist and buy almost the cheapest guitar that matches the style that you like.  There is a PLETHORA of cheap-ass electric guitars b/c people got bored, cheap-ass acoustics and classical b/c people inherited them, etc.

DON'T BUY YOUR FIRST GUITAR FROM GUITAR-CENTER (or similar). Buy a cheap / crappy / reasonable one off craigslist, push forward for 6+ months, *then* decide to buy a better guitar.

At that point buy whatever you want, from wherever you want.  Cheap guitars lose value VERY quickly and you don't want to overcommit to a type or style of guitar until you have played it for 6+ months.  And you don't want to pay the price premium for a new cheap guitar so just get a used person-to-person transaction for your first guitar.

Perhaps she could have written TFA a bit better and spoken clearly like I tried to do what is it that the questions makes us feel like.

As for the point of who is the dominant group and who is the subordinate group, I will give you that as far as that sort of metric, then non-european whites are doing well.  But what I mean when I mean dominant group is the group that is more culturally dominant.  One example that comes right off the top of my head is the color ""flesh"" in crayons, whose flesh? I mean, the thing is like a pinkish color.  So it follows that when people think ""flesh color"" more than likely they think of a ""white skin"" hue.  Also, even subordinate groups have internalized the attitude that it is better to have lighter skin, their movie stars, celebrities, etc. All seem to be a tad lighter than the rest of the population (this happens a lot in South America too).  I recall a commercial for a ""whitening"" cream that had this poor Indian girl not getting a guy due to her horrible dark skin, but after using the cream, she gets the attention she wants.  I know is a convoluted example, but I am at work and I am trying to figure out how to put a video on a website using HTML 5 (yes, I am a total noob; it's a college part time job dammit) and cannot get too involved in finding research articles or examples or whatever.

It isn't so easy to delineate right from wrong in war and it is usually the case that the victor decides which was true. To start, at least one of your points is more than likely wrong. [Here](http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1930) is an article on how the US provoked Japan into war using economics.

&gt; And this wasnt a war for oil. It was a war to the very end, an end to free thought as a way of life.

If you think this war wasn't about resources as much as victory then you're not thinking straight. The Soviet's march to Berlin was as much about defeating Germany as capturing Hitler and acquiring the results of the German Atomic Bomb program. I'm sure the US had similar objectives in its efforts, the least of them being keeping influential allies in Europe.

&gt; I dont think anyone would deny that bombing somewhere like Dresden was sad and unfortunate, but if this war wasnt won, the world would be a very different place today.

Assuming when stating the world would be a very different place you meant it would be worse, this is by implication stating that the ends justified the means. To what extent does a country have to go before such a thing is not alright? If the US had nuked Germany to powder, would that be alright? What is the middle ground? At what point do you stop becoming complacent to mass civilian casualties? 

Take for instance the atomic bombings of Japan. Some historians believe that despite some Japanese generals seriously resisting, that Japan would've surrendered either without the bombing or if the bombs had been detonated off shore. If that were true, would you not be alright with it? Does the existence of alternatives having less casualties sway your opinion in the slightest? Isn't the reality that they could have tried bombing off-shore first and then tried bombing the cities? The truth is that they didn't, because the civilian casualties were less important than the hasty and guaranteed ending of the war. The US killed tens of thousands of civilians over the course of a few days for potentially no reason.

&gt; Id like to see how others would have handled the big decisions that Roosevelt and Churchill had to make. How would you have fought the war without bombing? Would letting Hitler run Britain have been your solution?

Again, being emotional here. Conversely, how would you have handled being a Nazi stationed at a death camp? Given research by Stanley Milgram, you would have most likely blindly followed orders and exterminated whomever you were asked to. Given that you or I wouldn't have necessarily done any better, does that mean that no one can reserve judgment for those that did these horrible things? Of course not, what's wrong is wrong no matter the circumstances. Just because Churchill and Roosevelt did what they thought was best and anyone else might have done as well, doesn't mean that what they did wasn't wrong.",,tyree731,0,0,,1426232085,0

The thing I'm sick of is the rich (relatively) stealing the babies of the poor.  That IS what this is a case of. When the earthquake hit Haiti there was a feeding frenzy on the part of whites to adopt black babies but that's not good for the children.  How many people from other countries adopt children from the US or Western Europe?  0%?

There's no debate really when you consider what's actually going.  I've seen people in documentaries in the US alongside the mother who's about to give her child to them.  Of course she's poor and they are relatively rich.  They take the kid as she's crying with this ""it's for the best even though it hurts"" look on their superior faces.  The truth is that it's not for the best. Those children's families should be helped so that those children can be raised by their biological family.

There were a few wars(some started by settlers, but most started by European powers that were still in charge at the time or natives.) and some displacements(terrible ones, with thousands of people dying), but nothing to qualify as a systematic extermination. 

There is also the fact that the conquests were MAINLY done by soldiers following orders of European powers(not the orders of settlers). Powers that were kicked out during the revolution. Also, the fact the countless millions came to this nation long after the conquests would mean that only a tiny fraction of Americans has any relation to those that had ever participated in any wars against the natives.

Also even if what the original settlers did, does qualify as genocidal(we would have to change the meaning of the word to do that), it wouldn't make their decedents(the tiny fraction of Americans who's ancestors had anything to do with any war against the natives) genocidal.

First, I think you have the calendar confused a little.
http://www.google.com/trends?q=Apple+iPhone%2C+LG+Prada&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0
The phones were announced within a couple weeks of one another. Here's an article comparing them before official launch:
http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/72B08E9A-D467-45EA-B214-28D3A340C3E5.html
While nay-sayers have been falling all over themselves to suggest that the Prada “looks the same” and “does everything the iPhone does,” and “did it all first,” they seem to be avoiding the really interesting story. It goes something like this:
The number four mobile maker in the world, LG, set out to design the most beautiful phone possible. It worked with Prada designers to craft a sexy look, and spared little expense in designing a phone to sell at the ultra high end of the market.
It will be sold next to $800 Prada handbags and is targeted at the snooty European GSM market, where phones are already far more sophisticated than the US.
Before LG even officially unveiled the new phone, Apple revealed its own phone with striking similarities in luxury features and sleek design, although the iPhone’s hardware is better all around, at a slightly lower price.
Apple targets the iPhone at the mass market, and will sell it in its own retail stores next to related technology products. It targets the American GSM market, where phones are lame and 3G service is not widely available.
The big difference is that the iPhone is practical. It has a real email app that works just like desktop email. It has a real web browser. It has incredible polish on its media player, brilliant user interface shortcuts, and connects to popular web services that were custom designed to work on it, not pulled out of a bargain shareware bin.
Because of the release cycles, neither copied the other. The difference wasn't marketing, it was usability.""

'If you think this war wasn't about resources as much as victory then you're not thinking straight. The Soviet's march to Berlin was as much about defeating Germany as capturing Hitler and acquiring the results of the German Atomic Bomb program. I'm sure the US had similar objectives in its efforts, the least of them being keeping influential allies in Europe.'

This seems a little absurd to me. Sure, the US might have been putting some economic pressure on Japan, but that gives them no right to bomb Pearl Harbour.
Your second point. There are always people looking to make the best of of war. We are talking about human beings here. Are you seroiusly suggesting Russia should have stopped at Poland and said, 'ok we've taken everything back, we'll just let the Germans rebuild and come back at us stronger in the future'. They had no option, they had to totally defeat the Germans and make sure there were no reprisals. Now i'm sure there were a few in power that thought theyd make a quick buck out of the situation, but thats the case in almost all of life, there's very few true altruistic acts. It doesnt make the resulting effect 'wrong'. If I give a poor person 5£ because I enjoy doing it, it doesnt make the gesture any less 'right'.

'Assuming when stating the world would be a very different place you meant it would be worse, this is by implication stating that the ends justified the means. To what extent does a country have to go before such a thing is not alright? If the US had nuked Germany to powder, would that be alright? What is the middle ground? At what point do you stop becoming complacent to mass civilian casualties?'

This is what i'm saying, these are tough decisions that leaders had to make, you cant go calling them wrong or evil just because they bombed someone. This is war, you cant worry about every civillian in this situation. Todays wars are different, back then they either bombed the cities or the enemy kept their infrastructure to build weapons.

'Take for instance the atomic bombings of Japan. Some historians believe that despite some Japanese generals seriously resisting, that Japan would've surrendered either without the bombing or if the bombs had been detonated off shore. If that were true, would you not be alright with it? Does the existence of alternatives having less casualties sway your opinion in the slightest?'

If the americans were 100% sure the Japanese would have surrendered without the bomb, then I would have been happy to try them for war crimes. As it was, I dont beleive this was the case - i'm happy to be proved otherwise. I would have dropped it myself if it makes you feel happier.

'Again, being emotional here. Conversely, how would you have handled being a Nazi stationed at a death camp?'

I have no idea, but those people not in positions of authority were not tried for war crimes and rightly so in my opinion. 
I dont think its being emotional at all though. Its a perfectly valid question that historians use all the time. Put yourself in someone elses shoes. How would you have dealt with that situation? We use theoretical situations all the time to understand things. 

'Given that you or I wouldn't have necessarily done any better, does that mean that no one can reserve judgment for those that did these horrible things?'

Exactly yes. This is a very personal thing, but in my opinion, if you wouldnt have acted any differently (without the use of hindsight) then you cant judge people for what they did. I think that is how most people view criminal acts. We put a murderer behind bars because we wouldnt have killed someone if we were in their shoes. I therefore dont judge Churchill for allowing the bombing of German cities, because I would have done it without a moments hesitation. I condemn Hitler because he did things I would never dream of doing.

'Just because Churchill and Roosevelt did what they thought was best and anyone else might have done as well, doesn't mean that what they did wasn't wrong.'

Again I completely disagree. Its what makes them good human beings imo. I suppose it comes down to what you call wrong. How do you define what is wrong? I have no hard coded way of defining rights and wrongs, all I know is if I can understand why someone did what they did, and I would have done it myself, that makes it 'right' to me. Its emotional, yes, and there will be things I disagree with people about, but this is how we come to agreeing on Laws and societies morals - theres no hard coded way of going about it - I dont think there ever can be.

I guess I just have a very different moral code to you. I dont think emotions really come into this very much. I think bombing a city CAN be justifiable - thats not an emotional response, its just my opinion. I think you can to the right thing for the wrong reasons and still be considered the good guy. I think 2 people can do exactly the same thing and one be on the side of right and one on the side of wrong. You're not going to change my mind on that. ",,caughtatdeepfineleg,0,0,,1426232325,0

&gt; This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, **Mrs. Webster,** has so ably shown, a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.

As Catholicism became entrenched into the political systems of Europe, it melded with local religions - adding some obviously non-Biblical practices - and grew into more of an institution than a faith.  The Holy Roman Empire wasn't terribly holy, and it strayed away from Biblical teachings with alarming frequency.  

With the church as corrupt as it eventually became, it's no surprise to me that a literal interpretation of the Bible was viewed dimly by the Catholic institution.  The political leaders of that time were often viewed as having some supernatural power at their back that thrust them into their positions.  However, maintaining political power was more important to the leaders of that time than maintaining faith; the same is true of our political leaders today.

It really wasn't until the Reformation that the Bible came back into vogue as the bedrock for Christianity, and, even then, people will often pick a particular preacher or pastor to follow than to read the Word themselves.  I'm as guilty of that as anyone else.  But that's how we got Lutherans and Calvinists, then Baptists, Anabaptists and a whole slew of other denominations.

A great resource is the travel section of a bookstore.  Spend the afternoon there going through the books on Tokyo.  Pick out a few books that you like.  Get a full sized book or two and a pocket book or two.  Those will give you a good start.

Then go online and look for trip reports for Tokyo.  For instance:

http://www.fodors.com/faq/tripreports.cfm

Find someone who has similar interests as you and see what they looked at.

Keep notes on everything.  Start a google map for your trip.  Use it to mark down the places you want to visit.  I did this for my trip to Europe and it was very handy to have.

I studied a bunch of Japanese before going though, and I can tell you it comes in handy knowing some Japanese when going there, but Tokyo is pretty internationalized compared to other Japanese cities, so english and hand gestures should be fine. :) 

Some people have a hard time finding an ATM that works though, so it might be good to bring another major label/brand as well. They have citibank though, so maybe print out a map of where one is.

If you're a tech geek, there's a lot of tech stuff to be bought at Akihabara - it's the electronics centre of Tokyo. For clothes and fashion etc. I'd go to Shinjuku and Shibuya.

As far as handgestures etc go - I don't think there's any that will get you in trouble. They touch their nose it means ""me"". If they won't look you in the eye they're being polite, not nescessarily shy or rude. There's likely to be a lot of bowing, although that might just be for business conversations etc. It's polite if you bow back, but it's not expected.

Oh - and I know from my fellow european female colleagues that if you're a caucasian blonde and semi-atractive you'll be getting A LOT of attention, either by men who want to nail a blond white girl, or other women who want to touch your hair or some such. 

There's a bunch of places to go see in Tokyo. There's a incredibly tall building (hotel?) in Roppongi where you can see the entire city, which is just beautiful. Also there's the Eiffel tower copy thing in Ginza which is also pretty good. There's a huge park near Ikebukuro, and alsot eh national museum is there as far as I can remember. 

Anyway, Tokyo is great, but if you can travel, the best place to see Temples etc is Kyoto, that's where the Emperor's capital was when the nobility was in charge. Japan has had a history of power changes between the nobility and army-rule. Tokugawa was a military leader, and he situated his capital in Tokyo (which literally means eastern capital). Anyway, that's where the real pretty stuff is, but I've never seen them myself. Tokyo is plenty for a looong time. :)

It's not that easy to say. We were sort of educated and connected to the academia, to the intelligentsia. Many of our friends traveled back and forth to participate in academic conferences and spent some time doing research in Western Europe and the United States. There were better jobs and better pay in the West. One of our closest friends and mentors spent some time in the late 60's, early 70's in California - I think two years with one of his children (the Polish policy was that they didn't allow the whole family to leave Poland at the same time so although he had two kids, one of the kids had to stay behind, like a hostage). He was very impressed by the American school system, which was trying to not only cater to individual needs but also trying to emphasize the individual ability to self-actualize and to develop what was best about you individually, your own unique talents, which was different from the then-very rigid system of Polish primary education. He couldn't speak English well but he played the violin well and was immediately complemented on his skills and became involved in a local orchestra so he felt very included in the community immediately and they were happy about it.

People back then, e.g. during BeatleMania, were trying to get longer hair but were forced to the barber and had to shave their heads, so it wasn't worth it. We listened to the Beatles even though we didn't understand the words. There were special shops called ""Peweks"" which were officially ""for tourists"" who came to Poland and had dollars (officially Poland had two currencies, złotys and dollars if someone had a relative abroad) and you could buy jeans if you had the money. Dollars were very expensive because Polish salaries were pittance. The value of the dollar was inflated. Jeans could cost half of your monthly salary. When my son was small it was hard to get chocolate because of martial law, and I gave my father a dollar to buy my son chocolate. My father bought the chocolate in a Peweks but was really angry that he lived and worked his whole life in Poland but couldn't even afford a chocolate. In Polish stores there was nothing.

&gt; What did they think of occurrences like the Prague Spring or other uprisings/notable events?

What could we have thought about the Prague Spring? We were horrified that Polish soldiers were there helping quell the uprising. But everyday life was so difficult, I had a small son and I could stand 8-9 hours in line to buy basic goods. If it takes all day to get basic food, you're so exhausted it's hard to think of anything else. I needed to make sure that my son wasn't going hungry.",,solidarnosc,0,0,,1426232471,0

It's the equivalent of two runners in a marathon with one gets to starts right away, and the other is told that he can't start until 10 minutes later, and they both are competing to reach the same goal line first. The only problem is that any remedies you make are already too late as the damage has already been done. No matter how hard the second guy tries to catch up (assuming they both have equal talent), the first will still be ahead (unless the 2nd is extremely gifted). 

&gt; and the reason white people have more wealth is that they tend to be better educated. for some reason, europe had a head start on knowledge beginning even before the greeks and its been pretty consistantly that way ever since.

They're also quite cruel and will do anything to be ahead. If conquering lands mercilessly means laying the grounds for the next generations' safety and security then I guess they are better educated, but being better educated does not mean that they are inherently smarter. 
And when did Europe have a head start on knowledge before the Greeks? I don't recall that in any history book. The Europeans, fyi, took a lot from the Greeks, the Indians, the Chinese, and the Middle East during the period known as the Renaissance. 

&gt; my theory is that the climate in europe is just such that people have to be hardy and alert without being repressed by their surroundings. the african tribes did not live in such an area. 

That is just  ridiculous. 

&gt; don't try to correct history by dicking with the present though.

History has already happened, some people have gotten ahead of others using unfair and what is considered today ill-gotten gains. A clue for this is why Africans (from Africa) do so much better when they immigrate here to America over African Americans who are born here? 

&gt; all people should be completely equal in the eyes of the government and law.

I agree. Problem was, it wasn't equal for many centuries and it's still not equal, and that's why affirmative action is in place to help rebalance it. 

When you have a seesaw with a 1000 pound white guy and a 100 pound black guy and you put them on, it's going to tilt towards the 1000 pound white guy. 

What should have happened was that the seesaw should have been equal with two 100 pound guys (one white and one black) so that it was balanced. 

Do you think that balance will be achieved, then, if you create new rules that forbid two unequally weighted men from using a seesaw? 

The fat 1000 pound white man is still ahead of the 100 pound black man, but it hasn't been balanced and won't be balanced unless the black guy gains some weight. 

Cheesy analogy, but I think you get the point. 

Edit: As I said in my original post, it shouldn't just be based on race but also socioeconomic position in society as well. A well off black or hispanic kid shouldn't get in, now they have an unfair advantage. We should try to reach the point in society where the ""underrepresented"" and ""left behind"" groups who have been unfairly disadvantaged get to reach the proportional levels of whatever they normally would have been at.

// from wiki article on shock therapy

Poland has been cited as an example of the successful use of shock therapy. When democracy came to this central European nation, the government took Sachs' advice and immediately withdrew regulations, price controls and subsidies to state-owned industries. However with respect to the privatization of the state sector (which may or may not be considered as part of shock therapy depending on the definition being used) the change was much more gradualist. Whereas many economic factors were immediately applied, privatization of state-owned enterprises was delayed until society could safely handle the divestiture, as contrasted with the 'robber baron' state of affairs in Russia.
Productivity increased although at the same time unemployment rates rose as well. As of 2008, the GNP was 77 % higher than in 1989.[9] Moreover, inequality in Poland actually decreased right after the economic reforms were implemented, although it rose back up again in later years.[10][11] Today, although Poland is confronted with a variety of economic problems such as double-digit unemployment, it still has a higher GDP than during communist times, and a gradually developing economy[12]. Poland was converging towards the EU as regards the income level in 1993-2004.[13]

Aryan culture is not the cause of nazis.  Had they been any other culture, they could have done the same thing.  However, Islam is the cause of radical muslims. 

&gt;Yes you did. You said: ""If I'm talking about his political affiliation, I'm not talking about his ethnicity.""

You're right, my mistake.  I may have been thinking of something else, but I concede as much.  But what it comes down to is that Islam and political affiliations expect you to follow a set of ideas, whereas ethnicity does not.  In as much, Islam can be wrong whereas being arabic cannot.

&gt;That is an arbitrary distinction on your part. Obviously religion be as big part of personal and cultural identity as ethnicity is.

This is not an arbitrary distinction because your bloodline has absolutely nothing to do with your religion.  One does not make the other mandatory.

&gt;I said that I was a former Muslim atheist. I even put former in bold in a later message for you to see it. Perhaps you should read what I am saying instead of reading what you think that I am saying.

Either you're not wording things clearly or you don't understand what being a muslim is.  You could mean ""I was previously a muslim and now am atheist"" but to put the two together doesn't work.  If you mean it the other way than you are a ""person who follows islam and does not believe in deities"" The two are mutually exclusive.

&gt;So then if you take all parts of Aryan heretage, including holocaust, nazis, two world wars, colonizations, etc. We can conclude that Aryan nations are bad. In fact, why stop there? Many of the third world conflicts come from colonial policies of mixing ethnic groups together and setting them against each other so that they are easier to be ruled over.

Those are past injustices, not current ones, even if they have ramifications leading to today.  Aryans in the form of neo-nazis still shame my race of that I will not deny,  even if their race doesn't mean they have to become neo-nazis but being Aryan doesn't mean you have to subscribe to a set of ideas. Conversely the Islamic community, promotes a set of ideas, and still has a very large portion that is still unrepentantly in favor of killing jews, christians, and subjugating women.  

&gt;Well that is a weak disclaimer on your part. The whole point is how you would treat a Muslim or a Jew you never met when it comes to employments, bank loans, etc. You can agree in principle that not all Muslims are bad, but treat every Muslims you meet with prejudice and suspicion.

I believe my point is best expressed using a quote from Martin Luther King, saying I should ""judge a man by the content of his character rather than the color of his skin""  I feel the same way in regards to race, religion, gender, and just about every group a person can belong to.  The difference is, if you don't know someone's character, you, me and everybody else has preconceived notions about who the person will probably turn out to be.  This is what psychologists refer to as making archetypes.  

I know what certain groups are like as a whole, so according to that when I first meet an individual I view them as having different weighted possibilities about how they may be similiar to the archetype for that group in my head.  This can apply to christianity (when I first meet a christian I assume that they don't have the same strict adherence to scientific facts as I do) Muslims (I can normally assume muslims will be anti-western culture to some extent) even things like clothes (if you're wearing cheap clothing I assume you either don't care what you look like or are poor)

You can't sit there and say you don't do this, it's a universal human trait.  It's called a ""first impression"" and everybody gets them.  You can try and say you get an immediate impression of who someone is by their religion, but it's not true.",Knight of /new,Cituke,0,0,knight,1426232574,0

It didn't come from left field not because we wanted to go to war with them, because America was incredibly isolationist before Perl Harbor (you probably don't hear about that in whatever rudimentary history class you took), so all embargoes against Japan was an attempt to curtail their imperialism, not to provoke an attack.  The Japanese were not 'acting like assholes', they were raping their way across Asia and the pacific because of their 'divine right' to unify Asia under their emperor.  Even though nations we were friendly with (Great Britain, The Netherlands, Australia, China, etc) were succumbing to Nazi attack.

We couldn't even provide monetary assistance to the Allies in order to fight the Nazis without provoking an attack due to the Tripartite Pact, so perhaps *that* particular aspect of the situation made an attack inevitable, but maybe you're right; perhaps a complete Asian theocratic dictatorship as well as a European dictatorship under the Nazis and Italians would have been better for the world, perhaps we should have just let those countries settle their own differences (differences such as having their own governments as opposed to one under the Emperor or Hitler's rule).

The problem is what Americans actually consider conservative. Conservative in politics in the rest of world usually means, low taxes, small government, and being conservative with money - i.e - watch your books closely. No over spending.

In America, it's that, plus a whole load of other batshit crazy stuff like, disbelieving global warming, evolution, and God is awesome and screw anyone who says otherwise. That's not conservatism in the rest of the western world, that's ""oh, those loopy people."". I don't know where you are from, but if the conservatives in Ireland (or even the torries in the UK) started banging on about God, and personally believed that evolution is nonsense - because of the Bible - they wouldn't even be locally elected. Never mind government. Because these issues, in politics, aren't actually conservative issues at all - only in North America is such issues considered ""conservative"".  It's that they take the labels to the extreme. What we consider moderately conservative in the rest of the western world, would be labeled liberal in the USA and Canada.

For example, their president - An ex-lawyer, who bails out **banks**, and who's policies if judged analytically are undoubtedly conservative. If he was a politician in Europe, he and most of the democratic party candidates, would be considered conservative. Something that he [admits](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6211844/Barack-Obama-world-leaders-see-me-as-a-conservative.html) himself. In America he's ""liberal"". So Liberal in fact that some people have no problem actually thinking with the mindset that he's so liberal he's socialist. 

The problem isn't that the conservatives in America are a minority. The actual problem is what they have labeled conservatives are in the minority.

Another problem is because of the extreme nutbaggery that goes on with American ""conservatives"", no real conservative thinking person wants to be associated with these idiots - because their core rhetoric has nothing to do with actual conservative values.

So now the word ""conservative"" in America has become a dirty word with rational thinking people, when it shouldn't. We have to remind our friends in America that conservatism has nothing to do with: hating science and praising Jesus - and labeling anything you don't like either communist or socalist in an attempt to scare the shit out of people.

The word has simply been hijacked. For example, I do not consider the American Republican party conservative. I just consider them idiots. That's why America is such an anomaly, modern in one sense, but if the Republican party existed in any other major western country, they'd be ridiculed and laughed at for being ridiculous. The only place I could actually see them looking somewhat sane would be if they ran for government in radical Islamic Republics or a few radical nations in Africa.

TL;DR - There are plenty of conservatives in America, they are not an minority. It's just the way the Americans label themselfs a bit differently to the rest of the world in what is considered a conservative. Many Americans who consider themselves ""liberal"" in the political sense,  would be considered ""conservatives"" outside of the USA and Canada. 

&lt;exaggeration&gt;It's just that anyone slightly more to the left than Benito Mussolini is considered liberal in the states &lt;/exaggeration&gt;

This is why reddit seems more conservative when the majority of America is awake.

That's because if you're a part of a religion, it's easier just to talk about tenets of your religion or how god has blessed you in a certain way or w/e.  There isn't much to talk about in atheism except how religion has it wrong.

It's saying war is ordained ie sacred, and that even if you don't want to go to war you should because God knows better.

&gt;Open to interpretation, but in any case not as bad as murder in police custody.

I would say that wife rape permeating and being permitted all the muslim world is far worse than some fairly isolated incidents of murder in which prosecution is being followed.

Ugh, for one thing, don't use sex and the city as a moral reference point.  Other than that, saying you can't marry outside of your religion is bigotted, there's nothing false about that.

Which is part of why I don't follow any religion.  Why would a just god eternally tortue his children just because they didn't know any better?

That's not the standard interpretation, and moreover I (and many muslims) could interpret it as ""If someone won't let me practice my beliefs (stay aloof and keep my peace) I should kill them""  Interpretation is the main factor in doing plenty of the evil shit in this world.  Having a way to say it was written in the holiest of books is the basis of its justification.

&gt;Seems to me your people are worse than mine. In fact Muslims have by far much better record of tolerance than Christians. Oldest Christian sect, for example, are Copts in Egypt. There is no way Copts would have survived Catholic inquisition in Europe.

How the hell did you forget I was an atheist?  And why try to argue that muslims have a better track record (which is disputable) than christians if I see them both as capable and showing that they produce evil by the virtue of the nature of their existence?  This is not to mention that history isn't as important as what's going on now.  The way by which people interpret religions changes and Christians have much less militant stances now than Islam does.

Here's another good couple Quran quotes:

Women 4:15 As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four of you against them. And if they testify (to the truth of the allegation) then confine them to the houses until death take them or (until) Allah appoint for them a way (through new legislation). 

Punishment for being ""lewd"" is death? (until he says otherwise... great I can't way for Quran vol. 2)

Mutual Delusion 64:14 O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are enemies for you, therefor beware of them. And if ye efface and overlook and forgive, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Your wife and kids are your enemies? what?

The prophets 21:6 Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe?

Here allah decides to destroy entire towns, including children, there's some morality for you.

And this isn't even getting into the prior testaments you believe in.  God drowning the entire world except for the contents of the ark?  great.

This whole process took over two months since i had a one month vacation in between my interviews. That gives you an idea of how much they felt that they needed me. Two days before my start date, they call me up and tell me that they had made a clerical error and the position was actually for a ""Sr. Software Engineer""; and they give me another offer for this position.

Still, there's a certain weight threshold, different for every individual, below which is considered unhealthy. If your body requires more calories than you consume, and you're underweight and lacking fat reserves, your body starts breaking down muscle (including your heart), which is *not good*. I think it's safe to say that models who have poor body image exist and consequently starve themselves as a result; the end product is a person who looks famished. Their mental health and profession could be argued to have contributed to this.

That being said, whether or not that's the case for Mark Vanderloo cannot be said for sure. You're entitled to your opinion. Mine is that his distinct brow ridge and cheekbones make him look skeletal and famished, but there are other factors that may contribute to this aside from weight (camera angle, lighting, etc).",,lt_daaaan,0,0,,1426232745,0

Because they don't have to do that. But there are Jewish terrorists.

Ummm, Palestine, apartheid, ethic cleansing...

&gt; They see those parapels as some kind of moral story and not literal orders to be carried out. 

You mean like those Orthodox Jews?

&gt; As an ex-muslim myself I am clearly familiar with what the terrorists base their actions on - the Quran verses and the hadith.

Religion provides justification, but seems to me that Bin Laden and Al-Qaida attacked US, not because Quran told them to, But because of US suport for Israel, Us army bases of Saudi Arabia, and Sanctions on Iraq. How do I know? Coz he Fucken said so. What are you, six years old. 

&gt; You might be familiar with the ""camel pee"" incident in the Bukhari hadith.

Yeah well those were barbaric times, and you will find similar things in any book from ancient times. From what I understand, Islam forbade a lot of more barbaric practices, actually increased rights of women, and brought more tolerance for other faiths and religions. Of course, compared to now, This system seems barbaric, but consider that, for example, Oldest Christian sect are Copts in Egypt. No way Copts would have survived Catholic inquisition in Europe. Same thing in Spain. Muslims ruled Spain as an multi-ethnic place. Once Christians took over, they killed all the Jews and Muslims in short order. Same thing happened when Serbia freed itself from Ottoman rule.  Jews would actually historically go to Muslim countries to escape Christian persecution, But I don't want to overstate my case. Yeah, Mohammad was a barbarian in barbaric times. 

&gt; When you have a prophet with such a tradition and verses that clearly tell the muslims what to do, it doesnt take too much of a leap to kill civilians. Decent people who are also muslims simply do what is right, no matter what their religion tells them.

Well I could go by what Bin Laden says the reason behind his actions are, or I could listen to your speculation. You could believe that all Al Qaida terrorists are crazy rabid, fanatics who act without a rhyme or reason, But is that really the case?

&gt; The Danish cartoons are just that - cartoons. I've seen the cartoons and I admit they're poor taste, 

Well more than just poor taste. Jobs have been lost by radio personalities over racist or anti-sematic comments in the US. Government does not restrict speech, but employers usually don't tolerate intolerance. That is those cartoons were met not supported by main stream media here in the US. 

&gt; but instead of refuting the claims of the cartoonist, the muslims chose to wage war. Why? Could it be because albeit the poor taste the cartoonist had a point?

War? I think it was mostly peaceful demonstrations and boycotts of products. Yeah there were some violent demonstrations too, but most of them were peaceful. 

&gt; The oppresion -if it exists- exists because of extremists. Don't blame the people from being scared and judgmental of muslims when muslims who wield power do stuff that no decent human being should be doing. It scares the shit of people to think that Ahmed living next door might wield power some day and start kicking their ass.

Actually, hatred and prejudice in Europe against Muslims and Immigrants existed way before radical Islam took off in the 1980's.

Well from Wikipedia, first time those cartoons were published, they received little attention. [from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy)

&gt; In 2005, the Muhammad cartoons controversy received only minor media attention outside of Denmark. Six of the cartoons were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr on 17 October 2005,[45][46] along with an article strongly denouncing them, but publication did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and the end of January 2006, examples of the cartoons were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Belgium and France. Very soon after, as protests grew, there were further re-publications around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe.

&gt; You made a good start with the first paragraph, then you blew it on the second. Do you believe that Muslims are unique in the way they are treated in Europe?

When you give examples of inquisition you are trying to justify one fucked up thing with another. Of course ottomans would accept Jews because it means more taxes for the ottmans. Non-muslims pay more taxes than the muslims did. Ottoman emperors used to borrow money from Jewish bankers and go to war. Look up Yavuz Sultan Selim and his war on Egypt.

Ever heard of the quote ""with or without religion there'll be people who do evil, but for good people to do evil, it takes religion"". And it takes a religion where you can justify these actions. Try doing that with a Jainist. 

I advise you don't try to spread that crap about Islam making womens situation any better. Mohammed used to work for a woman before he started hearing voices in his head. If Islam was a true religion from a true god, it would have done much better and not wait for the American civil war to end slavery. It still can't sort out elemental stuff like womens rights, pedophilia and stonings. We still have these in the 21st century. Where? In islamic countries. Why? Because Islam felt that not eating pork and not drinking were much more important than fucking up childrens lives, executing people by stoning them to death, mutilating childrens genitals and making women semi-slaves to men their whole life. I'll take pork and alchohol thank you. 

Islam is made up by a cunning tribe leader and his rules and laws and examples are not relevant to the world now at all. However they are being used by sly people to trick naive people to blow themselves up. 
There is no other explanation for this. 

I guess putting a price on a cartoonists head is peaceful to you? The guy lives under police protection since then. How is this peaceful? The guy draws a cartoon, doesnt actually physically hurt anyone, but he now has a bounty on his head. 
Hatred and prejudice exists because of the Ottoman empire tried to invade Europe a few hundred years ago. Of course there'll be prejudice. But things went out of hand after fundamentals migrated to Europe. Once people actually saw what kind of lives these people lived, and after they became aware of how their home countries were like, prejudice turned into fear.

I'm gay, and I'm sporty, and changing rooms just aren't a sexual thing for me. Largely because I'm used to them. You go to parts of Europe, and they have mixed saunas, and that's not sexual, because that's just normal nakedness. I kinda feel the same way. I've grown up being in changing rooms with guys (rugby players, mostly). Plus, it's just a guy thing - you don't look at their bits - it's rude. And you're too busy sweating, getting dressed, etc.

That said, of course I'll notice a hot guy, but I do on the train too (and actually, much more often). There's not really any difference. I'm not looking at their cock, I'm thinking ""wow, that's a hot guy"", and just doing the ""trying to avoid being obvious"" thing. But from what I hear from straight dudes, it's the same, in that I'm not attracted to 98% of guys I see.

No I am not. That is not the topic. The topic is what beliefs for extremist Muslims have, not if their beliefs are accurate. I am simply saying that Extremist Muslims are acting reasonably based on their frame of reference. 

&gt; I think the insult and humiliation perceived from the Mohammed cartoons is bullshit. ""NO GRAVEN IMAGES ! ! !"" If I remember correctly, they were saying that the images themselves (of M.) were the problem as well as the insult and humiliation they felt. (Again, this goes to them not having a sense of humor about themselves. If you can't laugh off a cartoon making fun of the most extreme views of your religion, you have already lost the battle.)

Well remember when Don Imus got fired for his Nappy Headed Ho's comments. Maybe the problem was that Al Shapton did not have a sense of Humor. 

&gt; As for being second class citizens in Europe, maybe they are perceived that way due to how they treat their women based on Sharia law as dictated by their holy book. Maybe if they didn't have repeated 'honor killings' in the streets and actually adopted western values (non-religious ones like women are equal and deserving of respect) maybe they would be given more respect and treated as equals.

Well you are kind of blaming the victim here. Yeah some Muslims are backward and such, but in France there is only maybe few thousand women who wear a burka. That is like 1% of 1%.The whole burka thing is clearly to stoke anti-Islamic passions. And yeah there are honor killings, but those are rare. Still they receive disproportionate attention, compared to example Police brutality against Muslims, or Mosque burnings. Did you know that mosque was burned to the ground recently in England and another one was firebombed in Canada? You are more likely to hear about some Muslim who thinks that gays should be killed, than you are to hear about a mosque being burned to the ground. 

Did you know, for example, that in 1960's Paris police killed hundreds of peaceful Algerian protesters - many of whom drowned when they were thrown into the river with their hands tied.

We're both incredibly independent. She went through a period of time of about 7 months where I paid all the bills, because she was *too* stressed out with work and I convinced her to quit and take some 'time off'.

Yeah, I believe she is definitely worth it. She's an amazing artist, an amazing singer (think Adele, Amy Winehouse (her voice) and Etta James combined). She's incredibly talented, independent and amazingly beautiful person.

I have to wonder about what citizens of Foxnewsville tell each other what to prepare for when travelling to LeftistLoonyLiberalWorld, in an attempt to ""blend in with the natives"".  Somehow I picture a mix of David Attenborough and National Lampoon's European vacation.

Scratch that - I have a weirdly appropriate anecdote I'd like to share with the internet (side note, Firefox wtf, internet isn't in your dictionary?).  It isn't political, but I believe it's the closest match to the awkwardness your post seems to bleed.

A few years ago, I was a member of a regional university's ""physics club"", a social group for physics students that satisfied their need to have *some* sort of social lives.  Now, physics students are *famous* for being some of the most difficult groups of kids to organize into anything remotely social - you'll have better luck herding cats than us.  But this didn't stop the extroverts from at least *trying*, and so we managed to continue a 50+ year tradition of keeping membership in the ""club"" over the number fuckable.  (18 legal ... inside joke .... erm ... )

Being part of the club, and joining my first actual ""social group"" of my loner nerdy life, was obviously an exercise in perpetual awkwardness.  Having never ""belonged"" to anything at all, I quickly became the butt of jokes, as my skill in navigating ""joke / insult"" conversational dynamics was still *very much* a work in progress.  My ""noobishness"", if you can excuse the gamer term, at life in general, in fact, earned me the nickname ""the freshman that almost died"" due to forgetting a container for food and insufficient dry clothes for a *winter mountain camping trip*.   So perhaps I've established my credentials as a certifiable permanent ""outsider"" :-|

Well, the years in undergrad grind on, and the group replenishes its stock of lonely physics students.  Year three, however, was a turning point.  You see, a sophomore double-majoring in physics and electrical engineering decided to join up with our rag-tag group of **misfits**.  And boy did he have an entrance.  Where to start?  At the middle!

His first hellos at the first meeting of the ""club"" were normal enough - kid didn't say very much.  I'm not sure what exactly I should have expected, considering that his only prior contact with the people sitting in the meeting room was either in classes, in which students that *might* have known this dude didn't join us, or in physics symposiums, at which people depressingly didn't really socialize.

Well, the first meeting *every* year for this club begins with an introduction of the ""dudes in charge"", and then the members and guests.  Someone inevitably cracks an AA joke, but the usual ""name, background, favorite video game, and favorite physical constant"" shtick helps everyone get in that funky physics+social mood.  

Usually, these things aren't exactly the most memorable social events, but thanks to this social *champ*, I remember that every single word out of his mouth - down to the last preposition, was an *exact* Simpsons quote.   At that moment, it was *very* impressive.  Much laughter ... good memories ... yada yada.

Well, after we finish the rounds, go over physics club bullshit, pizza, etc., class is effectively ""dismissed"" and people converse in a more natural fashion.  Like any social scene, conversations ebb and flow in a small room in similar crescendos, so our *champ* decides to do his ""thing"" at just the moment everyone and his government listening device in the room can hear.  I can only *describe* the bizarre outburst.

It started with sounded like a dying hissing sound (which draws eyes like an optometrist), followed by what looked like a Parkinson's enhanced twitchy hang-ten sign, and ends with what sounded like a mix between ""yabba-dabba-do"" from Flintstones and R2D2.

The room fell silent for the second before the inevitable ""the FUCK"" exclamations.  Rather heartlessly, I piped up and mentioned ""well, it looks we found someone stranger than me"".  Everyone else agreed, and thus we found an even strayer cat.  But I certainly wanted to know what the fuck that was about.

Apparently, the guy was told by some schmuck that Simpsons references were an easy-in with the physics students, and thus he thought that by imitating some weird shit from Simpsons - that might have seemed like an appropriate illustration of some point he might have made prior to the outburst - he would seem ""cool"".

So, I can grudgingly understand where you're coming from when you repeat something you've heard from an *unbiased trusted source*.  Obviously, the people here might understand your cultural ""in-jokes"".

(LOL) I dunno, the Cubans have a life expectancy equivalent or slightly better than the US -- and they pay a tiny fraction of what Americans do for health care.

But it's not the American people who are opposed to national health care. Public opinion polls since the 1970s have consistently shown that a *majority* of Americans want public health care. These polls typically show that 55-75% of Americans favor this, depending on the period and how the poll is worded.

What you're referring to is our corporate-funded political parties and the corporate mass media -- but remember, they in no way reflect the true feelings of the American people. The American people are not as right-wing as our politicians or corporations pretend they are.

&gt; If you look at Canada or most of Europe, you'll find good systems and people don't go bankrupt just because they get sick.

Relatively few Americans know how bad we have it in the US.

Then, download the datasheet for your microcontroller and read it. You don't have to read it all but whenever you wont know something, 99% it's there (instruction set description, timers, fuses, ports, ...)

Then, find some code online and read that, too. [V-USB](http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html) is beautiful piece of code.

You will have to learn C, no other language is an option. (And hope your microcontroller has GCC tool chain.)

You're not expected to swill beer round your mouth whilst contemplating the subtleties of the bouquet, there's no reason you have to with wine :)

As for types, I tend to drink mainly South American, Californian and Spanish reds. South African and Australian wines are good but cheap as well.

Assuming you're American (apologies if not) I'd guess you could get Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo wine fairly easily which is pretty nice; the Red Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlots are all decent.

Other reds I like are Tempranillo, Rioja (let it breath) and Carmenere which you can get cheaply from South America.

You couldn't hae seen it better.

As I said, my current employer is now being forced to explicitly justify and explain every new financial product to the country's regulator -- if they can't make it clear how the product works, no product.  Period.  This is as it should be.

&gt; That is not to say that Iceland was blameless,

It was not.  Average Icelanders enjoyed a huge amount of prosperity from the bubble; however, I think that most ordinary citizens were unwitting victims, participating in an economic ""boom"" that they had no influence in and whose rotten root causes they couldn't have been expected to understand (given that all involved regulators did not either) and couldn't have done anything about in any case.  I would have expected Iceland's Fjármálaeftirlitsins (the regulator -- yes, I looked it up :-) to have had a say in the matter, but given that the dodgy operations in question were all outside the country, they can also be at least partially forgiven for the oversight.

As for the UK, it wasn't just ""you"" -- The Dutch, Norwegians, and several other governments are just as culpable.  In fact, as I recall, the Netherlands were directly complicit in the decision to not allow Iceland to bring its attempted rescue plan to bear, by moving against Icesave and the other banks at the same time as ignoring repeated Icelandic attempts at communication.  

I am terribly biased here, as I'm Swiss, and see this sort of thing very often, coming from the US and from several European countries.  Regardless of what you may think about tax avoidance and banking secrecy, there is a very strong culture of going after smaller, more successful financial markets.  I find this extremely cynical, as it's often clear that it's not about principle so much as gaining a home advantage at a smaller player's expense.

As for your ""lack of accountability"" statement in the UK -- yes.  However, I doubt whether in this case that the average voter would really object to Brown's aggressive, populist incompetence in this case.

Listened to the Palestinians and yanked all of the Jews out using the IDF... in a bold gesture it hoped would preace peace and calm from the locals.

Do critics give Israel any credit for that? No, they just attack it more viciously and claim it had bad motives... and they emphatically apoligize for Palestinian terrorism emanating from the Judenrein, unoccupied territories.

What happened after Israel took a great risk and did the politically and safety-endangering act  of ""ending the occupation""? Gaza was taken over by an Iran-backed Jihad faction, political opponents were thrown off buildings and shot in the legs by death squads, the privately Jewish-donated greenhouses were looted and smashed like cavemen... depriving Gazans of the ability to farm sustainably.

Life for the average Gazan is far, far worse under Palestinian occupation than it was under Israeli control. This isn't my opinion, this is reflected in Palestinian public opinion polls. Egypt blockages the terrorist state because it doesn't want Iranian arms and Al-Quadia type terrorists crossing in and out, ISrael blockades it because of the intense, life-and-death security risk it poses.

There is no reason to believe the same thing that happened to Gaza won't happen to the WB if Israel ""ends the occupation"" before Palestinians are serious about peace  - and not jiust using the ""peace process"" as setup for the next round of war against Israelis cities, synagogues and citizens.

The reason Israel builds settlements is a way to encourage the Palestinian Arabs to ""hurry up and make peace"" after 60 years of waging war and foot dragging. 

Arabs understand and respect strength - it is part of their culture. They do not, as a general rule, entertain ""negotiations with outsiders"" or ""common good"" or ""the value of religion diversity."" if you believe that Arabs think or negotiate with similar values as Jews or Europeans... you don't understand anything about the cultural differences. Anything Israel has done to appease Arabs or back down (like sign the Oslo accords, back out of Gaza) has been met with a HUGE increase in one-way Arab aggression / terrorism / violence.

That is why Israel will stand strong and set the rules in the territory it controls, and there will only be peace when Arabs recognize Israel and the right of Jewish people to live in a tiny scrap (0.5%) of the Middle East.. unassaulted and terrorized.

There is a point, where you are just godwinning without making any sense.  You are near the tipping point here, I'm afraid.

But eventhough you don't seem to get any futher than comparing everything to nazi's, i'll try to read your subtext and actually answer you concerns here.

========================

I don't think being 'dutch' is a fixed point in time en space. I think, when you have immigrants, you eventually end up with a new culture, that takes the better parts of both cultures. Cultures evolve. 

But they can also split. At some point in time, in Holland, we have catholics, protestants and the working class. These three pillars all had their own shops, their own schools, their own news paper. When television started, they even all got their own broadcasting organisation. 

When time passes, these pillars melted back into one unified nation. This happened in steps; it started with the rebuilding the nation after WWII, but I think the sixties, a fresh generation solidified this change.

Now again, we are a point where two cultures do not mix, do not intermingle. It's not so much, we are not converging. Rather the 'dutch' people tend to move towards a less tolerant society (which isn't that great I think) and the muslims are moving towards more radicalism.

I think the two movements reinforce each other. Our complaints radicalizes them, their radicalization pissed us off.

But there are a lot of people doing something useful. Trying to get this thing to work. But I do honestly believe that that is impossible to achieve when the number of non-integrated people rises so quickly.

We just can't keep up, and the two sides of our culture will divert even further away from each other. Up to the point, where living in the same legal and political system is going to be nearly impossible.

Typical examples are where things are falling apart:

- a muslim woman goes to a non-legal trial by an Imaam to divorce her husband. (if you divorse without permission by an Imaam, you'll likely get killed)

- social security is going to go away, because it really only works when people feel ashamed to make usage of it. Otherwise, there will be too many people intentionally taken advantage of it.

These two points illustrate perfectly, I think, the issue when you have two diverging cultures under one legal and political roof.

You see two core pillars of the nation-state failing here:
 - the monopoly of violence by the state is falling apart
 - the pragmatic relationship between laws and culture

If we don't find a way to make the cultures converge, or at least to provide a well distributed cultural spectrum (rather than clusters), one of two things are eventually to going to happen:

 - we enter an authoritarian system. They have proven in the past effective at uniting two or more cultures under the same social political roof
 - we enter into era of violence. Which will likely either end by splitting up the country, or by entering an authoritarian system.

This might sound like I'm just blindly assuming multiculturalism can't work. But i'm not. Multiculturalism can work where there is either one dominant culture, or a well balanced cultural spectrum. 

However, there is not a place in the world, where having two clusters of cultures did not end in either splitting up a nation, or entering an authoritarian system. 

Look at former Yugoslavia. (when the dictator fell, the nations splitted. Violence before, violence in between .. the only path proven to be effective for peace was one-nation-one-culture. The nation-state.

Look at Iraq. Dictator fell, civil war started. The current stalemate, that is now giving some sort of stability, is based upon the Americans artificially making one culture more dominant. (that is: the americans just picked a side)

You can even see it all though out Europe. 

I also don't think that the one-nation-one-culture; the nation-state; is itself a negative aspect of human beings. It's about a culture being autonomous. 

Laws, priorities and identity are things a nation provide, and it is culture what binds it together. It as unfair for the muslims, to not be allowed to apply Sharia law, as it for us, to have to change our policies and laws and political system to deal with them.

So, converging our cultures is not a choice. It's a we-have-to. Because the eventual alternatives all sound worse to me.

And for some part your comparison to the Nazi's is fair. They likely did the worst thing possible, the most inhumane and evil deed one could think of, to deal with a very similar problem. But it was a problem, one very similar. The jews did have a very isolated culture within a completely different culture. It is interesting to notice that rather than giving them american, canadian or UK passports, the only solution these countries could support was creating a separate state. The state of Israel. 

The more traditional jews are happier there, nowithstanding their constant struggle for security, then they would ever have been embedded within another culture. 

I think, the big lesson from WWII is to accept the idea of the nation-state and that the peace in the world is largely dependent on every culture having their own autonomy; their own state.",,RalfN,0,0,,1426233020,0

In Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, if you fail to wash your hands before touching a Quran, you get beaten up and then stuck in jail for 25 years. And that's the humane treatment. Homosexuality may get you buried under a brick wall that gets bulldozed over you. Look! Boy are those towel-heads respected!

The other is that by the time people like Hertzl founded Political Zionism the religious proto-Zionists had already made the First Aliyah. Religious proto-Zionism predated political Zionism and, when political Zionism came onto the scene, practically forced the notion that the Jewish homeland must be in Israel. Honestly, where else would it be? Many have suggested ""uninhabited"" lands like Uganda or parts of Brazil, but were those places really more uninhabited than the Land of Israel/Palestine? Not really, and Jews had far less legitimate ethical claim to a homeland in those places.

you know, I'm not that well read on the history, I simply know that Herzl is called the 'father' of zionism without regard to whatever parallel religious zionist movements existed at the same time. I also recognize that wikipedia is garbage for anything religious, political, or slightly controversial, but according to [this entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah) only 30k Jews immigrated to what is today Israel while a few million went to America (I guess those that became later helenized). It doesn't sound like there was a strong religious element to most of the people that first made aliyah, at least to the extent that it required incorporation of Herzl's ideas in a religious context. 
 
&gt;The liberal Jewish movements, specifically the Reform Jews (the sect I was raised in and actually learned much of Zionism from) in America, make such differentiations and condemnations all the time, actually.

I can accept that these criticisms happen all the time and that I simply do not hear them since I don't travel in your circles. The same thing happens to Muslims who constantly denounce terrorism in our own circles to the point where you'd rather drill your ears out than hear yet another sermon on the dangers of extremism, but to outsiders, they consider that the Muslim community tacitly approves acts of terror by virtue of their deafening silence. At the same time, I hear some truly disturbing rhetoric from American Jewish people (admittedly, mostly college-aged idiots) demonizing Palestinian civilians. That doesn't justify any crimes committed against them nor does it justify crimes committed against Israeli civilians, just as American attacks against Muslim civilians does not justify attacks against America. The appropriate reaction is to not draw parallels or moral equivalences but simply to denounce bad actions as bad actions. 

in any event, thanks for your insights into liberal Jewish movements. I don't know many orthodox or conservative Jews, but I grew up with a lot of Jewish friends (I was the best man at a reform Jewish wedding! It's so funny how similar some of our traditions are).  Also, I have no idea there was a such thing as unaffiliated Jews - I guess I simply thought that all Jewish people in the world fall into 3/4 categories, and I thought it was the reform that were considered assimilated/Helenized. 

&gt;Here's what I don't get. You ask for religious condemnation of unethical Israeli policies and then say you respect the Orthodox? Even the modern Orthodox and Israel's datim leumim are a little too caught-up in post-Enlightenment, post-traditional reconstructed fundamentalism, the belief that any adaptation to the modern world is a step towards sin and that when making a religious ruling, stricter is better.

actually, my understanding is that orthodox Jews differ in their views of Israel, some even making very harsh religious criticism of the state. I think ysebrius mentioned it as well - he went to yeshiva in Israel I think. Regardless, my respect for those people has little to do with their politics concerning Israel, I just admire people from strong religious traditions that take it seriously. That is to say, if someone really believes they are the chosen people from God and that they have a covenant for their salvation, isnt' that the kind of thing they would tend to take more seriously than all this fluffy mundane pop culture?  I don't believe that stricter is better as far as interpretation goes, Islamic tradition specifically negates that preferring in all things the easiest of what God allows. I've heard Muslim scholars claim that Jews prefer the strict while Christians prefer the lax and Muslims were commanded to follow the middle path. 

&gt;However, the automatic Islamic rejection of any and all Zionism, no matter how peaceful, is problematic. The modern world is rightly organized on the basis of peaceful self-determination and coexistence. While I'll be the first to say that some Zionists over the years, particularly the Jabotinski right-wingers, have been complete and utter dicks in simply assuming that we Jews have the right to take all of the Land of Israel by force of arms, Arab nationalist and Islamofascist opposition to any Jewish homeland (and the miseducation campaigns they use to keep the liberal wing of Arabs and Muslims from seeing common interest with the Jews against the fundamentalists) has repeatedly made force necessary.

There isn't an ""Islamic"" rejection of all things zionism. If you want to get legalistic, Jews living under the protection of Muslims are afforded vast rights of self-determination and self-governance and, according to some scholars, only subject to Muslim laws concerning crimes of right like murder and theft and and not crimes of morality like fornication and drinking alcohol and then only when those crimes concern Muslims. Other than that, Muslim courts would not have jurisdiction and Jews would be sent to their own Rabbinical courts. Those Jewish communities flourished under Muslim protection and was probably the closest thing to a pre-modern Jewish home after the advent of Christianity. It was the [Jewish Golden Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain) under Muslim rule that produced greats like [Maimonides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) who made invaluable contributions to Jewish law. In fact, the few instances of violence against Jews during these times were the result of popular resentment at Jewish wealth (kind of an immigrants taking our jobs mentality) more than genuine anti-semitism. 

Before this, upon the reconquest of Jerusalem during the crusades, Saladin did not avenge the massacres committed by the Crusaders by slaughtering the Christian inhabitants of the city, instead he established it as a homeland for all people of the religion of Abraham, ending the exile imposed by the crusaders of the Jewish patriarch and inviting him to resettle with his people in Jerusalem. 

I understand that these examples are not the same thing as a true Jewish homeland, that is, by Jews for Jews, but I want to illustrate that Islamically, there is nothing wrong with Jews living in or around Jerusalem, in fact, even the Quran recalls God telling Moses to bring his people there. 

However, I don't think the current manifestation of the Jewish homeland is ""rightly organized on the basis of peaceful self-determination and coexistence"" as you characterize the modern world. I do sympathize with the plight of displaced Arab populations, and I don't sympathize with fanatics that think the solution is to erase the Jewish populations from the area. In truth, I don't think even a recognizable minority of Arabs or Muslims truly want to ""drive the Jews into the sea."" When people call for the destruction of Israel, I believe they are talking about the political destruction of a regime that institutionally privileges one religio-ethnic identity over another.  That is as incompatible with the modern world as any other state that privileges an ethnic or religious group over another, be it saudi arabia or south africa under apartheid, or anything else.  I am critical of Saudi-style privilege and I am religiously very conservative. The ability of Islamic law to accommodate circumstance is its most powerful survival trait, which is a perfect segue into your question. Can lands once part of Dar al-Islam be relinquished into non-Muslim rule? In classical Islamic texts, the answer is a resounding no, based on the rulings of scholars more than a clear evidence from a primary source like the Quran. Realistically and for today's purposes, the concept of Dar al-Islam is now extinct. There is no Dar al-Islam. There is not one single state in the world that can make such a claim as to be re-establishing Dar al-Islam, and even if they were able, that would mean the rules concerning it would have to be recrafted from the ground up to accommodate the circumstances of today's world. The people that invoke ancient legalisms concerning dar al Islam are either politically motivated and ignorant of the law, or they simply haven't considered very carefully what if any impact those rulings have on today. Think about it, these same people that claim to be so concerned with reconquering dar al Islam mention nothing about almost all of Africa, Spain, India, the Phillipines, half of the former soviet union, a medium sized chunk of eastern Europe, etc. etc. Why Jerusalem? There are many prayers for the victims of Israel, not so many for the victims of Darfur, a much more serious cause of the death of many many more Muslims. The truth is they are politically motivated. It is not a religious thing. Yes, there is religious concern for the Palestinian refugees, but that is not typically what drives the actions on the ground. ",,txmslm,0,0,,1426233053,0

When it comes to a competitive advantage due to crop subsides, there is no investment into the economies of less developed nations, just exploitation.  The jobs typically remain in the U.S., while the workers come from the less developed nation, like Mexico, as was pointed out in the film.  

Subsides aside though, the working class of the currently developed nations enjoy a relatively high standard of living not because of the industrial revolution, but in spite of it.  The people of Europe and the U.S. fought long and hard for the basic rights we take for granted today, like 8 hour work days and child labor laws.  People would still work under terrible conditions had workers not actively organized and fought for their rights.  This was not a product of the industrial revolution but a reaction against it.  And because these workers raised the bar on the conditions under which they are willing to work, many industrial businesses have outsourced their labor to less developed nations, where people are willing to work for less money and in worse conditions.  Multinational investment into their economies does not typically allow for more job opportunities because the governments in these countries, often at the behest of the governments of the developed nations from which these multinational hail, actively repress the working class in order to keep labor cheap, subservient, and with little opportunity to move up.   

Again, this is the problem with multinational corporations.  They are not just businesses that invest in more than one country.  They have become global forces that shape huge sectors of the economy, influence government policies, and keep many less developed nations from growing.       ",,hrelding,0,0,,1426233054,0

To grossly oversimplify, severely decreased infant mortality and death due to disease means less people are dealing with or ""used to"" people dying. With the increased life span society and people put a higher value on human life, stricter laws against murder, closing loopholes of when it's okay to kill people (atheist, not virgin at wedding, because they're gay), plus better law enforcement and monitoring, etc. - all of which equates to less people killing each other. 
 
Larger countries (and things like the U.N. and European Union) mean there aren't a lot of small territories or countries fighting each other for resources/expansion constantly. There aren't a dozen different tribes in New York fighting each other for resources. People in Queens aren't at war with people in Manhattan over hunting/fishing/mineral rights. 
 
Also, nuclear weapons pretty much guarantees we won't have another country attempting to take over all of Europe by military force.

(As a side note, I feel like I should mention that I've been dating someone now for around 2 months and so far she's blown me away with how amazing she is.)

Think about it from the potential bride's perspective.  Why is she putting herself online hoping some guy in the U.S. (or Canada or western Europe) will marry her?  I tend to think she might just be looking for an easy way into the country.  The fact that you have money and a house is going to be very attractive, because she knows in a few years she'll have half of it for herself.

The women I've met (all Russian) who did this all barely spoke English when they came here.  How could they know someone enough to want to marry him when he couldn't speak Russian and she couldn't speak his language, either?  The answer is she doesn't want or care about your personality.  And no offense....but if she's hot you have to ask yourself if a woman who looked like that in the U.S. would date you.  If she's waaaayyyy better looking than you, you're kind of just doing a trade: you get to screw her a couple times, then she gets to screw you (out of your assets).  

I tend to think this way based on those women I've met.  I know at least some of them stopped having sex with their husband after a few times.  All of their husbands were guys who would have had a hard time finding a GF in the U.S.  I have heard of mail order brides getting out of prenups, too, saying they didn't understand English or our legal system when they signed it.

I think there's a big difference between the BNP getting a seat and getting in power. I'd never support those muppets getting in power, but I don't support the current or blue-flavoured muppets either. Bizarrely, both muppet groups have caused more damage than the BNP has done to date but then again you wouldn't want them anywhere near real political power.

I guess there's really two things that I'd find interesting with BNP MPs. Firstly, because the establishment hates them so much they have no real connections to it but as they'd be afforded the same rights as any other MP they would be free to investigate and expose things that other parties wouldn't want to due to complicity. They have alluded to this being a major part of what they want to do in the EU parliament, but I guess we should judge them by their actions rather than words.

The second part that's interesting is the impact that a BNP presence would have on electoral reform. All of the other major and minor parties would be desperate to do something, anything to make sure the BNP don't get back in and certainly don't increase their seats. I don't support the BNP or their policies, they're stupid moonbats from some sort of parallel universe but I can see them acting as a bigger catalyst for reform than a big Green, UKIP or Lib Dem gain (short of Lib Dem becoming kingmakers).

There is a final bit as well, it seems that on reddit (and off) there are a lot of people who go around calling people fascist or racist if they're not anti-BNP enough. My personal experience of dealing with members of the UAF was quite chilling. I think a BNP MP would give people the opportunity not just to see what the BNP are really like (which I would expect to be bizarre, ridiculous, stupid and as effective as George Galloway) but also to see how ludicrous some of the anti-fascist fascists are.",,bowling4meth,0,0,,1426233101,0

Take a look at http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com .  That group has a lot of people that can point you towards books and ideas.

I think that socialism (especially global socialism) is a loaded word without a lot of constructive meaning behind it.  I think we do need to apply science and technology towards engineering our culture and and creating a sustainable society with relatively fair distribution of resources and sane decision-making.

I believe that money and capitalism have been proven to be a cause of terrible amounts of suffering and inequality.

Here are a few of the points made by Jacque Fresco:

The roles of people in a monetary system are basically broken into three distinctions:
The Employee, The Consumer, The Employer (or Owner/Producer)


There is also the Investor who gives fiscal support to an Employer/Owner/Producer, or trades in the Financial markets for
gain. This isn’t relevant to the context for an investor is not required to exist in order for the market system to operate.
The Employee performs tasks for the Employer in exchange for a “Wage” or monetary payment,
while the employer sells a good or service to the Consumer for a “Profit”- another classification of
monetary payment.

In turn, both the Employer and Employee function as Consumers, for the monetary payments
(“wages” and “profits”) they obtain are used to purchase goods and services relevant to their survival.
The act of purchasing goods and services, which is the role of the Consumer, is what allows the
Employer to make its “Profit”, while also enabling the payment of the Employee’s “Wage”.
In other words, it is the requirement of perpetual ‘Consumption’ that keeps the Employer in business
and maintains the Employee’s job.

Now, it is important to understand that this payment-consumption cycle (or ‘cyclical consumption’)
cannot stop, or the entire economic structure would collapse, for money would not come to the
Employer, the Employer would not be able to afford to pay his Employee, and both the Employer
and Employee would not be able to perpetuate the cycle by being a Consumer.

In Monetary Economics, the notion of “Supply and Demand” is a well-known construct, simply
denoting that ‘the more there is of something, the less it is worth in respect to itself’’. For example,
drinking water was historically a very abundant resource, which didn’t typically require payment for
its consumption in a commercial sense. However, as pollution of the water table and city water
systems have developed, filtered drinking water is now being commercially sold, often at a higher
price than oil per gallon. In other words, it is profitable for resources to be scarce. If a company can
convince the public that their product is “rare”, the more they can charge for that product. This
provides a strong motivation to keep their items scarce. On yet another level, it should be pointed out
that the central banks of nearly all countries also create scarcity within the money supply itself in
order to keep pressure on the market system. Bernard Lietaer, designer of the EU currency system
points out:

“Greed and Competition are not the result of immutable human temperament…greed and fear of scarcity are in fact
being continuously created and amplified as a direct result of the kind of money we are using…We can produce more
than enough food to feed everybody…but there is clearly not enough money to pay for it all. The scarcity is in our
national currencies. In fact, the job of the central banks is to create and maintain that currency scarcity. The direct
consequence is that we have to fight with each other in order to survive.”4
The ramifications of this abundance of scarcity are nothing but detrimental. If profit can be made as a
result of scarcity generated by environmental pollution, then this creates a sick reinforcement of
indifference to environmental concern. If companies know they can make more money by having
their resources or products remain scarce, how can a world of abundance ever occur? It can’t, for the
corporation will be motivated to create the scarcity if need be. In turn, the scarcity created in the
money supply itself by the central banks compounds the motivation for us to compete with each
other, generating an ethic-less, primitive tribalism with everyone out for themselves, producing
human stress, conflict and illness.

The laws between states vary as much as laws between nations in the European Union. A comparison between a nation and the whole of USA just doesn't work, you have to compare a state to a nation. For example, the state where this shooting happened has gun control laws that rival British gun control laws. Those laws didn't prevent this shooting.

Also do you have a plummeting violent crime rate? 

We do in pretty much every state of the USA. But not in DC which had a major increase of crime ever since it banned handguns.

Other nations with gun laws as loose as ours also tend not to get someone shooting up schools, malls, offices &amp;. every few months.

It isn't about guns, it is about culture. This is why comparing one nation to another is not a perfect comparison.

For example, both Japan and Britain have strong gun control, yet the crime rates are extremely different. 

This is also why comparing the British strong knife/sword control laws to Japan's loose knife/sword control laws, is not a very good comparison.

This might have something to do with the crowd (mostly grad students), but there seems to be a big element of social status/positioning in choosing a beer. It's like what music you like-- there's a cachet to liking more inaccessible smaller bands/microbrews, and to liking something fewer people know well.

I like nice beer. And yes, Americans do serve their beer way too cold for my tastes. And they don't do a nice cask conditioned ale. Despite the profusion of microbrews, American beer is not great.

Maybe I am wrong and overgeneralising about beer on this point, but I don't find it to be quite such a social/positional good in the EU as here. People really seem to go out of their way here to make clear that they are 'beer snobs' (a term I've never heard used in the UK, by the way).

There are people like this in the UK of course (see the 'campaign for real ale'), but they are sort of mocked.",,[deleted],0,0,,1426233164,0

This article is complete self-serving elitist trash.  I don't say that because I'm a bleeding-heart Liberal, I say it because if someone turned in something like this to me they would get a failing grade for poor academic quality.

Lets outline a few problems:

1. Human intelligence is largely hereditary.
No sources more recent than 17 years ago.  This is a huge problem when dealing with the sciences especially.  This first claim is not adequately proven, although it may be true.

2. Civilization depends totally upon innate intelligence.
His proofs here can pretty clearly demonstrate the errors in thinking that are spread by racism.  His argument is contingent on the idea that the races of the world have their own unique IQ levels that accurately predict their economic success.  As proof he shows that Africans live in less civilized conditions as a result of being a less intelligent race.  He does not account for the fact that during the middle ages Africa had more advanced civilizations than Europe, or for the fact that, until WWII, Japan lived under a brutal dictatorship.  Unless the IQ of these nations has varied wildly to match their historical circumstances, and by a wide enough margain to explain such major events, he is full of shit.
3. The higher the level of civilization, the better off the population.  This is basically a pointless section.  The nebulous definition of civilization is always synonymous with being better off, whatever form that takes.
4. At the present time, we are evolving to become less intelligent with each new generation.  This is where the flaws in IQ measurement shine.  He lists a change in IQ over the last century of 3.2 points.  He comes to this conclusion by taking a single measured instance of IQ drift and multiplying it by 9, assuming identical performance over the last CENTURY.  The margin of error on that is so overwhelming
 as to make the number useless.  The number 3.2 points per century is hardly startling since the standard deviation of an IQ score is 15-16 points, meaning that IQ over measured history, including 8 extra generations of unmeasured history extrapolated for his interest, is functionally unchanged.  This is pathetic.

Skipping down to the end, the retardation study is not what we are talking about at all.  I think we all agree that severe mental retardation stemming from genetic defects, as opposed to IQ that is lower by less than one standard deviation, is heritable in a very direct and noticeable way.  It is very poor practice to equivocate mental retardation with a slightly lower IQ. (not to mention the extremely old study)

Please move on people, there are much better defenses of Eugenics, some of which even have a point, but this is not one of them.",,Diabolico,0,0,,1426233178,0

“I see in the near future a crisis approaching. It unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country … the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.” — Abraham Lincoln, just after the passage of the National Banking Act of 1863

About John Maragoudakis Fair, (F)
A totally limp, dirty, and very well used note. Large pieces may be half torn off or missing besides the defects mentioned under the Good category. Tears will be larger, obscured portions of the note will be bigger.

# First, we must remember that all clients are people. Each individuals has different expectations, and as dealers we must tailor every sales opportunity to custom fit that person’s needs. Dwight Macdonald, the author and educator, said “…conversation means being able to disagree and still continue the discussion…”. We all must remember it is not necessary to get a client to agree – we should only want to gauge how to satisfy their unique needs and wants. Not only listen to the words and meaning in their voice; but also assess their emotions. Any customer that feels you completely understand them will return repeatedly, an remain satisfied.

I never said anything about tax cuts not having the potential to increase revenue. However, to think that we could solve our financial situation with tax cuts AFTER bloating government to the size it is now is just wish-thinking. One of two things has to happen at this point... either we cut programs and cut taxes, allowing us to start paying down debt, or we keep most (but not all) our programs and raise taxes to European levels, allowing us to start paying down debt.

Although many Republicans fail to make this connection, war spending IS a government program, just like everything else... and the one most ripe to siphoned off in order to curtail debt.

There is, of course, the third option... which is to take some half-assed measure and watch out country (and our currency) spiral into oblivion.

I reiterate, believing that cutting taxes will help in any meaningful way at this point is as useless as bailing water out of a sinking ship with a fork.

&gt; The contracts awarded in two auctions, which pay a per-barrel fee for development work rather than granting a share in the production itself, will cost the companies a total of about $100 billion to develop deposits

and

&gt; A group led by BP, which vies with Shell as Europe's largest oil company, will receive $2 billion per year in fees to develop the Rumaila field. A Shell-led group will get $913 million and a group led by Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, will receive $1.6 billion per year.

Please to be explaining, for I am slow. This means it will take the companies 20-25 years to recoup the initial cost to ""develop deposits"" (not sure what that means). Am I cynical in thinking the companies and their financiers are not in it for 0% ROI over 20+ years?

Further down the article, I see

&gt; The amount of work needed on the contracts means the oil companies can afford to wait for a new government to form and consolidate its power before pressing for fresh production or exploration contracts.

and

&gt; Winning contracts to explore undiscovered and untapped deposits under more favorable terms is a long-term goal for producers operating in Iraq, said two officials with oil companies that won contracts last year.

&gt; Western producers haven't had access to oil fields in southern Iraq since 1972

Here's another story.  In the summer we were on a break, but we decided we would use this time to be introspective and grow.  Now, I happened to be off in Europe studying, and one weekend I took a trip to Dublin.  Long story short, I met a cute girl, and we flirted at the bar, and that was it.  Honest to God.  I didn't divulge that to the girlfriend at first, but at some point it slipped out, and the current situation is like a replay of that one.  She stopped speaking to me for a week (and I likewise), and I was convinced our relationship was done.  A week later she calls me and tells me that she slept with someone else (which I had guessed by that point), but didn't feel right and wanted to work things out with me.  Obviously I was hurt, but I appreciated the honesty, told her that I would get over it and we could try to repair things.  Yeah, a lot of people (myself included) think that's indicative of a lack of spine (and testicles), but I really believed that it was my actions that drove her to that, and I put the blame on myself.  And, you know, things were better for quite a while.  But know we are here, and like I said, it feels like a replay.  Until last night, I had let the sleeping with the other guy go.  I never brought it up, never used it in an argument.  But when she tears a strip off me for having a tiny crush on her friend, it just made me boil inside.  

I'm fairly sure if we split, she'll be back in short order, but I won't be taking her back this time.  A part of me still wants to fight for this, because she's got a lot of good in her, and because she has taught me a lot.  I just don't know anymore...",,throwaaway,0,0,,1426233258,0

Take 1848: revolutions occurred in about 10 states in Europe. But it didn't take in Britain (unless you include a failed rising by the Young Irelanders). 
I think this was because protest was permitted to an extent that wasn't allowed in other states. Protest was allowed in some forms because it was recognised as being necessary in order to keep people under control.

When people rose up and demanded reform then steps were taken in some way to address this - even if these steps were only intended to fob-off the people. There was less 'give' in other states; uprisings in those states, when they came, tended to be more bloody and definite. ie: The king lost his head.  

I also think that the class system in England has always been subject to a certain amount of romanticisation. ""Cry God for Harry, England, and Saint George!""

After breaking her out of jail (in a delightfully Quagmire-heavy sequence) the family goes into hiding in Asiantown - a pastiche of various ethnic neighborhoods. Lois stresses the importance of integrating into Asiantown and Peter agrees, saying they should do nothing to stand out as outsiders. He immediately turns to a man wearing a suit and glasses and says ""Oh my God, it's Jackie Chan!"" He proceeds to make this mistake again until Jackie Chan actually appears. He is quite amiable, but mistakes Peter and then Chris for Ethan Hawke. When Meg appears, he cries with the same glee ""Oh my God, it's Malcom in Middle."" While Meg insists she is not a boy, Chan offers a stern rebuke that she indeed is.

The humor in this situation - and presumably the one described by iorgfelkd - is derived from a perceived inability of members of one ethnic group to distinguish members of another and a subversion of the common narrative that this is especially prevalent among people of European descent.

[In 1999, Dr. Arpad Pusztai, the world’s top GMO safety researcher at the prestigious Rowett Institute in Scotland was working on a UK government grant to design long-term testing protocols intended to become part of the official European GM food safety assessment process. When Pusztai fed supposedly harmless GMOs to rats, they developed potentially pre-cancerous cell growth, smaller brains, livers and testicles, partially atrophied livers, and showed signs of a damaged immune system. Moreover, the results clearly indicated that the cause of the problem was due to the unpredictable side effects arising from the process of genetic engineering itself. In other words, his study suggested that the GM foods already on the market, which were created from the same process, might also create such effects. When Dr Pusztai expressed his concern he was fired from his job of 35 years and silenced with threats of a lawsuit. His 20-member research team was disbanded, all testing protocols were abandoned, and the pro-GM establishment embarked on an extensive disinformation campaign to discredit the study’s results to protect the reputation of GM foods already in the marketplace.](http://www.seedsofdeception.com/GMFree/CampaignforHealthierEatinginAmerica/HealthRisks/index.cfm?)",,[deleted],0,0,,1426233323,0

I never even mentioned their racism, let alone trivialised it. I asked you to explain why it is appaling in the form of a constructive argument rather than just going durp durp racism which is what your subsequent comment essentially is when it's not trying to paint me as a racist.

Your references to skinheads shows that you know little if anything of what the modern BNP is.

They're nutters, loons and morons through and through, but your paranoid fear of them does them more benefit than harm.

Your talking about large numbers of non-white and gay communities feeling threatened is garbage. Are non-white and gay communities feeling threatened in the MEP constituencies? No. Have the BNP been pushing sinister policies in the EU? No. They wouldn't dare try it in parliament because they have to try and preserve the facade that if they got in power they wouldn't go even more mental than they already are and anything they did push would bevoted down in parliament because the other parties will club together to block anything the BNP want.

Why did you pick non-white/gay communities? Is it impossible for white people not to like the BNP, or for Heterosexual people not to like the BNP? Do you live in a non-white/gay community? Are you non-white/gay? Do you have to tick these boxes in order to hold any view on the matter? Are Jews non-white? What about the Poles? Won't someone think of the Lesbians and Transgendered?

Why are you so scared of the BNP? A BNP seat isn't going to suddenly turn the UK into Nazi Germany. On the other hand a BNP seat will galvanise parliament to act on electoral reform to avoid them getting any further, something that is surely needed. Even in the distinctly possible scenario that the BNP don't get a seat at all an increase in votes for the BNP in constituencies will scare some parties at least at the local level and will encourage more people to vote in the next election.",,bowling4meth,0,0,,1426233325,0

Or how about my misogynistic ex boss who only hired women and required us to wear heels despite it being a blatant L&amp;I violation and would call you a stupid bitch if he thought that you made a mistake and send girls home for not wearing enough makeup.

I had another boss who would make the service staff pay for any tabs that people walked out on. Left me paying for an $100 bill once when two well to do looking gentlemen in business suits and ties walked out on a bottle of wine. After that I got payment up front, for everything, even restaurant diners, if you wanted to order a meal I had to get a credit card from you to put your order in.

Er? 

From wikipedia:

&gt;The North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream, along with similar warm air currents, helps keep Ireland and the western coast of Great Britain a couple of degrees warmer than the east.[23] However, the difference is most dramatic in the western coastal islands of Scotland.[24] A noticeable effect of the Gulf Stream and the strong westerly winds (driven by the warm water of the Gulf Stream) on Europe occurs along the Norwegian coast.[4] Northern parts of Norway lie close to the Arctic zone, most of which is covered with ice and snow in winter. However, almost all of Norway's coast remains free of ice and snow throughout the year.[25] Weather systems warmed by the Gulf Stream drift into Northern Europe, also warming the climate behind the Scandinavian mountains.

Norway, Scotland and Ireland are not ""pretty much all of Europe.""

Also, there is a lot of geothermal warming of the ocean around Iceland, and that warmth travels on up north of Europe, making the waters around several Russian mining islands navigable. Or so I'm told.",,The_Yeti,0,0,,1426233405,0

I did not think about the geothermal warming at all. To be honest, I wouldn't even know how it would effect everything. I do know that the warmer waters around Iceland are definitely pushed by the gulf stream so if the gulf stream ceased, it is very likely that those waters would no longer be part of any current and would instead just warm local waters instead of the surrounding areas, thus freezing those mining islands right up.

It's only affected me in that college was paid for so I'm debt free.  That was nice.  The having nice stuff isn't really that cool anymore.

&gt; What does it take to actually get your company public?

This is a long answer that has been answered below.

&gt; How smart are executives?

Answered below.

&gt;  What do you look for in a board member and what do they do for you?

This was interesting to me.  We all know companies and how they work.  You have departments that specialize in certain things and that VP is good at that thing plus managing.  It's pretty simple.  Board of directors was something new to me.  On the outside it just looks like a bunch of old guys that are old money and are on the board at many other companies.  It turns out that these people are where they are now because of where they have been.  They really are hot stuff.  They are great thinkers who are well connected and have an amazing wide array of experience.  (One on this board is Yale Skull and Bones I think)

&gt;  How is the public's perception different than reality?

I don't know why I wrote this.  There are a million things I want to say here.  Much of what I see in the news is funny to me.  Some of these executives need body guards and $500k nanny budgets, etc.  I'm from a relatively small town.  These guys pump their own gas just like everyone else.  I would answer the house line when I was a kid and the man calling is now worth more than many *rich* people that you know combined.  (Richard Branson + Donald Trump + whomever is still less than the CEO's networth.)

So when people like Kenneth Lay@Enron, Gonzalez@Countrywide, AIG, Madoff, etc get out there and talk about how hard it is to be normal I laugh my ass off.

Very moving, the content of your thoughts are very accurate, although I do not believe that most people are ""sheep"", I believe the masses know there is something wrong, but just don't know exactly what it is, and don't know what to do about it. As William Blake once said, *""Truth cannot be told, so as to be understood, and not be believed.""*, and the more recent, more contemporary derivation from Terence McKenna, *""If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.""*

I would like to propose that, instead of ranting to the choir, or resorting to cut-and-run, as you indicated that you would like to do, we actually take a few steps toward bridging the gap between where the world is today and where it should be. I know what you're thinking: ""Easier said than done"", right? But all great movements start with just a few people doing a few things to show the masses the right path; the masses will take care of the rest. We have more than a few great minds and voices in our little community here, why not make this the leaping point for the change that is needed by this country, and in turn, the rest of the free world.

Our founding fathers were wise men, they realized that there would be crooked politicians, trying to sell away the freedoms, whether for money, power, or status, and they set up a system that was designed to see these *traitorous* men fail. Well, those men have begun their bid at disassembly of that system, and most of us are seeing it, understanding it, but just letting it happen; we feel that we do not have the power to stop what seems like a train barreling toward a cliff. Maybe we can't. But I'll be damned if I'm not going to throw myself on the tracks trying. How far will this charade of democracy have to go before *you* decide to act? How many of our rights will have sold to the highest bidder before you say, ""Enough""? How many occupations of the Middle East for the sake of the oil industry, how many innocent Americans who believe they are fighting for a worthy cause have to die a pointless death, how many genocides do we have to watch while our ineffective, semi-corrupt Congress sits on their hands and pretend nothing is happening?

I love America, this country represents more than the sum of the land, the people, the buildings, and the culture; it represents something that's beyond words, an ever-changing amalgam of expression of free-thought, hope that the people can guide their own destiny, and that, no matter how bad things get, we can always correct our path.

Now on to the meat of my post: **We need a plan.** A plan to save America from the status quo. A plan to put us back on top as the embodiment of philosophical reason implemented in government. As with all great projects, this one will begin with the gathering and discussion of ideas.

don't we have really high quality weapons here? And our tech is pretty good, right? If a war-type environment does happen, i'd have to bet pretty heavily on the United States. Nobody wants to worry about nuclear conflict, so we just have a bunch of small wars. I mean, everyone is entitled to make a living. Even oil executives and others. And who are these other countries to come down on us. I feel like many countries, perhaps even 3rd world countries  rely on business in some way, shape, or form.  If we protect these principals, and make sure everyone continues to make money, and **consume less and figure out a way to safely get rid of the by-products of fossil fuels** then everyone wins. So in the case of a war, the united states is the best bet. 

And my money is still on ""nobody is gonna do nothin"" and corporations can be trusted to lead this country into a better position. They haven't so far, but they definitely have the funding required for scientific research which will make our lives easier. History **can** repeat itself but it doesn't mean it has to. We are so close, and we're encouraging greener energy every day. Cloning and stem cell research is on-going. Space travel, while being in it's infancy, is a pretty safe bet (although im too lazy to cite sources) to believe that we can rely on the brilliant minds behind the process.

Our future and the economy will be harder, but not totally unconquerable if you don't choose a corporation to side with. A faction to join. One that can destroy you with many weapons. And ultimately won't because they seek to make money first and keep the global economy going.

Remember folks- the world is a pretty gangsta affair (running it anyways) and you're either with one money making competitive asshole, or your with someone else.

As someone who's spent the better part of the last decade living in and traveling between both on a regular basis (as well as traveling elsewhere in the EU), I figure I may add my 0.02 USD / 0.0132 GBP:

&gt; Do you see us any differently to other European countries?

Yes.  You seem to be more ""American"" than some of your peers.  You also seem to take a dimmer view of civil liberties than... well... than most other ""modern first-world nations"" (mind the quotes...)

&gt; Do you all actually think we're a tiny, weak country, or is that just the over-patriotic 'Hurr hurr America is no. 1' arseholes who claim that 'We're your bitch'.

In terms of military strength?  Well that's like comparing a guy who works out, eats right, and is in good shape to a steroid-addled, muscle-bound 'bro' (translation: more casual, US version of a uni-aged yah) who gets into nightly bar-fights just to ""kick ass"".  Sure, one's stronger than the other -- but he's still a colossal prick who makes use of his strength to compensate for a lack of maturity, foresight, and social grace.

Nation-wide, I'm ashamed to say that the majority of people probably hold a variation of that view (i.e. the ""America is the best at everything"" nonsense) -- but I'm not so pessimistic as to think it a vast majority... at least not yet.  Give it time though: our primary schools are no better than yours, so I fear it's only a matter of time before the rising generation's notion of the world ceases to have any basis in reality...

&gt; And where does the bad teeth thing come from? Someone told me it's because Americans get more funding on dental work but I'm unsure.

That's pretty much it.  We [Americans] seem to value perfect teeth more, thus our basis for comparison is skewed by the vast number of young adults whose childhood visits to the orthodontists have given them unnaturally-straight teeth.

&gt; Do you Americans have 'sunday dinner' or 'Roast dinner' once a week, you know, meat, veg and mashed potatoes or is that a primarily english thing?

Area-dependent.  I grew up on the east coast: in a couple southern states for the first part of my childhood, and New England (northern states) for most of my teenage years.

Cool. the Asian dude is Canadian and the Latino gal is from the Southwestern USA. I can already tell they speak fluent English so it is safe to assume they grew up in North America and now that I know the region they are from, I have a little perspective about their background.

By asking them where their parents and grandparents from, what does it get me? So I found out that the Asian guy is actually 3rd generation Korean-Canadian and the Latino gal is 2nd generation Bolivian, does it really tell me anything when as far as I'm concerned they are really Canadian / American? Like the author of the article said, the people who ask her end up asking if she ""ever goes back to visit""? She is freaking British! Go back to visit Iran? Wha?

I understand that for the most part, many European countries are much more homogenous compared to North America. People there often equate ethnicity and nationality as the same thing. People here have a better grasp of the fact that they are very diffent things, and it just happen that for most people, they are the same. It PERSONALLY (I don't claim to speak for others bothers me when Europeans like to wave their superiority complex over use North Americans, yet when it comes to this sort of thing, they are not as developed as we are since both US and Canada are counties founded by immigrants.

Then there is the whole European racism thing. I hate for them to pigeonhole me into a specific Asian ethnicity because once they do, the stereotypes comes out. They generelly don't mean anything bad by it, but since I grew up here I'm used to not deal with a lot of it.

The difference between the Warsaw Ghetto and Gaza is so vast it is almost undignifying to have to explain them to someone.. but I guess if you've been THAT heavily indoctrinated by left-o-nazi propaganda...  you might need a basic history / reality check:

- The Jews never engaged in any acts of violent Jihad or recidivist terrorism against the Europeans which caused them to be walled off.

- The Jews never kidnapped soliders, held them in secret dungeons in violation of the Geneva conventions - and demanded than hundreds of convicted terrorist murders be exchanged for their release.

- The Jews were never offered any sort of peace offer from the Nazis, and did not repeatedly reject sincere peace negotiations for over 60 years.

- The Jews did not have a charter that officially called for the dectruction of Germany or Austria.

- The Nazis never once backed out of Jewish lands, in hopes of peace.... only to find Jewish aggression hugely ecsalate (like Palestinian terrorism increases every time Israel signs Oslo accords or ""ends the occupation"" in Gaza, etc.)

- The Jews never launched more than 8,000 mortars or rockets into neighboring civiliian territory, to provoke further war with the Germans.

- **No Jew has ever blown himself up at a German restaurant**. Our religion,  culture and the values we teach our kids are very different from that the ""Palestinians"" teach theirs. 


by the way...

The word ""Nazi"" - while over used and frequently abused - has an actual dictonary meaning. It means a member of the German Socialist Worker's Party, or a member of a similar organization. The closest thing to the Nazi's culture of Marxist envy and violently passionate anti-semitism in the planet is Hamas and Fatah / PLO. The Palestinians sided with Hitler during WWII, the first Palestinian leader visited Hitler and checked out Auschwitch with Himmler, etc... and made plans for stage 2 of the Holocaust in the M.E.

A ""Palestinian"" state .. like the buding terrorist state in Gaza... is as close of a thing, in terms of cultural/ philosophical /  emotional similatiry...  to a Nazi state as you can possibly get. I hope the Palestinians can heal themselves and plan a brighter future for themselves, rather than one of war and destruction. They will probably have to hit rock bottom first, before they will have the courage to stop lying and choose life over death and jihad.

The basic trolley problem can be recast in terms of the recent economic crisis, for example.  Greece is currently in the throes of bankruptcy.  It also happens to be part of the European Economic Union.  The premise of the Union is such that one could argue that they're obligated to do something to keep Greece from going under.  However, because the European economic situation in general is in such a tenuous position, doing so might do serious harm to the economies of other nations within the Union.  The questions is, should the Union make a concerted effort to bail Greece out and risk harming other nations, or should the Union protect its other members knowing full well that doing so is guaranteed to doom the Greek people to massive unemployment, deprivation, and hardship.

While driving the car back to campus, the engine ""threw a rod"" (or something) and he ends up stuck on the side of a country road in Northern Washington.  He waited for an hour and nobody drove by.  It was getting dark and he could see a light in the distance, so he figured he'd borrow a phone (likely to call me).  After walking towards the light awhile, he realized the road he was on curved off and didn't lead to that light, so he had to trek through the forest a bit.  Apparently, he was a half-mile or so into this forest when he loses sight of the light, can't figure out which way is back, and is basically lost.  Right about then he finds a bench.  A bench sitting in the middle of the forest.  No cliff, or view, or trail.  Just a bench.  He kept moving but ended up back at the bench - proof that he was lost.  So, he decided to wait until morning sleeping on the bench.  He spent the remaining light staring at a phone number someone had carved into the bench.  The next morning, it's light out so he can't see the light he followed the night before, so heads back towards the car, and finds the road he was on before.  When he gets to the car, a cop is there.  My buddy explains what happened to the cop - and it turns out the cop knows the people that sold him the car.  He drives my buddy back to their place, and tells them what happens.  Ok, so this is where it gets cool: First: The people were completely embarrassed the car broke down so quick, and gave him a truck that only had 55K miles on it, (apparently, they were REALLY embarrassed to have the cop know they sold that car, but that's a story I'm not privy to.)  It was old but it still runs today, (another buddy of mine still has it.)  Second, he dialed the phone number (he had plenty of time to memorize) on the bench, and reached a answering machine with an old lady's voice on it.  He thanked her for ""the bench in the middle of the forest"" since he slept on it, and left his name and number in case she wanted to call back so he could thank her personally.  A week (or something) later, a girl calls to say this was the last message on her Grandmother's machine (she died), and wonders why her Grandmother's phone number was on a bench in the middle of the forest.  He offered to take her to it to show her, and she accepted.  (I wasn't in that weird ass phone conversation, so I don't know exactly what was said).  In his newish truck he drove down to what turned out to be the house with the light, met a beautiful Scandinavian woman, and flirting the whole way took her to the bench.  It was a quick hike from the house to the bench.  Turns out the bench was made by her Grandfather, as he did woodwork, but nobody in the family had ever heard of him making a bench.  She probably thought it was sweet to find a bench her Grandfather made.  It's probably why she agreed to go out with him.  A few weeks later, he's back at the Grandmother's house helping his new Scandinavian girlfriend move stuff out to be sold/stored/thrown away.  He finds a picture of the old people sitting lovingly on the bench (but the bench is on the porch - same bench though) and made sure to set it aside.  The next week he had to head out to that county again to fill out paperwork over the broken and now abandoned car he originally bought.  Sitting in some government office up there, he had to wait an hour with a really friendly Arabic dude for the single official who worked there to return from lunch.  They became fast friends, and made sure to keep in touch.  Fast forward to the present (because I just realized this story will take forever if I don't).  He married the Scandinavian (she announced at the wedding that it was when he handed her the picture of her grandparents on the bench - beautifully framed - that she fell in love with him), they have a new baby girl, and live in Spain working for some rich Saudi Prince that pays them to travel to his various houses in Europe and oversee his ""houses and investments"".  You guessed it - same dude from the waiting room.  So, he spend ~$500 on a car that didn't work, but ended up with a newish truck, a gorgeous wife (and baby), and a dream job.

1. Yes, I see the UK as being different from other European countries. But primarily, I see the UK as 4 separate entities bound together under the guise of political scope. 

It's my experience that most people in the USA hear UK and think ""England."" That drives me up the wall. Likewise, Brits (mostly English and some Scots that make the same assumption.)

I had the shittiest experience ever traveling to N. Ireland through Heathrow. That taught me more about how prejudice isn't based on skin colour than every cross-cultural/international relations course I ever had. (I'm a white, blonde, female.)
Other European countries, in my experience, have a sense of humor they're willing to share. 

2. Tiny? In terms of size? Yes. But who cares about size. This girl doesn't. 

Weak? Definitely not. One of my former section managers was a retired RAF sniper and is the most respectable badass I've ever met. (Hur Hurr USA assholes that think the USA is #1 are absolute minority retards. (*See Sarah Palin, please don't blame Alaska. Out of gratitude, I won't hold anyone personally responsible for Gordon Brown.)

3. Having lived and worked with people from the UK and Americans I'd summarily say that those with little to no travel experience tend overwhelmingly to judge each other based on their knowledge/experience with known popular culture. (Americans like to reference a lot of Hugh Grant/BBC/Beatles/Royal Family/Top Gear which can be understandably irritating. Americans overwhelmingly feel the same when people from the UK bring up George Bush 2 (If we're in a position to be talking to you it's doubtful we voted for him. Feel free to confirm this and you have my permission to smack anyone who answers to the contrary.) Texas. Most people from the US think of Texas the way Brits think about the Falkland Islands. We're not from there (apologies to all engineers who are working there, I am not including you in this category) and during and post-Bush most of us are pretty ticked we didn't lost it in the Mexican-American War.

4. Within the USA borders few if any jokes about the UK are told, and people from the UK are generally held in high esteem. (Irish people are held in particularly high esteem in parts of the U.S. If you claim to be Irish you up your chances of getting a drink on the house by about 2000%. No joke. Kind of like being american and claiming to be Canadian when traveling, no drinks, but a lot less hassle.)
Bad teeth? Yah, but you're not alone. If you make it out of North America it's easy to see that good teeth/orthodontics are a serious minority value.

5. Sunday Dinner? My family did, but none of my friends families did. It's a case by case kind of thing I think.

-As a sidenote, the biggest irritation I encounter with the UK is when someone from there assumes they know everything (or really anything) about me because I'm ""from America."" (and further, that means I'm from either Texas or Miami.  I'm from Portland, Oregon. WTF??? That's like me assuming Dara O'Brian is from Essex. Just ask me where I'm from and what it's like (or how it's different from the parts of America you know.) (To be fair, people from the US pull this crap on people from the UK too, ""Oh, you're from Manchester? Is that in Western Australia or Eastern? I'm really, really sorry about that and I will step in whenever I can.)

This is obvious. When a new tree grows, new things live in that tree. This, again, is obvious. But the environmentalist argument is that the new things that live in that tree are somehow less valid or important than the original things that lived in the tree. Most radicial environmentalist arguments depend on this idea: the original thing is the only thing that is valid, and the things that will eventually replace the original thing are less valid. Without declaring that the ""new thing"" isn't as good as the ""original thing"", then the idea of the morality of the situation, that we are in some way evil for destroying the ""original thing"", goes completely out the window.

This argument comes up several times in The Story of Stuff (http://www.storyofstuff.com/) where she repeatedly says something to the effect of ""in North America only 4% of the trees are original"". What are original trees? Trees that were here 200 years ago when Native Americans lived here? There are more trees today in the United States than there were when Europeans landed here. Are those trees in some way less ""tree-y""? Do they sustain less life than the ones that were already here? What makes an ""original tree"" more important than a, I assume, ""non-original tree""?

Take it further: what's the ""original"" eco-system? Before the ""original"" eco-system what was here? Something less important than what we believe is the ""original"" eco-system?

When we're gone is everything that is going to replace what we've done going to be considered ""unoriginal"" and less important? Or are ""unoriginal"" eco-systems and trees only created when humans, specifically humans, destroy something and something new takes its place? And only what we destroy is the ""original"" and what comes next is less important?

Again, to reference the ""Story of Stuff"" as the measuring stick for most environmentalist material (or propaganda, if you will), she repeatedly uses the phrase ""You cannot have a linear system on a finite planet."" What exactly is finite about the Earth? Trees grow back. The atmosphere sustains itself and will recover if, say, humans disappear overnight and all pollution ceases (and even if, by some fluke we destroy the atmosphere compeltely, it will eventually come back.) The only thing on the planet that is finite is... oil, and that's only finite in the sense that it takes longer than most humans, even Biblical humans, could ever live to generate more of. Eventually there will be more oil, and it will be formed out of our fossils.

And when that oil is formed out of our bones, the Earth will still be here. There will still be trees. There will still be things living in the trees. The trees will still be filtering carbon dioxide into oxygen and sustaining the atmosphere in some way. Will that Earth be the ""unoriginal Earth"" that is less valid than the ""original Earth"" we started on?

A lot of the environmentalist stance comes from this idea that we are ""harming"" the planet in some way. What are we harming? Even if we destroyed the entire environment the planet would still be here. It would eventually recover over the eons of time. The only thing that wouldn't recover is *us*. That is usually what environmentalists are really talking about: we're not destroying the planet, we're destroying *our ability to live on it*, but they're wrapping it in terms of ""save the planet"". They really should be saying ""save ourselves"". The planet doesn't need saving. It existed before us, and it will exist long after we're gone. Without this weird reference point of ""original trees"" or ""original Earth"", the whole ""humans are evil and we're killing the planet"" argument kind of goes right out the window.",,[deleted],0,0,,1426233548,0

The point is simple: that **the definition of ""basic health care"" will continually broaden to encompass virtually every *possible* condition, and every possible test and/or treatment.**

*And this will be especially true if the definition is left to those *directly involved* who also stand to directly benefit.)*

The only other option (to restricting care) is to hand over (yet another) ""blank check"".

They did that with [MediCare in 1966](http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=124090475) and that little ""oops"" has lived on... and on... and on...

Like it or not, ignore it at your peril -- but undefined terms like ""basic health care"" ARE literally ""blank checks"" that, far from ""controlling costs"" will allow indeed *cause* them to skyrocket out of control.

&gt;do you believe the right place to start this discussion is on edge cases like Munchausen's syndrome?

No, but I believe it is important to thoroughly understand that phrases like ""basic health care"" are essentially fraudulent.

Yes, I went to the ""extremes"" with Munchausen's (and likewise with hypochondria, the octomom, etc.) -- but I did so in an attempt to drive home the point that a line will, indeed MUST be established somewhere. (And I wasn't stretching [anywhere near as far](http://blogs.prideangel.com/post/2009/11/Women-who-cannot-carry-a-child-themselves---denied-NHS-fertility-treatment.aspx) as [you might think](http://carersblog.com/?p=4444).)

If you leave that definition until later... you're going to get stuck with even more ""oops"" unexpected consequences, and part of that will end up being political ""special interest"" exceptions and ""rationed"" inequalities.

&gt;I get that there are, like in any large system, paradoxes and difficult choices. The fact is, other countries have solved this and provide great examples (and good lessons in pitfalls to avoid!), while we have obviously not (or perhaps you believe all is well here?)

Actually other countries have NOT solved this problem. Canada's health care system has it's own problems. Britain's has others. The same with the European systems. None of them is anything near ""ideal"" (despite the bill of goods the Michael Moore sold you).

&gt;Your line about ""HE got the benefit and someone ELSE got stuck with the bill"" seems to indicate that you just don't ""get it"" -- they pay taxes and in return get the NHS services. 

You really ought to do a bit more research... the [NHS has a lot](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7379983/Hundreds-of-NHS-wards-to-be-shut-in-secret-plans.html) of [problems](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7256980/NHS-puts-targets-ahead-of-patients-reports-warned.html), growing [more and more](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4557221/Almost-half-of-maternity-wards-turn-away-woman-in-labour.html) extensive [all the time](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7175496/Steep-rise-in-complaints-against-GPs.html) (and as medicine advances, there will be no end to the problems... OR, as seems very likely is already happening the availability and standard of care will deteriorate).

*But hey, feel free to ignore all of that, and continue to pretend that only the US has problems.*

&gt;Sorta like you pay taxes and get a military, or pay taxes and get roads to drive on.

Actually I have taxes extracted from me out of duress, not to fund ""defense"" but to pay for a whole world of imperialistic military adventurism which I do not agree with, and which does not benefit me in the least.

And the taxes I have paid to maintain the roads... have been increasingly diverted to ""other"" uses.

&gt;Why should we believe systems which are successfully holding down costs and providing more-or-less great 1st-world healthcare to the residents of other countries won't work here? What's so special about our situation that an NHS-like approach wouldn't be a vast improvement on our current ""end-result?""

Now both of us are living a much simpler life where we eat real food, can walk around safely, not live in fear of a Fascist Government (for the time being) and are happy making real friends - not just the ones who never want to see you again as soon as you leave your job.

I've thought about it a lot.  The American people need to figure out a way to remove the power held so closely by those at the top.  It has to be done legally and with some delicacy.  The best (actually the only real) idea I came up with is to use the established mechanisms that are in place to manipulate the behavior of the Government and Corporations. 

My suggestion, for what it is worth, is to gather together a crack consumer advocacy group (aka lobbyists) who have no explicit agenda.  Ordinary people would buy shares in (or perhaps a subscription) this non-profit corporation.  In return, they would lobby for whatever shit was demanded of them and report back transparently to the members.

I know it sucks to have to pay $$$ but perhaps it could work given the US understands the power of lobby groups and Corporations.  Also, people in the US are accustomed that to get shit done they need to pay.  If the group eventually became powerful enough there is no reason why it couldn't actually become the Government.  If you think about it the idea of a Corporation running the country is inevitable in any case, so it might as well be ""our"" company.

Aside from that idea, well you could organize and protest - he he.  They will succeed in getting whoever happens to be in power to do the absolute minimum to shut them down - perhaps by placating them and perhaps by squashing them.

Just curious but seriously, when, in recent memory, did the US ever have a Government that you felt you could fully trust?  Not to mention that when we vote we only get to vote on a few core issues (War, Taxation, Abortion, Religion, Education and oh yeah.. Health Care).  These issues are so big nobody does shit about them once they get in.  The really important issues that affect us all on a daily basis are all the line items that the people never get asked about. Things that affect our freedom, liberty, check-book, security, honor and self-esteem.  Currently there is no effective way for ordinary people to have any meaningful effect on these very important line items.  That is why I am suggesting that for now at least, a ""people's lobby"" may be a good way to get started.

Not having actually been there, I think of the UK as being kind of like New England in the States (the name was aptly chosen, I suppose). More densely populated than most of America and lots of greenery and weather to go with the beautiful seasons, and of course, by the ocean. I feel like I *want* to feel more kinship with people of the UK, but I can't, because there are *so many* more people here that are from elsewhere that the colonial heritage and the associated feeling has been pretty cleanly swept away.

I do think of the UK as being relatively small, but not at all militarily weak, or even weak by reputation. I mean, we've been fed a steady diet of 007 over here and we eat that shit UP. I think we think that the UK, not unlike the rest of Europe, are slowly forgetting just how important we were to you in World War II. We chide you about how you would be speaking German and saluting the Kaiser and all that not to tell you we think you are weak but to remind you that we helped lift you up when you were down. 

I think we feel a lot like we have to compete with you because you have all the cool things that we miss, like oh, you know, a thousand years of culture and architecture and a real health care system and all that. We think your accent is way cooler than ours. We think your comedy is so smart and we look at ourselves and we specialize in lowbrow, so I think we have an inferiority complex a bit honestly. Which is why we secretly LOVE hearing stories about chavs and Prince Harry dressing up like a Nazi and anything that brings you down a peg. :)

But ultimately, we feel sad about those stories too, because it seems to us like the UK is changing in some pretty dramatic ways and it might end up going someplace we wouldn't want to see it go. Also we feel a bit of guilt and wonder if our ""contributions"" to Western ""culture"" (ie: gangsta whatever) aren't seeping into you over there and making your problems worse. But then Lady GaGa comes along and we kind of go ""hey man, we didn't have ANYTHING to do with that,"" and so it equals out.

Americans value their teeth above all else, and... no, I really don't know where the bad teeth thing came from. We have bad teeth people here too. My father-in-law comes to mind. 

We have breakfast, lunch and dinner (or supper, depending on where you're from) but it varies from family to family as to whether any particular night would be singled out to be special and/or have a particular meal on that night. So no, I don't think we have anything like that. We don't have tea time, either. We have very little in the way of formalities when it comes to food. As opposed to say, Thanksgiving, where pretty much everyone in the country is having turkey dinners will all the traditional acoutrements: cranberry sauce, stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc.

You are a male, probably somewhere around the age of 22-28 who has probably lived in Arkansas for most if not all of your life.  Educated, holds a programming related job and understands the fine line between responsibilities and everything else. Addicted to opiates for the last two years and is well acquainted with the chemistry/physiology behind recreational drugs.  The psychology of addiction is far from my area of expertise, but it sounds like the opiate use doesn't define you (it's not so much a ""high"" that you're chasing).  It's more like something that has become a part of your identity/daily life.  This, combined with the fact that you have a cat and quite possibly live with your mother, makes me think that you have a sense of security in your life at the moment; however, I sense a fear of the unknown boiling under the surface.  Sometimes staying in your comfort zone brings you happiness, but it will never bring you a sense of adventure. 

 You seem like a guy who is confident in what he knows (technology, programming, drugs) and tries not to be cocky in a conversation (""try"" is the operative word here).  I'm guessing you have more guy friends than female friends and that one day you'd love to go on a cross-country road trip.  Contained it what may be the urban bubble of society...the last thing you'd probably ever do (I'm going out on a limb here) is probably ski through the Swiss Alps or take three friends, drop everything for a month and go to Europe.  Instead of taking a camping trip (Yellowstone, Sequoia, the list goes on...) you'd probably be cool/chill with doing something local with friends (big game or bonfire maybe?)

All in all, you seem like you've done what many people never achieve: you've found the joy/goodness in the little things.  You don't walk around with a chip on your shoulder because life's too short.  If I could end on one note though...I'd look deeper into your opiate habit (not in a ""drugs are bad/unholy/life-ruiners"" kind of way)...I mean an introspective, ""what do I truly want and is this it?"" kind of way.

The reason this is kind of a big deal is because Turkey - a modernized, wealthy nation and a candidate for EU membership - fiercely refuses to own up to a genocide they committed less than a hundred years ago. Can you imagine Germany denying the systematic destruction of the Jews? Or if the Americans flat-out denied the systematic destruction of Native Americans or the atrocities in Vietnam on an official level? If all the major countries in the world adopt similar resolutions to this one, then it may put Turkey in a bad enough position that they will actually have honest discussions about this issue. A lot of nations already have. You know what happened the [last time a prominent member of the Turkish intelligentsia brought this up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk#Criminal_case)? The only reason his charges were dropped is because the case wasn't allowed to go on due to a technicality - after the EU stepped in and made indirect threats. 

Now, why it is important for a country to own up to its history - or rather, the impact of historical suppression on a national consciousness - is much too lengthy and complicated for me to go into. To vastly simplify: denial = arrogance &amp; nationalism vs admittance = humility &amp; self-reflection. And even though Turkey's not really in bloodlust mode right now, arrogance and nationalism will still be catalysts for violence and genocide down the line.

Also, if our lawmakers had even a shred of conscience, this would get passed in a matter of minutes, regardless of the administration's military and economic concerns. Believe me, this is no more a time waster than anything else they do.",,stopwatchingporn,0,0,,1426233587,0

Very moving, the content of your thoughts are very accurate, although I do not believe that most people are ""sheep"", I believe the masses know there is something wrong, but just don't know exactly what it is, and don't know what to do about it. As William Blake once said, *""Truth cannot be told, so as to be understood, and not be believed.""*, and the more recent, more contemporary derivation from Terence McKenna, *""If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.""*

I would like to propose that, instead of ranting to the choir, or resorting to cut-and-run, as you indicated that you would like to do, we actually take a few steps toward bridging the gap between where the world is today and where it should be. I know what you're thinking: ""Easier said than done"", right? But all great movements start with just a few people doing a few things to show the masses the right path; the masses will take care of the rest. We have more than a few great minds and voices in our little community here, why not make this the leaping point for the change that is needed by this country, and in turn, the rest of the free world.

Our founding fathers were wise men, they realized that there would be crooked politicians, trying to sell away the freedoms, whether for money, power, or status, and they set up a system that was designed to see these *traitorous* men fail. Well, those men have begun their bid at disassembly of that system, and most of us are seeing it, understanding it, but just letting it happen; we feel that we do not have the power to stop what seems like a train barreling toward a cliff. Maybe we can't. But I'll be damned if I'm not going to throw myself on the tracks trying. How far will this charade of democracy have to go before *you* decide to act? How many of our rights will have sold to the highest bidder before you say, ""Enough""? How many occupations of the Middle East for the sake of the oil industry, how many innocent Americans who believe they are fighting for a worthy cause have to die a pointless death, how many genocides do we have to watch while our ineffective, semi-corrupt Congress sits on their hands and pretend nothing is happening?

I love America, this country represents more than the sum of the land, the people, the buildings, and the culture; it represents something that's beyond words, an ever-changing amalgam of expression of free-thought, hope that the people can guide their own destiny, and that, no matter how bad things get, we can always correct our path.

Now on to the meat of my post: **We need a plan.** A plan to save America from the status quo. A plan to put us back on top as the embodiment of philosophical reason implemented in government. As with all great projects, this one will begin with the gathering and discussion of ideas. [I have created a post in which we can begin](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b9tus/what_philosophies_or_ideas_should_be_implemented/), but this will take more than just wishful thinking and hope. I invite everyone, long-time redditors, long-time lurkers, Americans, Europeans, [insert word for everyone other than Americans and Europeans here], minors, elderly... everyone, to add to this discussion, which I will use as a starting point for more posts on **Our Plan**. Future posts will include topics such as: Effective ways for implementing our ideas and ideals into government, preventing politicians from abusing powers, as well as troubleshooting more specific issues (Palestinian genocide, what actions, if any, should be taken to ensure peace in the Middle East, health-care reform/socialized health-care debate, etc.)

The general attitude towards Britain is positive, I would say.  Although it is a foreign country, the differences are easily digestible, and I think that's why so many Yanks travel to London/the UK on their first trip overseas.  

When we think of a stereotypical Brit we probably imagine an effete 'old Etonian' type with a 'posh' accent.  In general, we see your society as less brash and more erudite, secular, drunken, and Orwellian than our own.  We realize that your political spectrum is farther to the left than ours, and that you're burdened with more onerous taxes and regulations.  Many of us don't understand the EU or why you remain a member.  Also, we think it's very odd that you still have a monarchy.  We think you all have a dry, biting sense of humor and that you spend most of your waking hours out of the unceasing rain in the neighborhood pub.  We tend to find British accents curious and pleasant, although I don't think the Yorkshire/Northern variety is what we'd call a typical ""sexy British accent.""

To me, Britain possesses many Continental traits but overall I don't think of the country as European.  It has a unique identity and I guess in a sense it acts a bridge between North America and Western Europe in culture (and not just because of the common language.)  We do not simply share a language, but we share a common heritage, history, and customs.  Even though many of us have little to no British ancestry, we tell the same fairy tales to our children and sing the same nursery rhymes.  We share a common literature; for example we think of Shakespeare or the legend of King Arthur as our own.  American institutions tend to teach European history from an English perspective.  I think our similarities go far beyond the common tongue, although many of them maybe be due to this fact.  When we won our independence in the 1780s, the US was 93% English-speaking and of UK heritage.  Although we later received millions of other Europeans, the common culture which immigrants adopted and molded was descended from our English, Scots, and Irish roots.

I've (unscientifically) concluded that Americans are dental perfectionists unparalleled by most other nationalities; not sure why the UK gets singled out.

I've never had that perception.  Fuck, listen to Churchill's speech ( The ""we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be..."" one) sometime.  Look at WWII history... Brits are known for kicking ass in my book.  And look at James Bond as the stereotype of a Brit from the US perspective.  :-)

I grew up watching Doctor Who and listening to Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Def Leppard, Judas Priest, Deep Purple, etc., and generally developing a real fondness for the UK.

edit:

&gt; edit2: Do you Americans have 'sunday dinner' or 'Roast dinner' once a week, you know, meat, veg and mashed potatoes or is that a primarily english thing?

It depends.  The US is pretty big and heterogeneous, so it's hard to generalize.

IMHO the societies and moral ideas mentioned in the Bible were pretty typical for human beings, varying from the compassionate to the atrocious. 

IMHO, other societies have mostly been, broadly speaking, morally comparable. Post-Enlightenment Western society shows some progress, but is guilty of enough atrocities and everyday nastiness that we shouldn't feel ourselves notably morally superior to the examples in the Bible. 

Totalitarian states such as the Third Reich and Stalinist USSR (as well as others) were post-Enlightenment societies.

Contemporary slavery, insofar as it occurs, must be considered righteous, proper and/or morally acceptable by *somebody* or it wouldn't happen. 

The article claims that U.S. citizens, as of 2008, were buying slaves in Haiti and keeping them enslaved in the USA. I don't know all the facts of this situation. The USA is a post-Enlightenment culture. 

&gt; ""Across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, traffickers have forced as many as 2 million into prostitution or labor. In South Asia, which has the highest concentration of slaves on the planet, nearly 10 million languish in bondage, unable to leave their captors until they pay off ""debts,"" legal fictions that in many cases are generations old.""

Many other vile things besides slavery are also done in post-Enlightenment societies, and are considered righteous, proper, and/or morally acceptable. 

To steal a line from Edward Said's discussion of how European powers once came to control much of the world: ""this did not happen in a fit of absentminded whimsy"" -- these things are done because people think it acceptable, righteous, and/or proper to do them.

We are just used to taking it for granted.

In all honesty, I think that the frequently mocked relationship between the US and France during the beginning of the war has more to do with the clash between two cultural paradigms that don't appreciate each other than it does with politics. I doubt something like that would ever happen between the UK and US, even if our governments disagree. Our countries are like best buds, you know?

Re: Teeth. Eh, you guys kinda do have crappier teeth, but only because you don't correct crooked teeth as much as americans. It's really nothing personal. Plenty of people think that everyone getting them corrected here is kinda shallow.

Re: Dinner. I believe this is pretty common everywhere, but isn't so much known by the name, except from where I grew up in the south. In the south Sunday Dinner or just ""Dinner"" is traditionally served mid afternoon on Sunday, but doesn't involve beef and potatoes so much as pork and corn bread due to the lack of either cows or potatoes in the south (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea).

Re: The UK being the US's bitch: If someone ever says this, just kindly remind them that the British were successfully fighting off the Nazis unlike much of continental Europe and that the UK was right there beside the US saving France's sorry ass.

Well, you do speak English after all.  It is much more fun to visit England than France.


&gt; Do you all actually think we're a tiny, weak country...

Uh, nope.

&gt; And where does the bad teeth thing come from? 

Magazines, movies, and television.


&gt; Do you Americans have 'sunday dinner' or 'Roast dinner' ?

I did when I was a child.   My grandparents were very keen on it, too.


Now that the questions are out of the way...    I like England.  I like the beer, I like some of the food.  When I am out of the States, I watch BBC and EPL.  I tried to purchase tickets to an EPL game when I visit but so far that has proven to be quite difficult.  I like your comedy on movies, tv, or books.  I grew up on The Young Ones and watched old VHS tapes of them for years.  I cannot live without my Terry Pratchett books.

I'm not sure what went on a hundred years ago to drive my familes out of Ireland and English.  There are a lot of times I wish I could take my family back.  I am one generation removed from being able to get dual citizenship.  This healthcare business we're in the middle of is total crap.  I am watching my wife's parents live through hell.   My wife's mother has advanced Hep-C.  Because of this, a pre-existing condition, she will not be allowed to get on any health insurance plan.  My father-in-law is stuck working in a job in a town that is financially dying, thanks to a Wal-Mart setting up shop on the outskirts of town and driving everybody out of business.   They cannot relocate because that would be a death sentence for her.  If he loses his job, the same outcome.  

Then there are the people.  It seems there are only a few places in this giant country where I can connect with people.  It seems to be that 75% of the people are reactionary religious nut-jobs running around with their head up their ass.   I'm sure England has them too, but you have far less of them.   I have a feeling that part of the American history of ""religious persecution"" had to do people like that making their way over here.

When was the last time (in the U.S.) you were buying something and thought ""well that's reasonable""? For me there are very few things in America that are reasonably priced ($5 footlongs, and thats about it). An apartment a block and a half from a really nice beach in Spain was 300 euros. Definitely reasonable. A can of beer at said beach? 1.20. Oh yeah no tipping either.

America has become so corporate that we don't even notice that we are being fleeced every time we buy ANYTHING. 

The lifestyle in Spain (and much of Europe) is also much slower paced. People work from 9-2:30, then have 3 or 4 hours off to enjoy themselves, have a nice homemade lunch, take a nap etc. and go back to work at 6 until 9 or 10. They work the same amount of time as us, they just spread it out throughout the day. It also is convenient that most people live within at most a mile of their work, so they save time that we spend driving. In America, all the good housing is miles from the jobs, and we leave all the super-convenient housing downtown for ghetto people. Retarded.

Then in Spain at night people go out and enjoy themselves with friends and nobody is too tired to do anything, or worried they have work in the morning. The next nap is at most 6 hours away anyway. 

In America we truly live for the weekend, and it sucks. We have no AWESOME holidays like Carnaval or Feria, we have no town celebrations, no sense of community, it sucks. I mean really what's the most fun holiday in America? New Years Eve? How long does that last? An evening only? Lame. Of course we're not allowed to drink in the street (another law brought to us courtesy of corporate America), God forbid the children see...

You can't get away from anyone else. The housing prices have climbed too high to the point where the current generation is facing a housing crisis the previous generations did not. They simply cannot affording anything. The only young people who can afford anything are girls who get themselves pregnant to get free public housing and the dole. The new families who do work as well as the single people trying to get by have a incredibly difficult go of it. A young couple raising a couple of kids in that economy with the cost of that housing deserve much more public support then what they receive. The north east part of the UK is collapsing into a unemployed hell. The economy is going to scat left and right in the UK which is destroying large swathes of regions and of generations. There are less after-school activities and openness to youths doing stuff together in public then previous generations leading to wandering gangs of absco youths randomly terrorizing people for fun. There has been a decline in the quality of public education since the 1980's and destruction of the private school system thanks to Labor. There is a terrifying lack of security for the individual in the face of the large amount of knife crimes and hot burglaries. The government first disarms the decent british civilians, then the zombie-gangs assault them. This makes the british government as criminally culpable of betraying the ordinary british resident as the most lowly knife wielding chav. The military is still formidable compared to other countries such as Argentina. As long as the UK stays away from the euro it will not be pulled down into the inevitable collapse of a european union based around abstract pseudo-technocrat principles which are unable to deal with real-world issues like corruption, debt, economic development and floating, inflation, and deflation of currencies. If it's not Greece that pulls down the EU it will be some other mismanaged country. The British sense of comedy is based around having to live in cramped confines with other people they may or may not necessarily like which leads to a finely developed verbal sense of humor which they are masters of in the English world. The BBC makes miniseries which are much better then many American series. Robin Hood and Torchwood and Dr. Who are much better then their alternatives such as Legend of the Seeker and Heroes and so on.

If the UK wants to survive:

* Reward couples socially for staying together, trying to work and raise kids in a decent standard of living. Give them more housing and earned income subsidies rather then pouring most of the money into helping banksters and unwed girls who got pregnant so they could live on their own.

* Raise the birth rate of established residents so that less immigration is needed to maintain the economy. Continually bringing in people who can't assimilate after a few generations only promotes social instability.

* Keep the cost of housing low and stable employment plentiful through promoting high-density residential areas socially functioning suburbs (parks, recreation areas, sports areas, shops) as well as constructing more high-skilled factories for export. Only building high density housing and nothing else nearby creates a social desert with attendant 'wasteland' style ethics and gangs. 

* Keep the pound and the inch. This differentiates them from the kilo and the meter of the continent. The more they give into the latest 'smart person fad' of the EU the more they open themselves up to the moment the continent inevitably 'sinks' when the leaders are of the EU are unable to deal with whatever next crisis the EU is vulnerable too. I am guessing it will be when the EU economy begins to tank due to its financial woes, stagnant birth rate and social safety net, and vulnerability to financial skullduggery. I think its a lack of its traditional christian culture and willingness to sell out to whatever culture moves in is also a factor.

Oh yes. There are also traditional british 'Facial Types' which is somewhat distinct and unknown in America. There's a certain edge and shape to the face which makes me think that having a island of potential marital partners over several generations does tend to promote certain facial features more then others. And it's very great and hugely beneficial to have another english speaking country which can launch music (Beatles, whoever comes next) and cultural artifacts (Red Dwarf!) in the same language but from a slightly different background then America.

I've always heard of each branch hating one another, but practically that only results in brawls in bar when various drunken service men get together. And from your statement, it's basically shit talking. When it gets down to it, it seems many men are willing to save a downed man at expense of their own life, and that is deeply, deeply admirable. I think that is one of the most admirable traits about American military, we're not going to leave a man on his own, even if it takes ten men losing their lives to save him.

From what you've said, it seems it's not that wide-spread. The former Army and USMC I've spoken to all recommend enlisting in *any* branch, and all seem to respect one another to a good degree.

*Thank you* for your response. 

As a follow-up, I'm 24 atm, I'm working to fix my credit history which is limiting me from USAF history (I've a fairly high ASVAB score, so I can do a lot of the USAF), and it's going to be cleared-up real soon.

I'm considering either full-time or reserves. Right now I'm making $28k a year, I don't know what enlistment would bring me with about 40 college credit hours, and the field I pursue, but do you have any general recc's in enlisting/reserving in the military?

In a way I think it can give my life some meaning. I'm about to be in the private IT field, which is really fun, but I want to save lives. I want to be in medical. Really, medical is one of the few fields where I can work anywhere on Earth. I'd love to move to Europe--not that I dislike my country, I love many aspects of the USA, but I also want what is best for me. I think Europe has more to offer.

Regardless of all that, did you know any reservists, if you did, did you feel that they felt different than the full-time Marines, or were treated any differently? Once my credit history is in the clear, I'm either going to be reserve or enlist in the USAF.

Your input is greatly appreciated.

When hooligans tortured my parents dog (it still isn't stable around small people, ie children) there was something worth saying about that situation.  There was a time I was somehow marked and for whatever reason couldn't count on my physical safety in public, in any place, at any time a crowd of bullies (who were kind of stalking me) would spring out of the crowd, hit me with something hard, and then disperse before I could get a good look at the assailant.  There was something worth talking about there.  And I'm not sure about your area, but gang-initiation stabbings are not even all that newsworthy in my old neighbourhood anymore, whereas before it became an 'inner city reserve' prototype, while people may have been stabbed, it was more predictable, isolated cases, not attacker-on-hapless-victims-in-spurts-who-happened-to-be-wearing-the-wrong-colours stuff like we see today.

'Race' *shouldn't* the issue in the above situations, and isn't really the issue, just like in this one, but all these cases share what I think are common roots -- one of which is parents who let their kids just wander around the streets, and a culture that does not penalize people for popping out offspring that they cannot support.  And yes, a lot of those people just happen to be aboriginals(see if you can say that on CBC).  Lots aren't too.  But there are *cultural* issues involved.

And then there's the americana culture where gangs are even possible, nevermind glamourized on TV, is a sign that there are problems in our society.  *THOSE* are the ones we should be fixing, not bullshit NIMBY shit like these jerks with their pickup truck are trying to do.  And those are the ones that we can't talk about, because someone might get upset at, for example, the idea that lots of people in winnipeg, along with other cities would gladly kick most people who didn't share their skin colour out of their neighbourhood if they could, even if they wouldn't admit it publicly(for the record I think those people are racist and have gone on at lengths in the conservative blogosphere defending our multicultural heritage to people who think that only american/european values/people/etc should be respected in canada).  Some even do admit it publicly -- when I was doing polling for the NDP at random places in certain areas of winnipeg, looking for what issues were important to the voters there, and the 3 that kept coming up were crime, gangs, and natives(as if they are a problem in and of themselves).  *Why* are these considered problems in that area?  That's what people in winnipeg should be talking about.  And why was winnipeg like this when even regina/saskatoon, which have arguably worse crime rates, weren't as noticable in this regard?

The point is, they *do* have something worth saying, but they just don't know how to clearly articulate it, and they may not clearly understand the society they live in to really direct their anger to its causes.  They might even be in the process of being exploited by other people (hating the 'other' to direct anger that could be directed towards more useful ends).  Like Truthers, there is a sliver of truth in what they are talking about, and if we write them off carte blanche, the issues that are causing their racism and hatred will not disappear, but only grow worse with time as they are ignored.  What we should be doing instead of writing them off is challenging them, and engaging them with members of the communities they despise.

In the following, not only is it assumed that the bill passes, but it is assumed that the issue is big and important enough to generate political will required for its passing.

I don't think anything the bill is supposed to address will necessarily change right away (Turkey officially recognizing genocide), but I do think the event will have consequences. Already, Turkey has responded very sharply to this - withdrawing an ambassador is diplomatically analogous to unfriending someone. That base in Turkey is of strategic military importance to the US, as well as the use of Turkish airspace, so they'll have to find a way to either placate the Turks in some huge way or figure out how to replace it once the Turks give them the boot. There's also the vote on sanctions against Iran. There will be other troubles too, possibly including but not limited to embargoes, tourism restrictions, difficulties involving that oil route, etc.

Now, this sounds like an absolute crap deal for the US. Which is why, of course, the administration is not only staying the fuck away, but actively opposing the committee on this. The poor Armenians are just not worth this much trouble, not even if it makes Obama look like a hypocrite. Maybe in peaceful times, Obama would make a stand for something like this. But there's a war on, and there's a military base in Turkey. End of story for this administration.

Of course, if Europe cared about this issue, they could counter Turkey's threats with threats of their own. That coveted EU membership - I bet the Turks will shut the fuck up right quick if threats were made to reinstate the acceptance of genocide clause into membership preconditions, should they take action against the US. But maybe not - 2013 is the earliest they can reapply after the process ground to a halt in the middle of this last decade, and that's an impossibly optimistic date. So they may just bite it and see if Europe changes their mind in the long haul. It already happened once.

Then of course, there's the UN. Economic sanctions may not work against a country like Iran, but Turkey is a fairly wealthy country and sanctions may actually bother it. By this point, mind you, relations between Turkey and the US have seriously worsened, it's all over the news, and everyone is paying attention. It's not totally crazy to assume that something might just get passed.

The most important thing that will happen, however, is that the Turks themselves will take note. A lot of them are going to be very angry. A lot of them are already very angry that their precious national character is blemished by these allegations. A lot of them are not historians or scholars of any kind, and believe the lies they are told by their government much like many Americans, lacking a proper historical context, believe that 9/11 happened because the Muslim terrorists are hating on their Freedom. But if the row between the US and Turkey keeps escalating, if the world takes notice and picks sides, and most importantly, if the genocide is persistently talked about in Turkey and abroad, then yes - there is a chance that somewhere down the line, Turkey will undergo a process of national penance.",,stopwatchingporn,0,0,,1426233842,0

Their knowledge of Chemistry is even more basic.

This was a first year university question. Admittedly the answer obviously is very complex but for the scope of what the teacher wanted was incredibly basic.

They didn't even know that when you heat something up the molecules move faster. These people all graduated with scholarships and from honour classes.

Towards the end of this year, the US will have another major financial fiasco, but this time the value of the dollar will evaporate. China will demand repayment of the US debt to China through 99-year leases on North American territory. Relations will become extremely strained between the US and China.

Meanwhile, Japan will propose to the US that the US debt to Japan be forgiven if the US sanctions the formation of a proper Japanese army, capable of foreign engagements; the US will agree. A year later, tensions between the US and China will become so great that China will seize any and all US-owned assets inside their borders. Japan will denounce this, proclaim their support for the US, and blockade Chinese ports. A full scale war will ensue: Japan and Taiwan against China. The US will be implicity in support of this, declare China as an enemy, and say the US's debt to China is now null and void.

After Japan has captured significant territory in China (5% overall area), aggressions between India &amp; Pakistan will percolate. Before full scale military actions from either of those countries, the US &amp; EU will demand a cessation of military actions across the entire area. A deal will be struck wherein the occupied Chinese territory will be evacuated by the Japanese if and only China agrees that US debt to China is zero'd, but all US-China trade will be subject to an overseer's tariff to be paid to the Japanese.

Second, in many parts of the US, there are no jobs to be disincentivized from pursuing. This is PK's reference to a bizarre point of view- there are many many more people who want and need to work than there are jobs available. Temporary policy that keeps them from losing their houses and further contributing to the negative, destructive feedback loop is better than none.

That isn't to argue that unemployment policy in the US is perfect, not by any stretch. But NRO at this point is too intellectually bankrupt to contribute to the conversation.

In other countries, particularly in Europe, benefits are more generous and last longer. The drawback to this generosity is that it reduces a worker's incentive to quickly find a new job. 

Jim Bunning's solution to this problem: eliminate all unemployment insurance for people laid off in the biggest downturn since the 30's, and let them and and their families get thrown out on the streets.

I tire of Krugman ""contradictions"". There is a balance between benefits that keep a surplus of unused labor from falling beneath the poverty line in a recession (not to mention the liquidity their benefits bring to an economy starving for business), and wanting cushy perma-benefits even for the chronically unemployed, even when times are good. But if you see a downside to longterm, well-paid welfare, then YOU CAN SEE NO BENEFIT TO WELFARE, EVER.

Actually, that attitude makes a lot of sense when you consider how stupid many of his critics are. They start with a simpleminded premise, for example, ""Welfare is BAD"", and then marshal the facts to support that position. If you find an exception where the opposite is true, you're supposed to ignore or deny it, because if you admit it, it might show that you're ""wrong"".

Since they see facts simply as weapons used to push personal agendas, those types of people never seem to understand when a real intellectual finds good things about something under some conditions, but bad under others.

The Palestinians revolted in 1936. [The uprising.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine). The cause was the increasing immigration of Jews into Palestine. 
( *It's the usual story of European colonists. Start small and friendly, use rising levels of wealth, political power and violence to get more land until the natives revolt then its all about defending yourself and grabbing more land. There's a few unique twists but the story arc fits in the usual framework*) 

The British crack down hard on the natives, 5000 killed and the leadeship arrested or jailed.  Is it any wonder the natives were later courted by Hitler to again attack the British and they sided with the Nazi against those that promised their land to outsiders?  

I find this quote says much:
George Antonius, 1938 ""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

Another point. The Yugoslavia Italy transfer was a reversal of a post WW1 transfer and did not involve mass population movements. More of a ""meet the new boss, your taxes go to him now"".  
The inbuilt logic of zionism is to create a homeland for the jews removing those that live there already. So its ""Begone, we live here now""

See the difference?   
1. meet the new boss  
2. begone.

Corporatism was an ideology that developed in the early 20th century which advocated a kind of alternative between socialism and laissez-faire capitalism. It was adopted by fascists such as Mussolini and Hitler, where it became known as [third positionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position).

Corporatism is actually fairly similar to Progressivism (and by that I mean the economic Progressivism of 1912 and Teddy Roosevelt, not that of 1980 and Teddy Kennedy. Two completely different things). Roosevelt's ideology was called the ""New Nationalism"" and sought to force big businesses to achieve national goals.

You can read his New Nationalism speech [here](http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trnationalismspeech.html), but this is, I think, one of the most interesting excerpts from the speech:

&gt;The effort at prohibiting all combination has substantially failed. The way out lies, not in attempting to prevent such combinations, but in completely controlling them in the interest of the public welfare. For that purpose the Federal Bureau of Corporations is an agency of first importance. Its powers, and, therefore, its efficiency, as well as that of the Interstate Commerce Commission, should be largely increased. We have a right to expect from the Bureau of Corporations and from the Interstate Commerce Commission a very high grade of public service.
Pretty much fits the definition of corporatism that you just gave. And in all honesty, it isn't that far from the economic policies of Mussolini and Hitler... but I'm not trying to trash Teddy Roosevelt here. Simply put, the ideology that developed in Europe now known as Fascism resembled, at least in terms of economics, the policies of Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and, to a lesser extent, Woodrow Wilson.

I never thought much of it because Brazil, particularly the South where Im from is very much like America: a crazy mix of immigrant traditions and people from loads of different backgrounds. I wasnt an expection, most people who I grew up with had Italian, Japanese or another crazy mix of roots. I never equaled my ethinicity to my nationality like many europeans do either and still find the concept weird (I am not Lebanese or Polish because my family is, I'm Brazilian, I was born in Brazil!'. A friend of mine calls himself Italian because his mum is, I wtf a lot at that O__o whatever.)

What I was trying to say, perphaps in a too laconic manner, is that people being curious about your background is natural and never bothered me. The UK is incredibly multi-cultural and I understand why people basically want to know what ethinicity makes you look asian rather caucasian. Whats wrong with that? Perceptions and prejudice will come out either way. I actually prefer people to ask than assume that every asian is Indian or Pakistani and that every latino is Mexican. I always ask, though I dont go through the whole interview, I just straight ask 'So whats your family's background?', with no malicious intend, I'm simply curious.

I know that the mix of the way I look, with my name and fluent English make people wonder so if they start with those questions I just save them the embarasement of trying to beat about the bush and be politically correct and tell them, it doesnt hurt. Ignorance will shine through no matter what you tell them, meh.

Americans seem to work for things, meaningless stuff and the more of it you get the better that makes you than the other guy. Europeans seem to work for the chance to do things. 

It is a less stressful approach to life, and for those of us who were hunched over Apple II's and PC JR's in the 80's a stress free existence is welcomed. What has your 60-70 hours a week got you? It got me a bunch of stuff, a house a coupe of HUGE tv's etc...none of which really make man happy.",,Fred_Jarvis,0,0,,1426233964,0

I know what you feel - you always think that there's something definitely wrong with the place and how it functions. Most of my own relatives when visiting from the US and the UK also comment on the same thing, and it's not culture shock. It's like walking through Disneyland and you pass by an open door to the maintanence area and see the grimy stuff behind the ride and then suddenly Disneyland isn't as utopian as they'd have you believe.

As for my overall opinion of the city - I've grown up here and spent a large amount of my life here, but I still don't like this city as much as I should be considering it's my hometown of sorts. It's got many problems, but perhaps the biggest one from my point of view is the way us people from South Asia are largely treated like dirt by the local Emiratis. And it's not just the ""slave labour"" that the media goes on about - it's every Indian, Sri Lankan,Philipino or Chinese who's working i white collar jobs. I can never be made to feel at home in this country because they've made it obvious that they don't want me, or any of my kind here - expatriates aren't ever considered for citizenship, no matter how many years they've slogged for the company out there. What I'm going to say is going to sound really harsh, seeing as this is predominantly western-dominated, but the fact that folks from the UK and the US and elsewhere in Europe get double the salary for the exact same job and position than their Indian or Asian counterparts saddens me even more. This is not my home, because they don't want me or my people here now that we've done most of their dirty work and they'd rather have people from your side of the world more.

In the beginning, when I was young and naive, I used to tell my parents that things would change, and someday the arabs would see our contribution to their success and treat us with the respect we deserve. Twenty years later, it's not changed - the arabs still treat us like second class citizens. I used to love this city, but these days, before I get set to move back to my home country, I doubt it.

Anyhow, the best way to see this part of the world (or any part for that matter) is to move around the way the people who live there do.  Take the small, crappy busses along the bumpy, terrible roads.  They'll be chock full of people and be very uncomfortable.  You'll watch people buy food out the windows from small children then realise that the guy next to you is eating spiders and he'll offer you one.  You'll get to stop at a bunch of small, out of the way towns and see a lot that you'll miss completely by air.  You'll also find that the average person in this part of the world is exceedingly friendly and will try their best to communicate to you with broken English (French will get you much further in Cambodia with the older folks).  This is where the soul of a country is.

Thailand is no longer what it used to be in the ""untouched"" category since it has become such a huge destination for young North Americans and Europeans looking to go somewhere that ""isn't touristy"".  The result is that everywhere is touristy to some extent and you'll have to just accept it and enjoy what you can.

Personally, I'd spend little time in Thailand and go directly to Cambodia - I loved it there.

What?  For 2008 [the Bureau of Labor Statistics said](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2008.htm) ""2.2 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 3.0 percent of all hourly-paid workers"".

And that's just of hourly-paid workers.  Can you point me to where you get your facts?

&gt;one third of the workers...Live in poverty

Here is a list of some interesting [facts about Americans that are officially considered living in poverty](http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed091109b.cfm):

* Nearly 40 percent of all poor households actu­ally own their own homes. On average, this is a three-bedroom house with one-and-a-half baths, a garage, and a porch or patio.

* Eighty-four percent of poor households have air conditioning. By contrast, in 1970, only 36 percent of the entire U.S. population enjoyed air conditioning.

* The typical poor American has as much or more living space than the average individual living in most European countries. (These comparisons are to the average citizens in foreign countries, not to those classified as poor.)

* Nearly two-thirds of the poor have cable or satellite TV.

* Ninety-eight percent of poor households have a color television; two-thirds own two or more color televisions.

* Eighty-two percent own microwave ovens; 67 percent have a DVD player; 73 percent have a VCR; 47 percent have a computer.

* The average intake of protein, vitamins, and minerals by poor children is indistinguishable from that of children in the upper middle class. Poor boys today at ages 18 and 19 are actually taller and heavier than middle-class boys of similar age were in the late 1950s. ",,isionous,0,0,,1426233990,0

 The USA lost it after September 11, 2001 I can see it was certainly traumatic but if the US was a person and the event was a tragedy in their life that person would be considered mentally unstable and in need of help, they are lashing out at everyone and everything due to that one act.

 Canada, where I live, is a bit more right-wing (although left-wing isn't any better) with the Conservative government in power I find it very shallow in culture it's very white, religious and condescending (and this from a white Catholic guy, me). MPs of the government have [often](http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2006/leadersparties/leaders/bio_harper.html) and [frequently](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/02/25/guergis-apology025.html) made comments how they hate certain regions of Canada.

 Where I live I can buy weed, I could marry another guy if I wanted to, most times people get house arrest for crimes, guns are relatively rare (I've never seen a real one) if you consider that a good thing, the police are fair but do their job.
