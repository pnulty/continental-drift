"Fact but with a caveat. First off, who or what is truly a ""wine expert""? Some old guy with an European accent who says that he absolutely adores the ""vitality"" of a 1982 Bordeaux? So is their opinion, in this taste test or any other one, the be-all-end-all truth in wine? Not in the slightest.

The truth is, in the wine world, taste is so subjective and it is hard to say that anyone is truly an expert. Yes, there are experienced tasters out there but that is it--they are just folks who have happened to taste more wine than the rest of us.

Now the caveat, while it is true that the subjectivity of taste is certainly influenced by people's perceptions (i.e. If someone tells you this is suppose to be a great wine, you're likely to think it is), that doesn't mean there is not a difference between a $5 Cabernet and a First Growth Bordeaux. There is a difference in how the wine feels on your mouth, the number of different aromas you can pick out, how long you seem to taste the wine in your mouth after you swallow, etc. For some people, those differences may ring their bells more than it would for someone who doesn't care about those difference. If you're just drinking something for a buzz, you're not going to care if one wine has several layers of aromas. But that is alright. Ultimately, the only ""expert"" opinion you should care about is what you like.",,t1_c0lcykx,IAmA,True,0,Ashlynkat,,1426228177,,0,0,10,10,t1_c0lcy0i,False,True,t3_b7mez,c0lcykx,t5_2qzb6,1267411895
"1.) What will strike you as a ""value"" will depend on what types of wines you like. If you tend to like big, fruity wines then the South American wines from Chile and Argentina are stellar-especially Argentine Malbecs.  Lots of excellent values in the $10-15 range that go great with burgers on the grill or a nice juicy steak.

If you are looking for European values (which tend not to be as fruity) then look for some of the ""baby brothers"" of the big name European regions. For instance, Bordeaux is the name brand but some of the lesser known regions of Bordeaux like Canon-Fronsac and Cotes de Blaye are producing some kick ass sub $20 wines. Many vin de pays from the Languedoc (on the label will be listed as Vin d'Oc) offer great Syrah, Grenache ""baby brothers"" to more expensive Rhones. Heck, some of these wines even beat Australia for value.

More into Italian? Avoid some of the overpriced Chianti and look further down south to the Salice Salentino on the heel of the boot where you will find the absolutely best pizza wines for $7-10. 

2.) Most of my studies have just been self taught, a lot of reading and a lot of drinking. :) Hint, free tastings at wine shops are your friends. 

3.) Whoa, this could be a long one. I wrote the Wikipedia article about the influence of oak on wine, so if you want the long answer, here it is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_in_wine . Now for the short answer, oak does have the ability to impart certain desirable flavors (like vanilla or carmel) but what it contributes the most to is the subtle ""smoothing"" out of the wine by it limited exposure to oxygen and the wood tannins that polymerize with the wine's tannins. Larger tannins come across as smoother on your palate. Other woods, like cedar or elm, either don't allow that same type of subtle aeration or they will impart some funky flavors to the wine.",,t1_c0lcz6p,IAmA,True,0,Ashlynkat,,1426228184,,0,0,6,6,t1_c0lcykq,False,True,t3_b7mez,c0lcz6p,t5_2qzb6,1267412794

America, what have you come to? 10 years of Al-qaeda, and everyone forgets what an extreme leftist is? Your propagandists are asleep on the job.

Back in the day, extreme leftists were something to be **feared**. They overthrew governments and shit. And not just ass-wipe governments, but fucking empires with hundreds of millions of people. And when people complained, they killed them by the tens of millions, just lined them all up against the nearest wall and put bullets in their heads, and for an encore they kicked the ever-loving fuck out of the unstoppable Nazi war machine and took over Eastern Europe and dared us to do something about it, which we were too shit-scared to do. So then just to freak us right out, they started launching shit into space, like satellites, and dogs, and communists and stuff, and detonated the biggest fucking thermonuclear bombs the world has ever seen, and started revolutions in every little country on earth, and we tried to fight them here and there, but pretty much lost every time. And even when we half-succeeded, they just went back to their jungle camps, lit their Cuban cigars with their AK47s and spent their days kidnapping and murdering government officials and judges and stuff just to piss everyone off.  

If you were an extreme leftist, you were basically one of the baddest motherfuckers on earth. Militias are a joke--your average extreme leftist wasn't holing up on a ranch all paranoid about fighting the government. He was actually fighting the government, and winning. Your vegetarian sophomores and animal rights groups are a joke, they would be the first bourgeois fuckwits sent off to a re-education camp.

"In Australia, much of our paper comes from native forests (our wood chip also go to Japan), despite there being ample tree farms to supply pulp. Turning 600 year old trees (the size of redwoods) into paper is not very environmentally friendly. Especially considering the carbon debt incurred in the process of logging these forests, which are the most carbon dense in the world, and lose their ability to store so much carbon after logging.

Unfortunately, recycling paper in Australia doesn't help much, because it only gets turned into cardboard and not copy paper, so we have to buy recycled copy paper from Europe. It's still better environmentally but pretty sad that we go on destroying native forests and don't even make any recycled copy paper here.

Yeah anyway, back to the question, there's far less resources used in recycling paper than it creating it from new pulp (resources: oil, chemicals, carbon emissions).

"You're very kindhearted... and I see why you have a concern. My question for you would be: ""do you know anybody yourself who wears a veil or a niqab?"" Or have you seen a television interview with a woman who likes to wear one? People of different cultures have different sensibilities about things. Now, yes, there are certain areas where I believe that government should step in to prevent culturally specific practices such as infant or adolescent circumcision or excision. These are permanent modifications to the body. And parents don't have the right to do that to a child, in my estimation. And yes there are times when it is illogistical to allow women to wear face coverings. For example, [here is a news film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJqLdw-Su6g) about how in Egypt it was determined that women in universities could not sit for exams in their niqab. Other examples might be places where security personnel need to check a photo ID. If people want to live in Europe, they have to navigate the society and work with its practices in an amicable fashion.


One ought to be aware of one's own ethnocentrism when it comes to one's sensibilites about these types of practices. What does a veil mean to women in that society? You see how those eqyptian women are distraught about **not** being able to wear the niqab for their exams. So their feelings run in quite the opposite vein to how you as a native European  see things. Isn't there value in mystery, and secrecy in certain contexts? Don't you see that there are certain practices that would evolve around such secrecy that might be very beautiful and fun?

Of course, I can see how in the Middle East, head coverings, and mouth coverings might serve a more important purpose. They might be important as dust shields in places where they have quite dramatic dust storms. It might be important to help to keep the sun off of your face and shoulders.

I'm sure there are certain places, like Afghanistan, where women have in past years been forced into ways of doing things that they don't agree with. But I think those situations are an exception, rather than the rule.

I've seen only a few over-dramatized instances of dying cancer patients not getting care. Usually, they are getting care, but the insurance won't pay up for a more expensive program that has a miniscule chance of making a difference. People who can't understand basic economics get riled up and angry, because insurance companies can't spend more money than they bring in. These same people have no problem with that fact that public healthcare has to make the same decision to cut more expensive, but ineffective treatments. The mortality rate for elderly in countries with public healthcare is lower than the US. That's because those are the people who are getting the expensive treatments to eke out a few more years. This is in fact where the bulk of the difference between US and European healthcare spending originates. I don't see you up in arms over the fact that European countries don't provide expensive treatments that could stretch out the lives of their elderly by a few more years.

"I want to add something to this, the financial aspect.

Marriage and thus the production of children, is something that the State needs and is very dependant on.  Children are the most vital resource of a nation, and that is the reason (much more so in Europe) that tax incentives, extended holidays, and all that jazz is given to married couples (even couples with no children have the opportunity to procreate and thus they are also given some of these financial and State-derived benefits).

A homosexual couple (with the exception of adoption and in the case of females artificial insemination) will not produce that valuable resource the State needs; a State without children is one that will cease to exist.  Thus why should they be given the benefit of this institution (marriage) when they can not produce anything ""positive"" from it.

"&gt;I address this issue with my color analogy which you have ignored.

Fine, the analogy is flawed. While the divisions into colors is somewhat arbitrary (not quite because of our physical mechanism for perceiving color), the ranking is objective. There is a single factor in use that does not change: wavelength. This is simply not the case for race among humans. There are thousands of genes involved, depending on which gene you care about you get a different grouping. Do you care about lactose intolerance? Then you can call the Bantu and Europeans a race and everyone else a different race. How about that sickle cell? If so, you get a band across African and India weakening as you go. Then you have that humans are constantly ""mixing the races"". The dividing line between Red and Orange may be arbitrary, but Red and Orange are not busy having carnelian babies. The socially constructed notion of race depends on these things being constants, not dynamic entities over time.

Anyway, I had considered your analogy. ""The question then is other than the division criteria is there anything to distinguish the groups."" That is a non-obvious but important point. We divide light according to wavelength. Now look at the groups and see if there is anything *other than wavelength* to distinguish them. If so, you have what is called a natural group. There certainly are natural groups in the world, I don't claim that all distinctions are socially constructed. To make the point clear, *species* are real things in the world. And for some species we do seem to find valid sub-species. I am not making a logical argument that race is impossible, I make the factual argument that races do not exist among humans.

&gt;Does your map not prove that geography is a large factor in deciding your genetics, and prove that race/ethnicity plays a role in your personal genetics??

It shows that for *that* factor it plays a role. Now show me someone who saw Bantu (the central Africans) and Pakistanis and Indians as a ""race"".

"&gt;You mean that you failed to find evidence, or you found something that falsified your ideas.

Whatever, the basic premise is the same: No one's presented evidence to support the view that religion causes such things more than other factors do.  I don't understand the falsification part though, I have specifically not found anything that falsifies this position of mine.

&gt;Why the double standard for things like Islam and Buddhism, where traditions that have been absorbed in, are said to be cultural and not part of Islam or Buddhism, yet things that have been assimilated in to Christianity from pagan religions and Roman beliefs and stuff are said to be part of Christianity.

What pagan/Roman traditions are you talking about specifically?  I probably wouldn't consider those things to be Christian either.  I don't really play with a double standard here, you may have me confused with someone else you're arguing with or have argued with on this subject.  I don't really think something like opposition to abortion has any basis in Christianity just as I don't think honor killings have a basis in Islam.

&gt;Do you think that without Islam, we'd still have these honour killings? I very much doubt it.

Yes, of course?  Why do you think we wouldn't?  Again, where are honor killings endorsed in the Quran or Hadith?  What basis do you have that they have anything to do with Islam other than the fact that people who commit them are Muslim?

&gt;It's also rather obvious that if political ideology can cause people to go and commit crimes, then so can religion.

I'd agree, but I don't think political ideology compels anyone to kill either.  Blaming socialism for the crimes of Mao and Stalin is just as ignorant as blaming Islam for honor killings, and I've said as much previously.

&gt;A 2005 study, article on it here, indicated that the more religious a society is, the worse off it is, and they did their best to account for poverty and other influencing factors.

First off this is an op-ed concerning this study.  Without the actual study to read it's not really a good source.  Secondly from what the article suggests the study simply found that the US is worse off in many ways from less religious European societies, which I would agree with, but it is a huge logical leap to assume this is due to the fact that the US is more religious.  There are all sorts of better reasons with more evidence behind them to explain why the US, and many Muslim countries for that matter, have the problems they do.  Again, this is similar to blaming the fall of the Soviet Union to atheism.  Yes, it is true that the Soviet Union was an atheist federation of nations that had a lot of problems, which eventually led to collapse.

Him: Did you go out into the town last night?

Us: No, did you?

"&gt;Palestine has never existed as a country and the immigration to Palestine by Jews was legal and they bought land to live on.

I think what you're missing is the way in which the land was acquired. Rich Palestinian absentee landlords living in Lebanon sold land to Zionists in Europe, who then leased the land to the Zionist settlers in the region. The land which was flippantly bought and sold, belonged to the peasant farmers of Palestine. They had farmed it, their fathers had farmed it, and their grandfathers had farmed it. It goes back generations. They were uprooted from their homes and forced to leave. You could say that it was legal, but it wasn't right. 

&gt;This actually attracted lots of Arab immigrants too during these years, even more than Jews actually. Due to the increased wealth in the area.

Really. *Reeeeaallllyyy.* The area you're referring, presumably the areas bought by the Jewish National Fund to be leased to Zionists, doesn't at all resemble this statement. For starters, the Zionists didn't let Arabs work their land. There was no influx or Arab migrant workers. The whole point of buying arable land was to feed the Jews and so they could have a legitimate claim to statehood. It was also inspired by the romantic ideal that Jews, through their own volition, would rise up through hard work and create a strong state in Palestine from the bottom up. So, as you can see, it's not like they are going to let no Jews work the land, that would be counterproductive to the movement, Labor Zionism, they were trying to create. 

Secondly, there wasn't a lot of wealth in the area you speak of. ""The transfer of cultivated land from Arab to Jewish ownership had a devastating effect on the Palestinian peasantry, which in 1936 still composed two-thirds of the Arab population of the mandate. The usual outcome of such a transaction was the eviction of the Arab tenant farmers and their addition to the growing ranks of the unemployed."" (255 Cleveland) As a result of this unemployment there was violence and poverty. Not an increase of wealth.  

Also,

&gt;This actually attracted lots of Arab immigrants too during these years, even more than Jews actually. 

Before you try to defend this statement, let me begin by telling you that you can't. If you think you've found something, look closer because you're being misguided. There was no reliable census conducted by the Ottomans or the British during the mandate. Both sides of the argument have their numbers, but there simply is not data to support a precise conclusion on the population of Palestine during this time.

"I love Grim Fandango and although I'm not the biggest jazz aficionado I'll point you at a few of my favourites...

While I don't have the greatest understanding of jazz history, the soundtrack to Grim Fandango takes influence from a number of different phases and evolutions of jazz combined together to make an overall mood. I'd say that the music in the game leans more towards the Miles Davis et al cool jazz period (that which sounds like whisky and cigarettes) but it's up to you what you like best.

While George Gershwin is not so much traditional jazz and takes many influences including european classical and also ragtime, I feel that his music best sums up the *feeling* that I get when I imagine that age.

"There really isn't a UK/US distinction. The Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust are global entities that offers their certifications across the globe. While the Court of Master Sommeliers (http://www.mastersommeliers.org/) has been more visible in North America, there are European MS.

The difference is more in their focus. The Master Sommelier exams focus more on the service aspects of food and wine pairing, particularly in the hospitality industry. There are 4 levels towards attaining your Master Sommelier. The first level, Introductory, focuses more on ""book knowledge"". The 2nd, Certified, focuses on tastings and the theories behind wine pairing. The 3rd, Advance, focuses more on theory as well as practical restaurant applications. In the 4th, the MS exam, you must truly demonstrate a mastery of all aspect of service and restaurant applications.

 I've gone through two levels of the Court's exam and got my Somm cert but I ultimately decided not to pursue it any further because I really wasn't as interested in the service aspect. For instance, in the 3rd &amp; 4th levels of examination you will need to demonstrate mastery in how to properly present, decant and serve a bottle of wine to royalty. I don't foresee my career path leading me towards serving wine to the Queen of England very often.

The Master of Wine process focuses more on the wine industry as a whole, though with some emphasis on the business side of making and selling wine. While the Master Sommelier exams are certainly challenging, I think you really chew off more with the MW since to succeed you will need to have extensive knowledge in viticulture, winemaking, wine history and the geography of the world's wine regions, in addition to knowing the wines themselves.",,t1_c0lei1o,IAmA,True,0,Ashlynkat,,1426228895,,0,0,3,3,t1_c0le6qz,False,True,t3_b7mez,c0lei1o,t5_2qzb6,1267477286
"&gt; Is that one car payment or two? How many monthly payments do you have? Is it more important to have two cars or have insurance to help protect your health?

Nicely loaded question.  But the reality is, I am not going to get turned away should something major happens like an accident.  Now if I AIDS or cancer, I am fucked.  But I would be anyway even if I had health insurance.

&gt; I haven't examined the issue but would welcome more information on it. I have to read an incredible amount of information in a given week but keep open on all of this.

"The term ""good bottle"" of wine is so vague and so loaded at the same time. It like asking someone to define what a ""good day"" is versus some other ""random day"". For some folks, a good day is a commute without traffic, receiving praise from the boss, having the barista not screw up your coffee order, and coming home to watch your favorite sport team win the game. For another person, a good day is winning the lottery and finding the love of their life while, still, for someone else a good day is simply waking up in the morning and the sun is shining.

The same is true with wine. What makes a wine good to you? For some ""wine experts"", a good wine is one where you can sense a wine's weight (tannins and alcohol) in your mouth, perceive many different aromas in both the nose and when you taste the wine, yet is still balance with acidity that the wine feel lively instead of flabby. Then finally, a ""good wine"" will leave a lasting, lingering impression long after you swallow it.

But what if that wine isn't really fruity? What if those layers of aromas are things like tobacco, mushrooms, cedar, roasted nut or coffee with none of the smooth fruity flavors that a lot of folks like in their wine? If a wine is missing those fruity notes, you might not like it and you are probably not going to think it is good. But if some ""random"" wine gives you those fruity notes, you're probably going to enjoy it a lot.

So, again, it really just comes down to ""What is good for you?"" Who cares what some European guy with an accent thinks about that wine you just picked up for dinner? Is he drinking it? No. So go with what you like. The only ""sin"" in the wine world is never trying new things. You don't have to defends your likes or dislikes but you should always be open to trying something new.

"Other redditors already gave you references.  They're also easy to turn up.

Why is it that you feel it's okay to claim something is an unfounded myth without reference (no, citing a philosophy professor who didn't do his research isn't reference; neither is wikipedia), yet want reference from others?

Andriy Slyusarchuk - hilariously not in your Wikipedia citation at all - was studied extensively.  That's the guy who got famous in the 80s for being able to answer single digits of pi anywhere in the first million digits and then some.  What most people don't know is he also remembered which page of his printed copy of pi it was on, which line and where on the line.

Swami Vivekananda was given a secretly doctored version of a book from the newly released year of the Encyclopedia Britannica containing several names intentionally altered.  Not only was the Swami able to consume the entire book in a sitting (he claimed to be able to take nine per day, though that was never verified), but when he was next tested, not only did he get every piece of data correct, but he even got the changed names ""correct"" with regards to the altered work.

Tesla claimed to have abilities which today would be considered eideticism - five seconds, he said, was all he needed to commit a complex engineering diagram to memory, and then he would study the memory later until it was understood - but it was never tested.

And, y'know, there're lots of similar things out there.  In the time of Mozart, there were no intellectual property laws in Europe; if someone could get a score for music, they could publish it.  As such, the actual score for most symphonies was a jealously guarded secret, to keep it from proliferating, so that the author would retain financial control by claiming nobody else was getting their work correctly.  Mozart and Beethoven were both frequently smuggled in to listen to large symphonies so that, after a single sitting, they could later write the scores from memory, and they were both famous for never missing a note.

You may, if you like, spend some time talking about how the five year old Mozart could only do this because, you imagine, he had at that age some kind of magical training, and that it wasn't an in-born quality.

What you'll learn is that eideticism makes no claims to being in-born.  It's simply a label attached to a skill.  If someone can do it, they're eidetic; it doesn't matter how.  To commit an image to memory does not denote that it be committed as an image, y'see.  As such, the title of this article is fundamentally wrong-headed; even if it's mnemonically based, it's still being an eidetic.

The phrase ""photographic memory"" is just a popular culture term.  Attempting to cast eideticism to the things that phrase implies is just pretending to understand a depth of psychology you do not in fact understand at all.

Do I have a reference?  Yes, quite a few.  You, however, do not.  What you have is a link to a non-authoritative community encyclopedia making reference to a quotation from a philosopher with no psychology training and no reference making an opinion claim.

When it comes to the IMF the wiki is ripe to pick apart your poorly thought out counter, as I can use the same article to make a more convincing case you can.

*quote* The role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the late Cold War period, as the IMF policy makers supported military dictatorships friendly to American and European corporations. Critics also claim that the IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to their views of democracy, human rights, and labor rights. The controversy has helped spark the Anti-globalization movement. Arguments in favor of the IMF say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight various examples in which democratized countries fell after receiving IMF loans.[

*quote* In the 1960s, the IMF and the World Bank supported the government of Brazil’s military dictator Castello Branco with tens of millions of dollars of loans and credit that were denied to previous democratically-elected governments

"&gt;All I have been concerned to indicate here is this: in the most spiritual sphere too, the ascetic ideal has at present only one kind of real enemy capable of harming it: the comedians of this ideal—for they arouse mistrust of it. Everywhere else that the spirit is strong, mighty, and at work without counterfeit today, it does without ideals of any kind—the popular expression for this abstinence is ""atheism""—except for its will to truth. But this will, this remnant of an ideal, is, if you will believe me, this ideal itself in its strictest, most spiritual forumlation, esoteric through and through, with all external additions abolished, and thus not so much its remnant as its kernel. Unconditional honest atheism (and its is the only air we breathe, we more spiritual men of this age!) is therefore not the antithesis of that ideal, as it appears to be; it is rather only one of the latest phases of its evolution, one of its terminal forms and inner consequences--it is the awe-inspiring catastrophe of two thousand years of training in truthfulness that finally forbids itself the lie involved in belief in God.

"&gt;I don't disagree with any of this. However, this does not mean they were not also religiously motivated. Why must the two be mutually exclusive?

Because the bombings would not have happened minus the political motive.

&gt;I think that, in the case of both bombings, the suicide bombers believed they would be divinely rewarded for their actions, that there are sufficient passages within the Koran to convince a susceptible human being that this is so, and that without this belief they would have been much less likely to override their human instincts and end their mortal lives.

First of all there is nothing in the Quran that advocates suicide bombing.  You are correct though that the Quran states that those who are martyred in the fight against the enemies of Islam have a great reward in paradise.  Now I ask you: Why would someone consider the US an enemy of Islam?  Is the US considered an enemy of Islam by Muslims like the 9/11 attackers simply because it is the US, or because of its aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world?  Were it not for aforementioned imperialism, where would the motive be for these attacks?  Even if a Muslim fervently believed in martyrdom, what reason would they have for attacking the US minus the US's aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world?

&gt;Last time I checked, belief in a national healthcare system was not an enabler for neo-nazism. Belief in god and belief in scripture as divine, are the irrational foundations upon which a suicide bomber's mindset is developed. By tolerating and encouraging such a mindset, you push future perpetrators a significant part of the way down the path to violent extremism, whether you agree with their enterpretation completely or not.

That's absolute hogwash and it is the equivalent to a ""HITLER believed that too!!!"" argument.  I could say that any left-of-center political view you hold emboldens the Shining Path in Peru or FARC in Colombia by the same logic.  Complete bullshit.  Or even better, I could say your support of the neoliberal, global capitalist model that the entire world labors under enables suicide bombings, and that would actually be much more true, because it is the aggressive imperial actions spurned by this model that gives birth to the ""terrorism"" of suicide bombings.

&gt;It does nothing of the sort. The Soviet Union replaced religious ideology with statist ideology. 

No more than any other secular state did, at least after Stalin.

&gt;The United States, I'd maintain, is an incredibly religious country, and that this motivated the actions of numerous members of their government (who were evangelical) and the actions and behaviour of their military (a deeply evangelical institution).

Do you honestly think things like military bases in Saudi Arabia, the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, or the support of Israel are based more on religious than strategic concerns?  Because if so congratulations, you're quite the useful idiot for the ruling class.

&gt;There are plenty of examples of non-religious countries that are more morally progressive, more responsible internationally, less violent and treat women better than any theocratic or heavily religious society. Those are societies (see: Scandinavia) that put the religious world to absolute shame. In many situations you can remove religious dogma from society and that vacuum will be filled with something equally evil, equally contemptible. But in many demonstrable examples this has not happened, and their societies are better for it.

That is equally as speculative as to suggest that without the religion the bombings would not have happened. You seem happy to suggest political motivation but in complete denial about the role their religious beliefs played in being willing to *take their own lives*, without any authority or reason with which to do so.

&gt; First of all there is nothing in the Quran that advocates suicide bombing. You are correct though that the Quran states that those who are martyred in the fight against the enemies of Islam have a great reward in paradise. Now I ask you: Why would someone consider the US an enemy of Islam? Is the US considered an enemy of Islam by Muslims like the 9/11 attackers simply because it is the US, or because of its aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world? Were it not for aforementioned imperialism, where would the motive be for these attacks? Even if a Muslim fervently believed in martyrdom, what reason would they have for attacking the US minus the US's aggressive imperialism in the Muslim world?

How about that a significant portion of muslims view western society as decadent and wish to bring about its destruction? How about that these people are so sensitive that they will perceive Western culture's very existence as an affront to their fictional god? Is the end goal of Islam not complete subjugation of the world under Islam?

&gt; No more than any other secular state did, at least after Stalin.

Uh, in fuctioning democracies there is no such thing comparable to the religious and statist idologies and dogma of Satalinist and theocratic dictatorships. The existence of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, and freedom of enquiry and freedom to criticise, prevent or at least severely mitigate such evils.

&gt; Do you honestly think things like military bases in Saudi Arabia, the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, or the support of Israel are based more on religious than strategic concerns? Because if so congratulations, you're quite the useful idiot for the ruling class.

Again, you seek to dilute my argument by making it a one-or-the-other issue. It is nothing of the sort, and it reeks of desperation that you continue to do so.

&gt; Secular Europe is still a key player in the imperialist system which, again, harms far more people than Islam does. Just because they support oppression in other countries and not their own doesn't give them a moral high ground.

A statement completely unsupported by a shred of evidence.

&gt; That's absolute hogwash and it is the equivalent to a ""HITLER believed that too!!!"" argument. I could say that any left-of-center political view you hold emboldens the Shining Path in Peru or FARC in Colombia by the same logic. Complete bullshit. Or even better, I could say your support of the neoliberal, global capitalist model that the entire world labors under enables suicide bombings, and that would actually be much more true, because it is the aggressive imperial actions spurned by this model that gives birth to the ""terrorism"" of suicide bombings.

It is nothing of the sort. Firstly, Hitler was before my time. I never shared my culture with him. Secondly, I do believe that haphazard and negligent foreign policy shoulders some burden for the climate that breeds Islamic retaliation. Those with power have a duty of care to use it responsibly, and when they do not do so they contribute to the suffering that retaliatory actions causes.

"I was speaking from an economics standpoint, businesses maximize revenue, monopolies maximize profit. Nonprofits like DRI maximize helping people throughout the world while minimizing overhead and making donations more efficient. It is not in the insurance company's financial interests to give you coverage for preexisting conditions, unlike DRI, insurance companies want profitability(rolled into overhead - exec wages/expansion) first, helping people second. It is not in their interest to give you preventative care since the likelihood is you'll be at another company in 10 years. Health insurance companies, despite corporate structure, behave as businesses unlike DRI. So I guess my point is bringing up nonprofit status is misleading. A government-run system better solves these problems: focusing on general health that is in the best interests of its citizens vs those who can afford treatment. An obese child today is an expensive diabetic patient in the future thus it is in the government's best interests to prevent such things: for instance, abstaining from sugary lunch food for example. In short, I understand you have your hands tied, but I've lived in the USA and France/Holland and I've seen a much better system in Europe which functions and makes more sense.

"Obesity rates can't explain everything, this is true.  However, what I was trying to point out was that there's a whole lot that those charts don't account for.

Europeans get considerably more vacation as well.  It's a short trip to the beaches for pretty much anyone, and etc etc.

"&gt;I'm looking for someone who will strengthen science education in this country, not someone who would rather leave it up to the people currently screwing it up to do so.

Are you a libertarian (standard American definition)?  If you are, why are you concerned with the president's views on science?  Libertarians typically believe the federal government shouldn't even be into science.  Education, libertarian philosophy goes, is a state (or local) issue...certainly nothing the president should be involved in.  If the president has no say in science/education, what issue is his opinion?  

If you are not a self-proclaimed libertarian (standard, American definition), what we're talking about is moot and does not need to be discussed.  If you are a European or some other type of libertarian (e.g., the definition Chomsky uses), this discussion about Ron Paul is moot as well.  

If you are a libertarian (standard, American definition), why do you care about the president's views on science provided you're taking science out of his hands?

&gt;I think the right to an abortion is a fundamental right, so I don't want states deciding whether abortion is legal or not.

I don't really want to get into abortion, but Dr. Paul's view on the issue is perfectly legitimate from a states' rights/small federal government libertarian perspective.  If you disagree, you disagree, but you can't say it's not in line with a states' rights view.  With all due respect, assuming you're a states' rights advocate, you can't just push whatever issue you want to the federal level so that states can't block what you specifically want (i.e., you get what you want).  

For instance, I believe national parks should be protected by the federal government and taken out of the hands of states.

Irish person here. I agree with the message but not with the mechanism by which it was sent. I'm rather surprised by this but then again Ireland is Israel's greatest critic in the EU. Recently our Foreign Affairs minister had to [enter Gaza](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0225/gaza.html) via Egypt because Israel denied him access to Gaza.  

To put the above story into context- there is significant sympathy for Palestine in Ireland. Personally I believe it's because Irish people identify with the narrative (real or perceived) of an oppressed people, dominated by a vastly more powerful neighbour who is setting about colonizing or controlling their land.

There are several Palestinian solitary campaigns in Ireland, as well as Boycott Israel groups and a significant Irish present in NGOs operating in Palestine.

Personally I would have agreed if my government had chosen to expel the Israeli ambassador in light of Israels recent assault on Gaza. If evidence (highly unlikely) does emerge confirming a Mossad link to the assassination/passport issue I hope they do.

"You mean the article you sent me as a supposed citation backup the claim that the economic elite have roots in the 18th century?

From the article you sent to me:

&gt;*'... The most powerful men in the United States were themselves answerable to another power, a foreign power, and a power which had been steadfastly seeking to extend its control over the young republic since its very inception. The power was the financial power of England, centered in the London Branch of the House of Rothschild. The fact was that in 1910, the United States was for all practical purposes being ruled from England, and so it is today' (Mullins, p. 47-48).*

The article was quoting a book by Eustace Mullins and Gary Kah alleging that the federal reserve bank of new york was own and controlled by foreigners giving those foreign banking interests control over the entire US federal reserve system.  The article you sent to me as a citation concludes:

&gt;*""It does not appear that the New York Federal Reserve Bank is owned, either directly or indirectly, by foreigners.""*

The article doesn't go in any way into the topic of exactly who those foreign interests are or what their history is other than a passing mention of Rothchild.  So it's not even a citation supporting your earlier claim that the economic elite have their roots in 18th century Europe - which they may very well have.  

The article only mentions the Rothschild banking dynasty as a stockholder in the eight banks that together own 63% of the new york fed, and then goes on to rather completely debunk any notion that Rothchild might be able to wield any real influence.

A *real* citation would have been regarding that point of interest, rather than a passing mention of it in an article debunking the claim of foreign control of the fed.

"&gt; Where's the confusion?

The main confusion would be your own. You're confusing a proposed solution to the conflict with an opinion about its moral/historical aspects. UN 242 says practically nothing about the latter.

&gt; It may not always be simple

My point exactly. Really, everything said after this is just redundant.

If I may go off-topic, there's another way, probably the only real way, which you completely ignored. It involves getting two sides together, and working out the best compromise they can. They can cite international law, holy books, or the third season of Ren &amp; Stimpy, but in the end, it'll be decided by politics and an alignment of interests.

&gt; I believe that starting from the principle of international law--for example that it is inadmissible to acquire territory by force

The solution would have nothing to do with that principle. Israel acquired that land by force from Jordan and Egypt, but those countries relinquished all claims to that land. In fact, Israel never annexed those territories, and probably never will. Now what?

&gt; I mean, you can go on and say it's ""simply false"", but until you say something else in support of that assertion, I don't have any reason to believe you.

So you're ignoring HAMAS's opposition to the two-state solution, the fundamental disagreements between Israel and the Fatah regarding the refugees and the definitions of ""Israel"" and ""Palestine"", and the fact that no Palestinian faction currently have the power to enforce a peace agreement, while dismissing Israel's and the US's repeated statements, actions, and indeed, motivations in support of the two-state solution as ""lip service""?

Those are well known facts. You are either completely ignorant, or incredibly biased. In any case, the burden of proof is on you.

&gt; What does this suggest to you?

That Israel, like any sovereign state, doesn't want to answer to (and, face sanctions from) a foreign organization, especially since its worst enemies have a powerful bloc there? That the US supports Israel, and wants to broker peace on its own terms?

And seriously, the US paying lip service? The US, and not the Europeans,  Egyptians or the Turks, are the driving force behind the whole peace process. If they're just pretending, then they're really overdoing it. And really, if there's one country that doesn't have to pay lip service to anyone, it's the US.

"&gt; Anecdotal evidence from sick, desperate people doesn't overrule every significant psychological study on suicide bombers to show they do what they do for similar reasons as spree shooters. See here and here. With your great respect for science surely you'd accept these conclusions or at least be willing to entertain me, as they were obtained largely through scientific inquiry?

I'm particularly drawn towards the line in the first study: *""Religion is used effectively by the Palestinian radical groups Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades to recruit suicide attackers and to raise operational funds.""* Which is pretty much what I've been saying all along. Another study that references the use of religion to recruit can be found [here](http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/1/1/5/pages241154/p241154-7.php). As for your second source, it is picked apart by this journal article [here](http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf), which concludes: *""Those who believe suicide terrorism can be explained by a single political root cause, such as the presence of foreign military forces or the absence of democracy, ignore psychological motivations, including religious inspirations, which can trump rational self-interest to produce horrific or heroic behavior in ordinary people.""*

&gt; How many of those people are liable to be potential ""terrorists?"" I see no indication that one in three Muslims are at risk of being suicide bombers just because they have problems with the West.

You're confusing points. That thread of discussion stemmed from my assertion that there will always be people who are unwilling to tolerate the existence of Western culture, and the statistics support this. I don't know how many of these are potential suicide bombers (it's hardly the point), but I know that they are raised in a religious community that has a gigantically disproportionate portion of believers who hold support and even venerate the actions of suicide bombers.

&gt; Besides that, just because 1/3 of Muslims in Britain think Western culture should be ""brought to an end"" doesn't mean they have no desire to coexist peacefully within it in the mean time. Again you're going to have to show me that these Muslims advocate violence in order to achieve that end. If you can't, there's no reason to believe this is of any significance.

A cursory skimming of the source I provided you with reveals that 6% of those surveyed supported the violent actions of the suicide bombers. Try and tell me that's an acceptable statistic.

&gt; I think you need to study your history better. The US wasn't a stalwart ally of Israel until well into the 70's. The first country to recognize the state of Israel was the Soviet Union. The ""formation and location"" of Israel had absolutely nothing to do with American evangelicals.

You're confusing points. I was not referring to the US, but to the role Christian support of Zionism (also religiously, as well as nationally) driven, that was found in the British support of the establishment of the state of Israel. I'm sure you'd argue the immediate violence towards the new Israeli state by the Islamic world had nothing to do with religion.....

&gt; So let me just get this straight: You deny the West having any role, or a at least a significant role, in Third World exploitation? Please answer this question so I'll know if I should bother to continue to reply or if I'm talking to a hopeless racist chauvinist.

I've never denied anything. I've on numerous occasions argued that the 3rd World has been raped dry of resources and wealth by the old European Empires, giving mostly bad things (like bible-code laws) in return. But whilst that explains a lot of their hardships, it doesn't absolve of responsibility the corrupt governments and dictators who are failing in their duty of care to their citizens. You don't need natural resources to have a reasonable code of laws and regulations that would prevent or at least mitigate the exploitation of their citizens.

&gt; Yes, because ""these countries"" invite multinationals, not their autocratic leaders. The Third World is well known for its competent, democratic governance that serves the will of the people.

Kind of the point I was making.

&gt; And what's ""common sense"" again? Oh yeah, mindless liberal, imperial orthodoxy that enables the perpetuation of the exploitative and murderous imperial system.

No, it's a healthy scepticism which requires a reasonable burden of proof placed on those making claims, and an extraordinary burned placed on extraordinary claims. It's holding rules of reason and logic above the blind, stupid guesswork that is the foundation of Islam, like the majority of monotheistic religions. These influence these religions have had on the world can be clearly, inversely correlated towards the social and intellectual progress of mankind. When the Roman Empire collapsed and the Church filled the vacuum, Western culture went backwards, whilst a relatively liberal religion called Islam rescued and developed the spark of Greek rationalism and scientific method. During that golden age the scientific advancements of the culture were staggering. Then the authorities tightened Islamic regulations and began taking all that shit more seriously, and that Empire regressed into the stagnant cesspool of retardation it is today.

&gt; And a person raised in the West, growing up being taught liberal orthodoxy, is much more likely to blindly excuse the wrongdoings of his culture, just as you have done.

I don't blindly excuse anything. I just do not deny the contributory factor that a culture of irrational belief plays in producing people who can be coerced into committing acts of evil in the name of religion.

An immigrant seeking to keep alive what they know and blending in to a new culture is more noble and peaceful than what the Europeans are known to have done. That quote, IMO, signifies that the ideas of colonization are still alive and well in the minds of many.

"&gt;the UK is a dualist system, so EU law must be implemented by way of national law

Ooh, that's interesting - I had assumed that every EU member state did it that way. Can you explain why and how the ""monist"" legal systems work?",,t1_c0lgeu2,worldnews,True,0,EatonRifles,,1426229801,,0,0,1,1,t1_c0lgc1u,False,False,t3_b85ye,c0lgeu2,t5_2qh13,1267551579
"I'm not an expert on German law, so this may not be completely right but I'll try to explain it as best as I can from my overall knowledge of EU law. 

Germany is a monist state. That means that when Germany signs an international treaty, that treaty has instant effect in national law. The alternative is dualism - ie the UK. In a dualist system, when an international treaty is signed, the country must also make a national law before that law has effect. Therefore in Germany, any treaty has the same effect as legislation passed by the parliament.

On your first question - if an EU law is in conflict with national legislation, the EU law will take precedence and the national law will have no effect. The case with the Data Retention Directive is different. An EU Directive MUST be implemented in national law regardless of whether the country is dualist or monist. This means that each country can choose how to implement the law in their own way. For this reason, the German constitutional court has been able to strike the law down - because it was effectively a German law, even if required by the EU. The EU can place sanctions upon any country that fails to implement EU law, including throwing the country out.

On your second question - basically you are correct. 

As to whether there's an easy way to learn this? I've been in law for over ten years now and still don't get it all! The best way would be to find a school level law/politics book as this should explain things simply and clearly.

"&gt;—In its 2007 report claiming that the Himalayan glaciers are melting, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change relied on a 1999 news story in a popular science journal, based on one interview with a little-known Indian scientist who said this was pure “speculation,” not supported by any research. The IPCC also misreported the supposed date of the glaciers’ meltdown as 2035. The Indian had suggested 2350.

So a misquotation was made.

&gt;—The IPCC report that global warming is going to kill 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest and cut African crop yields 50 percent has been found to be alarmist propaganda.

By who?

&gt;—The IPCC 2007 report declared 55 percent of Holland to be below sea level, an exaggeration of over 100 percent.

Oh, well I suppose 27.5% isn't bad at all! Either way, shouldn't we be looking at the rate of change?

&gt;—While endless keening is heard over the Arctic ice cap, we hear almost nothing of the 2009 report of the British Antarctica Survey that the sea ice cap of Antarctica has been expanding by 100,000 square kilometers **a decade for 30 years**. That translates into 3,800 square miles of new Antarctic ice every year.

Three data points. Nice. And how things were 30 years ago is vastly different from today.

&gt;—Though America endured one of the worst winters ever, while the 2009 hurricane season was among the mildest, the warmers say this proves nothing. But when our winters were mild and the 2005 hurricane season brought four major storms to the U.S. coast, Katrina among them, the warmers said this validated their theory.
You can’t have it both ways.

Who said it validated anything? I do recall reports that climate change phenomena were likely responsible for intensified storms, but nobody said storms proved climate change.

Oh, and warmer climates actually mean more snow, up to a point. Higher temperatures mean a higher vapor pressure, so that the air cannot ""hold"" as much water and more precipitation will occur. Obviously it still needs to be cold enough to snow in the first place, but you will see more snow the closer you are to that freezing point.

We've seen heavy snowfall in some areas, but we haven't seen particularly low temperatures.

&gt;—The Climate Research Center at East Anglia University, which provides the scientific backup for the IPCC, apparently threw out the basic data on which it based claims of a rise in global temperatures for the century. And a hacker into its e-mail files found CLC “scientists” had squelched the publication of dissenting views.

Nobody had squelched publication of dissenting views. The hacked emails referred to consisted of one scientist saying one particular denier paper ought to be blocked because there were very dubious claims with little evidence. But the paper was published despite him. And the paper was later debunked.

&gt;What we learned in a year’s time: Polar bears are not vanishing. Sea levels are not rising at anything like the 20-foot surge this century was to bring. Cities are not sinking. Beaches are not disappearing. Temperatures have not been rising since the late 1990s. And, in historic terms, our global warming is not at all unprecedented.

[citation needed]

&gt;Dennis Avery of Hudson Institute wrote a decade ago that from A.D. 900 to 1300, the Earth warmed by 4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit, a period known as the Little Climate Optimum.

&gt;How horrible was it?

&gt;“The Vikings discovered and settled Greenland around A.D. 950. Greenland was then so warm that thousands of colonists supported themselves by pasturing cattle on what is now frozen tundra. During this great global warming, Europe built the looming castles and soaring cathedrals that even today stun tourists with their size, beauty and engineering excellence. These colossal buildings required the investment of millions of man-hours—which could be spared from farming because of higher crop yields.”

Observed temperatures of a few degrees above average for a few centuries is not at all like what is predicted by our current models, and this misconception is the entire reason why scientists are pushing for the term ""climate change"" to replace the misnomer of ""global warming"". This is a lot more than just slightly higher temperatures. It is a vast excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere amplifying the greenhouse effect, which has long-term effects of unnatural weather patterns, and a push towards more extreme temperatures, both hot and cold.

However, I wasn't trying to make you look like an idiot, so I was going to let it slide and not call you on it.  Now that you're playing the ""I want to make you look wrong politely, so I'm goign to say I don't want you to look wrong and in so doing hold you to a higher standard than I hold myself"" game, there, it's time for you to show your own claims to be true.  Where do you see any traditional hookah smoking nation using flavored tobacco?  You'd be laughed out of any country in the middle east.  The only thing that even comes close is naklia shisha, which is flavored tobacco in the way that chinese food is flavored rice.

Do I have an internet link for that history?  No, I don't, because my education doesn't come from google.  Read Lewis Caroll's memoirs or one of the good biographies (if it doesn't talk about pedophilia, it's not a good biography).  For that matter, read almost any British author's work from that time who could be expected to know about the black market: opium dens were a problem in Britain the way Starbucks is a problem today in America, and higher society was thoroughly disgusted by the practice, so it came up in social commentary a lot.  CS Lewis, Charles Dickens, etc, lots of other authors talk about it.

It happened in other cultures, too.  Tolstoy talked about it, for example.

The hookah is originally for hash and opium.  I was going to let that go because I didn't want to have some meaningless drawn out argument with a redditor who imagined himself savvy regarding middle eastern history, but since you're digging in for facts, let's do this.  The hookah is from India, which didn't have tobacco when it was invented.  It wasn't until the hookah had gotten into Persia (modern-day Iran) before someone applied it to Tombeik, which is a rudimentary tobacco.  When that happened, the tobacco went back to India, which significantly increased trade, like a small spice road.

Hookah isn't even the Indian word for it.  Hookah is what the Persians called it.  They're properly called ""ghelune"".

Why would the hookah be haram if it was for tobacco?  Tobacco isn't haram.  Opium is.

The reason hookahs spread into Europe was that opium dens knew that four people on opium would look at a shared piece of drug and think of it as all-their-own, allowing the opium den to charge more for what amounted to less.  There is no shortage of photographs of people smoking machine rolled cigarettes in front of their hookah.  Why would they be doing that if they were smoking nargile?

&gt; That sounds like rational behavior to me.

Nobody said anything about your behavior.  Given that your position doesn't have a rationale, it isn't rational.  Spin that word as hard as you want.

&gt; Even if I had excellent logic, my hazy ideas about the mechanisms would have undermined accuracy - look at Aristotle.

Nobody said anything about your accuracy.

&gt; Incredible thinker, completely wrong about the composition of the universe.

Er.  Aristotle's idea of the universe was quite a bit closer to correct than the 1200 years of people that followed him, despite that they had better data.  If you think that's an indictment of the power of appropriate logic, I don't know what to tell you.  Almost the only egregious error he made was the celestial spheres, which were famously maintained until Kepler's time as the global belief.  

In the meantime, he understood elemental chemistry, natural selection and motive physics, something most people in Europe in the 1600s still had wrong.  Aristotle's contemporaries also had calculus before Newton/Leibnitz, the factory line before Henry Ford, and had so many other things nailed early (fallacy, logic, mode of government, popular behavior, etc) that here nearly 2500 years later, we're still using the terminology they - and in some cases, he - coined.

I don't know why you think he was completely wrong about the composition of the universe.  By and on the whole, he was correct.  He understood that the sun was a giant pile of fire, he understood that celestial bodies were in orbit (though he misunderstood why), et cetera.

&gt; and it was fairly lazy to post it to reddit knowing I'd get a response instantly confirming or denying the accuracy of my ideas. To quote Fred Schneider, ""before I talk, I should read a book."" But I don't think you can extrapolate that I'm terrible at science from that.

I didn't.  My observation that you're terrible at science comes from a very different root, and is not an extrapolation at all.  I also didn't say anything nearly so melodramatic: what I said was that the thing you were doing at the time was not science despite your claims, and that I wondered whether you knew what science was.

It's unfortunate that you feel the need to put such ugly words into my mouth.  Unfortunate, disingenuous, and arguably dishonest.  Why are you trying to vilify me?

Also, given that you even admit don't know what the scientific method is, what it's for or why it matters, how can you take the position that you aren't terrible at science?  Isn't that kind of like a guy saying ""I don't know how to play an instrument or sing, I don't know any songs and I don't know tonal structure, but that doesn't mean I'm not terrible at music?""

Do you really think that just because you want to do science means you aren't bad at it?  Do you really think you can fail to understand the sole principle on which a field is build as well as its importance, correct usage and application, and yet not be terrible at that field?

What would it take, in your eyes, to be terrible at science?  You mean sticking a bunch of unrelated sciency-sounding words together at random angles without data or underlying mechanism really isn't enough?

&gt; Probably, the fact that I've done chemistry for a while now and have no experience at all with physics or biology has something to do with the comparative dumbness of my original post.

Nope.  The difference between chemistry and alchemy is the thing you said you don't know about.

"I don't think it is America's responsibility to liberate the oppressed through military force. I don't remember who said it, but democracy does not come from the barrel of a gun. The culture must evolve to accept it. Otherwise, unless the US is willing to go bare knuckles and kill massive numbers of people to force them to change their ways, we will be trapped in a quagmire which we will not be able to extricate ourselves from short of another Vietnam. Ironically, Britain helped us in Iraq, when they tried to do the same thing in 1921. They should have known better. That's why the rest of ""Old Europe"" decided not to get involved. They've been at this game a lot longer than America, and after WWII, mostly got out of it. It is self-defeating.

Let's look at the Taliban. The Taliban was actually an improvement in Afghanistan, after the collapse of the socialist government reduced the country to anarchy and civil war. The problems the Pakistani government is having with the Taliban are of their own making. The ISI - Pakistan's CIA - has aided and abetted the Taliban, and has even harbored them. They created their own mess (with a lot of help from us, too). Pakistan must solve this problem.

Let's look at Al Qaeda. They are a criminal organization. They can talk big about fighting a ""war"" against the West, but they have no more capacity to do this than the Mafia. We didn't take out the Mafia by bombing Sicily. We took them out by calculated strikes against their leadership. Al Qaeda should be dealt with similarly. We should be engaged with the *police forces* and intelligence agencies of our allies to root out safehouses in places like Hamburg. We should have sent in special forces to capture Osama Bin Laden like we did Noriega. Instead of trying to smash Al-Qaeda with wild swings of a huge hammer and toppling countries, we should be making small, surgical strikes.

In fact, I remember after 9/11, Bush made a speech when he first announced the War on Terror.

"Why quote from a random patent? Let's talk about the real one which sparked this:

[The multitouch patent](http://www.google.com/patents?id=uuioAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false)

I'm not exactly sure what the ""claim"" is, but I'm guessing this (it says ""abstract"", correct me if I'm wrong):

&gt;A multi-touch system is disclosed that recognizes simultaneous touchdown of four fingers on, above, or below the home row of keys as a modifier chord and applies modifiers such as Shift, Ctrl, or Alt to subsequent touch activity until none of the chord fingertips remain touching. Touches by the thumb of the modifier chord hand that occur before any modifiable typing or clicking activity cause the modifier chord to be canceled and reinterpreted as hand resting. The Shift modifier may be released temporarily during thumb keypresses that are intermixed with typing of capitalized characters. Distributing the modifier chord touches across different zones or key rows selects multiple modifiers. In an alternative embodiment, different modifiers can be selected with different arrangements of the fingers relative to one another within the chord, irrespective of absolute hand alignment with the touch surface.

The first line pretty much sums it up, four fingers touching at once (I incorrectly assumed it was only two). That's pretty vague to me, which is why it wasn't allowed in Europe. They don't want anyone else to be able to use touch screens with many touches at once, end of story.

"&gt; I did not such thing. In fact I explicitly condemned such things. You're projecting your own insecurities regarding your participation in the murderous imperialist system.

Hmm, you've defended Osama Bin Laden by suggesting that he's *only killing civilians because he can't kill the military*. That's apologism. And the more time you use phrases like *""murderous imperialism""* the less impact it has.

&gt; That's in the real world, not in the ridiculous hypothetical super weapon scenario you highlighted. This is why I find hypotheticals like that incredibly silly: They have absolutely no basis in the real world which shapes our decisions.

On the contrary, it is very easy to see what a world where Osama Bin Laden has absolute power. Take a look at Afghanistan under Taliban rule. He has gone on record with his support of this regime that practiced genocide, and murdered its citizens for no good reason.

&gt;This is vile revisionism. First of all, Muslims in the Middle East had no particular problem with Jews until the state of Israel.

Now this *is* revisionism. There are numerous examples in history leading up to the formation of Israel when Jews were transgressed by Middle-Eastern muslims. Granted, the persecution of Christian Europe (and the charge of deicide) just as bad, but we have (to name a few):

- Massacres in Palestine (1929)
- The murder of 300,000 Jews in Morocco over a 16-year period between 1864 and 1880 (wow, that's cold, I didn't even know about that)
- 1840 Damascus affair (and subsequent riots)
- Prevalent support for and collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War among Islamic countries.
- The concept of *dhimma* in countries under Islamic theocratic rule, which restricts the freedoms and humiliates the dhimma (in accordance with the Koran). 

I would say the Middle-East had frequent issues with Jews (unsurprising as their holy scripture calls Jews the ""greediest of mankind""), certainly sufficient for them to continue to fear for their safety, and so wish for a state of their own to end the cycle of persecution (there was also the small of their systematic extermination in Nazi-occupied Europe), though you seem to imply that the Jews had no good reason to wish to not live in an Islamic country under Sharia law. It is simpleminded and reductionist to claim the partition was unfair because of Jewish minority, because it completely overlooks the purpose of the state, which was to swell under the numbers of Jews fleeing to a state that will, for the first time in modern history, actually look out for their best interests.

&gt;I guess you just have go to for the atheism reddit to find people using this tired bigotry, despite the fact that when doing so they are supporting the actions of a murderous theocratic regime.

Steady on cowboy. Please explain how me saying ""I can see why they react to these things"" is any more supporting their actions than you saying ""I can see why suicide bombers do the things they do"" is supporting the actions of suicide bombers? Looks like yet another example of your double standards. And last time I checked Israel was a democratic republic.

&gt; If you think Israel hasn't been the transgressor in the Middle East (to say ""Muslim world"" is a misnomer, since again most of Israel's historical allies have been secular Arab governments) then you're either a shill or a useful idiot.

I think anyone who views the opposing sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict with anything less than condemnation for both sides is either guilty of bias, or knows something that is unavailable to the public domain. Calling either side the ""transgressor"" (as you seem to) is a refusal to acknowledge the imperfect knowledge and conflicting accounts of various key incidents, and the sure truth that who ""fired the first shot"" will always depend on where you start time running from. It is arrogant to presume perfect understanding, and infantile to think that it matters when deciding on how to solve the gigantic mess.

Edit: Another funny thing about your way of thinking is that you appear happy to support international law when it supports your argument (""Illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq, Israel's illegal occupation of territories etc.""), but you throw it out when it suits you (""They were right to oppose this ruling""). Make your mind up! Either international law is worthwhile and must be respected, or it's useless and should be ignored for the greater moral good.

"&gt; Or if you're taught that the bible is fact.

In generational terms, though, that's only growth if the religion retains, on average, 3 children per family.  If you have two siblings, all of whom are taught that the Bible is fact, and one of them converts to another religion or renounces religion altogether, then your religion has only sustained itself over a generation, not grown.

My point is that, if you boil the growth of religion down to indoctrination, then you have to back that explanation by demonstrating birth rates, low infant mortality rates, retention rates, and so on.  Historically, though, it's clear that conversion has played a differential role even when there's no reason to suppose that birth rates differed significantly between two competing religious groups.

&gt; Many people are forced to deal with christianity and accept otherwise they don't get aid, and they starve.

I don't actually see much evidence of that, though.  In the case of Africa, for example, aid seems to have been less of a factor than the overt colonization of the last century.  Belgian, English and French governments ran the educational system, and put it, in many cases, in the hands of Jesuits, which promoted the growth of Christianity in the region.  I'd say that's probably more complicated than indoctrination, but to simplify things, we can call it that for now.  Part of the catch here is that, while that indoctrination *did* increase Christianity's hold on the country, the moment European-Christian interests released their hold, those gains began to reverse themselves.  So now we witness the overt resurgence of native religion and culture, as well as the incursion of Islam in previously Christian regions.

"The first sightings occurred in November 1944, when pilots flying over Germany by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas tree lights and reported that they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved as if under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name - in the European Theater of Operations they were often called ""kraut fireballs"" but for the most part called ""foo-fighters"". The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.[9]

"This is my take on it. (and btw, I've always had guns.) In some parts of the world, guns are as common and useful as wearing shoes. If you happen to live in a place where the government discourages not only the 'wearing of shoes' but also even keeping them on a shoe tree in your closet, then perhaps you should avoid shoes.

Yeah, it may not be the best possible analogy, but it's the first one that came to mind. 

Guns are a tool. They project a small piece of metal fairly rapidly out of a hole in the direction it's pointed. Sometimes a tool like this can be very useful. It can also be enjoyable to work on the skill of getting that piece of metal to end up going where you want it to. (Golf comes to mind here as having similar difficulties in achieving this.)

As for you personally? Living in Europe may make it impractical and difficult to do. If you ever move to a place where gun ownership is not so discouraged, it may be something to look into. Being a responsible gun user and owner *can* give one a perspective on life in general that is otherwise difficult to obtain.

"There's the possibility of the Falklands issue turning into another shooting war, although this time there is more unity and anti-western sentiment which could turn it into a more regional conflict (think the West vs. the South). It could easily turn into Britain, with limited help from the US (and puppet Colombia) and maybe a European country here and there, vs the majority of South America and maybe some Central American/Caribbean countries. That war could last several months. However, I think it's more likely that diplomacy will prevent that from happening.

The most likely conflict we'll see occur in the next decade or so is a confrontation between the US and China. China is itching for a fight and behaving provocatively, and to a certain extent, the US is as well. China very much wants to challenge US power in the Far East and could easily win a short war. I've seen very plausible scenarios laid out by people more knowledgeable than I about how China could use the pretext of a naval incident (they destroy a US Navy ship, claim it was an internal explosion/accident, then await a US response) to shift the balance of power in the region decidedly in their favor. The US would be forced to either look like they're turning an accident into a pretext for war, or do nothing and accept the loss while sitting on their hands (neither is particularly attractive). If the US responds with military force, things would spiral out of control very quickly. China would likely target US bases and naval vessels in the area with a deadly barrage of cruise and ballistic missiles, making it difficult or impossible for the US to mount attacks of their own without bringing in more naval forces. After dealing their devastating blow, the Chinese would likely sue for peace, making further retaliation against them impossible. China would come out as the victors and the US would be left picking up the pieces of their bases and ships. The balance of power would shift very far away from the US if that were to happen.

If that happens, a third world war would be all the more probably as the US, now a wounded giant, would be all the more dangerous as it would be looking to reassert itself as the global powerhouse it used to be. This could come in the form of the US asserting itself further in Europe and Central Asia against Russia, or reasserting itself more aggressively in East Asia. They would likely be far more aggressive in this action, which would lead to further provocation on both sides, which might cause a repeat incident with China or the US openly supporting minor conflicts against Russia (like sending combat troops to help Georgia in a future skirmish). If a minor incident were to break out, the US would be much more willing to use it as a pretext for revenge, which would make the conflict spread around the world as allies backed each other and those  that wanted to stand against US and Western powers did so.",,t1_c0lhlt8,history,True,0,[deleted],,1426230358,,0,0,3,3,t3_b8h40,False,False,t3_b8h40,c0lhlt8,t5_2qh53,1267584283

"Well, he made a poorer defense at least. His case was on iffy ground (although it should be noted that it was only narrowly affirmed 5-4) to begin with. Reading the majority opinion, Rehnquist notes, ""In Spencer v. Texas... this Court upheld the very statute employed here, noting in the course of its opinion that similar statutes had been sustained."" So apparently Rummel didn't really argue with the constitutionality of the law itself but claimed his circumstance was extra special enough to get him off the hook. Getting the Supreme Court to claim C&amp;U for prison time is just about impossible. Not to mention that the default sentence for the third felony he got was life WITH possibility of parole in 12 years. That seems kind of bad but as it turns out his three felonies on their own could have netted him up to 25 years so...cruel and unusual prison time? Not really all things considered.

I am in no way shape or form a judicial scholar, so I may be wrong on some of this stuff, but I think the gist is correct. The conservative Supreme Court didn't do anything wrong per se. I think sheerheartattack above elaborated very well on a big misconception of the role of the Supreme Court. It's not a European style court where the government can approach them and ask them to examine all the possible constitutional problems with a certain piece of legislation. The Supreme Court must (to my understanding) be approached with a case that has gone through the proper channels in order to examine the validity of the law as it relates to the Constitution. And the Court is not handed a law and asked ""Is this constitutional?"" They are handed two arguments about the constitutionality of a law and they determine which one is valid.

It seems like a insignificant distinction but it's pretty important. The Constitution itself is an extremely vague document. I mean shit we still don't know what the 2nd Amendment means. For the Supreme Court to examine a law in full and make the arguments for the parties (Like some redditors are saying: ""rah rah clearly *something* is wrong with this law they should invalidate it!"") introduces a world of biases and potential for tyranny of the Court. The Constitution is subjective and the appointments are political, so it is kind of necessary to keep judgement contained to the arguments presented to them. Although this does sometime lead to messed up situations where someone loses a case because they focused on the wrong point. For a great example of this see the brilliant [Brandeis concurrence in Whitney v. California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_v._california#The_Brandeis_concurrence). His response is sort of like ""Girl you messed up you should have argued first amendment shiiiiiiit"".

All this for a people who collectively account for approximately 2% of our population, whom by comparison make blacks look like a supermajority.  In reality they are not a race, much less a chosen race, but a tight knit ethnic, cultural, and religious group whose people were dispersed from Provincia Judaea by the Romans 2000 years ago.

"                 HIMALAYAN CRYSTAL SALT
                 GA R A M B U K I T TULIN
Himalayan salt lamps are naturally formed powerful tools that can be used for relaxation and meditation with glowing hues of red, orange and amber Himalayan salt lamps are amazing, made from centuries old raw materials formed into lamps or candle holders can create a warm feeling in any room or office. That’s all well and good but how do salt lamps work?” Himalayan salt lamps affect different people in different ways; however the overwhelming response is that these salt rock lamps are helping people find peace. The color is naturally soothing as is a camp fire or a nice sunset and let’s not forget about the negative ions that are generated by the lamps as well. 
When the earth was still in the beginning stages of formation, massive pressures and colliding continents caused the Himalayan Mountains to form. Actually the ocean that existed at that time was forced inside what is now called the Himalayan Mountains. These vast Mineral salt deposits developed beneath the surface, and the mountainous pressure and mineral content created a perfect environment for these crystals to evolve. Himalayan salt lamps are not actually created by the mountains but by hand, without the use of nasty chemicals and other unnatural materials. Hand crafted natural products are what we suggest to any home and the energy they create is amazing but there is more to learn. 
What are your salt lamps used? They are great to help one ad natural component to a home or office. In Fact the color spectrum is known to have a positive effect on the human body. First and foremost, Salt lamps work in much the same way as the fresh ocean air works. The salt evaporation negatively changes oxygen molecules and helps to create a protective of cloud of relaxation. One needs to be able to tap into that energy and want do feel the difference. There are always those that don’t get the higher realms of thought or feeling but we do not worry about them as they will eventually get the opportunity to awaken or not. The places where one can place a lamp is almost endless and if one is thinking about a gift it is one that will last forever. 
For decades Americans have been seeking relief from what ails them. Now with salt lamps you have a possible gift for some relief. The salt lamps act much like the salt caves do in Europe and other salt museums where people go below ground and stay overnight in the salt mines and have reported some profound relief regarding salt caves. 
One might also ask how many salt lamps one needs; well we suggest strongly that one consider several as one for the bedroom, office and living area is a great to start!
Himalayan Water and Salt  (Garam Bukit Tulin)
The human body is composed of water and salt. Natural Himalayan crystal salt contains all of the natural minerals and trace elements that make up the human body. Though vitamins and proteins are not found in water or salt, the elements that make up their complicated molecular chains are present in water and salt. In fact, water, salt and light are energy forms that construct highly geometrically structured chain links that are – biochemically – identical to vitamins and proteins. This is why sole, a mixture of water and salt, is such an important life-builder and worth incorporating into your daily life. One might consider sole as the equivalent of ‘liquid sunlight’ and obviously it relates to the ancient oceans from where we all came. 
Water and salt have different crystalline structures. 250 million years ago, light energy evaporated the primal oceans and created salt, which is essentially energy. When water is added the structure of salt changes and can easily penetrate the body’s cells allowing the potential of this energy to be released. 
The atomic structure of salt is actually electrical which makes it so transformable. Salt does not need to be broken down into sugars or acids, it always remains salt. Salt allows information to travel between our cells and produces our actions and thoughts. A lack of salt is critical, similar to a modern-day power outage. At the same time crystal salt helps us remain balanced and in harmony with ourselves and surroundings. 
Basic table salt is only sodium chloride. It has been chemically stripped of all of the other elements and has no positive benefit. Many of us are accustomed to adding salt to ‘flavor’ our food. But the real importance of salt is its vibration pattern, and again, this is only found in crystal salt. Seek it out next time you want to purchase salt and avoid buying basic grocery store white table salt. 
Historic Importance Throughout time, people have known about and valued the importance of salt. Many European cities are named after salt and the word ‘salary’ actually means payment by salt. The Celtic word for salt is ‘Hall’ and many towns and cities known for their salt deposits have the word ‘hall’ in their name. 

Himalayan Crystal Solay or Sole'
Sole or Solay the Himalayan Salt Elixir. A great natural way to help your body increase its own immune functions while providing essential nutrients. 
Himalayan salt provides a non toxic way to add nutrients and minerals to your body. Our salt is made or harvested by hand and is without pollutants. 
Sole (so-lay), our crystal salt mixed with water is the called the elixir of life. The eroupeans use the word sole came from the word sol, which means the sun. So the brine solution is the fluid state of the sun or light energy. The theory is the salt being natural and the sun being a fine source of vitamin D combines to make a powerful drink we now call so lay. 
“Combine your mental and physical balance and one will achieve wellbeing”. This salt mixture system causes the molecules to be hydrolyzed. This brine solution creates an immediate and yet lasting vibration in the body. The natural energy pattern will help restore your natural functions and remove stubborn toxins. 
To create your own sole, loosely fill a glass with several Himalayan crystal salts or several tablespoons of Himalayan Salt grains. Fill the glass with your favorite mountain spring water. Check if the crystals have been dissolved completely. If the crystals were dissolved, add some more crystal. The salt will stop dissolving when the mixture is correct in other words the salt finds its own balance and you will to. Now take one tablespoon of this mixture and ad to eight ounces of water every morning. You mind and body will thank you. 
Welcome to age old wisdom and the combining of natural health.

"&gt; why is an ethnicity 'threatened' when other ethnicities are allowed to live in the same region? what does that even mean?

Ethnicities are genetically different groups within a race, and immigration in large enough numbers will alter the genetics of the unique host ethnicity, particularly if the host ethnicity has less dominant genes. Culture is also a concern, particularly if a particular ethnicity is less prone to assimilate. Polish culture shouldn't overtly affect or change British culture, for example. 

&gt; i find every single one of your claims questionable, and i don't see that you've explained/supported any of them (except the ""larger entities make it harder to influence the gov't"" part).

It is rather simple; every race, ethnicity, culture and language should be preserved. 

Too many immigrants, particularly of more genetically distant people, will greatly affect the host people to the host people's detriment. Too many immigrants can also lead to cultural tension, particularly if the people immigrating have a very foreign culture; Europeans all have a very similar culture, which makes assimilation (like with the colonial countries) much more natural and easier. 

Multiculturalism does not promote diversity, it destroys diversity. Nationalism preserves diversity by allowing all peoples of any race, ethnicity, culture and language to preserve their people as independent and unique. This means that we have far more unique peoples, cultures and languages that actually enrich our species as a whole. We share our planet together, and have tools such as the internet which connect us without destroying the integrity of our races, ethnicities, cultures and languages.

"I understand states powers have eroded since the US's inception, but as I understand it the US was setup from the start to have the federal level as far more powerful ?

It is not idealism to say the EU will never be like this.  One vital way European nations differ from US states is that citizens have an allegiance and identification with their nationality going back centuries and in some case millennia.  Which is why someone will always be French, Irish or Italian first and European second.  Americans rarely have this kind of identification with their state over and above being American.

Secondly, the EU in its successive forms from its days as the EEC has always structured itself to have national governments firmly in charge.  The high watermark of its integrationalist efforts was forming the Eurozone and the pooling of sovereignty that took.  It's further incremental changes in that direction with the Nice and Lisbon treaties, have been unpopular, and barely passed into law.

"&gt;You ought to pick up manners and debate ethics. I've read Marx. As you can see from my reference to the manifesto.

Anyone can do that and not read what one sites.  It's clear that this is the case with you because the section that you cited doesn't actually show what you believe it shows.

&gt;It is simply nonsense to claim that Marx thought socialism and communism was the same thing.

Oh, well, in that case, with strong evidence like that, what was I thinking!?

&gt;As I've already said, he used socialism as a description of the wider movement that was concerned with worker rights, while communism is the true revolutionary party that represent the true ideology of the masses.  He doesn't use the terms interchangeably, he for example always refers to his own movement as 'communists', and not socialists.

I suggest that you actually *read* The Communist Manifesto and not rely on third party interpretations.  He does use them interchangeably.  READ his works.

&gt;In the last chapter of the manifesto he even says that the communists should join the ""socialist-democratic party"". It is quite obvious that the writers of the manifesto did not mean that communism and socialism is the same thing.

[Facepalm]

Socialism != Socialist-Democratic Party!

&gt;But all of this is really not all that relevant to the fact that Marxism, socialism and communism are all different things, especially in a modern perspective.

You mean *only* in the modern perspective.  Not from Marx himself.

&gt;The fact that you mention Trotsky and the existence of the host of different socialist and communist direction that have existed in the 20th century only serves to further undermine your non-existent argument.

You obviously did not understand what I said.  That is about Lenin.  I said that socialists never agree with each other.  Lenin used political-speech to differentiate the two.  My argument that still stands is that Marx himself did not differentiate between the two.

&gt;Even if Marx used the phrase interchangeably (which he didn't), there is still no doubt to the fact that communism, marxism, and socialism are different entities.

He did use them interchangeably, and the difference only exists in modern interpretations of Marx, not Marx himself.

&gt;Regarding the European Union, it legislates trade between nations because if it didn't, they would legislate it on a national basis and thus hamper free trade.

Total crap.  You are misunderstanding the nature of regulation.  The introduction of managed trade across countries, if it is going to result in more free trade, is not the result of the managing part.  It is a result of the abolition of local regulations.  A newer, larger government is not required for this to take place.  You are committing the ex post ergo propter hoc fallacy.

&gt;Not at all, since you claim that marxism is socialism is communism is the EU. Then when I show that the EU isn't classical marxism, you say irrelevant. Give me a break.

It is irrelevant to the main point of contention, which is that you are incorrect by insisting that Marx did not use socialism and communism interchangeably.

&gt;Wrong. You can regulate the trade of banana without regulating how the banana is produced.

Banana is the final product.  You said the means by which the means of production are regulated.  That means everything that goes into producing bananas is regulated.  That means the means of production are regulated.

&gt;In short, the EU is not socialism at all.

It is ""socialist"" because the EU is a governmental body that regulates the trade of means of production across Europe.  That is socialist based by definition.

"&gt; What do Estonians think about Americans?

In the 1990s, just as we gained our independence, you were seen as a sort of ""rich uncles"", because most everyone had some distant relative (WW2 refugees) who was living in USA or Canada and was much better off than your average Estonian.

Nowadays you're mostly made fun of and seen as stupid, evil capitalists who go around blowing up poor people to get oil.

The underlying mental shift seems to have been ""America is a paradise I want to move to"" -&gt; ""I know enough about America to not want to go live there permanently"".

&gt; Also I'm African American, so I'd really like to know how people from other countries consider Af Am's to be?

We still commonly use the word ""neeger"" to refer to black people here. When we use it to describe you, we don't mean it as an insult. It's just a historical curiosity of our language. The alternative would be to call you ""must"" (""black"") but the word also means ""dirty"" in our language and we don't want to call you ""dirty"", so we call you ""neeger"", which is a lot more neutral *in our language.*

I should also note that we tend to colloquially use the word ""neeger"" to also describe people who work way too hard for very little pay. In a way it's a reference to African Americans as slaves. The word, when used in that context, has some negative connotations, but we don't use the word in such a way as to mean that all black people should be slaves. Quite the contrary, in fact.

You see, Estonians were slaves themselves for over 700 years under the feudal lords of rich European countries who at one time or another had conquered our lands. We still sometimes refer to bad bosses with the same word we used for estate owners to whom we belonged as slaves: ""mõisnik"". The equivalent in English would probably be ""master"".

So when we use the word ""neeger"" to describe someone who works too hard, it's more of a sort of recognition of kinship with the African American slaves. Basically we're using one of your words to describe a concept which we all innately understand, but for which we don't have a better word.

All in all, we don't have enough experience with those of the dark skin persuasion to really have developed any sort of cultural understanding of you. I've seen only one black person on the streets here in Tartu (second biggest city of Estonia) this year and he seemed rather lost and confused.

There have been incidents of racism towards black people in Estonia, but, if anything, it's because we don't know you well enough.

&gt; I think it's close to Russia

Yup. Our eastern neighbours. We were part of the Soviet Union from the end of WW2 (we had no choice -- we were conquered by the Red Army) till early 1990s when the Soviet Union crumbled.

&gt; I'm guessing your culture is similar to Russian culture??

Much less so than you would think, actually. Most of the border between Estonia and Russia runs through Lake Peipus, which has hindered cultural communication.

Culturally we're much closer to Finland, which is just 80 km to the north of us, over a part of the Baltic Sea.

"forced? 
To make this perfectly clear for even the last idiots around here, it is called stupidity. Now a few fun facts. 

**Fact 1**: homeschooling is illegal in Germany and guess what 
the majority in Germany has no problem at all with that fact. 
You see that is how democracy works, the majority decides. 

**Fact 2**: if you break the law you are in trouble, 
especially if you do it more than once. 

**Fact 3**: if you don't like the laws in a democracy you have 3 options. 
You can break them, see fact 2, you can try to change them, see 
fact 1, or you can leave, see fact 4.

**Fact 4**: this one is what makes this story so unbelievable stupid. 
Germany is part of the EU, now bear with me, what is so great about the EU 
is that I as a German can move to say Spain, or the other way around, 
work and live there without big bureaucratic hassle. 
You still with me? Fine, so lets see what we have south of Germany's border, 
ah yes Austria (no not the one with the kangaroos). 
Austria, you know the one from the moronic movie ""Sound of Music"" 
which btw not many Germans or Austrians have ever seen, has 3 pros 
which pertain to this case. 
First the language spoken there is German (mind-blowing I know), 
second they have roughly the same culture (and history) as we Germans do 
and third, now here comes the kicker, they allow homeschooling, surprise!!!

So to sum it up, moving to the other end of the world, with your kids, 
where nobody speaks your language and the cultural background is strange, 
instead of just moving  1 or 2 hundred kilometers south, where only the flag 
and the name behind the title of chancellor is different,

"&gt;That is why these arguments never get anywhere. The burka and niqab are quite obviously sexist, and if it's not obvious there is a sound argument from evolutionary psychology that should convince anyone who is actually willing accept that the burka could be sexist but just needs evidence that it is so.

Well, that's something I can't agree with, because you have not demonstrated that it is sexist. It's a style of clothing. There is nothing inherently sexist about a piece of cloth that is wrapped around the entire human body.

&gt;China doesn't allow foot binding, that was banned in 1911 with the death penalty for anyone that continued it. In the West we no-longer have organ damaging corsets, but if some small religious group started forcing their daughters to wear them I wouldn't have an issue with them being banned. We also don't allow female genital mutilation (we should also ban male circumcision too).

Except those things are not styles of clothing. They are physical intrusions into the bodies of women. Are you seriously trying to compare cutting off a clitoris to wrapping a sheet around yourself?

&gt;And while they remain in the realm of ideas and words, we can use words to counter them. If the ideas if those sexist books turn in to action though, we'll often take action to counter that. The burka is not something that is limited to the realm of ideas and words, it is oppressing women in the real world right now.

But the way you're talking is as though the burka is currently the only way that sexism is exhibited throughout Europe. There is plenty of sexism and misogyny directed towards European women, regardless of ethnicity or religion. This is all legal. For example, look at the British National Party's agenda. They are almost certainly misogynist. They wield far more political power than any constituent that advocates burkas for everyone (which I doubt even exists). There are far bigger problems that face women in Europe today. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

"&gt; I've heard that the new generation has turned their backs on the traditional Estonian activities and culture.

We still check out each other naked in saunas. And traditional foods are eaten on traditional holidays. There's not much else in terms of activities and culture, really.

It does.

&gt; While Tallinn and Tartu are doing well I hear the rest of the country is struggling.

This is very true. I'm originally from a small town called Viljandi and my parents still live there. Still, European Union funding is helping to make places like that a lot more attractive.

&gt; I lived there for several years about 13 years ago and am hesitant to go back because the cultural component was such an attractive part of the country.

Wow! How did you end up here 13 years ago? And what did you like most about our culture?

I've never been there myself, so I wouldn't know about Valga :(

"&gt; So the King long ago who is persuaded to convert to Christianity already has respect from the people. He is converted, he then forces conversation upon others. After all, do you want to say you believe or have your head cut off?

That's two different arguments -- respect for authority v. fear of reprisal.  Let's break it down into two different examples to see how each works out.

When Isabella and Ferdinand drove the Moors out of Spain, a significant Muslim and Jewish population was left behind.  The new Empire gave them a choice -- renounce your old religion and be baptized, or have your families broken and driven out of Spain in poverty.  Many were driven out.  Those who stayed behind were a continual risk of ""relapse,"" and many were only nominally Christian, secretly keeping to their old faith even at risk of discovery by the Inquisition.  The point is, as a historian, you can't trust compelled conversions, and it's practically impossible to chart exactly when non-Christian belief finally dwindled away to nothing in Imperial Spain.  The exiled simply took their religions with them, while the apparent conversions tended towards syncretism or covert worship.

On the other hand, during the four centuries between the Fall of Rome and the reign of Charlemagne, Christianity was often spread by fiat.  Missionaries would convert kings, the kings would declare Christianity the official religion of the kingdom, and that was that, right?  Well, sort of.  There's no clear way of measuring how many subjects of such kingdoms actually adopted Christian religion.  It *is* clear, however, that Germanic paganism persisted even after the whole of the Frankish Empire became officially Christian.  The actual process seems to have been much more gradual.  The subjects of a converted king may have been officially Christian, but in terms of creed and practice, they remained pagan.  What it ultimately took was a modification from both ends.  The king would replace pagan holy sites with Christian chapels; pagan rituals would be adapted to fit Christian holidays; sanction was given for the cult of the saints as a stand in for pagan polytheism; and so on.  Respect for authority actually does remarkably little to explain the de-paganization of Europe, and the process ended up being generational and syncretic.",,t1_c0lijmm,atheism,True,0,blackstar9000,,1426230796,,0,0,1,1,t1_c0lhyom,False,False,t3_b8fvi,c0lijmm,t5_2qh2p,1267630981

"Asian culture?  Really?  How would you describe ""Asian culture""?

&gt; Originally it started out as explanations for things like thunder and lightning, why tribe members got sick or why the tribe went through periods of plenty as well as famine.

Ask yourself this: How do you know religion got started that way?  What's your evidence for that?  Do you recall where you first came across that idea?

I'd suggest that one reason that particular origin story is so popular these days is that it facilitates the direct comparison of religion to science.  You didn't even break paragraph before transitioning to that theme.

&gt; So after a couple hundred years, why isn't India primarily Christian?

That's a palpably weird question.  Why would the fact that religions *can* jump cultural boundaries mean that a particular religion, like Christianity, necessarily *would* dominate another culture into which it has been introduced?  The very fact that there are an estimated 24 million Christians, and 138 million Muslims, in India ought to illustrate my point well enough.  If that's not good enough for you, consider the spread of Buddhism into China and Japan.  Or the initial spread of Christianity out of the primarily Jewish communities in the Levant, into Ethiopia and across Roman and Germanic/Scandinavian Europe, through the Caucasus into Russia, and eventually across Atlantic into the Americas.  Religions jump cultures all the time, a fact that you can, of course, easily mitigate by using the term culture to means something obtuse and abstract.

&gt; They're more likely to be Hindu, Buddhist or any number of other Eastern religions, but Christianity still makes up a fraction of a percent of their populations.

Actually, more like 2.3%.  That's pretty small, but it also makes Christianity the third largest religion in the country, after Islam and Hinduism.  Sikhs come in at number 4, with about 1.9% of the population.  All other religions make up less than 2%, including Buddhism which nearly went extinct in India, and is now hovering at about 0.8% of the population.

&gt; Conquest, which is authority by right of the sword, explains the growth of Christianity more than any other reason.

Conquest (ironically) explains the post Medieval growth of Christianity.  Its initial growth outside the cradle of Levantine Jewish groups cannot be explained by conquest, and the conquests of later eras never would have been possible without that initial growth.

Note that, to a certain degree, I'm agreeing with you here -- conquest *can* be a tool for the spread and growth of religion.  But it cannot, on its own, explain that growth, and I suspect that it's a more difficult tool to use than more organic forms of growth.  Consider your earlier example.  From at least the 16th century until only about 65 years ago, India was a nation conquered and ruled by foreign powers with their own religious traditions.  And yet, as you've pointed out, India remains predominantly Hindu.  Conversion as an element of conquest seems to require a concerted dismantling of prior religious institutions and generations spent imposing the imperial religion on the subjected populations.  Very few fledgling religions have the resources to manage that, so even an answer like ""conquest"" still fails to account for the growth of most religions.",,t1_c0limdl,atheism,True,0,blackstar9000,,1426230832,,0,0,2,2,t1_c0lijsc,False,False,t3_b8fvi,c0limdl,t5_2qh2p,1267633149

"Hi, Mr. Origianal 3rd downvote here,

It was three minutes in I might add, if you're trying to keep a chronological tab on things.

People might be compensating in not voting for anti-Palestine stories, you see most of the media in the US won't, or wouldn't until recently even contemplate,  publicising an anti-Israeli story so you probably need to take into account certain geo-politics and counter-lobby reactionary movements when considering the Reddit effect.

Secondly you might consider that people feel uncomfortable openly criticising Palestinians, even though they too are responsible for many things which just shouldn't happen, because clearly the Palestinians are the little guys here, the net oppressed, the hard done by in reality.

Don't make it about ""THE JEWS"" as you put it.  Sure, for some commenters that is what it is about.  Most however don't have any problem with Jewish people whatsoever.  Jon Stewart seems to have an exclusive side entrance to the Reddit front page for example.  One he uses regularly.  He is to Reddit what Willy Wonka is to chocolate.  So being Jewish isn't a cause for downvote.  Invoking a victim complex, on these grounds, is.  For the most part people they can differentiate between Israel and the Jewish people quite easily.  They just don't conflate the issue; for them they are not synonyms and nor should they be treated as such.  Your direct link to a comment said this, ""Total lack of humanity. And they wonder why much of the world hates them.""  Well it's Israel's reputation that's in the dumpster, particularly the settlers, so I wouldn't be too quick to leap to assumptions of outright anti-Semitism.  If that was this particular commenter's intended implication then it would be inappropriate but whether it is or not is assumptive.   You did go on to explain this,

     ""The word THEY is used as if the Jews are
                     one singular entity.""

Well, no, you're being a little chipshouldered there I'm afraid for reasons I have already pointed out.

&gt;The entire nation of Israel is deemed a nation of Nazis.

Well there, if that is the case, but I sense you're being too over sensitive again, you'd be right in raising protest.  Many Israelis themselves are beginning to have issue with the direction Israel is going in.  Just Nazi Germany had its Schindler and Rommels fascist Israel also has its elements, much more established than the parallels, fighting the good fight.  We have the Israeli Veteran Letters petitioning Israel's actions, the likes of B'Tselem and Yesh Gvul to name just a few.  There is post-Zionism of the considerable Israeli academic field.  Some Israelis do have a conscience and haven't bought into the uber nationalist extortion.


Yes you are however right that Reddit seems insistent on the making ""THE ISRAELIS"" (I changed it for you) out to be the Nazis.  This is something I draw issue with.  The Nazis don't have a monopoly on fascism, they are admittedly its poster child but essentially just a Germanic political movement.  Italy's own fascism under Mussolini was itself different from the NSDAP.  Unfortunately when there is ethnic cleansing, an openly aggressive authoritarian right wing government with a kingmaker in FM and Deputy Avigdor Lieberman, occupation, UNSC violation and apartheid then Israel is going to court the fascist mantel - none of which excuses Hamas's role either.

What you will find however is that people outside looking in are starting to see a different angle to Hamas.  Everybody knows they are a political movement with militant connections with odious beginnings.  They're also starting to realise that when they took power they, Palestinians, were told by not only the what is now current US president that they'd never have US support whilst they supported arms but also by EU representatives that if they wanted to have any recognition since coming to power that they should embrace democratic principles.  Well we now know that they asked for a timetabled ceasefire and kept to their obligations until ISRAEL, who didn't meet their end of the bargain during it, broke it on November 4th, 2008.  Israeli intelligence and government admit that during the ceasefire Hamas fired no rockets, Reuters and other news agencies during this time reported that Hamas officials were active for the first time in arresting non-Hamas militants in Gaza trying to attack Israel.  Yet the Gazan and Hamas infrastructures were the ones targeted during Operation Cast Lead alongside international relief programs.

"&gt;Which is my point, I'd imagine you elect them to participate in the discussions of parliament and work on legislation.

Right.. 

&gt;That may be the justification for it, but I think most people, when they go to polls are thinking about the duties of the job and selecting the best candidate available. That said, the ""mandate"" is to be a legislator not an elector.

The mandate is to be a representative when legislation is produced, moreover, given that the current state of the EU is only possible through legislation within it's member states, and it is that which people generally want to have the odd referendum about, it seems strange to suggest that they should be second guessed.

&gt;""Democracy"" requires that at some point the people's will be the deciding factor.

And it was and is.

&gt;Electing someone for one task 

I still can't see where 'one task' suddenly excludes what legislators have done with regard to the EU...

&gt;But certainly an international council falls within this category, correct?

But not an international court? What about extradition powers? What about pollution standards or the formation of things like the UN, NATO and others?  Why is this suddenly such a departure that we can't trust our legislators?

&gt;If you want my personal opinion, not only should almost any position of sizable authority have democratic oversight

I fail to see how this isn't the case.  At present states remain utterly in control of their sovereignty, they have absolute control over how they are run and at present have opted to co-operate and form the EU.  That could change and states ould move in a different direction... You make it sound like it was imposed by outside forces, not created, joined developed with the input and consent of elected representatives.

&gt;First of all, that would require that I vote for my representatives based on their views on EU policies alone.

None, I assume you would vote on the basis of shared principles, not specific policy, after any given representative is also a member of a party and may or may not agree with central party policy... You can only vote on the basis of what you believe to be right.  However, just because you think something is outside of a given representatives remit, it doesn't mean (if a large majority disagree and there is no judicial bar) that you are right or should be catered for.  

&gt;Relying on elected representatives to do 100% of what I want them to do is a little like playing the lottery.

You can't expect them to do 100% what **you** want them to do, just to do what **they** feel is right.  It's a democracy, not somehow your personal government :).

&gt;Second, whether or not one can opt out of an undemocratic organization doesn't prove whether or not the organization is itself democratic, just that it's freely associative.

My point was that if you live in a democracy and it is through that democratic process that you have become a member, then it is also possible to leave if it becomes an issue.  The organisation itself is democratic and not something that undermines sovereignty.

"&gt; The United States cannot tolerate acts of terrorism,

And why not? [Terrorism is the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism). This means that the goal of terrorism is to either intimidate the US, or coerce the US into doing something.

Let's see. According to the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution, the US stands for freedom, for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, for the respect of each individual's civil rights as a basis for democracy, and for self-determination of nations as a basis for independence and freedom. If the US shows behaviors that evidence a departure from these values, then they are a signal of either intimidation or successful coercion from terrorists.

That means that if the US stops putting life, freedom, civil rights and the respect of foreign sovereignty on top of any other priority, domestic or international, then the terrorists would have won.

&gt; those who perpetrate them, or those nations who harbor terrorists.

Yes, perpetrating terrorism is a crime. Which means that law enforcement officers should pursue and capture terrorists for them to be tried in a court of law. Any different would mean a capitulation of civil liberties (and as stated above, this would make the terrorists win).

Punishing or invading nations also tramples on their sovereignty, which goes against one of the US's explicit fundamental values. Following this course is a terrorist victory.

&gt; As the sole remaining superpower, the United States has no choice but to take on the job of rooting out terrorism wherever it exists.

There are at least three things wrong with this statement:

1.- The US isn't the ""sole remaining superpower"". China, India and Russia still have plenty military might. The EU and China also have plenty economic might. Of course, they are not a ""superpower"" in the Cold War sense of the world, which means none of these countries stand against or opposed the US. Doesn't mean their opinion shouldn't be taken into account, or that their actions are meaningless.

2.- Even if the US was ""the sole remaining superpower"", this doesn't follow that the US has any responsibility of ""taking on"" any job. If you are playing Civilization and you win by conquering all your foes, or becoming the richest civilization, you enjoy your victory. Victory doesn't become an excuse for responsibility. Particularly, when no one is asking you to take on the responsibility and when over half of the rest of the world would prefer you didn't take on that responsibility. The US's might gives it the possibility to help those who ask for help. The US's compassionate nature gives them the inclination to help those in need. But neither conduces to a moral imperative. In fact, the US would be better off playing the game through and see what happens to the people, the nations, and the planet involved in the ""helping"". Iraq is, today, worse off than it was before the invasion. It will be even worse when the US leave. No one in Iraq asked the US to invade, the Americans weren't welcome as heroes, and most Iraqis, when polled, would prefer US troops to abandon their country. There is no moral imperative.

3.- Again, rooting out terrorism isn't a task for an army or a national movement. It is the task of law enforcement. Any different and the terrorists win.


&gt; It is the U.S. government's responsibility and duty to protect its people and make the world safe from terrorists.

The US does have a responsibility to protect its people, but it can do so by putting effective safeguards and procedures in place. Catching or killing currently existing criminals does nothing to deter future criminals. In fact, in the Arab World, American invasions have fostered a negative image of the Western World, and produced kids that want to become terrorists when they grow up. Is the answer mass genocide of the Arab world to prevent anyone from ever becoming a terrorist? No. The answer is to put public safety measures in effect that reduces the reach and capacity of the terrorists.

Furthermore, the US has no responsibility to the World. It only has a responsibility to its own people. When asked, the majority of the population of the rest of the world prefers the US keeps to its responsibility to its people and leave the rest of the world as ""unsafe"" as they would be if America just minded its own business.

&gt; The war on terrorism is a worldwide struggle

It isn't. It is mostly unorganized groups of people so desperate in poverty and oppression that their only solution is suicidal anger directed towards the most powerful target. The most powerful target is the US only. Most of the rest of the world seldom suffers from international terrorism. (Yes, the Madrid attacks and the London attacks were international terrorism, but their cause was the support these countries were giving the US in their war on terror, proving that a war on terror fosters terrorism). It is for this reason that most countries in the world repudiated the War in Iraq in the UN Security Council, and for this reason why other world leaders, including the Prime Minister of England, and the Presidents of most the G8 countries, have expressed their desire to deal with terrorism through law enforcement and not through military avenues. Even the President of the United States, Barack Obama, has stated that America should move in this direction.

&gt; and the United States must move forward with a worldwide offensive to combat it until all who threaten peace and security are destroyed.

Again, there is no moral imperative for the US to do anything on this issue. Moving to destroy other people goes against the values of America, and in so doing, the terrorists win, and doing so also fosters more terrorism.

&gt; Although it is helpful to have the cooperation of other nations, the United States must be prepared to fight terrorism - using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary - wherever and whenever it threatens.

If the US is going to meddle in the business of other nations, then having their input is very important. The US will affect the environment which it invades. Those inhabiting that environment should have a say on what happens there. You can quote the Declaration of Independence to support this statement.

&gt; Nothing less than US freedom is at stake.

Yes. By allowing terrorists to intimidate and terrorize Americans into renouncing their value of freedom, in favor of an illegal, unjust, and ineffective war, the US is losing to the terrorists. This cannot be allowed.

There are positions of authority in all sorts of Governments that are not managed by direct democracy, that doesn't make those Governments undemocratic.

Indeed if they act outside of their mandate, but I fail to see where this is the case at the moment. The EU has been around for a long time now, we have held a number of elections since various EU treaties were enacted, parties have stood with specific policies about EU composition and membership, yet we are still members and the EU still has broad support.  As such I would suggest that the mandate you claim is needed is present.

"&gt;The natural position for every person is racism (the original meaning, not the newer appropriated meaning), as we naturally seek to mate with those similar to ourselves. This means people are more likely to mate within their ethnicity, and particularly within their own race.

I just wanted to point out this is probably the most silly point in your argumentation. People tend to mate with people they find attractive; which in some cases is people with the same skin color, and in same cases isn't. In fact foreign people are often found exotic and specially attractive, and from an evolutionary point of view it makes sense: having children with people from a different ethnic group brings new genes into the gene pool and diminishes the chances of (I'm sure you'll agree) harmful inbreeding. Not to say we're slaves to such evolutionary conditionants, but they do exist.

If most people mate inside their ethnic group it's because of the statistical fact that most people are surrounded by people of the same ethnicity, and so the opportunities of having offspring with a same-ethnic mate are higher. In mixed-ethnic environments you'll find there is no such bias.

Sorry but it's so silly. Even if I agreed human ethnicities do somehow need preserving, which I don't, if you were right about ""people are naturally more inclined to mate within their ethnicity"" there would be no need to take any action regarding immigration to protect ethnicities. You could just allow it freely and anyway people from different ethnicities would not mate, leading to a ""natural"" state of ""ethic purity preservation"".

""Democracy"" can be use loosely, and I have in this conversation, but that doesn't change the meaning of the word. You wouldn't call me blonde for standing next to Dolph Lundgren. Similarly, unelected people don't become democratically appointed just because the person who put them there was democratically hired to do something else.

&gt;There are positions of authority in all sorts of Governments that are not managed by direct democracy, that doesn't make those Governments undemocratic.

No, but we're not dealing with trivial positions here. We're dealing with people in important positions where the public has no [ability to overrule](http://www.eu-referendum.org/english/about_us/index.html) unless it is so heinous that the one elected fears he may lose too many votes next election. Outside of that, they don't feel any public pressure outside of their own sense of morality.

People who get appointed rather than elected. They are part of the demos, but not the ""main"" part since they can't be said to even try to represent anyone other than the person who appointed them.

"I think this a flaw in their thinking. Turkey would indeed go ballistic over such a deal, but I think they sort of gloss things over when they say ""Turkish anger would serve US interests"". I don't think the Turks are so easily manipulated. In fact, I think this is typical short-sighted strategy that appears to solve a crisis now, while creating a bigger crisis in the future. Like arming the Taliban seemed like a good idea when they were fighting the Russians, but now it's turned around to bite us in the ass.

Briefly, about 25% of the Turkish population is Shia, belonging to the Alevi sect. There have been Sunni-Shia clashes in Turkey before, and the situation there remains uneasy. No doubt Turkey would be very unhappy to see Iranian influence grow in the region. Also, no doubt Turkey would feel threatened, since it shares a border with Iran, and would worry about Iranians instigating ethnic violence in Turkey, as they are already doing in Iraq. And Turkey is certainly very powerful, much more powerful than Iran.

However, this is **bad** policy. Turkish Shia people are not like Shias in Iran or Iraq. The Alevis have a strong Sufi component to their religion, and they are Shia in name only, since like other Shias, they also believe in the 12 Imams. But they are **much more progressive**. Turkish Shia women don't have to wear burkas or head scarves. They wear modern clothes, worship right alongside the men in their religious places. In fact, while Turkey as a whole is much less fundamentalist than most Muslim dominated countries, the Turkish Shias are **even more** secular and anti-fundamentalist than their Sunni countrymen.

There is a tension in Turkey right now between fundamentalist and secular forces. The spread of Wahabi Islam hasn't spared Turkey, and even though it has been one of the more Europeanized and secular of Muslim countries, there is a lot of encroaching fundamentalism going on there. And guess who's fighting it? It's the Turkish Shia population, which has always regarded the strict legalistic interpretation of Quran+Hadith as a perversion of Islam, only foisted upon Muslims by the Arabs, whom they regard as having a medieval mindset. After all, the Shia in Turkey were among the earliest supporters of Kemal Ataturk, and his overthrow of religious elements to create a secular state.

If the US allies with Iran as the article suggests, Turkey will be forced to play a greater role in the region to fight Iranian dominance of the Gulf. And Iran will play it's own card, that of fomenting trouble between Sunnis and Shias in Turkey, as they are doing right now in Iraq. And this will only radicalize the Shia in Turkey. When people get radicalized, they turn away from ideas such as secularism, and retreat into ethnic, religious and cultural solidarity, along with the petty hatreds they bring. Any Shia rebellion in Turkey will only bring down the wrath of the Sunnis, who are already pushing hard for a more strict version of Islam.

In short, what will end up happening is that Turkey will become more dysfunctional, less secular. And if you think that radical Islam is a problem in Iran and Iraq, you haven't seen anything yet. Iran is a problem because Iran is more powerful than just about any Muslim country around the middle east. And Turkey is vastly more powerful than Iran. Why create a disaster there?

"BlueCalx2,

I appreciate your through response, and you make some valid points... but I don't buy into your covteous ""fairness"" argument.

 Nothing is remotely ""fair"" in the Middle East. The weak and the powerless are brutally, violently suppressed and abused by dictators as a matter of course. Women are bitchslapped and ordered around by their men - with laughter and impunity. Kurds and Alevee are beaten and gassed. Gays are whipped and electrocuted. Pro-democracy demonstrators are raped and have their fingernails pulled out in private prisons.

Israel is the only ""regime"" that even tries to be ""fair"" to its enemies and that explicitly grants and guarantees equal rights to minorities under law.

Let's say for a second, that a big chunk of Israel's Jewish population has some European genetics... composed of people like my Jewish Lithuanian ancestors who did NOT migrate to Israel (and as a result were shot in the head at the edge of large ditches in the Russian woods).  Okay, so there is an infinitesimal minority of people from outside the Middle East - seeking refuge and save haven from anti-semitism there. People who are - by and large -  contributing to civilization, trade, science, techmology, and a better future in the Middle East beyond Islamism and oil wealth. The fact that these people live there could be seen as a blessing - to a non-bigot.

The Jewish narrative says that before 1948, there were more than 800,000 Jews living in ancient communities in Syria, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia. Now there are less than 50,000 - and most didn't leave by choice. Most of them went to Israel - and these indigenous-to-the-Middle-East Mizhari Jews make up 40% of the current Jewish population in Israel.

**The Arab Muslim narrative says Jews have no business being in the Middle East at all, indigenous or not, their ancient synagogues should be dynamited and their ancient graves should be used to pave roads**... and that the Middle East is strictly the political domain of Arab Muslims from the Arabian peninsula... any non-Arab Muslim self-determination or culture is an insult to Muhammad and Islam... and the only way minorities could conceivably be allowed to live there is if they were heavily controlled and taxed by Muslims... and it was made clear they were second class citizens without full rights. 

If you want to be concerned about ""Fairness"" - Arab Muslims like the ""Palestinians"" have over 30 countries where they are allowed to live and practice their religion without harassment.... and the Jews have one microscopic scrap of a state surrounded by violent, hateful and uncompromising Jihad groups waiting to murder them at a moments notice. The  continent of Europe that turned on them and helped cleanse them out in the 1930's... is becoming openly hostile towards them, once again.

Therefore, It think it's only ""fair ""and ""socially just"" that Jews have a defensible little spot of their own, considering how much oppression and violence they have been subjected to... the Jews right to life, liberty and survial is more ""fair"" than the Arab's need to redeem their honor and not feel the shame of losing their attacks on Jews in 1948, 1967, 1973, 2000, 2008, etc.,.. and the Jews security is more ""fair"" than the Arabs bleating losers demand to make the Jews return to the 1967 borders that would render Israel defenseless in the age of rockets and missiles.

I do not support the fascist, apartheid, Arab-Muslim-Only narrative in the Middle East...

I find it troubling that so many ""liberal"" and ""open-minded"" people in the West side with the Islamists -- who are viciously anti-semetic and opposed to the Jewish people's humble desire to survive as a people. Jews are real people... with a distinct language, religion, holidays, traditions and culture... not a population group of Arab Muslims called ""Palesitnians""  - who are human beings,  but who are culturally identical to the majority of people in the 10 surrounding countries.

"I don't approve the use of these scanners!

Here's my story from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ax5z6/thats_it_reddit_today_is_the_day_the_terrorists/) thread.

I was on a return trip to the US from Europe and on the return I had to step through an x-ray security scanner at Schiphol airport. I remember hesitating when going in there, but I was tired from the long trip and felt forced to do it ( everyone else did, and now I feel like a sheep! ).

I was told to put my feet at the markers so that my legs were spread apart, thereby arranging my dangly bits in a free-to-fall position. I got scanned, exit'ed, and immediately felt a fucked-up sensation of intimidation as I realised just what had happened. I blushed, got furious, and asked the security officer if they could see my dick and all that. He replied that the images are censored, and so they cannot see my equipment ( Being a very important security guard at the airport, and to trigger me even more, he of course had to take an extra security peek in my passport... ).

No, I didn't explode, nor did I cry, but I felt really intimidated and cursed the G.W. Bush and roughly 50% of the US population for putting the World in this situation.

"&gt; The Jewish narrative says that before 1948, there were more than 1,000,000 Jews living in ancient communities in Syria, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia. Now there are less than 50,000 - and most didn't leave by choice. Most of them went to Israel - and these indigenous-to-the-Middle-East Mzhari Jews make up 40% of the current Jewish population in Israel.

Correct. You may also be aware that prior to 1948, they lived peacefully with Muslims, Christians, and non-religious people, mostly (including the Jews) of Middle Eastern descent. And of course, you're no doubt aware that 1948 is when Israel (lead by European Zionists) declared itself a state without any treaties or agreements with the Arab population there. They initially claimed the land given to them by the UN (roughly half of Palestine), which Palestinians had no say in and rejected. And then of course, Palestinian Arabs declared war on Israel, later followed by other Arab countries. And during the war, Israel took even more land than the UN had given them and temporarily occupied parts of the other countries. 

This lead many Arabs in the Middle East to view Zionists as aggressive and expansionist and, sadly, many turned on their Jewish brothers. That's awful and they didn't deserve that. The Jews in Europe didn't deserve the horrible persecution they got. The Jews emigrating from Eastern Europe didn't deserve the hatred they faced in the US and the UK when they were trying to flee from these horrible conditions and had no where else to go but the Middle East. However, this doesn't justify the aggressive Zionists who wanted to drive the non-Jewish population out of Palestine. Even many Middle Eastern Jews were against Zionism because they saw it inciting ethnic hatred. 

You say that the Palestinians have other places they could go where they won't be oppressed, but surely you don't think it's that simple. Refugees have shitty lives. They have lost everything and usually live in overcrowded, poor, and unhealthy conditions. What would you have said to a Nazi who said, ""The Jews can move somewhere where they can live without harassment, but it won't be Germany""? In fact, many Nazis *did* say that. Not to mention that Zionists considered other parts of the world before settling on Palestine. Besides the fact that you acknowledge (correctly) that many of other Arab countries do not have very good living conditions for the refugees. And there are vast cultural differences between these countries. A woman in Syria has a lot more freedom than a woman in Saudi Arabia, but that's a totally separate discussion.

Please understand that I am not trying to disrespect you, your family, Judaism, or even Israelis. Jews as a people suffered tremendously in Europe (as did many other groups, though none as bad in the Nazi Holocaust) and we should never forget that. Contradicting policies at the end of the first World War really fucked up that whole region and there's not an easy solution.

Someone requested it:

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b8pyr/iama_request_holocaust_denier/

I have studied the Holocaust as an independent researcher for quite a while. I started out as a believer, then became a ""denier"", then became ""agnostic"" when certain aspects of the Holocaust became irrefutable while others are probably exaggerated.

I can explain about the controversy, why some people deny the Holocaust, the evidence for or lack thereof.

It is a very large subject on which dozens of books have been written so obviously you cannot cover everything here. It spans quite a few years and a continental scope, made up of a large number of events.

If I were to summarize the Holocaust it would be the destruction of European Jewry through persecution, expulsion, massacres and gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Around half of the 6 million are said to have died or were killed in concentration camps (mostly through homicidal gas chambers) and the other half through pogroms and mass shootings (the ""Holocaust by bullets"") in the eastern German occupied territory. 

Most of you are probably more interested in the gas chambers, so here's a summary: 6 camps, all of them in Nazi occupied Poland, are said to have had homicidal gas chambers: Auschwitz, Majdanek, Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Only 2 of these remain (Auschwitz and Majdanek), the rest were closed and bulldozed long before the war was over. In Auschwitz only one reconstructed gas chamber remains in the Auschwitz main camp, while in Majdanek there are said to be 4 remaining gas chambers - the rest were blown by the retreating Germans and only rubble remains of the main gas chambers of Auschwitz Birkenau - Kremas II, III, IV and V.

"Personally I'm greatly in support of the EU but find this idea of being a laboratory for world government frightening. The EU is important because it allows Europeans to wield similar economic power to the US internationally. Without it the EU member states would have been divided up and consumed independently into a trade block with the US in which they'd have no say. It is why European nations have greater clout internationally than nations of similar size and why collectively we can compete with the US.

Using it as some template to serve other people undermines its purpose. Honestly I have no problem with allowing entry to non-European members who can offer something but the EU exists and must exist to serve its members, not act as some damned test case for a bizarre NWO.

It brings it back to my current position. I'm largely pro-European and would integrate further but today I feel that the EU needs to become more conservative. We need to preserve the union both from delusional NWO proponents and the far right sceptics. To that end I would actually establish a stronger mechanism for constitutional change. At the moment a temporary flight of fancy could undermine the stability of the entire union. We need to change the system so broad support is needed before we dissolve the union or turn it into a world government play ground.

"Not really. The point is that China is looking for an incident with plausible deniability, and which can potentially be spun to make it look like the US is using bullshit evidence to attack them (like the USS Maine, Tonkin Gulf, Iraq...). Either way, their goal would be a quick, devastating blow to US bases and ships in the area, and then sue for peace. There wouldn't be time for NATO to get involved. The European NATO members wouldn't want to get involved with one of their biggest trading partners on the behalf of the US. They would sit it out, which would be another blow to the US in terms of political loss. US allies/clients in the Far East *might* help out, though there's little they would be able to do against China and they'd only invite reprisal attacks on them. Japan doesn't have the offensive capability and is well within range of Chinese missiles. South Korea wouldn't be able to mount much of an offensive against them and doing so would not only bring reprisals from China, but could possibly trigger North Korea to launch an attack in a moment of perceived weakness (or if they think Korea might attack them next). Taiwan wouldn't do well to help us as they are in the crosshairs of a *lot* of China's military. They would simply give China a reason to invade and conquer them. At any rate, reprisal attacks would only widen the conflict and I don't think the US will be willing to do that with China considering their economic position. Who knows if the US media would be able to get the public to believe what actually happened; no one believes their shit anymore these days and they would definitely look like they'd be shilling for the government again. Any way you slice it, it's going to be a big win for China and a huge, pivotal loss for the US. The fact that they are actively trying to make this happen means it's only a matter of time. I'm sure our Navy is well aware of this strategy of theirs, but what can they do? If they back off before something happens then they lose without a shot and set the precedent that China is capable of bullying the US military, so no US ally is safe anymore. This is a problem that all crumbling empires have faced throughout the centuries, and it's usually the main reason why they collapse.

We first listened to a crazy band from Israel called Monotonix (http://myspace.com/monotonix). And then, Dan Deacon is playing live somewhere else. For some reasons I don't remember at all but I already had some of his music on my ipod. So we see him live with his friends which most of them are from the band Teeth Mountain. We enjoy it. And I actually really appreciate the people playing with him. So a couple of day after, I check their myspace, like their stuff and see that they are done with Deacon's tour and are starting their own around Europe. Their first date is in Paris, actually a little bit outside of Paris, in the basement of a totally random bar called le Pixi. My roommate and I went to this concert together (I had some exams the day after btw). When we enter, it's just a crazy guy singing weird stuff in frenchyspanish. And then, teeth mountain is getting ready. But the electricity goes down... No more power in the basement. During 20 to 30 minutes, some people, including me, try to solve the problem. And I actually did it. I saved the concert. Which had to be much shorter unfortunately. The concert goes and then we started to drink some beer with the band, smoked some stuff and talk about I don't know what. At some point I invited them to my place (they were supposed to sleep at someone else's) and they accept. They had this nice van for their tour and they drove us home. I end up buying a bottle of vodka. We arrive at my appartment, talk, try some french food, listen to some music, etc... I realize I am the only one drinking, I start to be fucked up and tell them that their tatoos are pretty cool.
Their answer? ""do you want one?"" ""euhhmmmm.... ok!""
And during 2 hours and half, while I am drinking a bottle of vodka, a girl and a guys (andrew + kate) I didn't know until tonight, are drawing their symbol on my arm.
here is the pic for the one who can wait: http://imgur.com/DK1kX.jpg
I go to sleep at some point and wake up alone in my appartment with a random and weirdly done tatoo on my arm.
I saw those guys again a month after, in Baltimore, for the festival called Whartscape.

"Yes, Im familiar with the arguments opponents to Nuclear Power put forth.

First of all, understand there is no other solution, so we have to make it work, if not with the free market then with central planning. I say this as a libertarian and I concede it may be socialist, but it can be profitable, so it won't be a bad socialist program, also the gov can float part of it on the market. [Électricité de France](http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2053355) who reported profits of 3.4B for 2008, produces 22% of the EU's electricity, 74% of which is from Nuclear. They are 85% owned by the French gov.

Secondly, the economics of Nuclear Power are completely different, the always capex is a lot more than the opex, so its crucial to get it right in the planning stage. This is hard to comprehend for the mining companies who come and go as they please with very little planning, and they have little interest in changing the way they operate to provide energy, especially if it requires putting 90% of their opex into the capex of a new project. Both Exxon and Shell tried and failed miserably, they simply were not fully committed.

Those are two very important points I made, and there is a third.

Besides for the fact that we have no choice the Sun, Wind and Seas can't provide for our energy needs, there are also these mining companies that have a vested interested in maintaining the status quo.

Consumer demand is what will make Nuclear Energy work, and I don't doubt for a second that the above mentioned drilling and mining companies are involved with the opponents of Nuclear Power. This makes it very hard for environmentalists to approach this subject with any intellectual honesty.

I so happen not to subscribe to either of the [Nuclear Debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate) altogether as I am a proponent of the [LFTR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHs2Ugxo7-8) so Peak Uranium doesn't concern me, and the Nuclear Power vs. Renewable Energy is completely irrelevant to me too because it does not not take the exponential factor for energy demand into consideration at all.",,t1_c0lk0b3,environment,True,0,salvage,,1426231479,,0,0,-3,-3,t1_c0ljvz1,False,False,t3_b8suo,c0lk0b3,t5_2qh1n,1267673047
"The Jesuits are responsible for the modern rise in Atheism.

In 1776 a Jesuit named Adam Weishaupt created the Order of the Illuminati. One of the main goals of the Illuminati was to destroy theistic beliefs (namely Christianity). Adam Weishaupt also created Jacobinism which was responsible for the French Revolution, the atheistic Cult of Reason and the establishment of the Manifesto of Human Rights to replace God's Law.

Then the Jesuits started pushing a number of erroneous theories to ""prove"" that there isn't a God.

The Big Bang Theory has its roots in the Kaballah and was pushed by a Jesuit named Georges Lemaître.

[Heliocentrism is a fraud.](http://www.reformation.org/stationary-earth.html) A Jesuit named Leon Foucault invented a contrivance that was supposed to prove that the Earth rotates.

Pierre Telhard de Chardin another Jesuit was responsible for the Piltdown man hoax, which was supposed to prove Evolution. 

[More Paleontology Hoaxes](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/display/category/paleontology/)

Charles Darwin stole all his ideas for 'The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life' from his grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was a Freemason, but the writings can be found further back with the likes of Sir Francis Bacon who was leader of the Rosicrucian Order. (Freemasonry is merely the offspring of Rosicrucianism by the way and both organisations were created by the Jesuits.) Plato and Aristotle also taught forms of evolution, but its roots go even further back to Ancient Egypt with the idea of transmutation of species, where it was taught that a monkey would magically turn into a human. Babylon also taught a form of evolution, so this is by no means a new idea. 

&gt; O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of **science falsely so called**. (I Timothy 6:20)

The final hoax in this fraud to discredit the Bible is most likely going to be a fake staged alien invasion. Expect that to happen soon. (My money is on this happening at the 2012 Olympics)

All of these are just as much scams as global warming/climate change is and they all feed into one another and are steering people into the whole New World Order/New Age Agenda.

&gt; Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils (1 Timothy 4:1)


Here's just a few historical quotes about the Jesuits.

&gt; ""My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order’s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.""


- John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.""


- Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.""


- Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""


- Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)


- J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party."" 

- Adolf Hitler
---------------------------

The Jesuits Extreme Oath has been recorded in the U.S. congressional record. Here's a small excerpt -

*""I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants' heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.""*

"&gt; The United States cannot tolerate acts of terrorism, those who perpetrate them, or those nations who harbor terrorists.

What is an act of terrorism as she defines it? Would the 2007 Zahedan bombings in Iran count? Does that mean we should stand by the government of Iran as they fight the Jundallah also known as People's Resistance Movement of Iran? 

How about the 2006 Mumbai Train Bombings and the 2008 Mumbai attack? Does that mean that we should launch a full scale invasion on the country of Pakistan for “harboring” Lashkar-e-Taiba? Pakistan is a nuclear nation.

&gt;As the sole remaining superpower, the United States has no choice but to take on the job of rooting out terrorism wherever it exists. 

Are we the sole remaining superpower? Because we do not consider other countries to possess the qualities that make a super power, does not mean that they do not. 

How about China’s economy and the fact that we owe them massive amount in T-bills? How about the other nuclear nations? India? Great Britain? France? How about the European Union? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_superpowers

Wherever it exists? Really? Even if it is not Muslim extremism? 

&gt;It is the U.S. government's responsibility and duty to protect its people and make the world safe from terrorists. 

The U.S. does have a responsibility to protect its people. Where in the constitution does it say that it must make the world safe from terrorists? Should we spend taxpayer money to do so?

&gt;The war on terrorism is a worldwide struggle and the United States must move forward with a worldwide offensive to combat it until all who threaten peace and security are destroyed. 

&gt;Although it is helpful to have the cooperation of other nations, the United States must be prepared to fight terrorism - using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary - wherever and whenever it threatens. 

It’s worldwide struggle that requires a worldwide offensive that doesn’t require support of other nations. That’s a dangerous sentiment. “Whatever methods” and unilateral action are a bit much. If the terrorist group is not a direct threat to America, should we still use whatever methods, and should we do it without the help of the nation threatened? The U.S. should protect its citizens using whatever methods it takes and alone if necessary. A truer statement?

&gt;Nothing less than US freedom is at stake.

That is a very emotional statement. I would need proof to believe it. How is US freedom at stake? Will the terrorist groups enslave us?

The main argument I would make is that a full scale occuaption would cause more harm to the US than terrorism will ever do. Look at reports on the Iraq wars effect on Al-Qaeda's recruitment. And, the cost of the occupation of Iraq in treasure and American lives. A full scale occupation of the Middle East would be a knee-jerk reaction to fear and that means the terrorist will have won.

"Ah... yes.  Those accursed speculators, eating hapless currencies for the sake of a quick buck!  

I mean, Jesus, get real.  Speculators can and have put pressure on thinly traded currencies of smaller economies, but the idea that a handful of hedge fund managers could influence one of the most widely traded currency pairs in the world is downright asinine.  

When talking about currency speculation, people get causation all screwed up.  Here's how reality actually works: first, some currency zone has some sort of fundamental imbalance or macroeconomic problem.  Next, a few hedge fund managers spot the imbalance and place large short positions.  Finally, the market value of the currency adjusts to reflect the economic reality, and the hedge funds make money.

Yet people seem to **love** working backwards - as if the hedge funds' huge positions and subsequent returns *prove* that the speculators *caused* the shift in price.  

One of the most famous examples is George Soros ""breaking the Bank of England"" - in this case, it was obvious that while the Bank of England was moving toward interest rate parity with continental Europe in order to join the ERM (prelude to the Euro), the United Kingdom's economy was in dire need of lower interest rates than that of the rest of Europe.  Speculators shorted the pound, sure, but they could only do so by seeing that the Bank of England's interest rate policies were unsustainable.  The Bank of England proudly hiked up interest rates in response, which caused *even more* harm to the average U.K. citizen.  Eventually, the central bank did the right thing and withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism.

"Here's a quote to back up your information, because I'm sure it's a contentious topic:

&gt;The story is also the first time that the word Jew (יְהוּדִי) was used, thus denoting a distinction between the Hebrews, the Israelites, and their Jewish descendants in the diaspora.

Clearly, whenever the book was actually composed, a phenomenon which can already be identified as a kind of antisemitism was in existence - whether or not Haman is an actual historical character.

"as far as I understand it, there's no international patent and a patent is generally only valid in the issuing country. There are some exceptions to this, for example, If you patent something in a european country, it's only applicable in that country, but there's also the EU patent bureau that issues patents that are valid in all european countries (but an application there costs more).

There are some who are pushing for an international patent system, but obviously such a thing is almost impossible to create, politics playing a big part in it.

Additionally, there are some treaties concerning patents, e.g. the [PCT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty) but afaik they don't really cover a lot of ground.

On the other hand, lets say there's a chinese company infringing on some american patents, manufacturing its stuff in China but then shipping it to America, and they did the sipping themselves/have an office in america, then they could be sued, in America.

But I'm in no way an expert, this is just what I gathered when i was thinking about patenting an idea of mine, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh and concerning an international patent, another big hurdle towards that is the differences in patent law in different countries.
E.g. the EU has a First-to-File policy concerning patents (though with a 1 year margin where an earlier inventor could come forth), whereas the us has a First-to-Invent policy. And most US software patents would probably be invalid according to EU law, as they take the ""original idea"" aspect much more rigorous, i.e. you can only patent processes that transform something into another form (or something along those lines, at least you can only patent processes iirc) and you can only patent stuff that is not immediatly obvious to someone knowledgeable in the field (so the one-click sort thing wouldn't really apply) , and things like these obviously make it very hard if not impossible to create an international (and unified) patent system. And is has to be unified, because otherwhise someome country with a very weak/lenient patent system could just issue patents and have them be applicable globally, which could and most certainly would have a lot of bad consequences considering progress/free market stuff

"&gt;You have confidence that individuals will be charitable enough to maintain a society at least as well cared for as societies like France or Canada with decent social safety nets.

Yes, I do. Having said that, I'm also willing to accept some level of potential suffering. Know why? Two reasons:

1. I think we can probably agree at least that when the government has a monopoly on something, it grows more and more expensive and innovation comes to a grinding halt -- the very opposite of what happens in the private sector. So if the cost of providing welfare to that small minority that would not be able to afford the service when offered at the cheaper and innovative market rate is that the rest of us miss out on all that because the government destroyed the private sector, maybe that's not a good trade-off.

2. Let's say 5% of Americans ""suffer"" from extreme poverty with no/little safety net. Honestly, there are billions of people all over the world who don't even have safe drinking water and are eating mud pies. The worst-off of Americans live like kings compared to these people. If I'm going to be charitable with my money, what kind of pomposity does it take for an American living in a homeless shelter or facing eviction because they got a bigger house than was financially responsible, who are they to claim they're more worthy of my charity than those who literally have nothing and suffer utterly inhumane conditions while Americans rally around this idea that healthcare is a ""right.""

&gt;Socialized or single-payer health care in countless first-world countries consistently outperforms privatized care in the United States, both in terms of cost effectiveness and overall outcomes

We don't have privatized care in the United States. The government's tentacles have been all over healthcare for quite a long time. There WAS a time when this wasn't the case, and I seem to recall healthcare costs were pretty reasonable back then. Still, if you're curious how fully-privatized healthcare would look in the era of ultra-modern medicine, well, the only examples you can really look at in this country are in the few unregulated fields, like Lasik, veterinary care, etc. Prices in those fields have been consistently falling, and quality consistently rising.

There is barely any price competition in the US market right now, so it's fine to say our system is broken, but to make the leap and suggest that comparing the US to France or Canada and looking at per capita healthcare costs is even CLOSE to a representation of the cost difference of ""capitalism vs. socialism"" is ludicrous. We SHOULD be saying ""look how much government has ALREADY screwed up healthcare, we'd have to be crazy to give them more control.""

Of course, a huge part of the healthcare costs these days is end-of-life care and cancer treatments, etc. At a certain point we, like less wealthy nations (which we'll soon be), must recognize that the hippocratic oath cannot be a license to spare no expense in treatment, and that just because the technology exists to save or improve someone's life, doesn't mean all notion of costs goes out the window. The current population of elderly has something the baby boomers and their successors don't: savings. They have savings because they weren't as idiotic with debt and spending as we have been. So they can afford a little better care as they reach their later years.

&gt;no amount of ""confidence"" in private generosity is going to make up for the fact that despite our tremendous wealth as a nation,

We don't have wealth, just the illusion of it. Few Americans feel like being charitable with their income after the government takes 35% of it for welfare and war. The middle class barely keeps pace with inflation, there is no economic growth amongst the middle class, only a growth in debts and misplaced confidence, crazy notions about home equity, etc. Whose fault is all of that? The government. (that's a whole 'nother post though...)

&gt;I find that libertarians love to speculate about how much better things would be if only we could implement their free-market Utopia, but they get real quiet when you ask for evidence that their ideas actually work.

Hello! The greatest evidence that freedom and free markets works is your own country! Do you think the government is the source of the nation's wealth and prosperity? Of course not. This nation rose to prosperity and higher living standards by embracing the free market and relatively-small government. What's amazing is how quickly this is forgotten, and now we capitalism is scape-goated as ""evil"" and government is the cure. Capitalist, small-government-driven America didn't ""fail,"" it was simply hijacked by those seeking democracy and big government. So I guess one could say that the capitalist, constitutional republic failed to protect itself from political overthrow, but this was a known weakness right from the beginning, the Founders noted that for all the shackles placed on government by the Constitution, the republic would not survive if too many forgot the point of it and embraced democracy.

Can you show me an example of tyranny working?

&gt;As a nation, we need to implement rational, proven policies moving forward.

Proven where? Europe is not proof of anything. The EU is in its infancy, and the individual countries are far worse off than they look. And their wealth, like ours, is largely illusory.

A simple QED &gt; Buddhists are atheists. Here's a quote:
&gt;Believe nothing on the faith of traditions, 
even though they have been held in honor 
for many generations and in diverse places. 
Do not believe a thing because many people speak of it. 
Do not believe on the faith of the sages of the past. 
Do not believe what you yourself have imagined, 
persuading yourself that a God inspires you.
Believe nothing on the sole authority of your masters and priests. 
After examination, believe what you yourself have tested 
and found to be reasonable, and conform your conduct thereto.
(Buddha)

"You are welcome. Over here we view them as collector pieces and wish know everything about them. :) It's amazing in a certain kind of way, to you they are something common and unremarkable. Over here they are somewhat uncommon and one will almost always draw a crowd at a range. 

A perhaps interesting story for you. Over here, rifles that have a soldiers' name tag under the butt-plate are considered more collectible and are highly sought after. Many US collectors will search and try to locate and contact the former soldier or families to illicit general memories of their time in service. Amazingly, many get wonderful replies back. The old soldiers or their families are surprised and bemused we care about such things. And some have even established pen pal friendships with each other.

It's not much different here at the ranges, (except we can't sling a rifle across our back). The older guys tend to shoot wood and blued steel bolt actions, and the younger guys shoot those black plastic things. But we all still enjoy the day.

Those of us who collect Swiss rifles understand about the stocks. I think the only nice ones I've ever seen where sanded and refinished.

"In my opinion there is a public interest argument relating to individuals' right to know, even before considering the the Bulger family's interests. These two individuals, throughout the process, have received protection at the expense of the tax payer in order to protect them from recriminations owing to the particularly heinous nature of the crime that they committed. Now, I fully understand that such protection is in accordance with UK and EU law and is necessary in respect of the rule of law, especially considering that both have served their sentences. However, for the Bulger family I personally believe there is a legitimate interest for them to know why one of the individuals who brutally murdered their child, and has had the benefit of a 'new life' (public expense), has been returned to prison. If I were in their position it would anger me that, despite serving a relatively short sentence in comparison to the crime committed, the perpetrator has been returned to prison; this is with regards the prison system (which has obviously failed this individual from the perspective of rehabilitation) as well as the knowledge that Jon Venabales, who  committed the murder, despite being given a real second chance in life has once again broken the law and been returned to prison. Therefore, I think their right to know stems from the idea that despite the allowances afforded to Jon Venables, his actions, and the knowledge that he is enjoying life and continuing to breach the rules of his release would engage a right to know exactly what he has done; both for the family and the wider public interest.

"&gt;IF that's true, THEN it means that Germany wasn't any more evil than countries that start wars of aggression today, including the U.S. and Israel.

Thats not how I interpreted the comment at all. WWII is a war with moral certainty in the historical context we view it today. Virtually no other war fought by the United States can claim that view. Which is probably why it receives such strong historical weight today and continues to shape policy. 

The holocaust most certainly plays a role in this moral certainty. However, the holocaust was not the entirety, or even the majority of the genocide that Nazi Germany accomplished. Even without the genocide, Nazi Germany was still starting a war of aggression and WWII can be interpreted as defensive in nature. 

If the argument is, within the span of the entirety of human history, and presuming the holocaust and eastern European genocide didn't take place, then Germany's war of aggression is not a lot worse then America's recent wars of aggression in the middle east, then I guess I would have to agree. Not a lot, but still worse. 

Edit: I should point out, that I do believe for all intents and purposes OP is a denier. They might not be saying there was no holocaust, but they are saying that the numbers are greatly exaggerated. I don't think there is a significant difference in those two points of view.

"BlueCalx2,

Just wanted to share a crucially important demographic fact about Israel - not an opinion - and some links that should demonstrate this satisfactorily (to anyone but the most hardened anti-semite / bigot).

**A statistical majority of the citizens of Israel are not ""European Jews"" ** - not according to any factual account or census data collected by any organization. *A majority of the citizens of Israel are people whose ancestors have never lived anywhere but the Middle East* - 100% desert-dwelling natives... both Arabs and  Jewish refugees who were expelled from the ancient, indigenious Middle Eastern Jewish communities in Muslim-majority states.

There are 7.5 million passport-holding citizens of Israel (white, black, Jewish,  Arab, Druze, Chrisitan, Samatarian)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel

Approximately 20% of Israel's population are Arabs (Over 1.2 million). Many of these Arab citizens of Israel are (descendants of) Syrian and Egyptian Arabs who arrived in the late 19th / early 20th century, attracted to work opportunity and prosperity that Zionists developed in the region. A minority of them are Arabs whose ancestors parmanently settled or owned land in Palestine for more than 2 or 3 centuries. 

Out of the 7.5 million citizens, 5.7 million are Jews (a tiny minority of native Jews who have lived in Palestine for centuries +  a majority of 20th century immigrants + refugees from Europe, Russia, Africa, India, South America, Iraq, Yemen, etc.)

3.1 Million of those Jews are Mizhari Jews.  These are members of ancient, indigenous Jewish communities in the Middle East (Yemen, Morocco, Lenabon, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Tunisina, Lybia) - a majority of whom forced out of their homes and stripped of citizenship by Arab mobs and governments in 1947 - 1950. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands

A minority, 2.6 Million of Israel's Jews are Askhenazi ""European Jews"" - people like me -  and my relatives who fled to Jerusalem in the early 1900s to escape violent pogroms and anti-semitism in Russian-controlled Eastern Europe. There is a substantial minority within this segment, of immigrants from Russia and Western countries who arrived over the past few decades.

Many of the Jewish immigrants / refugees in Israel did not come there by ""choice"" - but rather,  out of survivial necessity... or a stark lack of places in Europe or the Middle East that were safe for their family to live and practice their faith without violence, harassment or discrimination.

"The news articles (like this BBC article, and [this older one by the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/13/falluja-cancer-children-birth-defects)) reporting birth defects in Fallujah, including this BBC article, all emphasize the presence of neural tube defects.  (In this article, the spinal problems and paralysis that's mentioned is a dead giveaway).  This is one of the consequences of war (see below ~'s), and is linked to diet, especially a decrease in [folic acid](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/about.html) consumption.

Having no idea what the the food conditions have been like in Fallujah:

(1) Compared to before the war, does Fallujah now experience food shortages?

(2) In the absence of food shortages, has the type and variety of food changed?  For instance, a shift from leafy green vegetables (harder to ship and store) to rice and unfortified grains?

Also, have other things, like the quality and quantity of prenatal care, changed in Fallujah since before the war?  Presence/absence of public health info/campaigns?  (un)availability of folic acid -rich multivitamins (commonly taken in the US by women who want to get pregnant, specifically to avoid neural tube defects)?


Here are abstracts of scientific articles linking war and diet to neural tube defects:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hum Genet. 1984;68(2):97-103.
Epidemiology of neural tube defects in Germany.

Koch M, Fuhrmann W.

A survey is made of the epidemiologic studies of neural tube defects (NTD) in Germany. A temporary increase is noted in the prevalence of NTD at birth for the time during and shortly after the Second World War, followed by a downward trend thereafter. Thus an earlier observation of Lenz (1965) could be confirmed. Falling rates of NTD were also reported from various other countries in recent years. No convincing etiological explanation is available so far. The current prevalence of NTD at birth can be estimated for Germany to be about 1.0-1.5 per thousand newborns with about an even distribution to anencephalus and spina bifida.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nutr Health. 1993;9(1):43-52. The effects of food shortage on human reproduction.

Wynn A, Wynn M.

PIP: The first dramatic effect of food shortage is upon fertility. The authors attribute the marked decline in fertility in Dresden following the second world war to a sudden reduction in food supplies from the formerly occupied territories following the fall of the German armies. There were also epidemics of low birth weight, miscarriage, and congenital malformations. The epidemic of low birth weight in Leipzig immediately after the war is illustrated, with note made of the existence of similar epidemics in all European cities affected by food shortages. Epidemics of miscarriage contributed to the decline of fertility wherever there was a food shortage. The effects of food shortage upon hormone status, how food shortage increases the risk of neural tube defects and other congenital malformations, and the long-term consequences of poor maternal nutrition are considered.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epidemiology. 1997 Jan;8(1):55-8. Sex differences in prevalence of congenital neural defects after periconceptional famine exposure.

Brown AS, Susser ES.

Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the sex distribution of deaths from spina bifida in birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to severe periconceptional famine. For this purpose, we compared the risk of deaths from spina bifida between birth cohorts exposed and unexposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1946. In males, the relative risk of death from spina bifida was 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-6.01]. In females, the relative risk for spina bifida was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.14-2.37). The sex ratio (male:female) for deaths from spina bifida in the exposed birth cohort was 2.74; a female predominance was not seen in any other birth cohort. Deaths from anencephaly and other central nervous system disorders did not exhibit this male predominance in the exposed birth cohort. These findings indicate that severe periconceptional nutrient deficiency may have a greater effect on the occurrence of spina bifida in males vs females. Other potential explanations include sex-specific effects of prenatal famine on prenatal or postnatal survival rates of cases.

Neural tube defects among neonates delivered in Al-Ramadi Maternity and Children's Hospital, western Iraq.

Al-Ani ZR, Al-Hiali SJ, Al-Mehimdi SM.

Department of Pediatrics, Medical College, **Al-Anbar University, Ramadi, Iraq. **

OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence, types, and sites of neural tube defects (NTDs) and its associated maternal and environmental variables. METHODS: All preterm and full term live and stillborn babies delivered at Al-Ramadi Maternity and Children's Hospital, Al-Anbar Governorate, Iraq, from the 1st of November 2007 to the 1st of November 2008 were examined for gender, gestational age, NTDs, and associated congenital malformations. Mother's data included age, parity, consanguinity, education, antenatal care, previous medical illnesses, other NTDs history, folic acid supplementation, and diagnostic ultrasound. Incidence was calculated per 1000 births. RESULTS: During the study, 33 infants were delivered with NTDs, giving an incidence of 3.3/1000 births. Most were of myelomeningocele and anencephaly types, and thoracolumbar and lumbosacral sites. Two-thirds of the cases found were from consanguineous marriage, 12 NTD's mothers took folic acid during their pregnancy, **while none of them received the drug during the periconceptional period**. Three mothers had another NTD affected babies before, and mothers 25-34 years old produced most of the NTD deliveries than any other age groups. CONCLUSION: The NTDs incidence is still high compared with developed, and some developing countries. **High consanguinity marriage and 100% lack of periconceptional folic acid intake needs further study considerations to reduce such morbid and mortal anomalies.**

First, my apologies for saying that you were having a tantrum.  I should have extended you respect rather than have a knee-jerk reaction.  Again, Sorry. Let me tell you the reasoning behind the statements I made before:

You are right, I may have speculated a bit too much as far as the whole white=londoner bit, but why is it that we do not grill a white person as to where they are from?  I mean, london itself is full of people that came from all over the place, so it stands to reason that many of these ""standard issue white guy, 1"" could be from somewhere else, yet you do not see it happening.

I may be wrong but I do not think that you can say that people do not care about race when a quick scan of the news headlines talk about racism and how it is a problem, and incidents and so forth.  The argument about race not being important anymore or racism does not exist is one usually made by a member of a group that has not encountered it, so since it has not happened to the individual, it does not exist.

Finally, I was wrong in using races for examples, but the sad truth is that the dominant group is european whites and the subordinate groups are, well, everyone else.

They do not care that running a country and defending the interests of it’s people in the international and European  diplomatic jungle requires at least some amount of intelligence. They want to see huge flocks of dancing turds who chant murder when someone with different believes crosses their sights.
 There is no questioning of the fundamental politics because attention and interest is diverted to flashy nationalistic items and dubious national safety themes by amateur politicians of whom more than half secretly hope to earn a good living from doing nothing more than shouting absurdities every now and then in front of a camera.

"True.  Racism drives traffic, or gets viewers, or whatever.  But at the same time I would posit to you that in talking about this, she is also telling you like I did somewhere else in this thread why this question may be seen as annoying to a person like her.  I think that her purpose was to try to create a dialog about what one person may see as a well intentioned or everyday question may feel like a denial of membership to another.  Perhaps she could have written TFA a bit better and spoken clearly like I tried to do what is it that the questions makes us feel like.

As for the point of who is the dominant group and who is the subordinate group, I will give you that as far as that sort of metric, then non-european whites are doing well.  But what I mean when I mean dominant group is the group that is more culturally dominant.  One example that comes right off the top of my head is the color ""flesh"" in crayons, whose flesh? I mean, the thing is like a pinkish color.  So it follows that when people think ""flesh color"" more than likely they think of a ""white skin"" hue.  Also, even subordinate groups have internalized the attitude that it is better to have lighter skin, their movie stars, celebrities, etc. All seem to be a tad lighter than the rest of the population (this happens a lot in South America too).  I recall a commercial for a ""whitening"" cream that had this poor Indian girl not getting a guy due to her horrible dark skin, but after using the cream, she gets the attention she wants.  I know is a convoluted example, but I am at work and I am trying to figure out how to put a video on a website using HTML 5 (yes, I am a total noob; it's a college part time job dammit) and cannot get too involved in finding research articles or examples or whatever.

"To start with, Im not denying theres an emotional connection. I'm not being an historian here, im talking about the actualities of war.

'If you think this war wasn't about resources as much as victory then you're not thinking straight. The Soviet's march to Berlin was as much about defeating Germany as capturing Hitler and acquiring the results of the German Atomic Bomb program. I'm sure the US had similar objectives in its efforts, the least of them being keeping influential allies in Europe.'

This seems a little absurd to me. Sure, the US might have been putting some economic pressure on Japan, but that gives them no right to bomb Pearl Harbour.
Your second point. There are always people looking to make the best of of war. We are talking about human beings here. Are you seroiusly suggesting Russia should have stopped at Poland and said, 'ok we've taken everything back, we'll just let the Germans rebuild and come back at us stronger in the future'. They had no option, they had to totally defeat the Germans and make sure there were no reprisals. Now i'm sure there were a few in power that thought theyd make a quick buck out of the situation, but thats the case in almost all of life, there's very few true altruistic acts. It doesnt make the resulting effect 'wrong'. If I give a poor person 5£ because I enjoy doing it, it doesnt make the gesture any less 'right'.

'Assuming when stating the world would be a very different place you meant it would be worse, this is by implication stating that the ends justified the means. To what extent does a country have to go before such a thing is not alright? If the US had nuked Germany to powder, would that be alright? What is the middle ground? At what point do you stop becoming complacent to mass civilian casualties?'

This is what i'm saying, these are tough decisions that leaders had to make, you cant go calling them wrong or evil just because they bombed someone. This is war, you cant worry about every civillian in this situation. Todays wars are different, back then they either bombed the cities or the enemy kept their infrastructure to build weapons.

'Take for instance the atomic bombings of Japan. Some historians believe that despite some Japanese generals seriously resisting, that Japan would've surrendered either without the bombing or if the bombs had been detonated off shore. If that were true, would you not be alright with it? Does the existence of alternatives having less casualties sway your opinion in the slightest?'

If the americans were 100% sure the Japanese would have surrendered without the bomb, then I would have been happy to try them for war crimes. As it was, I dont beleive this was the case - i'm happy to be proved otherwise. I would have dropped it myself if it makes you feel happier.

'Again, being emotional here. Conversely, how would you have handled being a Nazi stationed at a death camp?'

I have no idea, but those people not in positions of authority were not tried for war crimes and rightly so in my opinion. 
I dont think its being emotional at all though. Its a perfectly valid question that historians use all the time. Put yourself in someone elses shoes. How would you have dealt with that situation? We use theoretical situations all the time to understand things. 

'Given that you or I wouldn't have necessarily done any better, does that mean that no one can reserve judgment for those that did these horrible things?'

Exactly yes. This is a very personal thing, but in my opinion, if you wouldnt have acted any differently (without the use of hindsight) then you cant judge people for what they did. I think that is how most people view criminal acts. We put a murderer behind bars because we wouldnt have killed someone if we were in their shoes. I therefore dont judge Churchill for allowing the bombing of German cities, because I would have done it without a moments hesitation. I condemn Hitler because he did things I would never dream of doing.

'Just because Churchill and Roosevelt did what they thought was best and anyone else might have done as well, doesn't mean that what they did wasn't wrong.'

Again I completely disagree. Its what makes them good human beings imo. I suppose it comes down to what you call wrong. How do you define what is wrong? I have no hard coded way of defining rights and wrongs, all I know is if I can understand why someone did what they did, and I would have done it myself, that makes it 'right' to me. Its emotional, yes, and there will be things I disagree with people about, but this is how we come to agreeing on Laws and societies morals - theres no hard coded way of going about it - I dont think there ever can be.

I guess I just have a very different moral code to you. I dont think emotions really come into this very much. I think bombing a city CAN be justifiable - thats not an emotional response, its just my opinion. I think you can to the right thing for the wrong reasons and still be considered the good guy. I think 2 people can do exactly the same thing and one be on the side of right and one on the side of wrong. You're not going to change my mind on that.

&gt; This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, **Mrs. Webster,** has so ably shown, a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.

"&gt;  Just for the sake of being historically accurate, nazi's didn't believe in the supremacy of exclusively Germans, but rather the supremacy of the aryan race which included Scandinavia. Most nazis were aryan supremacists. Most Germans are not nor have never been aryan supremacists. That's only one of the key differences.

Well most Muslims are not violent religious zealot, so the analogy still applies. In fact, now you can extend your generalization to all Aryans. 

&gt; First, I did not mention political orientation.

Yes you did. You said: ""If I'm talking about his political affiliation, I'm not talking about his ethnicity.""

&gt; Second, Religion and ethnicity are not bound together.

That is an arbitrary distinction on your part. Obviously religion be as big part of personal and cultural identity as ethnicity is. 

&gt; That's why you can't be an ""atheist muslim"" because you don't subscribe to the beliefs of Islam if you are an atheist.

I said that I was a **former** Muslim atheist. I even put **former** in bold in a later message for you to see it. Perhaps you should read what I am saying instead of reading what you think that I am saying. 

&gt; I'm referring to all of Islam, the extreme and moderate, those who wear the burqa and those that do not. The good parts and the bad parts and have seen that if you stick them all together it is bad, therefore Islam is bad.

So then if you take all parts of Aryan heretage, including holocaust, nazis, two world wars, colonizations, etc. We can conclude that Aryan nations are bad. In fact, why stop there? Many of the third world conflicts come from colonial policies of mixing ethnic groups together and setting them against each other so that they are easier to be ruled over. Africa is facing centuries of warfare because European colonizers divided the continent across ethnic lines.  How do you feel being associated with that?

&gt; t's wrong to stereotype, but not to generalize. The difference is that a stereotype would say they all subscribe to a specific trait. A generalization is saying most subscribe to that trait.

Well that is a weak disclaimer on your part. The whole point is how you would treat a Muslim or a Jew you never met when it comes to employments, bank loans, etc. You can agree in principle that not all Muslims are bad, but treat every Muslims you meet with prejudice and suspicion.

"No, the US embargoed Japan because they were brutally invading ally territories across the Pacific and embargoing them, including territories and late colonies of your Commonwealth Nations.

It didn't come from left field not because we wanted to go to war with them, because America was incredibly isolationist before Perl Harbor (you probably don't hear about that in whatever rudimentary history class you took), so all embargoes against Japan was an attempt to curtail their imperialism, not to provoke an attack.  The Japanese were not 'acting like assholes', they were raping their way across Asia and the pacific because of their 'divine right' to unify Asia under their emperor.  Even though nations we were friendly with (Great Britain, The Netherlands, Australia, China, etc) were succumbing to Nazi attack.

We couldn't even provide monetary assistance to the Allies in order to fight the Nazis without provoking an attack due to the Tripartite Pact, so perhaps *that* particular aspect of the situation made an attack inevitable, but maybe you're right; perhaps a complete Asian theocratic dictatorship as well as a European dictatorship under the Nazis and Italians would have been better for the world, perhaps we should have just let those countries settle their own differences (differences such as having their own governments as opposed to one under the Emperor or Hitler's rule).

Don't forget how involved Canada was during WWII, even before America entered it.  America's military and resources were undoubtedly necessary in the success of the war in Europe; a war that *you all* were explicitly involved in.

"&gt;Maybe. But my thoughts were that the more conservative Americans were in small numbers

The problem is what Americans actually consider conservative. Conservative in politics in the rest of world usually means, low taxes, small government, and being conservative with money - i.e - watch your books closely. No over spending.

In America, it's that, plus a whole load of other batshit crazy stuff like, disbelieving global warming, evolution, and God is awesome and screw anyone who says otherwise. That's not conservatism in the rest of the western world, that's ""oh, those loopy people."". I don't know where you are from, but if the conservatives in Ireland (or even the torries in the UK) started banging on about God, and personally believed that evolution is nonsense - because of the Bible - they wouldn't even be locally elected. Never mind government. Because these issues, in politics, aren't actually conservative issues at all - only in North America is such issues considered ""conservative"".  It's that they take the labels to the extreme. What we consider moderately conservative in the rest of the western world, would be labeled liberal in the USA and Canada.

For example, their president - An ex-lawyer, who bails out **banks**, and who's policies if judged analytically are undoubtedly conservative. If he was a politician in Europe, he and most of the democratic party candidates, would be considered conservative. Something that he [admits](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6211844/Barack-Obama-world-leaders-see-me-as-a-conservative.html) himself. In America he's ""liberal"". So Liberal in fact that some people have no problem actually thinking with the mindset that he's so liberal he's socialist. 

The problem isn't that the conservatives in America are a minority. The actual problem is what they have labeled conservatives are in the minority.

Another problem is because of the extreme nutbaggery that goes on with American ""conservatives"", no real conservative thinking person wants to be associated with these idiots - because their core rhetoric has nothing to do with actual conservative values.

So now the word ""conservative"" in America has become a dirty word with rational thinking people, when it shouldn't. We have to remind our friends in America that conservatism has nothing to do with: hating science and praising Jesus - and labeling anything you don't like either communist or socalist in an attempt to scare the shit out of people.

The word has simply been hijacked. For example, I do not consider the American Republican party conservative. I just consider them idiots. That's why America is such an anomaly, modern in one sense, but if the Republican party existed in any other major western country, they'd be ridiculed and laughed at for being ridiculous. The only place I could actually see them looking somewhat sane would be if they ran for government in radical Islamic Republics or a few radical nations in Africa.

TL;DR - There are plenty of conservatives in America, they are not an minority. It's just the way the Americans label themselfs a bit differently to the rest of the world in what is considered a conservative. Many Americans who consider themselves ""liberal"" in the political sense,  would be considered ""conservatives"" outside of the USA and Canada. 

&lt;exaggeration&gt;It's just that anyone slightly more to the left than Benito Mussolini is considered liberal in the states &lt;/exaggeration&gt;

This is why reddit seems more conservative when the majority of America is awake.

"&gt;But that leads you to absurd conclusion that you can almost arbitrarily assign people to groups and demand accountability. Everybody can be grouped into a group associated with something bad.

There's nothing arbitrary about it, if a person is part of a group, it doesn't matter how broad the group is.

&gt;Well again book is an arbitrary distinction. I find atheist subreddit to be more supportive of prejudice against Muslims and hatred than Islam subredit, and that is saying a lot.

That's because if you're a part of a religion, it's easier just to talk about tenets of your religion or how god has blessed you in a certain way or w/e.  There isn't much to talk about in atheism except how religion has it wrong.

&gt;Is talking about self defense.

It's telling you that anyone who has persecuted you (and being persecuted is a very vague term) should be killed.

&gt;Is saying that war is sometimes necessary.

It's saying war is ordained ie sacred, and that even if you don't want to go to war you should because God knows better.

&gt;Open to interpretation, but in any case not as bad as murder in police custody.

I would say that wife rape permeating and being permitted all the muslim world is far worse than some fairly isolated incidents of murder in which prosecution is being followed.

&gt;Well marry into your own religion. Not something I did, but not uncommon. There was a sex in the city episode in which one girl had to convert to Judaism to marry this guy, and she did, and it was presented as the most normal thing.

Ugh, for one thing, don't use sex and the city as a moral reference point.  Other than that, saying you can't marry outside of your religion is bigotted, there's nothing false about that.

&gt;Standard religious fare.

Which is part of why I don't follow any religion.  Why would a just god eternally tortue his children just because they didn't know any better?

&gt;here is another, more clearer interpretation: You will find others who wish to make peace with you, and also with their people. However, as soon as war erupts, they fight against you. Unless these people leave you alone, offer you peace, and stop fighting you, you may fight them when you encounter them. Against these, we give you a clear authorization.

That's not the standard interpretation, and moreover I (and many muslims) could interpret it as ""If someone won't let me practice my beliefs (stay aloof and keep my peace) I should kill them""  Interpretation is the main factor in doing plenty of the evil shit in this world.  Having a way to say it was written in the holiest of books is the basis of its justification.

&gt;Seems to me your people are worse than mine. In fact Muslims have by far much better record of tolerance than Christians. Oldest Christian sect, for example, are Copts in Egypt. There is no way Copts would have survived Catholic inquisition in Europe.

How the hell did you forget I was an atheist?  And why try to argue that muslims have a better track record (which is disputable) than christians if I see them both as capable and showing that they produce evil by the virtue of the nature of their existence?  This is not to mention that history isn't as important as what's going on now.  The way by which people interpret religions changes and Christians have much less militant stances now than Islam does.

Here's another good couple Quran quotes:

Women 4:15 As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four of you against them. And if they testify (to the truth of the allegation) then confine them to the houses until death take them or (until) Allah appoint for them a way (through new legislation). 

Punishment for being ""lewd"" is death? (until he says otherwise... great I can't way for Quran vol. 2)

Mutual Delusion 64:14 O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are enemies for you, therefor beware of them. And if ye efface and overlook and forgive, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Your wife and kids are your enemies? what?

The prophets 21:6 Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe?

Here allah decides to destroy entire towns, including children, there's some morality for you.

And this isn't even getting into the prior testaments you believe in.  God drowning the entire world except for the contents of the ark?  great.

"Denmark is actually about as free as the U.S. is, overall.

http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.aspx

If you look at that chart, on average, analreactionary's claim that the more socialized a country is, the worse off it does, is pretty accurate.  It's even moreso accurate if you account for the amount of time a country has had a free market.  And it's even moreso accurate if you account for the area of the world.  The worst countries in Europe are those with the least economic freedom, a la Greece.  The worst countries in Asia are those with the most socialization, China and N. Korea, while the best have the most free economy, Hong Kong and Japan.  North America comes out as would be expected, the U.S. and Canada are about equal, with Canada being slightly better.  South America, Chile is the most free, Venezuela is the least free.  Africa is pretty much a shithole, except for Botswana, and guess why?

Also, Denmark has very different circumstances from the U.S..  They have socialized oil reserves worth massive amounts of their GDP.  They also have much more strict immigration policies than the U.S. has, and the U.S. can't even enforce it's own immigration policy.  Denmark has also been privatizing it's healthcare system more and more, as time goes on, because of large amounts of debt.  Denmark also has higher taxes and spends a much larger portion of it's taxes on programs that directly benefit it's citizens.  Denmark also has a very small military.

"&gt;One of the things driving the global economy was the relaxation of import duties. Start imposing duties again and you could well ignite a trade war that'll end up making us all poorer.

We have no other way to combat the way that nations like China and India exploit their poorer workforce. Besides, if they don't operate withing the US they are missing exposure to the largest economy on the planet and probably taking a massive profit hit. We have enough bargaining power simply due to the size of our economy so that we don't need to worry about firms with overseas production holding us to ransom. If those firms don't want to pay the import duties, then it will create an opportunity for American firms to produce those goods within the US.

&gt;Taxes killed my desire to build a company, employ people and make things that people want. Why do that if you don't get to keep most of the proceeds but have to deal with all the risk and heartburn? I finally gave up and became a wage slave.

Because they don't have to do that. But there are Jewish terrorists.

Ummm, Palestine, apartheid, ethic cleansing...

&gt; They see those parapels as some kind of moral story and not literal orders to be carried out. 

You mean like those Orthodox Jews?

&gt; As an ex-muslim myself I am clearly familiar with what the terrorists base their actions on - the Quran verses and the hadith.

Religion provides justification, but seems to me that Bin Laden and Al-Qaida attacked US, not because Quran told them to, But because of US suport for Israel, Us army bases of Saudi Arabia, and Sanctions on Iraq. How do I know? Coz he Fucken said so. What are you, six years old. 

&gt; You might be familiar with the ""camel pee"" incident in the Bukhari hadith.

Yeah well those were barbaric times, and you will find similar things in any book from ancient times. From what I understand, Islam forbade a lot of more barbaric practices, actually increased rights of women, and brought more tolerance for other faiths and religions. Of course, compared to now, This system seems barbaric, but consider that, for example, Oldest Christian sect are Copts in Egypt. No way Copts would have survived Catholic inquisition in Europe. Same thing in Spain. Muslims ruled Spain as an multi-ethnic place. Once Christians took over, they killed all the Jews and Muslims in short order. Same thing happened when Serbia freed itself from Ottoman rule.  Jews would actually historically go to Muslim countries to escape Christian persecution, But I don't want to overstate my case. Yeah, Mohammad was a barbarian in barbaric times. 

&gt; When you have a prophet with such a tradition and verses that clearly tell the muslims what to do, it doesnt take too much of a leap to kill civilians. Decent people who are also muslims simply do what is right, no matter what their religion tells them.

Well I could go by what Bin Laden says the reason behind his actions are, or I could listen to your speculation. You could believe that all Al Qaida terrorists are crazy rabid, fanatics who act without a rhyme or reason, But is that really the case?

&gt; The Danish cartoons are just that - cartoons. I've seen the cartoons and I admit they're poor taste, 

Well more than just poor taste. Jobs have been lost by radio personalities over racist or anti-sematic comments in the US. Government does not restrict speech, but employers usually don't tolerate intolerance. That is those cartoons were met not supported by main stream media here in the US. 

&gt; but instead of refuting the claims of the cartoonist, the muslims chose to wage war. Why? Could it be because albeit the poor taste the cartoonist had a point?

War? I think it was mostly peaceful demonstrations and boycotts of products. Yeah there were some violent demonstrations too, but most of them were peaceful. 

&gt; The oppresion -if it exists- exists because of extremists. Don't blame the people from being scared and judgmental of muslims when muslims who wield power do stuff that no decent human being should be doing. It scares the shit of people to think that Ahmed living next door might wield power some day and start kicking their ass.

Actually, hatred and prejudice in Europe against Muslims and Immigrants existed way before radical Islam took off in the 1980's.

Well from Wikipedia, first time those cartoons were published, they received little attention. [from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy)

&gt; In 2005, the Muhammad cartoons controversy received only minor media attention outside of Denmark. Six of the cartoons were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr on 17 October 2005,[45][46] along with an article strongly denouncing them, but publication did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and the end of January 2006, examples of the cartoons were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Belgium and France. Very soon after, as protests grew, there were further re-publications around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe.

&gt; You made a good start with the first paragraph, then you blew it on the second. Do you believe that Muslims are unique in the way they are treated in Europe?

That is like 1% of 1%.The whole burka thing is clearly to stoke anti-Islamic passions. And yeah there are honor killings, but those are rare. Still they receive disproportionate attention, compared to example Police brutality against Muslims, or Mosque burnings. Did you know that mosque was burned to the ground recently in England and another one was firebombed in Canada? You are more likely to hear about some Muslim who thinks that gays should be killed, than you are to hear about a mosque being burned to the ground.

"Messiah?  Really?  I have to wonder about what citizens of Foxnewsville tell each other what to prepare for when travelling to LeftistLoonyLiberalWorld, in an attempt to ""blend in with the natives"".  Somehow I picture a mix of David Attenborough and National Lampoon's European vacation.

Scratch that - I have a weirdly appropriate anecdote I'd like to share with the internet (side note, Firefox wtf, internet isn't in your dictionary?).  It isn't political, but I believe it's the closest match to the awkwardness your post seems to bleed.

A few years ago, I was a member of a regional university's ""physics club"", a social group for physics students that satisfied their need to have *some* sort of social lives.  Now, physics students are *famous* for being some of the most difficult groups of kids to organize into anything remotely social - you'll have better luck herding cats than us.  But this didn't stop the extroverts from at least *trying*, and so we managed to continue a 50+ year tradition of keeping membership in the ""club"" over the number fuckable.  (18 legal ... inside joke .... erm ... )

Being part of the club, and joining my first actual ""social group"" of my loner nerdy life, was obviously an exercise in perpetual awkwardness.  Having never ""belonged"" to anything at all, I quickly became the butt of jokes, as my skill in navigating ""joke / insult"" conversational dynamics was still *very much* a work in progress.  My ""noobishness"", if you can excuse the gamer term, at life in general, in fact, earned me the nickname ""the freshman that almost died"" due to forgetting a container for food and insufficient dry clothes for a *winter mountain camping trip*.   So perhaps I've established my credentials as a certifiable permanent ""outsider"" :-|

Well, the years in undergrad grind on, and the group replenishes its stock of lonely physics students.  Year three, however, was a turning point.  You see, a sophomore double-majoring in physics and electrical engineering decided to join up with our rag-tag group of **misfits**.  And boy did he have an entrance.  Where to start?  At the middle!

His first hellos at the first meeting of the ""club"" were normal enough - kid didn't say very much.  I'm not sure what exactly I should have expected, considering that his only prior contact with the people sitting in the meeting room was either in classes, in which students that *might* have known this dude didn't join us, or in physics symposiums, at which people depressingly didn't really socialize.

Well, the first meeting *every* year for this club begins with an introduction of the ""dudes in charge"", and then the members and guests.  Someone inevitably cracks an AA joke, but the usual ""name, background, favorite video game, and favorite physical constant"" shtick helps everyone get in that funky physics+social mood.  

Usually, these things aren't exactly the most memorable social events, but thanks to this social *champ*, I remember that every single word out of his mouth - down to the last preposition, was an *exact* Simpsons quote.   At that moment, it was *very* impressive.  Much laughter ... good memories ... yada yada.

Well, after we finish the rounds, go over physics club bullshit, pizza, etc., class is effectively ""dismissed"" and people converse in a more natural fashion.  Like any social scene, conversations ebb and flow in a small room in similar crescendos, so our *champ* decides to do his ""thing"" at just the moment everyone and his government listening device in the room can hear.  I can only *describe* the bizarre outburst.

It started with sounded like a dying hissing sound (which draws eyes like an optometrist), followed by what looked like a Parkinson's enhanced twitchy hang-ten sign, and ends with what sounded like a mix between ""yabba-dabba-do"" from Flintstones and R2D2.

The room fell silent for the second before the inevitable ""the FUCK"" exclamations.  Rather heartlessly, I piped up and mentioned ""well, it looks we found someone stranger than me"".  Everyone else agreed, and thus we found an even strayer cat.  But I certainly wanted to know what the fuck that was about.

Apparently, the guy was told by some schmuck that Simpsons references were an easy-in with the physics students, and thus he thought that by imitating some weird shit from Simpsons - that might have seemed like an appropriate illustration of some point he might have made prior to the outburst - he would seem ""cool"".

So, I can grudgingly understand where you're coming from when you repeat something you've heard from an *unbiased trusted source*.  Obviously, the people here might understand your cultural ""in-jokes"".

(LOL) I dunno, the Cubans have a life expectancy equivalent or slightly better than the US -- and they pay a tiny fraction of what Americans do for health care.

But it's not the American people who are opposed to national health care. Public opinion polls since the 1970s have consistently shown that a *majority* of Americans want public health care. These polls typically show that 55-75% of Americans favor this, depending on the period and how the poll is worded.

What you're referring to is our corporate-funded political parties and the corporate mass media -- but remember, they in no way reflect the true feelings of the American people. The American people are not as right-wing as our politicians or corporations pretend they are.

Relatively few Americans know how bad we have it in the US.

"Exactly! Everyone on reddit comes from Europe or the USA. Not from Anywhere else! And Reddit is known to attract ""Conservative Americans."" 

&gt;and I often get voted down for progressive/liberal remarks.

Exactly! Reddit resembles fox news! The conservative bias is so obvious!

Lets look at some of the OP's progressive and enlightening comments!

&gt;You're the type of guy who would treat education problems the same way most Americans treat their weight problems.

&gt;Being a teacher to students of poverty is like being a dentist to patients who won't brush. 

&gt;I've never heard a Keynesian say that debt isn't big deal. And you might want to do some research on Greenspan finally admitting how wrong he was.

OH SNAP! 

&gt;Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to life a hundred times their body weight, but take it from this old ant, I've spent my entire adult life in the nest, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

&gt;The older I get, the more I wonder if we really should let the South secede.


And you have no downvotes! So I can see where your outrage is coming from!


But in general you are correct Americans are fat racist ignorant PIGS who onyl care about low taxes, killing brown people for oil, NASCAR, Jesus, and assault rifles.

&gt; sheep that has been tasked with overseeing a pack of wolves

This describes most regulatory bodies.  Oddly enough, despite all the hate,  I've worked for several large investment banks, and the only regulators they really feared and respected were Switzerland (only for data protection, for everything else they're a joke, and for secrecy they may as well be now) and the United States.  You couldn't hae seen it better.

As I said, my current employer is now being forced to explicitly justify and explain every new financial product to the country's regulator -- if they can't make it clear how the product works, no product.  Period.  This is as it should be.

And your description of the use of the Anti-Terrorism Act...I couldn't have put it better myself.

&gt; That is not to say that Iceland was blameless,

It was not.  Average Icelanders enjoyed a huge amount of prosperity from the bubble; however, I think that most ordinary citizens were unwitting victims, participating in an economic ""boom"" that they had no influence in and whose rotten root causes they couldn't have been expected to understand (given that all involved regulators did not either) and couldn't have done anything about in any case.  I would have expected Iceland's Fjármálaeftirlitsins (the regulator -- yes, I looked it up :-) to have had a say in the matter, but given that the dodgy operations in question were all outside the country, they can also be at least partially forgiven for the oversight.

As for the UK, it wasn't just ""you"" -- The Dutch, Norwegians, and several other governments are just as culpable.  In fact, as I recall, the Netherlands were directly complicit in the decision to not allow Iceland to bring its attempted rescue plan to bear, by moving against Icesave and the other banks at the same time as ignoring repeated Icelandic attempts at communication.  

I am terribly biased here, as I'm Swiss, and see this sort of thing very often, coming from the US and from several European countries.  Regardless of what you may think about tax avoidance and banking secrecy, there is a very strong culture of going after smaller, more successful financial markets.  I find this extremely cynical, as it's often clear that it's not about principle so much as gaining a home advantage at a smaller player's expense.

As for your ""lack of accountability"" statement in the UK -- yes.  However, I doubt whether in this case that the average voter would really object to Brown's aggressive, populist incompetence in this case.

"Let me tell you something about respect, MechaBlue.

In medieval Europe, if there was any hint you were not slavishly loyal to the Church, you were chained down to a rack, stripped and had red-hot pokers taken to your body parts. If that argument didn't persuade someone, they were burnt alive at the stake. THAT is when the Catholic church started getting some real respect.

In Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, if you fail to wash your hands before touching a Quran, you get beaten up and then stuck in jail for 25 years. And that's the humane treatment. Homosexuality may get you buried under a brick wall that gets bulldozed over you. Look! Boy are those towel-heads respected!

Religious powers have deeply embedded ""respect"" for their faiths into the surrounding culture. People still pay lip service to that tradition, although they don't know why.

Unless you're willing to kill and torture in the name of atheism, forget about respect. Ridicule the stupid tards and you may be able to put a dent into their ""wall of respect.""

It was just like romance is nowdays between members of the opposite sex, or between gay couples, but minus the sexual aspect.

"There's a lot of interesting reasons why now is probably the most peaceful time (and will continue becoming more and more peaceful), however it's a big enough topic to write papers about. 
 
To grossly oversimplify, severely decreased infant mortality and death due to disease means less people are dealing with or ""used to"" people dying. With the increased life span society and people put a higher value on human life, stricter laws against murder, closing loopholes of when it's okay to kill people (atheist, not virgin at wedding, because they're gay), plus better law enforcement and monitoring, etc. - all of which equates to less people killing each other. 
 
Larger countries (and things like the U.N. and European Union) mean there aren't a lot of small territories or countries fighting each other for resources/expansion constantly. There aren't a dozen different tribes in New York fighting each other for resources. People in Queens aren't at war with people in Manhattan over hunting/fishing/mineral rights. 
 
Also, nuclear weapons pretty much guarantees we won't have another country attempting to take over all of Europe by military force. If another world war does happen, it'll end badly for everyone on the planet and a ""rational"" state wouldn't engage in that. Personally, I'm scared of any religious country (including our own and Israel) having nuclear weapons. 
 
Greatly expanded communication (internet, phones, etc.) plus ease of traveling humanizes people in other countries. The last great barrier to communication is the language barrier. If the majority of people in Iraq spoke English, we would NOT be occupying Iraq right now (this part is just my opinion/conjecture. I feel if the people of Iraq could plead directly to the American people in English via the internet [instead of through mass media/translators] we wouldn't take what's going on over there as lightly as we do).

"In high school, I dated a woman who I thought was incredibly beautiful.  A couple of weeks into the relationship, when we were still in the honeymoon phase and I was drunk on teenage hormones, I found out that she had a bf back home who she visited (and slept with) every weekend.  (We were in boarding school.)

Later on in high school, I fell madly in love with someone and we dated.  I was in heaven.  We lost our virginity to each other.  Then, a year and a half into our relationship, she gave some douche a bj in Europe over spring break.

All through college I had a huge crush on this incredibly cute woman with the cutest little pixie haircut and a smile that could make the sun come out.  My senior year, we began dating and it was so great I thought it was all a dream.  We got married two years later and I felt like finally my life was falling into place.  We bought a house and a beautiful dog and we both got well paying jobs.  We were even talking about having kids.  Then she blew her boss.  And I got a divorce.

About two years later I fell in love with someone so great that I couldn't believe I was so devastated with the ending of my other relationships.  But we ended up breaking up because of complications related to a drug &amp; alcohol problem that she hid from me.

But despite all this, I'm driven by this determination that true love really exists, I'm determined to find it, and I refuse to settle for anything less.

"I have seen at least 5 mail order bride type women in my area who just married the guy and then divorced him as soon as she had her green card and the right to stay in the U.S.  All of them understood that they could take half of their husband's money and house, and they did.  

Think about it from the potential bride's perspective.  Why is she putting herself online hoping some guy in the U.S. (or Canada or western Europe) will marry her?  I tend to think she might just be looking for an easy way into the country.  The fact that you have money and a house is going to be very attractive, because she knows in a few years she'll have half of it for herself.

The women I've met (all Russian) who did this all barely spoke English when they came here.  How could they know someone enough to want to marry him when he couldn't speak Russian and she couldn't speak his language, either?  The answer is she doesn't want or care about your personality.  And no offense....but if she's hot you have to ask yourself if a woman who looked like that in the U.S. would date you.  If she's waaaayyyy better looking than you, you're kind of just doing a trade: you get to screw her a couple times, then she gets to screw you (out of your assets).  

I tend to think this way based on those women I've met.  I know at least some of them stopped having sex with their husband after a few times.  All of their husbands were guys who would have had a hard time finding a GF in the U.S.  I have heard of mail order brides getting out of prenups, too, saying they didn't understand English or our legal system when they signed it.

"I have to disagree.  European men treat women much better.  A lot of American men just don't do much to keep a relationship going.  They can be selfish, both in and out of bed.  

Female empowerment has been good for women, but the fact is that most women are supposed to have a career, manage the household and raise the children and lots of husbands don't chip in.  Maybe their irritation at having to be everything to everyone is what you are interpreting as arrogance.  Yes, some women are bitchy, but the average woman is not so bad.

"Thanks dude (presumably).  With hindsight, I know not to let her browbeat me, and I know that while there are certain things I do screw up, she's no saint.  

Here's another story.  In the summer we were on a break, but we decided we would use this time to be introspective and grow.  Now, I happened to be off in Europe studying, and one weekend I took a trip to Dublin.  Long story short, I met a cute girl, and we flirted at the bar, and that was it.  Honest to God.  I didn't divulge that to the girlfriend at first, but at some point it slipped out, and the current situation is like a replay of that one.  She stopped speaking to me for a week (and I likewise), and I was convinced our relationship was done.  A week later she calls me and tells me that she slept with someone else (which I had guessed by that point), but didn't feel right and wanted to work things out with me.  Obviously I was hurt, but I appreciated the honesty, told her that I would get over it and we could try to repair things.  Yeah, a lot of people (myself included) think that's indicative of a lack of spine (and testicles), but I really believed that it was my actions that drove her to that, and I put the blame on myself.  And, you know, things were better for quite a while.  But know we are here, and like I said, it feels like a replay.  Until last night, I had let the sleeping with the other guy go.  I never brought it up, never used it in an argument.  But when she tears a strip off me for having a tiny crush on her friend, it just made me boil inside.  

I'm fairly sure if we split, she'll be back in short order, but I won't be taking her back this time.

Varies.  A buddy started working there and said that he was surprised when he received an email from my dad at 3am.  Heard another story about him trying to leave a voicemail at this mans office (at 3am too) and someone picked up.  He had called the home line on accident.  It is anything but 40 hours a week.

Really not much at all which is why I mentioned it.  I grew up in a tiny house sharing bedrooms and fighting for a spot in the cramped, gum stained minivan.  We all still get along just the same.  It's only affected me in that college was paid for so I'm debt free.  That was nice.  The having nice stuff isn't really that cool anymore.

&gt; What does it take to actually get your company public?

This is a long answer that has been answered below.

&gt; How smart are executives?

Answered below.

&gt;  What do you look for in a board member and what do they do for you?

This was interesting to me.  We all know companies and how they work.  You have departments that specialize in certain things and that VP is good at that thing plus managing.  It's pretty simple.  Board of directors was something new to me.  On the outside it just looks like a bunch of old guys that are old money and are on the board at many other companies.  It turns out that these people are where they are now because of where they have been.  They really are hot stuff.  They are great thinkers who are well connected and have an amazing wide array of experience.  (One on this board is Yale Skull and Bones I think)

&gt;  How is the public's perception different than reality?

I don't know why I wrote this.  There are a million things I want to say here.  Much of what I see in the news is funny to me.  Some of these executives need body guards and $500k nanny budgets, etc.  I'm from a relatively small town.  These guys pump their own gas just like everyone else.  I would answer the house line when I was a kid and the man calling is now worth more than many *rich* people that you know combined.  (Richard Branson + Donald Trump + whomever is still less than the CEO's networth.)

So when people like Kenneth Lay@Enron, Gonzalez@Countrywide, AIG, Madoff, etc get out there and talk about how hard it is to be normal I laugh my ass off.

Nobody wants to worry about nuclear conflict, so we just have a bunch of small wars. I mean, everyone is entitled to make a living. Even oil executives and others. And who are these other countries to come down on us. I feel like many countries, perhaps even 3rd world countries  rely on business in some way, shape, or form.  If we protect these principals, and make sure everyone continues to make money, and **consume less and figure out a way to safely get rid of the by-products of fossil fuels** then everyone wins. So in the case of a war, the united states is the best bet. 

And my money is still on ""nobody is gonna do nothin"" and corporations can be trusted to lead this country into a better position. They haven't so far, but they definitely have the funding required for scientific research which will make our lives easier. History **can** repeat itself but it doesn't mean it has to. We are so close, and we're encouraging greener energy every day. Cloning and stem cell research is on-going. Space travel, while being in it's infancy, is a pretty safe bet (although im too lazy to cite sources) to believe that we can rely on the brilliant minds behind the process.

Our future and the economy will be harder, but not totally unconquerable if you don't choose a corporation to side with. A faction to join. One that can destroy you with many weapons. And ultimately won't because they seek to make money first and keep the global economy going.

Remember folks- the world is a pretty gangsta affair (running it anyways) and you're either with one money making competitive asshole, or your with someone else. But you're with the only ticket around that'll almost guarantee you're continued technological lifestyle and survival. The united states has lockheed martin and others backing them up. Even xi. and at times Britain and the European Union.

Germany had plans to invade Poland and the Soviet Union, not the rest of Europe. Germany even offered peace, or alliances, with various European countries (including Britain). 

Germany had war declared upon them. The rest was a matter of trying to win the war. 

Had Britain and France not declared war on Germany, than the war would have been limited to Germany conquering Poland and the Soviet Union (west of the Ural mountains).

"Not my money, but here goes: Six (seven?) years ago while in college, I drove a buddy of mine to pick up a used car he bought for ~$500.  While driving the car back to campus, the engine ""threw a rod"" (or something) and he ends up stuck on the side of a country road in Northern Washington.  He waited for an hour and nobody drove by.  It was getting dark and he could see a light in the distance, so he figured he'd borrow a phone (likely to call me).  After walking towards the light awhile, he realized the road he was on curved off and didn't lead to that light, so he had to trek through the forest a bit.  Apparently, he was a half-mile or so into this forest when he loses sight of the light, can't figure out which way is back, and is basically lost.  Right about then he finds a bench.  A bench sitting in the middle of the forest.  No cliff, or view, or trail.  Just a bench.  He kept moving but ended up back at the bench - proof that he was lost.  So, he decided to wait until morning sleeping on the bench.  He spent the remaining light staring at a phone number someone had carved into the bench.  The next morning, it's light out so he can't see the light he followed the night before, so heads back towards the car, and finds the road he was on before.  When he gets to the car, a cop is there.  My buddy explains what happened to the cop - and it turns out the cop knows the people that sold him the car.  He drives my buddy back to their place, and tells them what happens.  Ok, so this is where it gets cool: First: The people were completely embarrassed the car broke down so quick, and gave him a truck that only had 55K miles on it, (apparently, they were REALLY embarrassed to have the cop know they sold that car, but that's a story I'm not privy to.)  It was old but it still runs today, (another buddy of mine still has it.)  Second, he dialed the phone number (he had plenty of time to memorize) on the bench, and reached a answering machine with an old lady's voice on it.  He thanked her for ""the bench in the middle of the forest"" since he slept on it, and left his name and number in case she wanted to call back so he could thank her personally.  A week (or something) later, a girl calls to say this was the last message on her Grandmother's machine (she died), and wonders why her Grandmother's phone number was on a bench in the middle of the forest.  He offered to take her to it to show her, and she accepted.  (I wasn't in that weird ass phone conversation, so I don't know exactly what was said).  In his newish truck he drove down to what turned out to be the house with the light, met a beautiful Scandinavian woman, and flirting the whole way took her to the bench.  It was a quick hike from the house to the bench.  Turns out the bench was made by her Grandfather, as he did woodwork, but nobody in the family had ever heard of him making a bench.  She probably thought it was sweet to find a bench her Grandfather made.  It's probably why she agreed to go out with him.  A few weeks later, he's back at the Grandmother's house helping his new Scandinavian girlfriend move stuff out to be sold/stored/thrown away.  He finds a picture of the old people sitting lovingly on the bench (but the bench is on the porch - same bench though) and made sure to set it aside.  The next week he had to head out to that county again to fill out paperwork over the broken and now abandoned car he originally bought.  Sitting in some government office up there, he had to wait an hour with a really friendly Arabic dude for the single official who worked there to return from lunch.  They became fast friends, and made sure to keep in touch.  Fast forward to the present (because I just realized this story will take forever if I don't).  He married the Scandinavian (she announced at the wedding that it was when he handed her the picture of her grandparents on the bench - beautifully framed - that she fell in love with him), they have a new baby girl, and live in Spain working for some rich Saudi Prince that pays them to travel to his various houses in Europe and oversee his ""houses and investments"".  You guessed it - same dude from the waiting room.  So, he spend ~$500 on a car that didn't work, but ended up with a newish truck, a gorgeous wife (and baby), and a dream job.

"&gt;I'm honestly not sure what the point of your long laundry list of ""OK, but what about XYZ thing"" is 

The point is simple: that **the definition of ""basic health care"" will continually broaden to encompass virtually every *possible* condition, and every possible test and/or treatment.**

*And this will be especially true if the definition is left to those *directly involved* who also stand to directly benefit.)*

The only other option (to restricting care) is to hand over (yet another) ""blank check"".

They did that with [MediCare in 1966](http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=124090475) and that little ""oops"" has lived on... and on... and on...

Like it or not, ignore it at your peril -- but undefined terms like ""basic health care"" ARE literally ""blank checks"" that, far from ""controlling costs"" will allow indeed *cause* them to skyrocket out of control.

&gt;do you believe the right place to start this discussion is on edge cases like Munchausen's syndrome?

No, but I believe it is important to thoroughly understand that phrases like ""basic health care"" are essentially fraudulent.

Yes, I went to the ""extremes"" with Munchausen's (and likewise with hypochondria, the octomom, etc.) -- but I did so in an attempt to drive home the point that a line will, indeed MUST be established somewhere. (And I wasn't stretching [anywhere near as far](http://blogs.prideangel.com/post/2009/11/Women-who-cannot-carry-a-child-themselves---denied-NHS-fertility-treatment.aspx) as [you might think](http://carersblog.com/?p=4444).)

If you leave that definition until later... you're going to get stuck with even more ""oops"" unexpected consequences, and part of that will end up being political ""special interest"" exceptions and ""rationed"" inequalities.

&gt;I get that there are, like in any large system, paradoxes and difficult choices. The fact is, other countries have solved this and provide great examples (and good lessons in pitfalls to avoid!), while we have obviously not (or perhaps you believe all is well here?)

Actually other countries have NOT solved this problem. Canada's health care system has it's own problems. Britain's has others. The same with the European systems. None of them is anything near ""ideal"" (despite the bill of goods the Michael Moore sold you).

&gt;Your line about ""HE got the benefit and someone ELSE got stuck with the bill"" seems to indicate that you just don't ""get it"" -- they pay taxes and in return get the NHS services. 

You really ought to do a bit more research... the [NHS has a lot](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7379983/Hundreds-of-NHS-wards-to-be-shut-in-secret-plans.html) of [problems](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7256980/NHS-puts-targets-ahead-of-patients-reports-warned.html), growing [more and more](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4557221/Almost-half-of-maternity-wards-turn-away-woman-in-labour.html) extensive [all the time](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7175496/Steep-rise-in-complaints-against-GPs.html) (and as medicine advances, there will be no end to the problems... OR, as seems very likely is already happening the availability and standard of care will deteriorate).

*But hey, feel free to ignore all of that, and continue to pretend that only the US has problems.*

&gt;Sorta like you pay taxes and get a military, or pay taxes and get roads to drive on.

Actually I have taxes extracted from me out of duress, not to fund ""defense"" but to pay for a whole world of imperialistic military adventurism which I do not agree with, and which does not benefit me in the least.

And the taxes I have paid to maintain the roads... have been increasingly diverted to ""other"" uses.

&gt;Why should we believe systems which are successfully holding down costs and providing more-or-less great 1st-world healthcare to the residents of other countries won't work here? What's so special about our situation that an NHS-like approach wouldn't be a vast improvement on our current ""end-result?""

"&gt; Germany declared war on everyone when they invaded poland.

Britain and France knew that a conflict would arise with Poland, and made pacts with Poland knowing full well it would give them an opportunity to go to war with Germany.

Poland held German territory, and within the territory were many German citizens; Poland carried out many acts of genocide against German civilians within those territories. 

&gt; Why do you think it is ok for them to invade poland?

A considerable amount of German territory was taken from Germany after World War 1, and Germany wanted it back. Also, Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded Poland at the same time; they divided the territory and Germany recovered the lost territory. Yet, the Allies did not fight the Soviet Union, nor did they make any effort to save the rest of Europe from being occupied by the Soviets; they actually ordered their armies to halt and allow the Soviets to occupy territory (something that angered Patton). 

Poland was also carrying out a genocide of German civilians in the German territories that Poland occupied. ",,t1_c0logfo,business,True,0,Valkyria,,1426233570,,0,0,-1,-1,t1_c0lo9sv,False,True,t3_b9l3j,c0logfo,t5_2qgzg,1267839057
"My impressions: (Some are observations of the state, and some are more cultural stereotypes with variable accuracy)

* Stronger division between social classes than some other European countries and the U.S.
* Overall more Eurosceptic than most EU nations
* Very different academic life than the U.S. (My friend at Oxford is *miserable* for some reason)
* Better appreciation of foreign cultures and languages than America (but who *isn't* better than America at this?)
* Some of the scariest ""police state"" issues in the free democratic world
* Consistently good source of great rock music
* Protective of British English over other countries' dialects. (I'd say the same of France and Spain)
* I'd say Brits have more subdued mannerisms overall compared to Americans. We're a loud and expressive bunch over here, and I don't argue with the Pink Floyd lyric that says, ""Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way."" But that's not always a bad thing.
* Americans are more individualistic; The UK is a bit more society-oriented

But no, because Europe and Asia have their own problems, and if the U.S. dollar goes down, then Asian / European shit gets more expensive, and America stops importing as much of it, so it would trigger an economic tailspin.

"If I had to guess, I'd say that most Americans probably think less often about the UK than the other way around.  The general attitude towards Britain is positive, I would say.  Although it is a foreign country, the differences are easily digestible, and I think that's why so many Yanks travel to London/the UK on their first trip overseas.  

When we think of a stereotypical Brit we probably imagine an effete 'old Etonian' type with a 'posh' accent.  In general, we see your society as less brash and more erudite, secular, drunken, and Orwellian than our own.  We realize that your political spectrum is farther to the left than ours, and that you're burdened with more onerous taxes and regulations.  Many of us don't understand the EU or why you remain a member.  Also, we think it's very odd that you still have a monarchy.  We think you all have a dry, biting sense of humor and that you spend most of your waking hours out of the unceasing rain in the neighborhood pub.  We tend to find British accents curious and pleasant, although I don't think the Yorkshire/Northern variety is what we'd call a typical ""sexy British accent.""

To me, Britain possesses many Continental traits but overall I don't think of the country as European.  It has a unique identity and I guess in a sense it acts a bridge between North America and Western Europe in culture (and not just because of the common language.)  We do not simply share a language, but we share a common heritage, history, and customs.  Even though many of us have little to no British ancestry, we tell the same fairy tales to our children and sing the same nursery rhymes.  We share a common literature; for example we think of Shakespeare or the legend of King Arthur as our own.  American institutions tend to teach European history from an English perspective.  I think our similarities go far beyond the common tongue, although many of them maybe be due to this fact.  When we won our independence in the 1780s, the US was 93% English-speaking and of UK heritage.  Although we later received millions of other Europeans, the common culture which immigrants adopted and molded was descended from our English, Scots, and Irish roots.

I've (unscientifically) concluded that Americans are dental perfectionists unparalleled by most other nationalities; not sure why the UK gets singled out.

"You see, I am the opposite of you: I feel somewhat out of place with the Asian group. I can hang out with them fine- it's just when they start getting cultural and the sterotypes start seeping that I start feeling awkward.

I'd say most of my friends are Asians-- but that's a breadth. I have plenty of friends that are non-Asian and I feel that I am definitely closer to them than most of my Asian friends.

And no, I did not go through the phase of uber-Asian pride (maybe when I was 5-8 though). The most proud thing I have for Asian culture is their martial arts and determination. Other than that, it bothers me a lot when my elders start bad mouthing other races/ cultures and just plain start being ignorant. I think it's just unwarranted a lot.

Personally, I think I'm neutral:

I consider myself *American* because I don't consider myself fully Chinese. I probably speak .0001% of the language, don't know how to read or write it (sans the name), barely have a grasp of its history, and can hardly relate to my ancestors village-farming period.

English is my first language. I am the first child in my entire family to pursue computers. I (apparently) am smarter than the majority of my family line; I think its just me grabbing opportunities when I can. I watch not only English and Chinese films, but other foreign ones too. I have a broader sense of *""world""* (when my parents say 300 miles is far for college, I'm wondering what if I choose to go somewhere farther away? what if, looking at where the US might be going, I moved to Europe?)

In my Chinese family, the ones I am able to relate with are also my 2nd gen cousins. They know English- they go through the same cultural gap (more or less). They aren't as strict with tradition and certainly don't think that ""our"" race is more superior than others.

I think... I'm just neutral. I find no reason to pertain to one side unless I reason it out to be, and since I certainly am not a traditional Chinese, I'd say I'm American....",,t1_c0lonho,AskReddit,True,0,happy-dude,,1426233662,,0,0,2,2,t3_b9ovk,False,False,t3_b9ovk,c0lonho,t5_2qh1i,1267846961
"I am a bit of an older redditor (30s) who's done quite a bit of traveling in the US and in the UK and continental Europe, and I can say that my own personal impression is the cultural personality of the US is far closer to that of the UK than any other European country. It's not just a shared language, or shared history but the inheritance of a common culture. The same goes for a certain extent for Ireland, as well. What I'm trying to say is that there's a reason why you feel comfortable just asking these questions of yanks on reddit, and we're just replying like normal people: we are on the same wavelength. We are just used to taking it for granted.

In all honesty, I think that the frequently mocked relationship between the US and France during the beginning of the war has more to do with the clash between two cultural paradigms that don't appreciate each other than it does with politics. I doubt something like that would ever happen between the UK and US, even if our governments disagree. Our countries are like best buds, you know?

Re: Teeth. Eh, you guys kinda do have crappier teeth, but only because you don't correct crooked teeth as much as americans. It's really nothing personal. Plenty of people think that everyone getting them corrected here is kinda shallow.

Re: Dinner. I believe this is pretty common everywhere, but isn't so much known by the name, except from where I grew up in the south. In the south Sunday Dinner or just ""Dinner"" is traditionally served mid afternoon on Sunday, but doesn't involve beef and potatoes so much as pork and corn bread due to the lack of either cows or potatoes in the south (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea).

"You think they have nothing worth saying?  How would you know otherwise unless you actually let them speak?

When hooligans tortured my parents dog (it still isn't stable around small people, ie children) there was something worth saying about that situation.  There was a time I was somehow marked and for whatever reason couldn't count on my physical safety in public, in any place, at any time a crowd of bullies (who were kind of stalking me) would spring out of the crowd, hit me with something hard, and then disperse before I could get a good look at the assailant.  There was something worth talking about there.  And I'm not sure about your area, but gang-initiation stabbings are not even all that newsworthy in my old neighbourhood anymore, whereas before it became an 'inner city reserve' prototype, while people may have been stabbed, it was more predictable, isolated cases, not attacker-on-hapless-victims-in-spurts-who-happened-to-be-wearing-the-wrong-colours stuff like we see today.

'Race' *shouldn't* the issue in the above situations, and isn't really the issue, just like in this one, but all these cases share what I think are common roots -- one of which is parents who let their kids just wander around the streets, and a culture that does not penalize people for popping out offspring that they cannot support.  And yes, a lot of those people just happen to be aboriginals(see if you can say that on CBC).  Lots aren't too.  But there are *cultural* issues involved.

And then there's the americana culture where gangs are even possible, nevermind glamourized on TV, is a sign that there are problems in our society.  *THOSE* are the ones we should be fixing, not bullshit NIMBY shit like these jerks with their pickup truck are trying to do.  And those are the ones that we can't talk about, because someone might get upset at, for example, the idea that lots of people in winnipeg, along with other cities would gladly kick most people who didn't share their skin colour out of their neighbourhood if they could, even if they wouldn't admit it publicly(for the record I think those people are racist and have gone on at lengths in the conservative blogosphere defending our multicultural heritage to people who think that only american/european values/people/etc should be respected in canada).  Some even do admit it publicly -- when I was doing polling for the NDP at random places in certain areas of winnipeg, looking for what issues were important to the voters there, and the 3 that kept coming up were crime, gangs, and natives(as if they are a problem in and of themselves).  *Why* are these considered problems in that area?  That's what people in winnipeg should be talking about.  And why was winnipeg like this when even regina/saskatoon, which have arguably worse crime rates, weren't as noticable in this regard?

The point is, they *do* have something worth saying, but they just don't know how to clearly articulate it, and they may not clearly understand the society they live in to really direct their anger to its causes.  They might even be in the process of being exploited by other people (hating the 'other' to direct anger that could be directed towards more useful ends).  Like Truthers, there is a sliver of truth in what they are talking about, and if we write them off carte blanche, the issues that are causing their racism and hatred will not disappear, but only grow worse with time as they are ignored.

"&gt;Public policy designed to help workers who lose their jobs can lead to structural unemployment as an unintended side effect. . . . In other countries, particularly in Europe, benefits are more generous and last longer. The drawback to this generosity is that it reduces a worker's incentive to quickly find a new job. 

Jim Bunning's solution to this problem: eliminate all unemployment insurance for people laid off in the biggest downturn since the 30's, and let them and and their families get thrown out on the streets.

I tire of Krugman ""contradictions"". There is a balance between benefits that keep a surplus of unused labor from falling beneath the poverty line in a recession (not to mention the liquidity their benefits bring to an economy starving for business), and wanting cushy perma-benefits even for the chronically unemployed, even when times are good. But if you see a downside to longterm, well-paid welfare, then YOU CAN SEE NO BENEFIT TO WELFARE, EVER.

Actually, that attitude makes a lot of sense when you consider how stupid many of his critics are. They start with a simpleminded premise, for example, ""Welfare is BAD"", and then marshal the facts to support that position. If you find an exception where the opposite is true, you're supposed to ignore or deny it, because if you admit it, it might show that you're ""wrong"".

Since they see facts simply as weapons used to push personal agendas, those types of people never seem to understand when a real intellectual finds good things about something under some conditions, but bad under others.

"No, dont apologise, I find it fascinating. Im in Europe, Im from Brazil, my parents were born there but my dads family is Polish on the mothers side and native brazilian on the dads side. My mother family is Lebanese and Portuguese. As you can see its an absolute insane mix. My dad is dark, my mum looks like a ghost. Both me and my brother are brown, with light eyes and in my case, blonde hair.

I never thought much of it because Brazil, particularly the South where Im from is very much like America: a crazy mix of immigrant traditions and people from loads of different backgrounds. I wasnt an expection, most people who I grew up with had Italian, Japanese or another crazy mix of roots. I never equaled my ethinicity to my nationality like many europeans do either and still find the concept weird (I am not Lebanese or Polish because my family is, I'm Brazilian, I was born in Brazil!'. A friend of mine calls himself Italian because his mum is, I wtf a lot at that O__o whatever.)

What I was trying to say, perphaps in a too laconic manner, is that people being curious about your background is natural and never bothered me. The UK is incredibly multi-cultural and I understand why people basically want to know what ethinicity makes you look asian rather caucasian. Whats wrong with that? Perceptions and prejudice will come out either way. I actually prefer people to ask than assume that every asian is Indian or Pakistani and that every latino is Mexican. I always ask, though I dont go through the whole interview, I just straight ask 'So whats your family's background?', with no malicious intend, I'm simply curious.

I know that the mix of the way I look, with my name and fluent English make people wonder so if they start with those questions I just save them the embarasement of trying to beat about the bush and be politically correct and tell them, it doesnt hurt. Ignorance will shine through no matter what you tell them, meh.

"I love parts of America/American culture and loathe others, and i think a fair few Brits would say the same.  Fashion, music, hollywood, the American dream, the stunning and huge landscape. Remember America is almost incomprehensibly vast to the average Brit (or European).  The idea of being able to drive all day and barely leaving the same state etc.  I've never studied the American revolution or the war of 1812 which is a real shame, i think that much of the British Empire's history is semi-tabboo now, we would more likely to consider the impacts of colonialism rather than the wars etc, which probably is a good thing.  

  As for ""America saving yo' ass in WW2"" attitude, yeah i guess it rankles, but im sure a lot of Americans have a more nuanced understanding than ""America - fuck yeah!"".  Anyone who properly studies WW2, would say that it was far more ""the USSR saving yo' ass"" as uncomfortable as that is to think for many people. 

  American politics/American news networks i find absolutely fascinating.  Having grown up with the BBC, to see such partisan coverage claimed to be news is ridiculous frankly.  ""Socialist Europe"" isnt the devil thats its portrayed to be nor is it utopia, although in my opinion its far closer to the latter than the former.  That said, although us Brits complain about the NHS etc, I am eternally grateful for it, because frankly compared to the US system its the cats pajamas.

"Great question. I know what you feel - you always think that there's something definitely wrong with the place and how it functions. Most of my own relatives when visiting from the US and the UK also comment on the same thing, and it's not culture shock. It's like walking through Disneyland and you pass by an open door to the maintanence area and see the grimy stuff behind the ride and then suddenly Disneyland isn't as utopian as they'd have you believe.

As for my overall opinion of the city - I've grown up here and spent a large amount of my life here, but I still don't like this city as much as I should be considering it's my hometown of sorts. It's got many problems, but perhaps the biggest one from my point of view is the way us people from South Asia are largely treated like dirt by the local Emiratis. And it's not just the ""slave labour"" that the media goes on about - it's every Indian, Sri Lankan,Philipino or Chinese who's working i white collar jobs. I can never be made to feel at home in this country because they've made it obvious that they don't want me, or any of my kind here - expatriates aren't ever considered for citizenship, no matter how many years they've slogged for the company out there. What I'm going to say is going to sound really harsh, seeing as this is predominantly western-dominated, but the fact that folks from the UK and the US and elsewhere in Europe get double the salary for the exact same job and position than their Indian or Asian counterparts saddens me even more. This is not my home, because they don't want me or my people here now that we've done most of their dirty work and they'd rather have people from your side of the world more.

In the beginning, when I was young and naive, I used to tell my parents that things would change, and someday the arabs would see our contribution to their success and treat us with the respect we deserve.

"For your second question, there are some wine drinkers out there who do not believe in the concept of ""daily/weekly drinkers"" and who subscribe to the thought that if life is short, you don't want to be on your death bed regretting that you haven't drank more good wine.

I don't buy completely into that. I think of the fabulous wine drinking cultures of Europe and places like Argentina where wine is drank every day and with nearly every meal. Are these people drinking $50+ juice? Hell no. They're drinking local ""table wines"" that, if bottled, and sold on the shelf would easily be comparable to the sub-$15 wines that we find at grocery store today. 

Here in the States, we are so wrapped up in the idea that ""wine is special"". That is some kind of sacred drink that you need to treasure every moment that you are in its presence. That is total B.S. Wine is a drink, so enjoy it for pete's sake. That doesn't discount that in the hands of some gift winemakers, grapes from some remarkable pieces of land can produce wines of breathtaking beauty-it just doesn't mean that every wine needs to reach that scale in order to be enjoyed.

As for the line between what to cellar and save versus drink now, I say it is best to err on the side of the ""drink now"". When I was writing the Wikipedia article on the [Aging of Wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_wine), I was shocked by a quote from wine expert Jancis Robinson which stated that most wines are often consumed too old, rather than too young and in need of more aging.

This where is I see a grain of truth in the somewhat ""snobbish"" view espoused above of having death bed regrets. Too many people put too much faith into cellaring, thinking that each day they give a bottle it will only get better. That is not true for the vast majority of wine and it is a regretful thing if you let time pass and never pop open that cork and enjoy a special bottle of wine.

There is no hard and fast rule about which wines should be cellars and which should be drank soon (though the Wikipedia article gives some rough guidelines).

"It's working real well in Mexico and Russia.  Gun violence isn't purely a function of number of guns per capita.  It's more cultural.  Example: There is a higher percentage of ownership of guns in Montana then Washington DC but DC's gun violence (and violent crime rate) is substantially higher.  Go to a nice place in Los Angeles like the Pacific Palisades and statistically it should have a high gun ownership rate (more income = more guns), but there is no gun crime.  Go to Compton where gun ownership is low you'll see higher crime with guns.  I'm not saying that there aren't places with low gun ownership and low crime, I'm just saying that it really isn't a function of merely firearm ownership.  Since there is
gun ownership in Finland, France, Germany, Switzerland and yes even Britain.
If a bad guy really wanted to get his hands on a firearm in Europe I'm sure it
is possible.

Guns (Household) by Country
USA 39%
Norway 32%
Canada 29%
Switzerland 27%
Finland 23%
France 22%

I don't think the 7% difference between gun ownership in the US
and Norway accounts for the gun violence problem we have 
in certain areas of the country.

Norway doesn't even rank on the list whereas the US is #8.

Therefore, my conclusion is as follows, gun violence is not a function of 
an ownership rate.  Which means that stronger gun ownership laws
would likely not have an impact on US gun violence rates.  Also by ownership

Now, my book, ""White-Hatin' Coon,"" don't have none of that bullshit. The hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a descendant from the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you European motherfuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to. 'Cause I'm here to tell you, the chickens is coming home to roost, y'all.

"&gt; So reddit, have any of you backpacked SA or live there, what are you're stories? 

Spent a couple weeks backpacking around Peru... mostly in the mountains. No jungle. It was pretty awesome. Much more of an ""adventure"" than Europe. 

I met this local who who offered to show me around on horseback for a minimal fee. Something like $15.  It was way off the beaten path. We were out for pretty much the whole day. It was pretty cool until I feel off the horse into some mud. :-)

&gt; I want to know everything. For South America what shots do I need and how far in advance should I get them?

I can't remember. Yellow Fever and Hep. A/B for sure. Your doctor will know. You'll need more if you plan on going to the jungle, and you will go to teh jungle if you're there for 5 months. Getting shots a few weeks or a month in advance should be fine. Though some of them might require a booster to remain be effective. You don't want to be in the middle of your trip when it is time for your booster. 

Go all over the place. I wasn't a big fan of the larger cities. Lima was kinda meh. I'd just wing it. Pick a few major sites you want to hit, and maybe a general path, but for the most part you want to wander. Give y ourself time to stay in places that are interesting and skip places that aren't as cool as you thought.

&gt; For the backpacking part what should I bring? (I plan on leaving around January 2011 so it's summer there) I love music, should I bring my ipod, or will it be a liability and hassle?

Don't bring anything worth stealing. IF you need music, bring a cheap bargain MP3 player.

&gt; Should I bring a cheap laptop to upload my photo's or are internet cafe's fine for this?

Internet cafes are your friend. They're all over and they are pretty cheap. I wouldn't bring a laptop. 

With exception of Aguas Calientes at the base of Macchu Picchu, the hostels were nice. Unlike European hostels, you got your own room usually. And they're cheap. You could probably get by on just $15 or so a day. Less if you're frugal.

"&gt;Do you all actually think we're a tiny, weak country, or is that just the over-patriotic 'Hurr hurr America is no. 1' arseholes who claim that 'We're your bitch'.

A note to add that wasn't brought up in the thread so far: with the EU and the US under NATO, in real terms the US vs. UK slander is irrelevant.  Also, the US is just behind the UK in terms of empire (as others have noted), so it's just a matter of relativity.  ""Every dog has its day in the sun"" as they say.

I am curious about two things:

1. It seems strange that the EU is not more pronounced in US media (with the UK as a subset)?  More often actions are described in terms of individual countries.  If this is the political reality, what gives?    
2. Concern that some sort of wedge is being propped up (in behind-the-scenes Machiavelli fashion) of the EU vs. US.  This is played out most prominently in rulings with the EU (like Microsoft and even Google, which I and probably average Americans would agree with) and Iraqi troop withdrawl (which again I agree with it's sensibility).  This is just a pet theory though and perhaps it is just due to the EU's healthier condition and US corruption.

A totally different case.  The European conflicts were national ones, the one between the Israel and the Arabs is today a religious one.  You can just check out the Hams charter, the speeches of Nasrallah and Dr. Z to understand that this is the case today.  Please prove me wrong here.


&gt; That unfortunately creeping extremism is working in Israel.

You forgot to read the context for the left demise in Israel which started with the Oslo process transformation into suicide bombing binge each day of the week.  You are not honest enough to accept that the whole process of waking up from the post-Oslo ""New Middle East"" hangover was the driver for most of the peace loving Israeli people to not accept the false promise of ""peace process"" that brings 400 civilian deaths by suicide bombings in the Israeli towns.

BTW, today's division between Fatah and Hamas makes any agreement impossible as none of the Palestinian parties will not and cannot achieve any agreement with Israel that include compromises on **both** sides.

It's pretty easy to see the game plan from here.

They're building World War III with most of the world to be against Israel, America and the West, who have been made to become the fascist countries.

9/11 will be revealed to the world to have been an ""inside job"" by U.S. and Israel.

People will simply blame the Elite U.S. bankers and the Zionist Israeli government for it all and the world will go to war with these countries for all the wars they've created.

With the rise of China and India the New World Order will then be implemented and Israel and the West will be ""liberated"" from Christianity and Orthodox Judaism and the world will be indoctrinated with new age eastern mysticism.

All the while the Vatican will sit back as always not being implicated at all, even though her Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Freemasons are orchestrating the whole thing.

Anyway that's just my rough prediction of what's to happen.


----------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT: I'm Christian so for the next part of what I believe is going to happen I'm going to be quoting from the Bible. For the atheists on here, if you want to see why I believe atheism has been part of the new world order agenda [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b8rap/how_to_accessorize_like_a_rothschild/c0lk40k)**

""And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."" Revelation 17:12-13

These ten kings or ten leaders I believe will be the leaders of the ten regional governments. The European Union, North American Union, South American Union, African Union etc.. and we know that [the beast is the Vatican.](http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/BibleStudies/StudyGuides/tabid/105/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/453/IID/2-15/LNG/en/SC/R/Default.aspx?7=Who-is-the-Antichrist?)

I believe they're going to give their power to the U.N. to form the world government, but the U.N. will just be controlled by the Vatican. It's worth mentioning Vatican City is the only recognised sovereign state that isn't a member of the United Nations and instead holds permanent observer status. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta although having no sovereign territory also holds permanent observer status.

**Vatican City and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta are both sovereign entities exempt from International Law!**

When they get rid of National Law and replace it with International Law, Vatican City and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta will be free to do whatever they like.

After this happens though, it's not going to be long until the world figures out what's happened. The Bible says this one world government will only last for an ""hour"" or a short time in other words and then **the Vatican will be burnt to the ground!**

Read on.

Revelation 18

*And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.*

 *2And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.*

 **3For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth [the big corporations] are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.**

 **4And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.**

 **5For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.**

 **6Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.**

 **7How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.**

 **8Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.**

 **9And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,**

 **10Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.**

 **11And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:**
 
 **15The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,**

 **16And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet [the bishops and cardinals], and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! [the Vatican is the richest institution on the planet owning almost all the worlds gold]**

 *17For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,*

 *18And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!*

 *19And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.*

 **20Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.**

 *21And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.*

 *22And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;*

 *23And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: **for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.**

 *24And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.*

"Yes, there likely are bad teachers, and they **should** be fired.  Parents, the school board, and the principal should make sure the teachers are good.  To have the parents so closely involved is one good reason for having schools run **locally** and **not** from Washington, DC.

But the claims in the article are nonsense.  The big claim is that the US K-12 students are falling behind in the world.  Nonsense.  Total incompetent, manipulative, deliberately deceptive, deliberately nonobjective, politicized, *politically correct*, nonsense.  Lying with statistics.  Look at the data even a little and will see the truth.

Of course *Newsweek* didn't give any references to the data, but they did mention a study by McKinsey &amp; Co.  Okay, I saw that one, and here's the reference:

*McKinsey's report, The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America's Schools,*

as of Thursday, April 23rd, 2009 at

http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievement_gap_report.pdf

and

*supporting materials (PDF - 1.0 MB)*

as of the same date at

http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/detailed_achievement_gap_findings.pdf

There can see the same brow furrowing, hand wringing, passion, pathos, and poignancy in the *Newsweek* piece, the same claim that the US is falling behind, etc.

But if look at **all** their data, including the graph on page 24 of the *supporting materials*, then see that the US is doing just fine.

Here's how to read the graph:  People in the US with ancestors from northern Europe are doing just like the people in northern Europe; same for people from South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Zaire, etc.  Uh, right, the report didn't **actually** include Uganda, but here I'm trying to be clear!

So in terms of social science, *control on country of ancestry* and the US does just fine.

Or, the problem of the *uncontrolled* comparison is that the US is *diverse*.  So, compare Minnesota with Sweden and the US does fine.  Compare Mississippi with Zimbabwe, and the US does fine.  Etc.

Where is northern Europe falling behind?  They don't do as well as the US in, say, basketball.  Where is the US falling behind?  We don't do as well as Kenya in long distance running.

But the cute, sweet, pretty, darling, adorable, precious, sensitive, altruistic, emotional, bleeding heart employees of the McKinsey *pro bono* division are *afraid*, want to get security from joining a herd, and what to save the herd as a special case of saving the world, standard for sophomores in sororities majoring in social science, and in particular want to scream ""Oh, we got trouble; Right here in River City; Trouble starts with a *T*; and that rhymes with an *E*; and that stands for *education*.""

Right, sweetheart.  Next they will want ""Need more money for school, Ma!""

With some *irony*, a favorite of many of the sorority sisters, some of the best evidence of poor US education is the McKinsey report that failed to do the obvious *cross tabulation control* to explain their results.  But, this is standard, in the US and likely around the world:  Social science majors, interested in socializing, sociology, social work, socialism, and ice cream socials (**nice** if they wear a little sun dress with floral pastel print chiffon tied up with satin ribbons, a big bow in the back, a bow in their hair, etc.!), really **hate** the mathematics of *cross tabulation*.  But in that sun dress, **really** nice!

Uh, sweethearts, **relax**.  I've got some suggestions for some other interests for you:  Some of you become teachers.  The really cute ones, come with me!

More generally, the really big, deep, dark *secret* of education is the **parents**.  Quite generally parents who want their children to do better should be better parents including helping their children in their education.  Good parents will also insulate their children from *pop culture*.

Did the *Newsweek* emasculates mention that the study showed that the US Jews do better than Israel?  Uh, Israel might reply that their figures included Israeli Arabs!

Uh, people are, in one little word, *different*.  Uh, we can't all be Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, or Tiger Woods.

If really want to look at US education, then look at the US graduate schools, where the best papers in the best journals come from, and who gets the Nobel prizes.  I'm a US WASP male, from a public high school in the US South, and will match my math SAT scores with anyone from anywhere, for money, marbles, or chalk, anytime, anyplace, and my undergraduate honors paper in mathematics, my Ph.D. dissertation in applied mathematics, and my published papers in applied mathematics.  **Believe** me, for such work, the US is doing **just fine**.  We're also doing just fine on really cute, sweet, pretty, ... little things with cute little sun dresses, bouncing blond pony tails, etc.!  We're also beating the world in computing, the Internet, biotechnology, and military technology.  **WHAT** a country!  But, let's don't mess it up.

You do care though, you made that stupid response.

&gt;Most people don't go to prison for shoplifting once (or twice, or more) at the age of 18 (or just about any age)... they might spend a few nights in jail, if that.

If the theft is large enough they could well do. How about people who are seriously abused as children, and lash out in a series of petty thefts, should we kill them even if they could be reformed?

&gt;If you kill someone who's raping you... well, that's probably considered justifiable by just about any court.

Some victims of spousal abuse who murder their abusers get jail time, ditto people who murder someone who has murdered or raped a loved one.


&gt;Sure, there are exceptions to any rule

Many, many, many exceptions. Why do you think that crime and poverty are so closely linked? Are poor people just genetically inferior or what? Are you really okay with murdering 2.3 million people, plus more every year?


&gt;With regard to the shoplifter becoming a violent offender or drug addict? Once again, those are more choices that an individual chooses to make knowing the consequences of his actions.

Environment plays a HUGE role in crime, and even if you don't give a shit about the offender, stopping him from becoming a violent or repeat offender is IN ALL OF OUR INTERESTS.

&gt;I'm not saying that harsher punishments deter crime - just get rid of the offenders completely. I don't have any interest in seeing a thug or crack whore rehabilitated... I would just as well get rid of them and move on.

How do you get rid of them. Given that society is not so ridiculously draconian that it would implement the death penalty for all crimes, isn't rehabilitation in all of our interests? Also, what about people who were wrongly convicted? 


&gt;But by saying this you're admitting they would eventually kill each other anyway

A small core of truly evil could well murder, rape or enslave many of the other more minor prisoners. Furthermore as there is no island in the world capable of settling 2.3 million people (who would breed and grow in population, resulting in their children being punished for nothing), they wouldn't really have much otion.

&gt;The deserted island thing was sarcasm. But if you want to seriously entertain the idea, then you're right, why not just kill them all?

If it was sarcasm, you don't have an actual workable solution, rendering your argument so far worthless.

&gt;Where did I say I advocated increased victims of crime???? That's idiotic.

Punitive focused prison systems lead to increased recidivism and increased crime, leading to more victims of crime.


&gt;I could get on the internet and find a hundred studies proving one side or the other to be the correct course of action

Not really, there is very little actual evidence supporting punitive prison systems and a SHITLOAD suggesting they are utterly inneffective. If you want a good case study, look at Finland, where in the 1970s they switched from a heavily punitive focused soviet style criminal justice system, to a humane and fair rehabilitative one, and subsequently went from having one of the highest crime rates in Europe to one of the lowest.


&gt;I never advocated punishing anyone more harshly 

Tacit allowing of rape is punishing people more harshly, if you turn a blind eye or don't pay attention to it it will happen far more often.

"What war?

Australia *doesn't have a war on drugs*. Australia employs a harm minimisation policy, the same rubric used by the most progressive drug policies in the world. You won't find the ""war on"" terminology employed in Australia. Clearly the author is confusing Australia's drug policy, which is readily available [here](http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/druginfo/fact_sheets/harm_minimisation1/harm_minimisation1.html), with what he saw on a Law and Order rerun. The linked to page says quite explicitly; ""It (Australia's drug policy) recognises that drugs are, and will continue to be, a part of our society.""

Secondly, targeting high level distributors has been shown to be effective in reducing drug-related harm. The author shot himself in the foot by making a reference to economics - if you cut back on supply enough to see price change, then that is evidence that supply has been reduced and fewer people are consuming the drug.

&gt;The only sane approach is to put all of our resources into education programs to highlight the health risks of drugs

Education programs that simply inform users/potential users about the health risks associated with drugs have been shown to be ineffective. Consider how fast food providers are now required to show health information on their products, and people still attend these resturants  in droves. Now, harm reduction based education -- the very same employed in Australia -- is effective. For example, safe use guidelines with needle sharing or designated driver programs.

Drug use is a complex problem that requires a multi-faceted harm minimisation strategy to curtail. Law enforcement needs a role on the supply side, and public policy and harm minimisation education operate on the demand side. Australia is actually doing a good job compared to the UK, the US, and many European nations.

"Strongly recommend London. It's expensive as fuck, but damn, it really feels like anything is possible in that city. I love the parks and the pubs there. You could spend a lifetime in its museums and historical sites. London is best enjoyed with friends, so try to make some at a hostel or pub. Public transport is expensive, but you can walk almost anywhere in the centre if you really have to.

Paris is fun too, but it took a while to grow on me. Again, you'll enjoy it a lot more with friends. I think it's best enjoyed with a lover, however.

Verona is a great place to visit for a day or two -- a lot of historical stuff jampacked into one small town. (Juliet's house is fake, though.)

Munich is an expensive German city, but I loved it and wish I had had a bit more time to spend there. Making friends at the hostels there is so easy, and almost every hostel seems to have a bar, which is really convenient. There is a lot to see, including the Dachau concentration camp, and this Bavarian castle which the Disney castle is supposedly based on.

Wherever you go, look out for Sandeman's New Europe Tours. They usually offer a free tour of the city (guides work for tips only), and also some specialty tours.

Oddly enough, today I don't feel a lot of sympathy with the difficulties Iceland is having paying off it's debt to the UK.

If they default on their debts, Iceland can forget about being a full member of the EU. There is no incentive here based upon previous dealings with Iceland to take anything other than a hardline approach on this.

Also consider that once Iceland is a full member of the EU it can expect to have enough money thrown at it to dwarf its current financial difficulties... where do you suppose that money comes from? Why would the UK and Netherlands effectively place Iceland on an EU cash lifeline when it can't honour it's obligations in a reasonable manner?

For those outside the EU please be aware than once Iceland is in Iceland will effectively be taking monies from Britain, France, Germany, Netherlands etc., in the form of EU grants... And that's a good thing. It's part of what the EU is for, but it's something that we're not obligated to extend to them while they're being asshats. Why would we enter into profound treaty with them when they can't meet their current obligations with us?

Iceland is doing itself no favours posturing like this. The worst thing that could possibly happen to Iceland at this juncture is for the UK and Netherlands to simple say ""Fine, keep your money"". When you hear that in the press you will know Iceland is finally fucked.

Basically, make any outrageous generality tar and feather statement, and claim that if they do not disprove it to your standards and grovel before you, that this means that all of the potential allegations are true. and is true even if they do grovel before you.

I have demonstrated that using [national FBI crime statistics and national averages over a 20 year period](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_01.html), as well as other statistics, that Scientologists are far more law abiding than the national average.

(In a population of 100,000 over a 20 year period, the average number of deaths by murder, etc is over 100.)

He then asks why do I defend any possible potential crime by scientologists, and this is why Scientology should be destroyed, because he says I am defending Scientology crimes.

I dispute his view of the facts.

Now he does the same thing with Suicides.

I have shown that Scientologists are [healthier than the national average based on suicide rates](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html#death-rates), assuming that every accusation of suicide was factual. (I do not think they are all factual) He then asks why I am defending Scientology suicides.

(The national average rate of suicide from 1950 to 2003, in a population of 100,000, is about 18 people per year, but it is higher earlier on. over a 20 year period in a population of 100,000 the average would be about 350 - 400.)

He presumes that if a scientologist was in the vicinity, then a suicide must be blamed on the scientologist.

He presumes the existence of crimes, presumes to assign the cause of all of these presumed crimes on Scientology, and then asks me why do I defend these presumed crimes, presuming I am a criminal.

He asserts the existence of suicides, presumes to assign the cause of all of these on Scientology, and then asks me why do I defend these presumed suicides, insinuating I am a criminal for defending these.

Without demonstrating any understanding or compassion for the complexity of emotions, etc. that are typical of a suicide, never mind the kind that points an accusing finger in any direction. 

The accusations of suicides need to be parsed carefully. Compare the suicide of the pilot who flew into the IRS building vs the suicide of the woman who claimed a love child by George Bush.

If you want to look at the subject of suicide in religion, you shoud examine [the work of Émile Durkheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim#Suicide), who looked at the differences in the suicide rates between protestants and catholics in europe. 

&gt;*Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the logical error termed the ecological fallacy.[21][22]  Indeed, Durkheim's conclusions about individual behaviour (e.g. suicide) are based on aggregate statistics (the suicide rate among Protestants and Catholics). This type of inference, explaining micro events in terms of macro properties, is often misleading, as is shown by examples of Simpson's paradox.[23]*

Given national statistics, and a large enough population, of course something stupid may happen from time to time. Someone in a population of 50,000 is not quite expert or knowledgeable enough to make sure something is handled perfectly, sometimes to tragic results.

God knows that they can happen despite the best efforts.

He asserts this as defacto evidence of the malevolence of Scientology.

Of course, demonstrating his logical fallacy of presumption means for him that I have not disproven his accusation, and therefore this means I am a bad man.

Breaking it down, he is using proof of the law abiding nature of Scientologists as evidence of the high criminality of Scientology. The standard is that anything less than perfection and sainthood is good enough to warrant total destruction, and Scientology must be punished forever for any potential fall from perfection.

I wonder how he would cope with this level of justice being applied to his own self.

Oh, but his rules of ""justice"" do not apply to him.

"We actually agree on some things.  I don't think Capitalism is inherently broken.  I think the collapse was a result of unregulated capitalism, which even Adam Smith was against.

Assuming unregulated capitalism is an ideal is a straw man argument.

I'm in favor of raising taxes on short term capital gains and cutting them on long term gains.  That could arguably restrict flows of capital and lead to inefficiency but I think it's the lesser of evils.


""yes labour is smart enough, but often restricted by circumstances in its ability to freely chose work.""

Good point.  I think this is why home ownership and 30 year mortgages are a lot less common in Europe.

""1) The cost of producing the next generation of workers is privatized. In other words, most workers have families they are financially responsible for, and so can't easily take risks, study breaks etc.""

My company pushes me to continue my education by paying for it.  This is pretty common among businesses I've worked for.  Being poor is tough but I can't imagine most people can't spare 30 minutes a day online or with a used book.


""2) Education is expensive and time consuming.""

I taught my self how to write software for free using Google and other free online resources.  Yes, it was time consuming but I figured it was worth it.  Also, we're now competing with one billion people who were just living on farms in abject poverty.  People who deserve jobs just as much as we do IMO.

""3) Immigration laws mean it is difficult for workers to go to where the jobs are. In a globalised world, this is unfair: since companies can shift production to where ever it is cheapest, so workers should be able to move to where wages are highest.""

We still have much higher wages than China but the jobs are leaving because we have higher wages.  Are you suggesting that Chinese should be allowed to immigrate here en masse?

"I once read a paper on the topic, all I was able to find by googleing 'social mobility' was [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/apr/25/socialexclusion.accesstouniversity). The article states that the UK and the US ranks last.

Think of the following:
The US has a system where not only Universities cost money but also top High-Schools. This is just not the case in the whole of Continental Europe.
E.g. let's say you want to become a doctor: In the US you either are born rich, are really lucky to get a scholarship or end up with a huge pile of debt. In Europe you pay 500 Euro per Semester even at the best of the best Universities (e.g. compare [ETH Zurich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETHZ) with the [MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mit)).

The drain on social mobility is the disadvantage of a strongly privatized educational system: Due to the factor 'money', 'intelligence and studiousness' (or how ever you want to call it) loose some value in the selection process.

For what place on earth isn't that true?

"This is exactly why I judge with my taste buds first. The concept of ""authenticity"" in food is so amorphous, it makes no sense to me to call something ""authentic"" (or conversely, ""bastardized"") and I generally find it pretty ridiculous when other foodies get up in arms about it.

Where does one draw the line? How narrow is one's geographic focus? Is it a national dish? what about regional variations within that nation? how about recipes local to one city only? or one family's special recipe? And on top of that, how far back in history are you going? Can you call this generation's typical dish of ""xyz"" authentic? or was it only their parents that could do that? or their grandparents? Also, how do you account for the exchange of food culture that happened in the past? Is tea (from India) really authentically British? What about curry and its many incarnations? Or potatoes? They seem ""authentically"" Irish now, but they were brought to Europe from the New World only a few centuries ago.

I understand trying to learn about a food as it truly is somewhere else in the real world (lord knows I've hunted high and low for cookbooks and restaurants that can replicate the foods I've eaten while traveling or eating with non-American friends), but to create this notion that there is a perfect, most-authentic version of any food out there is essentialism and completely ignores the constant evolution of food and food culture across time and space. The only exception I would make is to account for arbiters of food culture, such as influential chefs and the like. However, just because Julia Child says beouf bourginion is made this way or that, doesn't necessarily mean it is still made that way or was ever made that way by the majority of French people.

"I had this exact project. I'll get you my work so hopefully I can save you some. We didn't make the implicit denialist argument, because there's nothing to back that up. I searched for hours and hours for scientific papers that supported the notion that global warming is not happening, and as you could imagine, they simply don't exist. Instead, we argued that government intervention may exacerbate climate change and so no action should be taken. I don't know if you're allowed to argue from that angle, but maybe some of this will help you anyway. Just a sec.

Edit: Here you go:

- Warren Thompson: demographer, came up with Demographic  Transition model in 1929

- As countries industrialize, their population explodes due to advances in medical science.

- Depending on the rate of the following industrialization, the growth rate levels off following empowerment of women and better access to family planning.

- Also, families no longer depend on children to make a living, e.g. farming

- A 2001 study released by the Dutch government and the University of Groningen, titled ""Is Japan a Second Demographic Country?"", found that industrialized nations such as Japan and the Netherlands have entered a 5th phase of the Demographic Transition model, in which marriage structure in their societies have shifted from ""parenthood"" to ""partnership,"" and as a result many couples put off child bearing until they are confident that their partnership with their spouse has reached a comfortable economic status.

- This leads to longer generation times, and fewer children. If average fertility drops below roughly 2.1 children per couple, the population will decrease.

- Overpopulation is one of the main driving problems causing climate change.

- As industrialized nations shrink in population, and as technological advancement continues, their carbon footprints will reach sustainable levels.

- The concern lies in countries such as India and China, who are in stage 2 of industrialization. Until economic stability reaches the middle class, population will continue to grow exponentially, pushing the earth to its carrying capacity.

- Countries still in stage 1 of the demographic transition will have an even more unpredictable effect on the world's population.

- As fossil fuels become more and more scarce, innovation from the private sector will drive a shift to more sustainable economies.

- A diminishing supply of capital is not only bad for the environment, but it's bad for business.

- What will facilitate their growth past the carbon-dependent early stages of industrialization? Will government restrictions on the same business practices that facilitated European, east Asian, and North American industrialization? Or will a free market, with open-ended opportunities for businesses, be better at fostering the growth of a middle class?

- According to political economist Daniel J. Mitchell, in his essay for the Heritage Foundation, ""The Impact of Government Spending on Economic Growth,"" use of expanded government locks up capital away from the productive sectors of the economy, and traps it in government, where it is used much less efficiently. He points us to Rahm's curve, which is a theoretical model which compares economic growth against government spending. It suggests that a certain level of government spending is necessary to enforce the rule of law, but if it becomes excessive, it hinders economic growth. Beyond antitrust laws and other regulations enforcing a healthy market and limiting market failures, government regulation will bog down innovation that is crucial to leaving behind unsustainable economies.

- Climate change is happening, and its causes are predominantly anthropogenic, but that doesn't mean that government is going to act as our knight in shining armor. The real solutions to our failed markets, where externalities will not be internalized, is the market itself. An informed consumer will make conscious choices, voting with their dollar for the companies that work out new technologies, and new innovations that will separate us permanently from carbon-based economies. Unlike false markets driven by government incentives and subsidies, these markets will be self-sustaining, self-feeding, and sustainable indefinitely.

I've never been to Prague, but European medieval cities quite often follow the pattern of winding streets without an overall organisation. I think he developed this into something symbolic of K's problems, rather than simply transposing it. 

A clear example of how modern design has evolved to be more transparent can be seen in the Palais de Justice in Nantes by Jean Nouvel, or the design for the Welsh Parliament by Rogers in Cardiff. If you compare those to the traditional European model of civic buildings, neo classical, impermeable structures, these new designs are a lot more transparent, literally and symbolically.

"&gt;Not me or anyone else in the country made a fucking dime from your friends retarded business decision, the few that did were then and are now living in the UK, paying UK taxes.

So Iceland had the highest standard of living in the world in 2009 from...its fishing and tourism industry?

A huge chunk of your countries GDP was generated from the financial service sector; attracting foreign inverters to make deposits with your banks. Over the years your banks leveraged those deposits to ridiculously high levels to the point that when they collapsed, they owed three times your countries GDP to foreign inverters.

So you see how that has something to do with you; An Icelandic citizen? The standard of life of you, and your family, was raised to the highest in the world by standing on top of a bubble. You might not be a banker yourself, but that money from the financial services still goes into your local economy. It raises the cash the Government makes from taxes, to be spent on public services. It raises the value of your skills and salary.

Now the bubbles burst, and like everywhere else in the world you have to absorb a painful drop in your standard of living. More painful then elsewhere perhaps, because you have further to fall. 

When the Icelandic banks were nationalised, the Government had no plans to insure the savings of any foreign inverters, or perhaps not even the ability to. They admitted they probably didn't even have the ability to reimburse the €20,000 minimum prescribed under EU law.

So a desperate plan was hatched. The UK, the Netherlands and the world bank leant Iceland a big pile of money to help it sort itself out, and protect their own economies. We're all intertwined financially, after all. And it largely worked.

Now its time to start paying the cash back. I'm sure it'll hurt, and you have my sympathy for that. But in short; *you owe us*.

"By ""At the time"" I'm talking about 97, when Blair took over, not the entirety of Major's reign.

I don't think the 90's recession can really compare to what's going on now... we bounced back pretty quickly from the 90s one, this one has been so bad that I'm surprised anybody even wants to be PM right now. When Blair took over the 90s recession was over, and things were much better than they had been for a while.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember Major promising a referendum on Maastricht? There's no denying that it was infighting between pro and anti EU types that really screwed his time in office, but that all just seems so damn petty when compared to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 

There's no denying that the amount anyone dislikes the tories often correlates to their latitude. I'd personally blame the trade unions as much as thatcher for the destruction of northern industry (they totally underestimated what they were up against), but yeah, the north got fucked under the tories. 

&gt;What I have seen is a recurring theme where the longer a government stays in power the worse it gets. In my living memory this happened with Thatcher, Major and Blair (Brown started off fairly bad and continues to do even worse so it's not fair to include him as he hasn't completed a term).

I'd agree with you on the whole here, but I think Brown actually started ok, his calm response to the Glasgow airport attack comes to mind. The simple fact of him taking over without so much as a proper leadership contest is bullshit though.

I don't blame people for wanting to see the back of the Tories, or for feeling good about Blair taking over, it just pisses me off when people act like New Labour were some amazing bunch of messiahs who saved us from the evil forces of Lord voldemort, and the iraq war, the wholesale destruction of our civil liberties and the recession have just been minor bumps on the road to Cool Britannia.

"&gt;And the way I see it forcing someone who wants an abortion for whatever reason to carry the foetus to term because you don't agree with their reasons is a slippery slope.

A slippery slope to what?

&gt;You either have the right or you don't.

I disagree, and I think this kind of black and white thinking on both sides is what makes a lot of trouble.  The pro-lifers (again, in the U.S., I have no knowledge of European politics on the subject) believe life begins at conception, period, and will allow no discussion of early term abortions and many don't even draw a distinction between the morning-after pill and a surgical abortion.  But then on the other end of the spectrum you have the people who say, as you did, either you give a woman ""control over her body""-- regardless of what's inside-- or you don't, and anything less than full control over her body-- and anything inside-- is tantamount to chaining her in her basement and making her your full time sex slave.

It's more complex than that and more nuanced and it's a continuum, not a binary thing.  A fetus becomes a baby, there isn't a point in gestation when it's a not a baby and then it suddenly is.  Obviously that doesn't happen at birth, or everyone would be A-OK with late term abortions, and even most pro-choicers aren't wild about third-trimester abortion, though they don't want to illegalize it either (another slippery slope, or maybe the same one you mentioned).  The ""slippery slope"" is known as a logical fallacy for a reason.

Edit to address:
&gt;It's kind of hard to understand how it works in the US, I get the impression that different states have quite different interpretations of the issue.

I'm having some trouble with it myself.  It looks like, according to the same wikipedia article I linked to before, that most states outright illegalized it prior to 1973.  I don't agree with this; it doesn't look like a lot of them even had exceptions for the mother's health, which *is* crazy.  Then in '73, the U.S. Supreme Court said the individual state laws banning abortion before ""viability"" were Unconstitutional, and thus nullified them.  That was the famous Roe v. Wade.  In 2007, the USSC upheld the ban on partial birth abortions 5-4, the first abortion ban the Court allowed since 1973.  It only bans that specific [procedure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction), and I believe does allow exceptions for the life of the mother, though I'm not positive on that since there are other late-term procedures and I don't know the difference of which ones are used in what circumstances.  Other than those blanket rulings on the country, there are no rules.  So, no state can completely ban abortion before ""viability,"" and no state can allow partial-birth abortions, and other than that, the states can and do make their own laws.  I don't know how many laws restricting abortion have been challenged and upheld or struck down by various courts.  I do know some states require parental consent/notification and some don't, some have ""feticide"" laws for third trimester abortions, and some have laws mandating disclosure of the risks of abortion.  I think spousal/partner consent laws have been struck down.

"Except that it's true.  There are no individual or combination of alternative energy sources that match the energy density or reliability of oil or natural gas.

This is simply and basic physics.  Not politics.  Anything else is pure fantasy and magical thinking and no amount of wishful thinking will change that.

It's not that there aren't ways to improve alternative energies *effective* densities *somewhat*, that is, to crudely approximate the deliverable energy features of oil or gas but at the cost of far, far more input energy and extraction costs.  You can't get something for nothing, especially with energy - it's called thermodynamics and conservation of energy intersecting with the realities of logistic curves.

It should also be pointed out that in Denmark, very few people own cars - it's insanely expensive - several times more expensive that in the US.  Most people bike or scooter.

I do not think the smoke is that toxic (comparatively speaking as to other hazards like hydrogenated trans fats aka diet, obesity, or driving a car even), and this is from someone who has done a huge amount of it in production work. I have had my blood tested for lead on a couple of occasions, and there was none. I would not say the same about other metals such as lithium (which is not used in hand soldering). Glue and paints are probably far more hazardous than hand soldering. For a definitive scare, find the MSDS data sheet for anything you use. For soldering substances, most of the problems seem to be from ingesting it (don't eat it) and respiratory irritation (any smoke substance can do that). My concern would be if it is in the blood more than those two. There seems to be very little studies about long term low level exposure at this time.

 What can help is if you have a very small fan (like a computer/power supply fan or something out of the dollar store even) blowing the smoke away from your assembly when you solder. 

The thing you want to do is use lead solder when working on assemblies that have used that, and the lead free on other new assemblies. Like anything else, it probably takes a degree of practice before becoming used to it and proficient. Because it melts at a higher temperature it does not have the same ""flow"" profile and coloration as traditional solder, and a lead free joint may look like a cold solder joint but may not actually be that.

But beyond that, there needs to be more EOL disposal planning for all electronic assemblies rather than sticking stuff in a landfill. Maybe that will inadvertently be the case now with circuit boards being recovered for the silver in the solder!",,t1_c0lse9w,electronics,True,0,eclectro,,1426235413,,0,0,2,2,t3_b9tur,False,False,t3_b9tur,c0lse9w,t5_2qhue,1268026980
"Proportionally silver has gone up a lot more then gold. Right now silver and the platinum metals have momentum, I'm not sure what your time frames are but gold is a buy too, while platinum, silver, and base metals (copper, lead, etc) have more room to gain in my opinion depending on the Europe situation. Also as of late (past couple weeks to a month) silver has been out preforming gold, I've seen silver go up while gold went down on more then one day. In fact on over seas trading this very second Silver, Platinum, Gas, Oil, Index futures, non-US currency futures are slightly up, while gold is slightly down. I don't know or care how it will change by tomorrows open but that seems about right, and while gold is still in an uptrend other commodities stand more to gain in a short term leg up, but like I said don't know your time frames, and I trade on primarily technical analysis. If you buying the physical metals you probably should talk to someone else, but you should also be less concerned about entry points, as the mark up and cost of shipping alone will add up very quickly and you will have to hold it a long time as it is going up to make a buck. If your trying to make money I wouldn't attempt to trade physical metals at all for that reason.

"From IMDB for Inglorious Bastards 1978 - *Set in Europe during WWII, a group of American soldiers are in the process of being shipped off to military prison for a variety of infractions, ranging from desertion to murder. While they're being transported, a German artillery attack hits the convoy, killing the MPs and enabling four of the prisoners to escape. The group decides their best bet is to head to neutral Switzerland where they can avoid the fighting and prison. As they make their way to what they think will be freedom, they end up volunteering for a commando mission to steal a V2 warhead for the French Underground. Somehow, the team must sneak into the most heavily guarded base in German territory, steal the Nazi's most precious military hardware, and bring it back to the allies without getting arrested again by their own side*

But a system can not work without critics pointing out the obvious holes. And a system can not defend its ideas on the basis that current systems suck. But then as with most people who believe in an ideology, it comes down to just that - belief.

"From which country are you; you can be from any EU country; that wage is normal for PHP in at least NL and ES. I'm sure it is also for other countries in the union.

If that's not an option/preferred way of existing, you might consider learning another language; keep your job for 6-12 months while learning some kind of Enterprise language like Java or C# and a popular framework going with that. Do some freelance jobs (no cure no pay) even to learn about it and make resume work.

Another thing might be to train for a projectlead/manager; no programming, good pay.

"I think Europe has always seen Russia as powerful, and a threat to smaller countries' interests. As Europe consists of small countries, they have feared and respected Russia for what it is: big, powerful and unpredictable.

I do think Europe was closer to Russia during the time of the Czars, albeit hesitantly. It was, after all, a kingdom, and European monarchies married into the Russian monarchy and vice versa. Politics was easier and agendas were closer. I think much changed after the revolution, as the communist policy was so different from the west. Politically, Russian and European ideals became much more ploarized, but it got very complicated as communism was becoming trendy and social democracy, if not communism, was on the rise in the rest of Europe too.

In WWII, Russia was seen as another country fighting against the fascists, but as the war came to a close, ties became more and more strained. Russia set their own terms on reimbursements and what countries would be under soviet rule after the war, and Churchill famously said that the allies should not have stopped their march at berlin, but should have marched on and taken Moscow in the same swoop.

In large parts of Europe, Soviet was seen as a real threat after the end of WWII. Gestapo and Stasi infiltrated much of European societies, and they recruited at universities etc. The closer a country was to the east geographically, the more important it became to play the old game of ""keep your friends close but your enemies closer"". Countries such as Finland, who was a sovereign state, did still not dare to instate a single policy without Soviet giving it the go ahead, partly because of how WWII ended, but also in fear of what stance Soviet would take to the country if shit got real, which was a very real threat at the time.

Still, in broader scale, the cold war was just a clash of interest between two super powers, and europe was the playfield. It has later been revealed that Soviet, in practice, wouldn't have been much of a threat, but at the time the threat was very real, with the cuban missile crisis and whatnot. People were very polarized in europe, with both left wing and right wing propaganda at the same time. In the US, the propaganda was very successful, as we can still see today with the term ""socialism"" seen as being an inherently evil concept to many.

Today I think Russia is mainly seen as unstable and unreliable, but still a country with possibilities. The russian stock market swings like an oscilloscope, the state takes over companies if they feel like it which makes investors hesitant, but Russias progress isn't going unnoticed and Russia's international image is becoming better all the time.

TL;DR, All politicians saw Russia as ruthless and unpredictable, european people feared or adored them, and people in the US saw them as baby eating brutes.

"&gt; Quite honestly, the best thing the Fed could do right now would be to print a bunch of money. It would help our debt crisis - public and private - at the expense of banks and the wealthy (i.e. the retired and the young rich). It would stimulate the economy, and put power and freedom back into the power of working people. Unfortunately, the public is so hamstrung by their simplistic view that ""we can't just print a bunch of money"" that this probably won't happen.

Careful. While a bit of inflation is good and necessary, and I believe more spending on infrastructure would be the right thing for the US, even if it means more debt and inflation, once it passes a certain threshold, it becomes very, very bad. The currency becomes worthless once people lose their faith in its ability to store wealth, and you can't run a modern economy without currency. The economy would be replaced with a barter system where you trade blowjobs for potatoes. 

Another thing an economy needs is credit. Interest is above inflation, otherwise the lender is better off buying something -- anything -- with his cash instead of investing it in your business. When inflation grows, especially if it's perceived as policy, then you'll have to factor that in. For long term loans, this quickly becomes unpredictable, so you have to take even more interest to make up for the uncertainty.  
*Or*, of course, you just buy something tangible. That's the safe thing to do. But if holders of cash try to buy up stuff quickly, that's a lot of demand, so prices go up, making loans even more unpredictable and more people nervous, spurring more panic buying, driving inflation up even further, until it spirals into hyperinflation and you learn a painful lesson about the Second Amendment from a guy you meet on your way back home with that bag of potatoes you bartered for.

So, don't try to inflate your way out. Even if you try to keep inflation at a moderate level, once China gets (even more) nervous, there's no telling what could happen.

Other than that, I agree with you about the gold standard people. However, the US uses much more fossil fuels than it produces, subsidies (same goes for the EU) have a negative effect on food production elsewhere, and Americans aren't the only ones that know how to write code (and not all of the code is written in the company HQ, and not only Americans work there -- software development also happens to be one of the industries you can move elsewhere the easiest, programmers included, especially when their former home turns into hell on earth.)",,t1_c0lsxnj,Economics,True,0,Fr0C,,1426235666,,0,0,1,1,t1_c0lrwkt,False,False,t3_badpm,c0lsxnj,t5_2qh1s,1268059894

"From my limited understanding of the subject, the Earth goes through two main cycles [1,500-year meta-cycles of heating and cooling. Within these, there are smaller 30-year cycles caused by sun-spots, where we heat up or cool down within the given mathematical cline of a respective meta-cycle.] 

Rather than rationally talk about these assertions, you rush to slurs and attempts at marginalization [using terms like ""denialist,"" or by saying that skeptics should ""go baclk to High School to learn math,"" etc]. Resisting the impulse to react in kind, I'll maintain a rational, level-headed approach and make you aware of what certain scientists are saying. Men, who—in contradistinction to you or me—have actual credentials. Fred Singer from the University of Virginia, for instance, said, ""Human activity has little to do with climate change"". This, according to ice core samples which demonstrate 1,500-year meta-cycles—this time from Greenland.

    *  An ice core from the Antarctic's Vostok Glacier
 -- at the other end of the world from Greenland -- showed the same 1,500-year cycle through its 400,000-year length.
    * The ice-core findings correlated with 
known glacier advances and retreats in northern Europe.
    * Independent data in a seabed sediment core 
from the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland, reported in 1997, showed nine of the 1,500-year cycles in the last 12,000 years.

"I spent the last four months of my life living in France, smoking fancy cigarettes, drinking inexpensive wine, giving tours of battlefields, touring the sexiest of European cities, attending raves, and falling in love. In other words: I'm a walking talking stereotype. You know the one. White, male, middle-class, suburbanite, aged 18-45, North American posing as Eurotrash. I'm a romantic. I'm in touch with my emotional side, but I listen to my rational side far more often when dealing with life plans and goals. However, I knew that I had fallen in love (in France of all places) and I decided that our relationship would not end there. I picked up my life once again to move to the heartland of Canada. She is presently finishing up her university program and working at a job that is actually in her field. I flew here about a month ago with no definite plan, no job prospects, and no credentials (ie. university degree, college diploma, skilled trade). All things aside, I had a great feeling about it all. I'm a well-traveled gentleman. In addition to attending a year of university abroad, I lived in Vienna for a year and also lived outside Paris for four months. This, however, would be the first time that I was taking a leap into the unknown. My decision to travel abroad to Europe was confirmed upon securing employment and having the financial means to support myself. For this excursion, I had neither. But I got a job at a sexy little coffeeshop in the uptown area of the city. I enjoy working there quite a bit. There is an excellent selection of music, a really nice clientele (not too many cantankerous students), and a lethal amount of espresso-related drinks – so many it makes my head spin...

"Good point.  I should mention that in the past 5 years, my wife and I also made 5 major trips to Europe, ratching up 31 countries.  Our average yearly cost was about $10,000, so we've spent about $50,000 overall for these trips.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely.  Now, if we'd taken that money and put it into the mortgage, we would have paid it off about a year earlier, sure, but we wouldn't have that life experience.  

I acknowledge, however, that most people can't do what we did, so I wasn't going to bring that into the discussion.  But your point is well taken.  There's definitely a balance there, and it can be tought to decide what to do.  I've found that as I get older, life goes by a lot faster, so it's really important to have life experience.   I've tried very hard to do that and pay off the mortgage, and I've sacrificed on both sides, and that's all you can do.

On the other hand, look at it from your brother's perspective...did he accomplish one of his major life goals?  Sounds like he did.  Is he happy?  Sounds like he is.  Is that not life experience, meeting your goals?  Perhaps his goals are different from yours.  Perhaps he was not so interested in school?  Your perspective is different from his.

"The House of Commons  failure to represent its people is screamingly obvious when it comes to  women. Here in the UK, just one in five of our MPs is female. And while this figure is slightly better than the world average, we are trailing at the bottom end of the league table for European and established democracies. 



On international women's day it is exciting to see that women are excelling in some aspects of social life, such as Kathryn Bigelow, who last night became the first ever woman to win an Oscar for best director. But we still have a long way to go! It is not just in the corporate world that women are under represented, women are also grossly under-represented in parliament! Only one in five of our MPs are female, hardly a representative parliament is it?! The Jury Team (http://www.juryteam.org) have a great way in which we could raise women's profile in parliament, by changing the voting system from first past the post to proportional representation http://www.juryteam.org/p15-proportional-representation.php

Implementing proportional representation is key if we want to see more women in parliament and a parliament that reflects the will of the people. The way we vote can and does influence the number of women elected into parliament http://tinyurl.com/yzn5l2t. First past the post lets down women hugely, it offers very few chances for women to break into national politics and gives huge advantages to its incumbrents. It lets down voters and constituencies by limiting their choices and fosters negative and agressive political culture. Under proportional representation an average of 10% more women would be elected. There is already proof that PR works in making a more representative parliament. Sweden uses PR and 47.3% of their parliament are women and Rwanda has 56.3% women. We need to change our voting system now if we want to see a parliament that represents the people!

I know that Brown has promised a referendum on voting systems after the election, but can we really trust him?! Labour promised a referendum in 1997 and it never materialised!  In fact, Labour have promised many things that have never materialised!

The problem is, my friend, that the ""oppressed"" people in Finland are the Finns, not the immigrants. Don't believe me? You're welcome to move here and live with me as long as you pay half the rent. You'd soon learn that immigrants of Muslim background are granted a honorary status. A Muslim immigrant who can't read and refuses to learn to read even when it's free and encouraged in a familiar environment, is ahead of the curve when applying for a job in favor of any other person with a proper education for the job. But, instead of actually working, they stay at home buying expensive shit, driving nice cars and buying brand clothes. Why on earth would they work? Why would they? An immigrant is granted almost the same amount of welfare as what a Finnish physician makes in a month. The difference is like one-hundred euros, give or take. They get an insanely amount of money and they don't have to do anything. Why would they even consider working? I wouldn't and neither would you.

We have made their living conditions a paradise here. We have put their freedoms above ours. Our goverment discriminates Finns in favor of immigrants. I'm not asking to put us in the ""superiority"" status, I'm asking for equality. But it's not going to happen.

"&gt;There are probably a lot more things that influenced her life (and the lives of people in that country) than the execution of Jewish insurgents in WW2 (e.g. the invention of the: computer, nuclear bomb, chemistry development in the 60ies, internet, etc...).

Let's go down that list, shall we?

1. The computer was first implemented by British intelligence as a means of automating the algorithm used to break Enigma encryption used by the Nazis in World War II, in order to stop the various crimes that Nazi Germany was perpetrating in Europe.  Amongst those crimes was the execution of anyone even remotely Jewish (not just insurgents).

2. The nuclear bomb was invented because American and British forces received intelligence that the Nazis were working on similar weapons.  Wait, the Nazis?  Yep, nuclear technologies are a product of the war to stop their atrocities, too.

3. Which chemistry developments of the 1960's are we discussing?  LSD was admittedly a Swiss development, but it was first isolated in 1938.  Pot has been around for a lot longer.  Oh, you're talking about the hippie counterculture, which was a backlash against the overly rigid domestic culture of the 1950's, brought about in part because almost every dude had been a member of the military during World War II.

4. The Internet would not exist without the invention of the computer.  See number 1.

The Jews weren't traitors (unless I'm talking to a Holocaust revisionist/denier, in which case, you're just fucking nuts).  They were just Jews, and were killed for that ""crime"".  I will, however, agree that it was not a turning point in the war.  That said, the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo weren't really turning points, either: the Allies had the upper hand by that point.

"&gt; The computer was first implemented by British intelligence as a means of automating the algorithm used to break Enigma encryption used by the Nazis in World War

The computer is much older than that I am afraid. Development of it probably started with automated looms and primitive counting machines. Babbage created mechanical computers in the 19th century (quite a while before WW2).

You may argue that several components were developed in WW2. Then again, more important components were developed later – such as the transistor for which Shockley (a noted Eugenicist) received the Nobel Prize. If you read history, you will notice that war time commitments actually *delayed* this development.

&gt; in order to stop the various crimes that Nazi Germany was perpetrating in Europe. Amongst those crimes was the execution of anyone even remotely Jewish (not just insurgents).

Neither the German general public nor the American general public were aware of what happened in the concentration camps at that point. Note that concentration camps were also used by the British in several wars (they invented concentration camps). 

&gt; Pot has been around for a lot longer.

WTF? Drugs do not mean “chemical revolution”. I am talking about the development of industrial scale of chemical processes and a better understanding of chemistry as a whole. As an example, consider the development and industrial use of several types of plastics. 

&gt; The Internet would not exist without the invention of the computer. See number 1.


Again, the computer was invented long before WW2. The internet would not exist if it wasn’t for many important developments, and at best, WW2’s effect is insignificant. 

&gt; The Jews weren't traitors

Germans viewed them as traitors since communist agitators (which were mainly Jews) tried to take over Weimar Germany in a “German Revolution”. Many Germans also felt that they were betrayed by Jews in WW1. (This would be an entirely reasonable POV, [since even in the USA, the majority of people guilty of high treason are Jews]( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/b6rbc/the_european_court_of_justice_has_ruled_that/c0lahlq)). 

&gt; They were just Jews, and were killed for that ""crime"".

Women and children in Dresden and Tokyo firebombings were killed under the “total war” excuse that Americans use. To summarise this argument: The women and children were enabling German industry and civil society to function; therefore it is entirely justified to kill women and children. 

Yet, you can use that same argument with WW2 – Jewish civilians allowed a communist insurgency to survive. So, the “Total War” excuse is entirely justified. 

&gt; fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo weren't really turning points, either: the Allies had the upper hand by that point.

This only makes those atrocities worse and the excuse for it (“Total War”) irrelevant.

It seems however that we do agree on Dresden, Nagasaki and Hiroshima. This is rare for a foreigner, as most Americans will tell you that they did Japan a favour by dropping nuclear bombs on civilian cities. 

The firebombing of Tokyo wasn’t warranted. The target was not heavy industry, but wooden building in which civilian women and children lived. The idea was to start huge fires in civilian neighbourhoods and overwhelm fire crews (so that they literally burn to death).

-Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), reply of the Pennsylvania Assembly to the governor, November 11, 1755 or Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759. 

*""It is always dangerous to the liberties of the people to have an army stationed among them, over which they have no control ... The militia is composed of free citizens. There is therefore no danger of their making use of their power to the destruction of their own rights, or suffering others to invade them.""*. - Samuel Adams, Writings, III (1906)

*""False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that  has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm those only who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty -- so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator -- and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the quality alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.""*  - Thomas Jefferson, paraphrasing 18th Century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment (1764) [Kates,""Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment,"" 82 Michigan Law Revue 203,234 (1983)] 

*""A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the companion of your walks.""*  - Thomas Jefferson,  Letter to his nephew, [Kates,""Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment,"" 82 Michigan Law Revue 221-2,228-9 (1983)]. Also in Encyclopedia of Thomas Jefferson, at 318, Foley, Ed. reissued 1967

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers...To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.""*  - George Mason, during Virginia's ratification convention, (1788), in The Debates of the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, Jonathan Elliot (New York, Burt Franklin: 1888) 

*""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.""*  - Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principals of the Federal Constitution Proposed by the Late Convention (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States, at 56, P.

competition is very much a good thing in my opinion.  one of the things i most value about the free market system as it relates to me personally is that i only get paid for the services or goods that i can produce myself.  i think most natives are like me in that respect.  we understand that if we want a job in the western world or take part in western civilization that we need to have an education.  competition is always good.",,t1_c0lu28j,IAmA,True,0,ndoomdoom,,1426236205,,0,0,0,0,t1_c0lt28j,False,False,t3_bafk9,c0lu28j,t5_2qzb6,1268092540

"&gt; The two countries gave them money when their government was on the verge of collapse.

They didn't give Iceland money. They unilaterally decided to pay Icesave depositors in their respective countries (suspecting that the Icelandic depositor's fund could not cover the foreign Icesave deposits) and now they're asking Iceland to reimburse them. The Icelandic depositor's guarantee fund could not cover the deposits and became bankrupt, so they're offering to loan the money to the fund if they get a government guarantee (sovereign guarantee) on payback.

(Note that while the UK compensated Icesave-UK depositors, it used anti-terrorism laws to freeze the assets of all Icelandic banks in the UK, both the parent bank of Icesave and of Kaupthing, which had nothing to do with Icesave (and was still a private bank at the time, it became bankrupt after all its assets were frozen), and that further contributed to the collapse of the Icelandic economy and currency.)

There is no sovereign guarantee on the fund by default except as is provided by law. Since the EU legislation on guarantee funds is fuzzy on the matter (and UK/NL have refused to bring the matter before a court to settle it), the Icelandic government, under pressure from UK/NL, has been trying to pass laws to put a sovereign guarantee on the fund.

The first issue that needs to be settled is what the legal responsibility is, and that is why we have courts. If the court decides that the Icelandic law that established the EU depositor insurance scheme and the depositor guarantee fund, also established a sovereign guarantee on the fund (meaning that if the fund goes bankrupt, it doesn't just stop there, the government takes the burden), then we can start discussing terms of payment.

So long as the lodges have mutual recognition, a Mason from one lodge in one state is recognized as a Mason in the other lodge in the other state.

Depending on the rules of the state and lodge, some will allow joint membership. Others will not -- a Mason would have to withdraw his membership from one to become a member of the other. Personally, I've moved states a few times but have never left the lodge where I was raised.

"Sure! Here's a few vids I enjoy. If you want anything more specific just let me know. http://www.tube8.com/teen/faye-and-lexi-share-a-dick/132131/ Amazing threesome scene, Faye and Dane Cross are a couple so this scene has a great laid back energy to it. The whole scene is ridiculous but in particular check out the position he gets lexi in at 23:40. If that isn't heaven.... http://www.tube8.com/teen/lexi-belle-sybian/5812/ here's Lexi riding a sybian. It's from really early in her career and she's laughing and really getting off from it. Watch 21:40 when she tries to get through her abc's as her turns up the power.

If you can lose your suspension of belief and really get into them (believe she really is making eye contact and talking to you etc.) pov vids and ""jerkoff encouragement"" vids in particular are great. http://www.tube8.com/fetish/jerk-off-for-lexi-belle/202305/
http://www.megavideo.com/?d=4MI1SSNQ really nice pov scene.

Texas Presley is really cool. Check out her interview here http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/texas-presley-interview.php since it makes getting to watch her scenes all the more awesome

http://www.xvideos.com/video341924/texas_presley_fresh_out_the_box_part1 I love this cause you get to see her put on her makeup and give a really natural interview with the female director beforehand. Some guys like porn where the girls are sex slaves with no personalities but for me anything that fleshes out her true personality and makes her feel like a real person makes porn so much hotter for me.

http://www.tnaflix.com/view_video.php?viewkey=94aa06f0925d58d4148c this is Gianna Michaels driving around in public fucking a guy in the back of a van. Really laid back scene, they joke around and playfight a lot and even stop and talk to random strangers a few times.

These vids are pretty crazy, basically a house party in Europe where everyones fucking each other and the camera goes from room to room stopping for 10 minutes then moving on. It advertises itself as tapings of a real swingers party and there is a very wide mix of people, some of them aren't that attractive but some girls are very hot and it *feels* so real and raw and human that I find myself getting off harder to this than most porn. http://www.empflix.com/view.php?id=51081 http://www.empflix.com/view.php?id=42020 http://www.tnaflix.com/view_video.php?viewkey=5690823d30d15269a980

"The burden of proof on an anonymous Internet site is definitely on the person making a claim about something. When my bullshit meter goes up to a certain level while reading an IAMA post and there's not a gold star to lessen my suspicion, guess what? I stop reading.

Which is exactly what I did with OP's original post. I'm only returning to this issue now because of all the drama I've noticed, plus I'm bored.

OP: I stopped believing your post early on and definitely quit reading altogether when you mentioned the little sister thing. I didn't downvote you, I just moved on because I smelled BS and frankly the post and topic were boring me anyway. But that's how I handle these situations: I move on. I don't downvote into oblivion because for all I know you are telling the truth. But no gold star, high BS style of writing? Moved on.

Maybe you were telling the truth though. Maybe you're just a poor writer (you are) but in reality come across as a very decent, intelligent, trusting guy IRL. Maybe you just had a big huge brainfart when you made the mistake of incorrectly stating you were from the USA. I don't know. What I do know is that the burden is on you to prove claims that would seem ridiculous or incredible to most of the rest of us.

Think about it like this: you login to Reddit tomorrow and see a post that says, ""I am the actor Brad Pitt. AMAA."". Shocked to discover Mr. Pitt is a redditor you click the link. No gold star. Still curious, you read some of the comments:

Comment 1: ""If you're really Brad Pitt, why no gold star on the AMA? I call BS.""

Reply 1: ""My agent is working on getting me the gold star. Trust me, though, I'm him. Angelina is sitting on my lap right now in our house in Hollywood, in fact. AMA.""

Comment 2: ""I'll buy you're Brad Pitt if you have Angelina take a picture of you sitting at your computer right now with this thread open on the monitor.""

Reply 2: ""Unfortunately our camera is broke. But like I said my agent is working on getting me the gold star. Trust me, I'm Brad Pitt. AMA.""

Comment 3: ""Wait, I just read in Variety that Brad Pitt is in Europe shooting a movie! [link]. Plus, you said your camera is broke? That sounds fishy, the real Brad Pitt could get a new camera in a second with wealth!""

Reply 3: ""JESUS CHRIST I MADE ONE MISTAKE AND SAID I WAS IN LA AND NOW I'M BEING CALLED A TROLL!!! That is such bullshit! This isn't the Reddit I know! Wow, I hate Reddit now. But you'll see, you'll see one day when my agent gets me that gold star! But for now of course everyone is downvoting me for confusing which country I was in! GOD. I hate you ALL now. Hate you ALL!!!""

When suspicion first came up about the veracity of your post you should have contacted a moderator and asked one simple thing: ""How do you propose I prove who I am and get the gold star? I'm sensitive about my privacy, I don't want my ID stolen, but perhaps there's a way to prove that I'm telling the truth we can both agree on."" I'm sure the mods would have many suggestions for how to do that which would not have included the rather convenient waiting period you suggest now (you don't see ""Jessie"" until Wednesday and you feel that's the only way you can prove who you are while in the same breath stating that you have all the documentation in front of you).

**tl;dr** Just talk to the mods and don't insult this community for being reasonably skeptical about your claims after such a terrible first post made so many of us suspicious.

"&gt;It's just the situation over there  
  
I'm very familiar with the situation ""over there"" thanks. I live in Europe.  
  
There are plenty of publications who do exactly as you suggest - print lots and lots of xenophobic articles. Give them their due, they seem to hate everyone who is ""foreign"", whether they are white Germans, black Nigerians or Muslims of any colour.  
  
The difference is this: If someone in the US argues against Christianity they are not arguing against any ethnic group per se, they are arguing against a bunch of fellow Americans whose behaviour they disagree with. I assume, if there were a war, that all the Atheist Americans would fight side-by-side with the Christian Americans, etc. In the UK, where there is, as you say, a perceived resentment against Muslims, the prevailing though amongst these bigots is to ""send them all home"".  
  
It's the difference between putting your own house in order (preaching to fellow Americans) and trying to force your neighbour to put his house in order (preaching to ""foreigners"" or ""others"").  
  
And, to remind you of my earlier point, I don't have anything against an anti-Muslim post, if it's well thought out and appropriate.  
  
If I come round to your house for dinner every week and we talk about a whole bunch of things, then you might quite enjoy my company. We can talk about the weather, cars, football, our holidays, where did you get that shirt? etc. if I come round every week and only talk about one thing, e.g. parrots, would you invite me back after the first few weeks? Not likely. You and your wife would be saying  
  
""Let's not invite puggydug back. All he ever talks about it parrots. I don't mind occasionally mentioning them, but it's just not normal to talk about them all the time. It's boring, and actually, it's not normal. Does he have a parrot fetish? Is he mentally ill?""  
  
If I see a Redditor with a wide and varied submission history and they then submit a link about Islam, I'll think ""OK, must be interesting, or he wouldn't have submitted it."" If I look at a Redditor's history and he's only been on the site for 5 days and has submitted 14 stories during that time, all on the same subject, then I'm probably not going to be interested in what he's got to say, because he's obviously got an agenda.",,t1_c0luweq,atheism,True,0,puggydug,,1426236597,,0,0,3,3,t1_c0lu0bd,False,False,t3_ban62,c0luweq,t5_2qh2p,1268122135

"&gt; Nazis definitely arent specific to germany lol. but holocausts are not specific to jews, they are more akin to War in general.

[The Holocaust (from Greek ὁλόκαυστος \[holókaustos\]: hólos, ""whole"" and kaustós, ""burnt""), also known as the Shoah (Hebrew): השואה, Romanized ha'shoah; Yiddish: חורבן, Romanized churben or hurban, is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II, a programme of systematic state-sponsored extermination by Nazi Germany.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)

Systematic state sponsored extermination campaigns are anything but akin to war in general, and nothing like the Holocaust is going on in the Palestinian territories. There are sporadic fightings in which both sides take too little precautions to spare civilian lives, but to say those fightings qualify as a holocaust is the exaggeration of the century.

Iran is a theocratic dictatorship whose senior figures repeatedly stated that they see America and Israel as ""Satan"". He has threatened Israel with destruction and supports Hamas and Hezbollah with money, weapons military advisors and is training their operatives.

"Turkey. Cheap beer, cheap cigarettes, amazing cheap food. If you move to Istanbul things will be more expensive (I pay about 300 USD a month rent), but you will live in an amazing cosmopolitan city. If you prefer a cheaper place, but still a great city, try Izmir. Izmir is probably the most secular city in Turkey, has great weather, and a reputation for beautiful women. You could get a decent apartment for 200 Turkish Lira a month (about 130 USD). In the big cities (Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara) pretty much everyone speaks some English. In Istanbul, English is almost universal.   

The visa situation can be done two ways. You can get residency easily for about 3,000 dollars or so (depends on the day you go in, and who you talk to). Or you can do what most young people do and get a series of 3 month tourist visas, just leave the country for a day every three months. It's actually nice, you get to see a lot of the region. You can get a round trip to Greece, Northern Cyprus, Bulgaria, Syria etc. from 100 TL or so up. 

There are a fair number of Europeans and Americans living in the three big cities (Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara). Mostly young people traveling and teaching, or older Europeans retiring to a warm, cheap country. In Istanbul there is a small traditional expat community, and Ankara has foreigners coming for government stuff. Ankara is very boring though. Probably the lamest place I have ever been. 

Alternatively, Egypt is amazingly cheap. And there are lots of foreigners in Cairo. Cairo has a decent nightlife scene. There are some cool bars and saloon type places that sell Stella for about 2 bucks a bottle, and food is great and cheap. You could live forever on 100,000 in Egypt. It's way more money than most people there will make in their entire life. I actively tried to spend money there and couldn't. I once ordered an 8 course meal at a decent restaurant and the bill came to around 20 dollars. Most days I ate for around 3-5 dollars a day.

"Dear god this is long...

1)     I don’t see the relevance of this link.  I have read the whole thing and is mostly a call to protest while the author bitches about how different people made out while banking was going well (politicians and bankers). (Edit:  He also plugs himself and his appearance on some US based TV panel and chats about the nice weather today)

No where does it say anything about normal people or the state as a whole doing badly while the banks did well.

Ok...  2) is even more irrelevant than 1.  It is an activist MP (which I have no problem with) giving her *opinion* about the IMF and Iceland’s governments actions.  It not only contains NO (zero, none, nil, zilch) facts but actually several misconceptions.  

For instance:

&gt;I’m very concerned about the vast amount of debt we’re taking on. **The European Union refused to support the IMF loan to Iceland unless we as a nation took on all the debts of Icesave and Kaupthing Edge – the debts of private enterprises that we, the citizens of this nation, did nothing to incur.** So we were trapped in a hopeless situation. And we can’t pay all those debts. What we need is skilled negotiators who will go to the creditors and say, ‘Look, we really do want to pay those debts, and **you can have the money as soon as we recover it from the tax havens where it was stashed**.’

There are three misconceptions here:

First, the EU only expects Iceland to take on the debts of those banks which it agreed to take on as part of ""EU by compulsory depositors protection schemes"" (Im quoting the same Wikipedia article that the Author or MP quote which is ironic as they clearly didn't read it).  In case you don’t know how this works, if a bank wants to operate in the EU area then the government of the nation it operates in must agree to insure the first 30,000 euros of the deposits that that bank takes from ordinary people against the bank failing.  The government can refuse (preventing the bank operating in the EU area) and it can charge whatever it thinks is reasonable to cover the risk.  Other EU governments all do this (many insure more than the required 30,000euros).  Iceland agreed to this and charged accordingly.  Now those banks have failed the EU insists that Iceland honour those commitments just like many other EU governments have done themselves.

So the EU does not insist that Iceland take on All the debts of the failed banks, only debts which it has already agreed to insure and been paid to insure and only debts which every EU national government would have to cover under the same circumstances.  

The second misconception here is that the nation did not incur.  Iceland did incur these debts when it sold insurance to banks incase the failed and then let them fail.  Note the lengths that the UK and US have gone to prevent failures like this.

The third misconceptions is that the money is available in “tax havens where it was stashed”.  It isn’t.  It has been spent.  Spent making bad loans to people (millions of people mostly for mortgages) who could not afford it and used it to buy things they could not afford (bigger house mostly) in acts of speculation (buying huge houses on interest only mortgages because “houses always increase in price”).

Maybe some money can be clawed back from bankers personal accounts but that is pretty unethical.

[She also claims that increasing interest rates is the wrong move but says something has to be done about the kroner devaluing.  Increased interest rates are about the only way to prevent the devaluing on a national currency.  On the bright side she is dead on when she says “Many of them [Households] are in great distress. The process of loan indexation** must be turned around manually”]

**TL;DR 1** In short, she does not understand what she is talking about and she is giving (un informed) opinions not facts on a website that is looking increasingly biased.

So, back to my original claims:

&gt; 1.  They profited from the actions of those few citizens 
&gt; 2.  They agreed multiple times to cover the losses of those few citizens

I present to you Wikipedia, which lists the [increase in GDP]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arsbreytinglandsfr2000-8_English.png) that Iceland: experienced after de-regulating its debt; that government used those funds to reduce tax rates (taking on a flat rate tax which is a dangerous luxury for any economy) as well as reducing corporation tax to one of the lowest rates in the world (now who is a tax haven huh?); knowingly insured high risk investments of about 80% of GDP at the same time that Iceland’s currency was rated the most overvalued in the WORLD and all while promising EU regulators that they would meet any and all responsibilities under international treaties on deposit insurance (which they charged the banks for by the way but now cant afford to provide).

The Dutch and UK goverments did not 'simply pay the icesave account holders' directly.

The Icesave banks in the UK and Holland were *branches* of Icesave, which is registered in Iceland. They are not independant banks. They hold no assets, no liabilities. They are just offices, really.

Such banks are required under EU law to provide a minimum deposit insurance against any losses of €20,000 per depositer. When the Icelandic banking system started to fail, bosses at Icesave realised they did not have enough cash to cover the insurance of everyone. Their solution was to re-write the terms and conditions of these accounts so insurance would only be offered to depositors in Iceland (something plainly illegal under both Icelandic and International law). They then quitely started moving any funds left in their international branches back to Iceland.

Transfers of such large ammounts of money don't go unnoticed however, and the UK was soon demanding to know what was going on. When they figured out that Iceland was essentially ripping off British citizens for billions to save themselves, they reached for laws written as part of an anti-terror bill to freeze any further transfers.

What happened next involved a lot of politcs. Holland and the UK offered the Icelandic goverment a deal where they'd leand them enough cash to fulfill their legal obligations to forign depositors, but Iceland rejected the deal thinking it could get better terms from the IMF. The 27 member countries of the IMF flatly turned it down based on the obvious legal situation; Iceland could not ignore its debts and would have to settle them before it could apply for any futher loans to aid its ecconemy.

So Iceland took the money from the Brits and the Duch.

You could say Iceland was 'forced' into the deal in the sense that it had no other choice, but then Iceland had left itself no other choice. It was a mix of poor governing and a population who would rather look the other way when told its banks were doing dangerous things by leveraging themselves to five times the countries GDP.
