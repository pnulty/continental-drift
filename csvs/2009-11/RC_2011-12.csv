&gt; The last group that had to be careful during this time was scholars. Early attempts to reform the educational curriculum to keep pace with contemporary European influences were exterminated during the 1640s and 1650s by the Inquisition. The central target was Fray Diego Rodriguez (1569–1668), who took the First Chair in Mathematics and Astronomy at the Royal and Pontifical University in 1637, and tried to introduce the scientific ideas of Galileo and Kepler to the New World. For thirty years, he argued the removal of theology and metaphysics from the study of science. He was the leader of a small circle of academics that met semi-clandestinely in private homes to discuss new scientific ideas. Political struggles of the 1640s, however, brought the suspicions of the Inquisition down upon them and a series of investigations and trials followed into the middle of the 1650s. When academics worked to hide books banned by the Holy Office’s edit in 1647, the Inquisition required all six booksellers in the city to subject their lists to scrutiny under the threat of fine and excommunication.",t1_c344f7n,lordlicorice,,,-1,True,t3_mv76g

The Federal Security Service (FSB) is reporting today that the “secret letter” sent to Prime Minister Putin by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda contains a warning that United States President Barack Obama has issued an executive-level “kill order” against US Congressman Ron Paul over fears this charismatic politician, who many believe could capture the Republican Presidential 2012 nomination, is about to expose to all Americans what can only be described as the largest mass theft in human history.

According to this report, Prime Minister Noda first became aware of this “kill order” after a private meeting with Obama at last weeks ASEAN Summit meeting in Indonesia when the American President expressed his “unconstrained joy” over the toppling of the Greek and Italian governments in bloodless coups by EU banksters who installed to run these countries unelected former Goldman Sachs executives.

Not known to many Americans is that the giant global investment firm Goldman Sachs put Obama into office by being its top donor and after winning the Presidency put so many of its former executives into the US government it is known as the “Wall Street Cabinet.”

The reason for Goldman Sachs, and other top American and European banksters, putting Obama into office, this report continues, was to loot the Americans taxpayers of an estimated $100 Trillion…nearly $30 Trillion of which went directly into the pockets of international banksters around the world and another $70 Trillion in lost home values, stock portfolios and pensions funds.

The main conduit of this massive theft was the US Federal Reserve System which during the 2008 Financial Crisis secretly doled out, without the American peoples knowledge, over $16 Trillion to European banks and companies and another nearly $8 Trillion in “secret loans” to the largest banks in the United States.

Causing Obama and his bankster allies to fear Ron Paul, this report continues, is the Congressman’s ability to hold US Congressional hearings on the $8 Trillion in secret loans to the largest banks in America without the public’s knowledge exposing this largest theft in human history and laying bare for all to see the total criminality of their entire elite political, financial and corporate class.

Though the US mainstream media has virtually ignored Ron Paul’s candidacy the American people themselves appear to have broken through this deliberate government ordered blackout of his Presidential run as evidenced by his rise in the polls in the first campaign States of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which should he win them all would assure him the Republican nomination.

The fears Ron Paul is causing among Americas elite classes appear to be justified as he recently likened the US Federal Reserve System to “drug addiction” warning that the deception it has foisted upon the public will lead to the destruction of the United States.

Ron Paul further warned the American people this year that their nation was becoming a “police state,” called for the impeachment of Obama for ordering the assassination of an American citizen without charges or trial, and stated that Obama had violated the War Powers Act over his actions against Libya.

Ron Paul’s fears of a police state America being ruled by a dictatorial tyrant were confirmed yesterday when the US Senate, in a 61-37 vote gave, for the first time in history, the power to the US Military to hold citizens without charges or trial indefinitely by passing a bill that was written in secret and never openly debated.

So frightening is this new law that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the days prior to its passing warned: “The Senate is going to vote on whether Congress will give this president—and every future president — the power to order the military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians anywhere in the world. The power is so broad that even U.S. citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself.”

Most ominous in this FSB report is its stating that the “assassination regime” ordered against Ron Paul by Obama may already be underway as one of the US foreclosure fraud whistleblowers subpoenaed by Ron Paul to testify before the US Congress named Tracey Lawrence was found “suicided” yesterday in Las Vegas.

The destruction of anyone found opposing the Obama regime and its bankster backers was, also, brought into sharp relief this week by the smearing by mental illness allegations of one of America’s top heroes US Marine Sergeant Dakota Meyer, who in September received the Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama (who called him one of the most “down-to-earth guys that you will ever meet”) for saving the lives of 36 of his comrades, but after he alerted the press that his employer defense contractor BAE Systems was selling high-tech sniper rifles to Pakistan that are being used to kill America Soldiers was labeled as a “drunk and mentally ill.”

So concerned has the Kremlin become about the growing American fascist police state it caused General Nikolai Makarov, Russia’s top military commander, to issue a warning to the West last week that the Motherland was fully prepared for a nuclear World War III and which prompted the Obama regime to state that it would immediately cease observing their arms treaty with Russia.

To if the American people will be able to rally around Ron Paul before he is assassinated by the Obama regime it is not in our knowing, other than to note that in a country where every public demonstration – however peaceful and orderly it might be – is ordered by their authorities to be treated as the equivalent of a prison riot, where the former police chief of Seattle blamed the militarization of local US police forces on Obama’s Homeland Security Department, and where the media is described as being nothing more than a “lapdog” for Obama and his bankster allies, the likelihood of these people escaping the worst horrors to come do, indeed, seem inescapable.",t1_c345bsb,smallblacksun,,,8,True,t3_mve5x

It's probably easier to think of them as states in the American sense, and all making up a larger nation state. Currently, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland both have some level of direct control over issues within their borders, fairly extensive controls as well in domestic policy terms. 

Historically, Wales has been a part of England (thus, the Prince of Wales) for many centuries. Scotland is an independent Kingdom in it's own right (a remant of this is that Prince Charles is known as the Prince of Wales in England and Wales, but the Duke of Rothesay [an area of Scotland] in Scotland). It was in fact a Scottish king, James (James the Sixth in Scotland, James the First in England), who was the first king of both Scotland and England &amp; Wales. NI is, basically, a fucking nightmare and has been for a long time.

For Scotland essentially, the next step is complete independence. There are legitimately strong arguments both for and against, it's really an instinctive and personal decision in the end. 

Wales is on much the same course as Scotland seemed to be. However, unlike Scotland it doesn't have much in the way of a route to economic self-dependence. There are fairly large reserves of oil in the North Sea in what would be Scottish waters, so there is a cash flow. Wales doesn't have the same. After the gutting of the industrial sector in eighties by the Thatcher Govt, a very significant number of people are employed by the public sector, to a point that would be unsustainable if there was actual independence from England (and English tax revenues...).

Northern Ireland, because of the sectarian and historical issues is unlikely to ever see actual independence - at least in the short and medium term. It'll be interesting to see how it develops, just as long as whatever happens, happens peacefully.

Some people, usually of the small-minded variety, question why England doesn't have some form of separate control over it's affairs. This is largely because of the demographics, England has most of the people and a lot of the money (in taxable terms anyway). Historically and culturally, the UK parliament has always been viewed as a development of the English parliament.

You'll find that there's little predicatable in how people will take certain descriptions of them. For every Welsh nationalist dreaming of independence, there are those that would prefer reverting back to complete Westminster control. I personally always describe myself as a Londoner, a European, a Brit and then English. There are of course various levels of offence that will people take. I really don't care if I'm confused for a Welsh person, a Scot or a fucking martian. There are others who have killed for less.

Even though they formally declared Independence in 1948, they had been developing a government for a long time before that, already had a military strategy, and had the backing of several European countries. The Arab League was never a true threat, as most countries had only existed a couple years and were on the verge of collapse after being occupied and dominated for a couple decades (at the least). Distrust was high after being separate for so long, and many in the Arab League inadequately prepared for war out of fear that, when they won, an opposing nation would take control. There were several well-populated Palestinian cities left with farmer's weapons to fend off the Israeli invasion because neither side was willing to trust the other with weapon caches. In short, Palestine was a lost cause in the first war due to greed and ineffective military strategy.

As for economic development: the first 2 generations of Jews were essentially European citizens who were highly educated and displaced who had international backing. To expect them to do anything less than make a former ""desert"" bloom would be surprising. You are comparing their progress to that of a mostly pastoral nation.

Adoptions of children from the United States, especially those in the Midwestern poverty-stricken states have risen by 600% since the news network first began airing the undercover footage.
PM of the Southern European Union made a public plea last week urging others to offer assistance to these children.  “We all should be offering a hand to those fallen on hard times.  Not merely a wave of the hand as we walk past, but an outstretched arm, pulling those who have been trampled on so harshly, and grasp them tight until these churning waters subside.”
The TMZ reports describes the conditions to be an affront to the senses, poorly lit, a hanging smell of urine and haunting, feral yells of countless children.  The orphanage, exposed in the undercover report, is a makeshift shelter originally used as a children’s hospital and contains an estimated 850+ children.  There are volunteers shown in the report who do what they can, but as the report explains, far too few.  One volunteer remarks, “It’s a place used for so long to benefit sick children… and now has become a last stop for so many healthy ones.”

1. Don't ever buy from a new seller (sadly), as a lot of them peddle fakes, and a lot of them scam you with lingo. Go for someone who's traded at least 200-300 times with a 98/99+% ratio

2. Take care of impulse buying. There is a LOT of cheap stuff on ebay, if you get all of it then you'll regret not buying 1 GOOD item, especially if the cheap stuff you got was ""used"".

3. Try to bid near the end of the time limit. Bidding near the middle seems to increase the total amount of bids that are made, which means you could end up paying more than if you'd waited before putting in your first bid.

4. Measurements are king. Don't trust sizes like ""S"" / ""M"" / etc.. even things like ""38"" and ""40"" can't be trusted, because some european designers add 10 to these figures (a euro 48 = a normal 38), so look at measurements! If they don't provide measurements, your best bet is to leave it.

5. The only items that I've been happy with from ebay are ones that came with tags, all the ""used"" stuff I bought I ended up donating because I didn't really like it; even though it was the right size and in good condition.

Kosovo became again part of Serbia after WWI which also marked the rise of Albanian nationalism , same way Palestine became part of Israel after the   war.

&gt;This is basically the cleanest and textbookworthy example of separatism recorded in recent history. People from state A (Albania) get into state B (Serbia), breed heavily, ond one day suddenly declare a part of B now belongs to A

Kosvo Albanians never declared a desire to join Alabania. First separatsim movments only waned liberation form Serbia and ""Serbian national Program"".  Same way ""Republika Srpska"" during Bosnian war.

That said I base my morals on what makes the most amount of people happy at the least amount of pain or other negativity. It's basically utilitarianism but I add compassion to it. I'm always seeking for better morals and big questions. I don't think I have a soul or purpose but I do have a conscience and choice.

I can be selfish at the expense of others or I can be charitable and help others; so I would want to be charitable and help the most people. If I was low on funds however, I would be less charitable because I could go bankrupt and wouldn't be able to be charitable at all.

As far as sex goes I'd say it's between partners on what is allowed and what isn't, I think most sexual lifestyles are fine as long as they don't hurt anybody. So I'm pro lgbt and anything in between. Legalize love.

I'm not too savvy as far as law goes but some basic things I believe in are personal freedoms, a fair social net that provides shelter, food, water, healthcare and other necessaries, direct democracy and ultimately whatever works best.

In many ways I felt like I was learning the art of courting all over again given how different America was at times. I got myself into situations that at least taught me a lot. I think European women tend to be a little more assertive than American women when you are talking to them, American women in my experience tend to be more reserverd.

So in other words if I'm talking to say a Swedish woman she is a lot more likely to smile, turn her body towards me and joke with me but Swedish women are just laid back, it's not always a sign of ""sleep with me, now"".

American women like I said tend to be more reserved but the reserved women are bloody hard to read. I remember going to a party and spending a while talking to a pretty blonde. She didn't seem too interested, hardly made any eye contact and basically when she came back my way she didn't sit too close to me.

A couple of days later at Berkeley(most of my friends were Berkeley students in the US as my cousin studied there and introduced his friends to me) I find out that shes avoiding me.. because I didn't ask her out despite the obvious signs she was giving me. Are you bloody serious?!?.. I didn't say that but I was thinking it lol. I did ask her out and we dated for a while and got along great.

As for the women who are open with you, well to be honest I think all women should be like that. I mean don't get me wrong theres nothing wrong with being a little nervous though it takes a very confident person to ask somebody like that out so you are probably reducing your chances significantly, but it's a good thing to be open and honest. That doesn't mean be rude just don't be afraid to reciprocate the treatment you are receiving, if somebody is being nice to you then try and return the favour regardless of whether you are male or female.

If I mistake a womans ""signs"" she can always say no when I ask her out or ask for her number, it isn't a blow, if you aren't willing to take that risk then you are losing more than your gaining. Rejection for a lot of men in the US seems to mean some sort of horrible wounding blow. It's not that big of a deal though and if you are avoiding asking people out then you may be missing out on a great lady you have read wrong. I certainly learnt that the hard way and changed my attitude towards women that seem reserved. I don't think you should change what you are doing, that particular fault tends to lie more with men but a easy putdown is something you should practise IMO.

Here is a blurb from a [Guardian article]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2807,00.html )


&gt;Q - Why are cans of soft drink standardised at 330ml, cartons of juice 200ml and alcoholic beers and ciders 440ml? Is that as much as they think we can drink or is there some other reason?

&gt;&gt; A - DRINKS cans are now made in dozens of sizes worldwide, depending on local needs, from 150ml up to &gt;&gt;750ml. Before the second world war, beer in the US was filled in steel cans which used what had been a &gt;&gt;traditional size for canning peas. This held 12 fluid ounces of drink and the volume and diameter of the can &gt;&gt;was retained when the modern style of so-called ""two-piece"" (with a lid and a body) drinks can was &gt;&gt;introduced in the late fifties. A volume of 12oz is 355ml, and this is still the standard in the US: in Europe it &gt;&gt;was converted to the round figure of about one-third of a litre, or 330ml. Demand in Europe for bigger &gt;&gt;volumes in beer cans lead to the third larger size of 440ml and later the 500ml. Smaller sizes such as 150ml, &gt;&gt;200 and 250ml are employed for children's drinks and mixers where bigger volumes are not required. Regional &gt;&gt;traditions influence can sizes. In Venezuela, 8oz and 10oz beer and soft-drinks cans prevailed until recently &gt;&gt;because they fitted in the local cooled vending machines.*

&gt;&gt;John Nutting, Editor, The Canmaker, Crawley, W Sussex.



As for the weaker beer question, it is simply due to government regulations it seems. [Here](http://www.yourdrinking.ie/reports/HPR00520.pdf) is an governmental report on drink strength in the Republic and at various points, it compares + contrasts with the UK.

The whole house-of-cards built by money makers seems to be starting to tumble down. This really sounds like the logical conclusion of fractional-reserve banking (I would encourage anybody to look it up, see brief description below).

I think that people are beginning to see that it is banks that rule the world, not governments.

&gt; Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes her laws.

&gt;-Mayer Amschel Rothschild

Here's a *brief* summation of the main problem with fractional-reserve banking, in case nobody wants to look it up:

&gt; Critics of fractional reserve banking claim that since **money creation requires loans** from the banking system, **people are required to go into debt** in order for any new money to be created. They assert that this can debase the means of exchange. While there is no controversy over the fact that the commercial banking system expands the money supply, critics find it problematic that **banks ""create money out of nothing**.""

&gt; One criticism posits that since debt and the interest on the debt can only be paid in the same form of money, **the total debt (principal plus interest) can never be paid in a debt-based monetary system unless more money is created through the same process**. For example: if 100 credits are created and loaned into the economy at 10% per year, at the end of the year 110 credits will be needed to pay the loan and extinguish the debt. However, since the additional 10 credits does not yet exist, it too must be borrowed. **This implies that debt must grow exponentially in order for the monetary system to remain solvent**. This was the argument of the Social Credit movement of the 1930s, who proposed to remove the job of money creation from banks and give it to governments.

I believe that proactive steps to prevent, or at least delay, that inevitable event should be taken - one of which is to implement a population control plan. Nothing as drastic as say China, but at least some sort of plan to slowly control the birth rate.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the Church promoted literacy and science through their schools, which were the best in Europe, and Astronomy was of great interest to the Church. But not all science was promoted; the Church banned Aristotle's teachings in the 13th century.During the Scientific Revolution, Scientists such as Copernicus (heliocentric theory) and Gesser (zoology), were directly involved with the Church. Of course, Galileo was convicted of heresy, but his book was eventually uncensored by the Church. Mendel (Genetics) and Georges Lemaitre (Big Bang theory) were also priests and conducted their studies within the Church. 

Evolution is always a heated topic with Christians, but the Catholic Church has never condemned the theory. For nearly 100 years, they were neutral on the subject, and do not worry about the literal take on the Book of Genesis. Instead, they are concerned with the idea that humans have souls, and how that fits into evolution. In fact, the Church has spoken out against Modern Creationism and Modern use of Intelligent Design. Senior Vatican scientist Brother Consolmagno believes, ""The word has been hijacked by narrow group of Creationist fundamentalists in America to mean something it did not originally mean at all Today, the Church promotes Theistic Evoltuion, or the idea that evolution and the Bible don't directly contradict.The Church also does night fight with scientists based on how old the Earth is or the accuracy of fossils, because it is not within the realm of their specialty. The Church also promotes evolution being taught in school, along with supplementary Bible teachings at Church. Jesuits have been huge supporters of science and education and continue to be remarkable individuals.

People from different parts of the world have different skull shapes, for example.  Different skin tones.  Different eye and hair colors.  Different muscle densities or bone structure.  These things all tend to differ from one geographic area to the next.  For example, the negroid race (Africa/Indian ocean/native Australians) differs significantly from the mongoloid race (East Asian/native Americans).

You seem to be working off of a different definition of race than everyone else.  Whether you want to admit it or not there are genetically divergent groups of human beings.  We call these groups races.  People who don't fit neatly into one have a mixed ancestry or exist in the tails of phenotype distributions.

Phasing out the word race is a politically motivated endeavor.  A biologist or forensic anthropologist will tell you that people belong to certain groups, usually called races.

EDIT:  This may be more reading than you care to do on the subject, but there is a great Nova article about this that explores both sides.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html  If you read nothing else of this comment I really recommend giving it a read.

The article has opinions from an anthropologist on each side.  I tend to agree with the ""pro race"" stance, especially because a number of arguments used by the ""anti-race"" side are fallacious.  first:

&gt;I should point out that this is the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. To this day, few have actually made the observations and done the calculations that led those Renaissance scholars to challenge the universal perception that the sun sets in the evening to rise again at the dawn.

I'm an Astronomer, and I can tell you straight away that this is factually incorrect, and the two issues aren't all that similar to begin with.  

&gt;As a rule, the boy marries the girl next door throughout the whole world, but next door goes on without stop from one region to another.

This is factually incorrect as well.  There are very sharp geographic (and climate) delineations that create sharp divisions between populations.

These are both dwarfed by the massive admission the author makes here:

&gt;There is nothing wrong with using geographic labels to designate people. Major continental terms are just fine, and sub-regional refinements such as Western European, Eastern African, Southeast Asian, and so forth carry no unintentional baggage. In contrast, terms such as ""Negroid,"" ""Caucasoid,"" and ""Mongoloid"" create more problems than they solve. 

The problem with race is not it's definition but it's connotation.  There is no difference between differentiating people based on geographic region of ancestry, which this author says is alright, and races.  It's a syntax argument, made for political correctness.  The problem is the ""baggage"" carried by the terms, not that the terms are incorrect.",t1_c342qe9,[deleted],,,2,True,t3_muszw

It's really got to do with the mentality the people have. Sweden again being a prime example is where I thought the women didn't care about social or peer pressure.

It's sort of like getting on a train, smiling at a woman and she smiles back instead of frowning or jumping on you, kicking you in the balls and calling the police because you had ""rape in your eyes"".

I remember going to a bar and this woman starts talking to me. A few minutes later shes telling her friend ""Doesn't that accent just make you wet"" and then a few minutes after that she pretty much asks me ""So my place or yours"" out of the blue.

Of course I'm not saying that you can do any of that without being good at courting, I mean if you are not going to approach a woman in the first place your chances aren't very good at getting anything going and even then there is work to be done.

I agree about differences in Europe being part of the charm although I also think that road safety might improve if there was a common standard. In Sweden deaths decreased in the first few years after the switch so the risks associated with re-learning may be overstated. 

European LGVs especially suffer from blind spots while on UK roads, this [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/5303465/Accidents-caused-by-foreign-lorries-increase-by-10-per-cent.html) attributes 30 deaths a year to it and also notes that the DFT provided 200,000 mirrors to foreign LGVs. I have no idea what such mirrors would cost but it is an example of the ongoing cost of having a different road system from the primary trading partners. 

The fatalities will have cost somewhere around £600k each (according to DFT, quoted by the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8239048.stm)) plus the obvious human suffering. On a more personal level three people I knew have been killed on the roads in recent years, two were young guys (20-something) and one was in his fifties, killed on the last day before retirement. Every time somebody I know dies I wonder if it was avoidable, perhaps even if it doesn't make economic sense it might make 'human emotional cost' sense if a standard transport system reduced fatalities.

Having said that of course the UK is doing much better on fatalities per capita than most right-hand drive countries. I guess coming from Sweden I'm spoiled and biased.

Gangs aren't really a big problem within the 'civilised' circles of society so you probably won't encounter them much. To be on the safe side, never pick a fight with someone wearing a motorcycle jacket with a patch on it (think Hell's Angels), or with a tattoo on their face (called a 'moko'). This is actually a pretty offensive thing to say, because the moko is a noble tradition, but generally these days it's unfortunately associated with gangs.

I recommend you buy a car when you can. There's lots of places you can get to quite easily within a few hours that are quite spectacular. Insurance is a pittance compared to the UK, but petrol isn't cheap, so smaller car still probably better. 

Supermarket selection of stuff is much smaller. You can't buy spirits in the supermarket - you have to go to a liquor store for that - but you can buy wine and beer.

**Royal Australasian College of Physicians**

After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand. *(Page 5)*

**British Medical Association** 

Circumcision of male babies and children at the request of their parents is an increasingly controversial area and strongly opposing views about circumcision are found within society and within the BMA’s membership. The medical evidence about its health impact is equivocal. 

[..]

Nevertheless, normal anatomical and physiological characteristics of the infant foreskin have in the past been misinterpreted as being abnormal. The British Association of Paediatric Surgeons advises that there is rarely a clinical indication for circumcision.

[..]

The medical benefits previously claimed, however, have not been convincingly proven, and it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. It is essential that doctors perform male circumcision only where this is demonstrably in the best interests of the child. 

[..]

Best interests

-Doctors must act in the best interests of the patient.

-Even where they do not decide for themselves, the views that children express are important in determining what is in their best interests.

-The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental preference must be weighed in terms of the child’s interests.

-The courts have confirmed that the child’s lifestyle and likely upbringing are relevant factors to take into account. The particular situation of the case needs to be considered.

-Parents must explain and justify requests for circumcision, in terms of the child’s interests.

**Canadian Pediatric Society**

Recommendation: Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely performed.

Validation: This recommendation is in keeping with previous statements on neonatal circumcision by the Canadian Paediatric Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The statement was reviewed by the Infectious Disease Committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society. The Board of Directors of the Canadian Paediatric Society has reviewed its content and approved it for publication.

**Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij  tot bevordering der Geneeskunst (Royal Dutch Medical Society) *or* KNMG**

This viewpoint by the KNMG is jointly endorsed by the following scientific associations:

- The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners
- The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians
- The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons
- The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons
- The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine
- The Netherlands Urology Association
- The Netherlands Surgeons’ Association


There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in the light of the complications which can arise
during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. Insofar as there are medical benefits, such as a possibly reduced
risk of HIV infection, it is reasonable to put off circumcision until the age at which such a risk is relevant and the boy himself can decide about the intervention, or can opt for any available alternatives.

[..]

Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child’s right to autonomy and physical integrity.

[..]

Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present, or if it can be convincingly demonstrated that the medical intervention is in the interest of the child, as in the case of vaccinations.

[..]

The fact that this is a medically non-essential intervention with a real risk of complications makes the quality
of this advice particularly important.

Another side note, you mentioned that this is something you're looking at doing after you are married. Make sure this is the case as there is a massive difference, often, at how UDI sees married couples who want to immigrate versus couples in a 2+ year relationship. If you go the route of job transfer it will be your finance who has the primary visa, and yours would be dependent on your finance's, which will be bolstered via marriage certificate. Right to family is something often controversial here, due to lots of immigration from non-western countries, and while they're supposed to recognise your relationship if you've been together over 2 years, there's no guarantee. I would really recommend waiting until after you're married. 

Oh, and on a side note about applying for your family visa, whatever the route, and providing your marriage certificate as proof? You'll need to get an apostille from the appropriate US governmental office. Often not a local one, but federal. Do this before you move as it can be VERY costly if you have to provide one after. Actually, get 2 or 3 with an apostille. You'll need it. 


One last thing to point out - getting a visa for one of you is priority, but you don't BOTH need one to get in. If your fiance can get one, but you are unable to initially (I'm not 100% positive about how the added on family immigration visa works in regards to the non-eu work visa), as an American you can be in Norway while you apply for a visa. This loop hole exists for very few countries, but the US is one. The processing times can sometimes be excruciatingly long (up to a year) but if your fiance has one, you can almost certainly be in Norway while you apply for yours. Granted you can't actually work or do anything of any use while you're waiting, but you don't have to be separated.

Other than that, it's worth getting out of the city to see some of the stunning countryside. Checking out the bazaars never really gets old either. It's not really a city for sightseeing or cultural activity, to be honest, although there are the occasional festivals, ballets and operas.

3. The best way to practise the language? I wouldn't know for sure, but my friends seem to say that staying as detached from the expat scene as possible is best, if possible.

This statement doesn't even make any sense. Safety, by definition is

&gt; freedom from the occurrence or risk of injury, danger, or loss.

So really, too much safety is a good thing! It prevents accidents and idiots!

&gt;  it's too damn expensive.

So, because our capitalist economy is threatened with safety (haha, had to laugh while I was typing that one), we should disregard safety? We should make things cheap so everyone can have them, no matter how safe they are? That's absurd, my good friend! Especially when considering the ramifications of releasing an untested or dangerous drug. We're talking deaths, illnesses, lawsuits, etc.

So, I have less of a problem with a few large drug companies than I do with a lot of under- or unregulated drugs out on the market that are potentially harmful to the user.

&gt; BTW while drug companies [only monopolies that can survive the current FDA environment] who would have a cure for cancer by now if they weren't spending billions of dollars for many unnecessary restrictions...herbal and vitamin manufacturers are not regulated at all by the FDA!

Number 1. Don't try and speculate on what could happen without any evidence that it could, it makes you look like a horrible debater.

Number 2. 

&gt; herbal and vitamin manufacturers are not regulated at all by the FDA!

I'm gonna hit you with some facts here, so be prepared.

&gt; FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under a different set of regulations than those covering ""conventional"" foods and drug products (prescription and Over-the-Counter). Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), **the dietary supplement or dietary ingredient manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that a dietary supplement or ingredient is safe before it is marketed. FDA is responsible for taking action against any unsafe dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. Generally, manufacturers do not need to register their products with FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling dietary supplements.*** Manufacturers must make sure that product label information is truthful and not misleading. Under the FDA Final Rule 21 CFR 111, all domestic and foreign companies that manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplement, including those involved with testing, quality control, and dietary supplement distribution in the U.S., must comply with the Dietary Supplement Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPS) for quality control. **In addition, the manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the label of a dietary supplement marketed in the United States is required to submit to FDA all serious adverse event reports associated with use of the dietary supplement in the United States.**

&gt; **FDA's other responsibilities include product information, such as labeling, claims, package inserts, and accompanying literature. The Federal Trade Commission regulates dietary supplement advertising.**

&gt; *Domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture/process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States are required to register their facility with the FDA. For more information, see Registration of Food Facilities.

Up until the last 10-15 years, soccer (now known as football officially) was primarily played by migrants and the children of migrants.

And the migrants came mostly from UK, southern Europe (Italy, Greece) and the Balkans (Croatia, serbia, etc...) but some also came from Hungary and Poland.

When they moved here, they really didn't know English and tended to stick together and participate in sports they knew like soccer as it was called. They also formed clubs based along ethnic lines. So in Melbourne there were teams like Brusnwick Juventus, South Melbourne Hellas, Melbourne Croatia.

In the mid 70's, the ASF formed the National Soccer League and every team was ethnically affiliated somewhere.

And it continued like that for a while, but they found it hard to compete with the VFL/NSWRL. The only time they usually made the papers is when say Melbourne Croatia played a team with Serbian heritage and there were riots.

It still kept going but they switched the season to summer but they realised they were struggling to attract non-ethnic supporters so they started bringing in franchise like teams like Perth Glory. Collingwood FC had a team called the Warriors who played at Vic Park and Carlton had a team called Carlton SC. While Carlton only lasted a couple of years, they did manage to produce some great players like Bresciano and Archie Thompson.

But by the start of the 2000's the NSL was on life support and coupled with the Socceroos inability to qualify for a WC, the Australian government ordered an inquiry and the report suggested 4 main points...

1. Get rid of the NSL
2. Ban existing state teams  from using ethnic names
3. Create a new league with no ethnic affiliations
4. Join the Asian confederation

This created the A League. Also in the first year, Australia finally qualified for the WC and due to the fact they're playing more often, qualified for the 2010 WC as well.

This has created problems for RU. Up until 2006, the Wallabies were the premier national team brand as there is no internationals in AFL and int RL is a joke.

Soccer isn't so much part of the code wars. The AFL/NRL administrators don't see soccer as a threat because although alot of kids play it, most don't stick to it and will eventually cross over to AR/RL/RU.

Truman's threats MIGHT have softened Stalin's position, and he may have been more lenient; however, he wouldn't have given Europe away no matter what was done. 

In 1945, communism wasn't despised. Most countries had large communist parties or communist-supporting minorities, and the USSR's industrial miracle of the inter-war era, where it went from utter destruction in a civil war and being fifty years behind the West in industrialization to the third largest industrial power and caught up to the rest of the world, was considered by many to be indicitive of Communism's superiority. 

You assume that Truman had a far stronger hand than he actually did. When he made his deals with Stalin, American presence on Europe was essentially nonexistent, while the USSR was succeeding in the East, and creating an army that eventually caused more than 80% of German casualties. The U.S. was winning against Japan, but even after the nuclear bombs fell (well AFTER the deals about Europe were made), it's disputed whether it's the bombs or the Soviet invasion of Manchuria which forced a Japanese surrender. Guess who wouldn't have invaded Manchuria, and who may have even aided Japan, if he didn't like what the United States was doing?

You're silly. Read a history book. Telling a country more powerful than you to fuck off doesn't work. And from 1943 until 1949, when the USSR also got nuclear weapons, the American military was miniscule compared to that of the USSR. The U.S's Navy was unmatched, but useless for waging an offensive war against a land power. Force a war, and you may lose all of Europe except Great Britain to the Red Army. Then, try to somehow make them surrender, with a weaker military, before they get nuclear weapons themselves. ",t1_c341xqr,BIG_GORILLA,,,1,True,t3_mr4my

I'm not the American here, Bubba. You are. Where I come from we learn real history. Not the ""the world is 6000 years old"" hogwash that passes for history in your retard factories you call schools.  

&gt;In just a couple centuries America accomplished more than your shit eating squatting peasants could ever have dreamed of.

You mean America has been bribing people from other parts of the world to come to it's shores and then claims their work as its own? America by itself has produced and contributed absolutely nothing to humanity. It has only detracted from the sum of human knowledge and culture.

It's a parasitic infection upon humanity since the day it came into existence and it will be until it dies (which thankfully is  gonna be real soon). Oh and do you know why you guys desperately bribe and whore yourself out to attract talent from around the world to pass of as your own? Because the Americunts are a bunch of useless, pigfucking, inbred retards incapable of producing anything worthwhile. 

Your founders were a bunch of incestuous fundy fuckwits, the genetic gutter of Europe, whose favorite hobby was fucking their sisters, pigs and smearing shit all over themselves with paper.


&gt;Shit, you guys had HOW LONG to make meaningful advancements in science? 

LOL, there you go being American again. Hey motherfucker, the modern Scientific method was a Muslim invention. Between the the 10th and right up to the 17th century most of the Scientific and intellectual contributions to humanity were made by Muslim societies. That's until your Euro cousins went on their imperial rampage and pretty much destroyed all non-Euro societies out there. 

&gt; Yet who went to the moon?

You think American retards were behind that? Like the Manhattan project most of the intellectual work was done by non-American with functional brains. Americans are incapable of doing anything productive or impressive at all. Everybody knows that.


&gt;You child molesting zealots had HOW LONG to develop your culture?

AHAHAHAHAHA... Funny since it was only a few days ago that you savages were violently rioting because some pedophile coach got arrested. That's American culture.

&gt; Yet who set the example for women's rights, which your sand nigger camel jockey faggot people still have horribly wrong (""you reject me?? I THROW ACID ON YOU! BECAUSE MY PEOPLE INBREED!!!!""). 

Except acid attacks are not a Muslim phenomenon and occur throughout non-Muslim societies in Asia and Africa. But American culture is far worse, every minute an American women (who are all fat, ugly and stink like crap btw) gets raped, your rates of domestic violence and homicidal violence against women are through the fcuking roof. 

on the other hand, nearly half the Muslim world has already elected women to serve as heads of state and government. You Americunt savages haven't even elected a woman to serve as a vice president yet in your centuries of existence (Iran btw has already had 2!). Lets be real, a woman is probably far more safer and empowered in your average Muslim society than in the States where she faces the risk of getting violently gangraped evertime she goes out and getting her head blown off by a criminal. That's America. 

&gt;Seriously, the world collectively facepalms whenever you people are in the news, because it's ALWAYS some absolute bullshit. 

The world doesn't consist of your stinking, inbred trailer park, you degenrate rectal parasite. 

&gt; In 2011 alone, over 1,400 Afghan civilians have been killed, and over 100k just in Iraq since 2003. 

And I'm sure you eagerly gobble all the other crap they serve you as news on that Fox channel.

&gt;I like to imagine a little brown boy, shot, but not mortally wounded, crawling in the sand towards his shit-hut, crying out for his burqa-herp-derp wearing cunt of a mother (not his dad, because he was already killed by American soldiers). Then some American soldiers come by and strip him down and stick a broom handle up his ass and pose for pictures. I love that shit. You people deserve it. 

Exactly, that's what American culture is really about. The average Muslim dreams of a prosperous, productive life working to achieve his goals, providing for his family and serving his community. 

The average Americunt troglodyte dreams about sodomozing some defenceless brown orphan whose parents they have just murdered in cold blood. That is his only goal in life.

That's the difference between Muslim and American culture. It's also the difference between humans and animals.  Thank you for making that so clear for us.

Although it's certainly possible that the entire world's birthrate could theoretically level off, I would seriously doubt that happening. If it does, then I doubt that it would happen for long.

I attribute Europe's birth rate problem to a culture that is highly secular, and a society where a high standard of living and a high level of education (as well as the easy availability of birth control) have prompted families to choose not to have children. This isn't a reality for places with high birth rates like Africa, and probably won't be a reality for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I don't think that it is likely that the entire world would see a dramatic decrease in birth rates.

Also, we need to remember that all of the factors that are attributable to low (and high) birthrates aren't static. It seems logical to me that in the coming decades and centuries as Europe (and other places) change, so might the birthrate.

Is your TV an older model, or is it something more recent with HDMI?

If its HDMI, connect your Xbox360 to your TV via an HDMI cable and all should be good.

If you don't have the option of using HDMI, using the composite plugs that come in the box may give you a problem with NTSC/PAL. Not sure, just guessing.

Your bigger issue will be game region encoding. Confusingly enough, the region encoding for Xbox360 games is called NTSC/J, NTSC/UC or PAL, even though its not strictly about the colour system (e.g. in Asia you get NTSC-J games even though most of the region uses PAL for their TVs).

Games sold in the European market have PAL regional encoding.

It does not mention what causes a lack of this instinct. Link 2 says that ""the biological effect is far from foolproof"" which caused an additional cultural aversion to evolve. Link 3 adds that seeing a child as a newborn goes a long way in guaranteeing an aversion to incest. Also that men are less disgusted by incest than women, and men with only male siblings (that's me) doubly so. It gives sexual abuse as one possible way for kinship to be overwritten, allowing incestuous feelings.

So basically that's not relevant to the point you're making, which is that incest is morally reprehensible. All this shows is that an aversion to incest evolved, genetically and memetically. Which is obvious, since it is deleterious if offspring is the end goal.

&gt; I think it's morally reprehensible and I highly doubt anyone can change my mind

Morality doesn't just fall out of the sky. It's a combination of nature, nurture and self-analysis. You can choose to apply self-analysis, or you can choose not to. If you don't want to be a ""get off my lawn"" old coot 30 years from now, I suggest you reduce your pig-headedness and actually attempt to justify your morality. Ask yourself what your moral axioms are: are people free to do what they want, unless it's bad, or are they only allowed to do things which you know are good? Do you base your beliefs on the ten commandments, your emotional moral compass or a rational extension of your axioms? Then ask yourself whether *making sexual relationships between siblings illegal* is consistent with your beliefs.

What I want more than anything from you now it to get you to think about your own beliefs. And that means you quit the ""I believe it so I won't think otherwise"" thing and start philosophising.

&gt; And no offense, but you seem idealistic and a bit naive.

The future sees the past as a list of ideas. Idealism isn't stupid, it's looking at things from a large perspective, where practicalities fade away but the core reasons hopefully remain. And I'm well aware a bid for legalising incest would be met with the same revulsion as you now show by everybody but proper social liberals and people with incestuous tendencies (though those will probably attempt to hide it by opposing it more fiercely than anyone else). So I won't march to my local seat of government and start protesting in favor of incest, but that doesn't mean I won't approve of it and attempt to convince others if possible.

&gt;And I doubt legalizing it would change many things.

Indeed it would change nothing. Except brothers and sisters and cousins and mothers and fathers and grandparents and nieces and nephews and uncles and aunts would be able to pursue sexual relationships if they're able and willing to consent to it, and so that small group of people would be happier while everyone else would go on, and **nobody would be affected but people who want to have a relationship with their next of kin**.

I agree that it's unlikely that change will come any time soon, but to give up for that reason is cowardice. Political weakness. What separates American protests from European protests and why American freedom is in such worse shape than European freedom. Because Americans look at the powers that be and see a juggernaut whose course can't be changed by one person, so why try?

&gt; I suppose that makes me a bigot to you, but like I said before, that's where I draw the line. 

I don't understand what you mean with the word ""but"" in this sentence. Do you think bigots aren't normally morally disgusted by what they oppose? That they are in any way different from you, except for the cause they speak out for? What is your definition of a bigot - and if you remove your personal disagreement with their position from that definition, and redefine that to be an ""objective bigot"", are you an ""objective bigot""?

I am not asking you to no longer be emotionally disgusted by incest. That's still acceptable, as long as you don't start beating up incestuous people or insulting them in person.

The reason I responded somewhat harshly is becuase in a lot of ways, the public is badly misinformed about HCV. EDIT: Just take a look below at a comment by castellammare where this user COMPLETELY misreads a report and tries to claim that cure rates for Hep C are at 99%./EDIT  My immediate family member was part of 4 clinical trials over 14 years that all eventually became FDA approved drugs, so I've been keeping up to date and am very well informed about Hep C treatment.

Basically, the statistics saying that cure rates exceed 80% only apply to Genotypes other than 1a and 1b.  The problem is that in North America and Europe, the vast majority of people have Genotype 1 HCV.  In other words, those statistics make it seem like HCV is less of a serious issue than it really is.  I havent seen any numbers showing up to 40% with PegInf. and Ribavarin alone, but I do have documentation showing 0-5% for Genotype 1.  I do know that in the last study my family member participated in, PegInf. and Ribavarin along with an NS3/4A inhibitor achieved cure rates of up to 40%.   The problem is that there is essentially no hope for the other 60% of Genotype 1 infected people because the next wave of anti-virals, Polymerase inhibitors and NS5 inhibitors, are at least 3 years away.  

Also, we REALLY need to develop more treatments that exclude interferon, because simply put, it is extremely brutal to endure.

Also, I have seen PSI-7977, which looks very promising.  Hopefully they can push more drugs in that class through faster.

I think most of my frustration comes from the fact that back in 1997, doctors were saying that the first wave of anti viral drugs would be out in a maximum of 5 years.  Well 14 years later, there is only 1 class of drugs currently approved.   It mostly stems from a lack of attention and resources.   Even the CDC listed HIV as a 'beatable' virus, but completely failed to acknowledge HCV as a problem.  I know there are tons of fantastic drugs in the pipeline, but we really, badly, needed them 10 years ago.  IF HCV had even a fraction of the media attention and resources that HIV has had, then perhaps BOTH diseases would now be manageable with a drug cocktail. Now, it is too late for millions of people who will die on the liver transplant waiting list.

The states that left tended to be rather poor, and their economy was based on producing and selling cotton, which worked out because Europe liked buying cotton. The federal government however kept raising the tariff, to raise money, and force the southern states to sell to northern states for a lower price. By the start of the war, it had gotten so bad that the 30% of the country's population that made up the rebelling states were paying 70% of the federal intake. The situation was further aggravated by the fact that almost none of that money was actually used in the south.

The really frustrating part is there was nothing these states could do about it. While the number of slave and free states was equal, the border states really had more in common with the northern states and would therefore vote with them whenever questions of raising the tariff came up. So basically what you had was taxes that only effected a comparatively poor part of the country constantly going up, and the people being taxed having no meaningful say in the matter.

Then right before Lincoln took office the congress passed the Morrill Tariff, which raised the average tariff rate from 15 percent to 37.5 percent while expanding the types of goods taxed. This was done over the objections of southern states and would have smashed their export/import based economy. Lincoln was elected on campaign promises of collecting on this impending raise(though he was rather quiet about slavery at the time) and threatening to send federal troops to collect it if he had to.

The Confederates saw themselves as roughly similar to the American revolutionaries of a century before. Rising up at a government that no longer represented them, but still demanded their money. It is a curious, but rather unsettling comparison. Many of the founding fathers were slave owners, and the British were offering slaves their freedom.

These technologies were created from scratch on the shop floor at General Motors at a time when there was a saying that what is good for General Motors is good for the America.

This was back before semiconductor transistors were affordable. Those early manufacturing robots actually used arrays of electromechanical relays and ladder logic which is still used till this days in the robots that come out of Japan is still based on metaphorical relays although they are now virtual constructs. 

The Japanese ran with the tech and now many people believe that the Japanese invented it. Certainly they refined it over the years but the early work was handed to them in part as an effort to win them over from their potential allegiance with the Soviets. Japan was always a much larger lynch-pin than either Korea or Vietnam where the actual military battles went down. What was really scary to America was losing Japan and the transfer of robotics technology to the Japanese was part of the arrangement to keep them cozy with the US military empire. 

But the largest customer was not within Japan. The actual sales of equipment went to the Europeans. That's where automated manufacturing is currently at its peak. However, things have been rapidly changing and for over a decade the fastest rising automation market has been China. 

Currently Foxconn or HongHai the large contract manufacturer famous for their Apple contracts is in the process of building an automation base in the middle of Taiwan. 

If you want jobs in automated manufacturing technology you should be studying Chinese as well as microcontrollers. ",t1_c34710r,ahfoo,,,3,True,t3_mv6gr

I think that a reversal of development trends is certainly possible, though not probable (and it would probably be slight at that).

I think that its certainly possible for the human population to reach a dangerously high level before that happens.

Portugese?

Look, I never wrote expressly Portugal. All European nations were involved, and the United States did not exist as a nation until 1787. It was Europe that did this. It took 72 years to pass the 13th amendment to outlaw slavery explicitly. But it didn't just happen on the 72nd year.

As I also wrote, in *Commonwealth v. Jennison* in 1781, *

It has been a usage -- **a usage which took its origin from the practice of some of the European nations,** and the regulations of British government respecting the then Colonies, for the benefit of trade and wealth. But whatever sentiments have formerly prevailed in this particular or slid in upon us by the example of others, **a different idea has taken place with the people of America, more favorable to the natural rights of mankind, and to that natural, innate desire of Liberty,** with which Heaven (without regard to color, complexion, or shape of noses-features) has inspired all the human race. And upon this ground our Constitution of Government, by which the people of this Commonwealth have solemnly bound themselves, sets out with **declaring that all men are born free and equal -- and that every subject is entitled to liberty, and to have it guarded by the laws, as well as life and property -- and in short is totally repugnant to the idea of being born slaves. This being the case, I think the idea of slavery is inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution; and there can be no such thing as perpetual servitude of a rational creature, unless his liberty is forfeited by some criminal conduct or given up by personal consent or contract** ....

As to why we were suddenly willing to spend so much more on food and booze in Asia - it was because lodging was suddenly so much cheaper. We could afford to spend more on other things and still be well below our averages in Europe.

Not really. Our government is smaller than most European ones.

&gt; Well, up until right now, I had always assumed that public universities were nonprofit. CLEARLY I was wrong. 

""Nonprofit"" doesn't mean that they don't like money. Universities love money. They especially love using that money to build fancy new buildings and hire administrative staff.

&gt; If colleges were really like any other corporation then all of them should be competing against one another for their students.

They aren't exactly like other corporations... but it's a much better starting assumption than assuming they are benevolent and they hate money.

&gt; So, even with all this money coming in, they should still be saying ""Fuck those pussies at Marshal, the Blundering Turds. UCF is superior in education and it's cheaper!"" 

Some schools do that. Many of the top schools (Ivy League, etc) will give students free tuition if they can't afford to pay. The University of Texas has been talking about drastically lowering tuition across the board, but I don't think anything has come of it yet.

&gt; If they're really like any other corporation they wouldn't require you to get good grades because they just want your Benjamins. If they're really like any other corporation they should be like ""Fuck it! Errybody gets some learnin!""

Some are like that. There is a college for everyone. Of course, the top universities are kind of like an exclusive premium product, so if they started just accepting everyone, then nobody would want to go.

&gt; Instead, it's like all of them get together and are like, ""Hey, we're gonna increase tuition next year because if we charge more it'll look like we provide a better education than you guys."" and then the next guy says ""No way, dude! That's a great idea! We're gonna do it too!"" and so on and so on.

It's called collusion. I have no proof it happens in universities, but it's happened in many other industries.

I think the reason you don't see more competition on price is that the consumer doesn't care much about it. College is still seen as the path to a guaranteed lucrative career (although this vision is fading in recent years), and student loans only need to be paid back after that lucrative career has begun.

Those medical organizations found no justification for newborn male circumcision and do not recommend it.

""The medical benefits previously claimed, however, have not been convincingly proven"" ""There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene."" ""data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.""

&gt; The majority of men here in the states are circumcised.

Of your generation - Yes. But circumcision rate in recent years have been declining in America. [32.5 percent in 2009 from 56 percent in 2006.](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/u-s-circumcision-rates-on-the-decline/)


&gt; A majority of women I know prefer it as well (note: I said majority, not all).

I don't understand this. 

In an adult male the foreskin retracts, erection pushes the head of the penis out of the foreskin - similar to other mammals like dogs and cats. (If the foreskin can't retract then the male suffers from phimosis, which in Europe is cured with steroid cream) 

There is no major aesthetic difference between a foreskin-retracted erect uncircumcised penis and a circumcised penis. *(NSFW pictures)*

If you move to Europe you won't see close to as much propaganda against China, even if you see some from time to time. Moving to Canada might actually be moving far enough, but I admit I do not know enough about Canadian politics to state that with any certainty.

My point was, the only country I know of in the west where the propaganda against China is so incredibly bad that the general conception you spoke of could be that of them being crazy, would be the United States. In the United States it's as if both politicians and the media jump at every opportunity they get to portray China in a bad way. It is rather one sided. I doubt many Americans could name many of the good things the Chinese government has managed to do for its country in past decades, while most Americans can likely name a lot of things they've been told about China's wickedness.

Perhaps I was simply mistaken, but it seemed to me that you believed that most of the west somehow shared the Republican Party's opinions on China. I should probably point out that most of Western Europe probably considers the Republican Party to be more dangerous and aggressive than the current Chinese government. I'm being quite literal here. The last time the Republican Party was in power they were extremely aggressive towards Western Europe and said quite some nasty things. They even fuelled a massive anti-Europe propaganda war over in the United States.

I can't say I have ever seen such aggressiveness from China in my lifetime. If China hates us more than the Republican Party does, then they sure go about it much more quietly and less rudely. I've certainly never seen a high ranking Chinese official being quoted saying that he thought the world would probably be better off without Europe on the map.

Fascism is not simply about repression, but it involves it.  Fascism is not about the lack of the rule of law, but it involves that as well.  Neither of those things are particularly inspiring messages, I think you'll agree, and yet fascists inspired millions of people in Europe in the last century.  There must have been something deeper there, don't you think?

The central idea of fascism is that the nation (not necessarily the state) is the most important social unit, trumping individuals, families, corporations, associations, whatever.  The particular context of the first fascisms are described fairly well by AutoAdviceAlgorithm, especially the idea of a nation that has been downtrodden or denied rising up to seize its ""rightful"" place.  Remember that fascism was developed in the specific context of Italy being way, way, way behind in the industrial race, and took hold in Germany after it's sort-of defeat in World War I.

Those are the specific contexts of the original fascisms.  It's harder to describe mature fascism because it's not really clear what an ""ideal"" fascist state would look like - as opposed to an ""ideal"" communist state, in which at a minimum the land and the means of production would be publically held and used for everyone's benefit.  It's pretty difficult to actually realize that, as countless millions have tragically found out, but there's a reasonably clear goal in mind, even if there's disagreement on the exact form.

Fascism by contrast is just about the glorification and power of the nation.  Which is not really a political goal that makes a lot of sense, since you still have to figure out what the interests of the nation are.  And that's sort of a double-edged sword - on the one hand, a ""fascist"" government can justify all actions by saying they are good for the state; on the other, it's easy to critique something as ""fascist"" since ""fascist"" in the weakest sense just means something is good for ""the nation.""  It doesn't mean a lot, in other words.

But I'm getting off track here.  Basically fascism is the idea that the nation is the most important social unit.  Its specific form in history has been mostly about militarism and state-led industrialization.  It tends to be associated with brutal repression and brutal repression only, but the goal is the advancement of the interests of the nation, and the devotion of all other social units to the interests and advancement of the nation.

In that sense, by the way, the USSR was and modern China is pretty fascist.  In fact, as it actually played out in the real world, most ""communist"" states were and are far more fascist than they were what Marx would call communist.  Whether that's a statement on the feasibility of communism or a statement on the leaders of attempted communist countries or just a statement on the societal contexts in which communism took hold - well, that's a whole different discussion.

It used to be that propaganda wasn't necessary because you could just kill the people who didn't agree with you. Nowadays, propaganda (or the manufacturing of consent) is crucial, since you can't even pepper spray people without a huge backlash (a good thing). Does that mean we could have a non-violent revolution?

And that's just America. In the Middle-East and Europe, it's already violent, and the worst regimes get away with murder.

But I don't see how violence could be used constructively. I haven't spent that long thinking about it, but if your goal is to take down the banking system, it's not that hard: just think of another system and get enough people on board. Crashing an economy isn't that difficult, we do it partially every few decades without really trying. Or would you fight back against the police forces? They are well trained, well armed, and getting violent will give them the excuse to use even more force. You will never be as strong as them.

You could also try to go and kill all the ultra-rich people, French Revolution or Scarface style, but in the end you will only have destroyed the problem without having bothered to build an alternative.

Never forget 90% of all start-ups fail.  VC-funded start-ups only do slight better at 70-80% failure.  If the expectations of anyone were any different, that would be Epic Fail on *their part*.

The part I suspected before this and this article confirms as the biggest mistake was actually targeting the US as the primary customer market.  

This was fail because the US has largely already been bypassed on most Green technology and in terms of [Technology Adoption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle), the US ""Green Market"" is very definitely a ""Late Adopter - Laggard"" that is risk-averse to even the concept of Green Energy, let alone a new, untested (market-wise) technology.  Late adopters always wait until everyone else has ""proven"" the technology - they are never the first ones into the water.

With that particular market, you can not sell based on premium performance or price - those are Early Adopters.  Who would those folks be?  Europe first.  Asia second.  US a very distant third.  Currently 95% of world wide PV consumption is Europe and Asia combined and has been for while.  

Probably doesn't fit with the ideology of patriotism that probably came with the founders and any government money, but facts are facts.  If you want to target the US you'll have to do it with minimal risk and price which is why First Solar with it's more ""conventional"" manufacturing probably has a good shot in the US as their beachhead.  Conventional means lower perceived risk for the Late Adoption US market - it's a better impedance match, sales-wise.

What would have been the ""right"" strategy would have been to target that far larger market of risk-tolerant Early Adopters to generate the volume to move the technology down the learning curve as quickly as possible.  I.e. focus on Germany primarily and the rest of Europe, and if that worked out OK, next Asia, then finally the US.  Of course that begs the question about siting in the US in the first place.

As the article mentions, Solyndra had the highest unit price in its competitive space AND was trying to sell to risky new technology first to laggard market rather than beach-heading in a richer, more risk-thriving market in Europe or Asia.

To me, aside from the technical market fitness questions, this was the biggest problem.  

Of course hindsight is 20-20 and looking more ""macro"" like this is typically one of the 2nd or 3rd order skills you'd like to have and cover as a start-up but often can't.  It's often a roll of the dice and as I said, statistically there's a strong ""Darwinian cleansing"" that occurs with start-ups.

&gt;They are at least an even match with us, or will be within the next 10 years.

At *least* 10 years, if not longer. This is assuming that their economy doesn't crash and a lot of economists are predicting it will. I hear their economic policy being called ""unsustainable"" a lot. I'm not an economist, though.

&gt;sustain it for longer

They couldn't sustain a force on U.S. soil large enough, or for long enough to force us to surrender. If they're going to win this hypothetical war, they won't win it with their infantry. Infantry with inferior equipment and training that is inferior to the U.S.

&gt;They also exceed us by orders of magnitude in technical degrees per year.

Their population also more than triples ours. We should be producing fewer lawyers and more scientists though, not going to argue that. However, number of graduates is somewhat irrelevant. The United States still has the finest university system in the world and we're still ahead in terms of research and development. At least for now. If anyone is going to surpass us, it's Europe. And Europe is a lot more buddy-buddy with the U.S. than the Chinese.

&gt;The only way we would ""win"" would be if other nations came to our aid, and I'm not sure that would happen.

There's a good chance that we could. And if it got to the position where we needed help, we could probably get some. If Beijing is in a position where they feel confident enough to declare war on the U.S., they've probably already ruffled more than a few feathers. Odds are, some of those feathers belong to various European nations. Nations that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: the most powerful military alliance on Earth, which the United States just happens to be a part of.

&gt;considering our foreign policy mainly consists of taking a shit on anyone who doesn't agree with us.

No, we only shit on little countries. Countries who wouldn't help us anyway. We may claim Pakistan as our ally, but we still shit on them, just like they shit on us. They wouldn't help us, just like we wouldn't help them if/when they attack India. Which is where they would fire their nukes, not at us or the Chinese.

&gt;Even then, we would lose in the sense that our country, economy, and standing in the world would be ravaged.

I'd rather lose in that sense than in the sense where Washington D.C. is occupied by Chinese troops. I'm sure the federal government will agree with me, as will the military. This whole scenario assumes that China declares war/attacks first. They are the aggressors, not us. That makes them the ""bad guys"". Just look at what happened at the end of World War II. Were the nations of the world looking at the United States and going ""Aw, mean 'ol America, bombing Germany and Japan."" Hell no. They both declared war first (*in Japan's case, after they already hit us with a sneak attack, but I suppose that was unintentional*) and so they were the aggressors, the bad guys. You could honestly claim that WWII did more for the image of the U.S. than almost anything else in history.

I don't want to see a Sino-American War, but we would *probably* win if we had to fight it.

The english came about and simply took our handiwork and used for their own purposes, and have treated us like garbage.

Our culture is rich, intense and recognized around the world as a world-class culture. It is the only thing that differentiates us from the anglo-saxons, so we want to keep it dearly, it’s the most precious thing we have.

And that most precious thing can be freely shared, unlike money that has to be hoarded and niggardly dispensed if anyone wants to attain some wealth.

That precious culture, we hand it out freely, but we will never allow it to be wrenched away from us permanently. We have fought tremenduous forces and temptations designed to have us ditch it and espouse the conqueror’s.

We have steadfastly refused to do so for a quarter of millenium now.

You are welcome to come here and help us build it.

But be aware that we will never tolerate anything that remotely threatens the survival of our culture against the unfavorable odds that surround it — we’re outnumbered more than 40 times in North-America.

And having been “nice” for two centuries have brought us close to extinction. So this is why I am not “nice” and will fight with all my might to protect my culture.

lol. I've literally stayed in ROYAL CHAMBERS for less than that. I've lived like that in India, Nepal, Thailand, Egypt, Ukraine, Russia, Italy etc. All of those places you can easily find a place that is ok and costs under $15 a night for a single and usually around $30 for a double. In certain places like India, you can get even cheaper. I had a double room at the top of a greek-style villa with a landscape view overlooking the ganges for 400 rupees per night, that's less than $8 AND luxurious. I stayed in *ok* places that were only 100 rupees per night in Nepal. In Ukraine and Russia I stayed mostly around hostels, but usually got a room to myself for around $10.

If you get away from the standard chains and look for smaller hotels, you're sure to find amazing deals. Shop around, haggle over room price, especially if you're going to be there for more than 2 nights, and it's ok to play hotel managers against each other for your business. Saying, ""hey, this guy at Blah Blah Inn says I can have his room for blah blah price and that room has a nicer bathroom, but I want to stay at your hotel because I like the location (or whatever), if you can make me a deal.""

&gt; €10/day for food

That's about right for food costs, if you don't mind your budget and are ok with eating in restaurants. You can survive for as little as €3 per day if you only buy from street vendors or cheap diners (if you have concerns about food safety, then only buy grilled or fried things and fresh fruit from the street vendors.) In Egypt, a normal shawarma wrap costs about 12 pounds, which is $2, that's a full meal unless you're a glutton or a body builder. In India, you can easily eat big meals twice a day for less than, say, $7 per day.

Even living like that, I still have lots of money for souvenirs and transportation, buying drinks in clubs, going on tours, etc. I even bought out a movie theater in Darjeeling once because nobody else bought any tickets, so they weren't going to show the movie unless I bought 10 tickets (only $0.50 each, though).

1. Layoffs - In america, when you get laid off they can give you your pay for the day and pretty much kick you out the door the same day.  In any other country in the world you get big time advanced notice of the layoff and are usually helped into another job.  I'm not talking about European countries.  Fucking 3rd world countries like Malaysia treat layoffs better than we do.

2.  Vacation - There is no required vacation days in our country.  This federal days off stuff is just something the companies do to make nice.  If they wanted to they could make us work on those days.  The two to four weeks a year you accrue is purely voluntary on the part of the companies and not required by law.  Once again every other industrialized nation in the world kicks our ass.

3. Minimum Wage - we fucking suck.  period.  Look at this Australian guy below somewhere.  Minimum wage is $15/hr there.  We're all the way up to $7.25/hr now.  That's $15K per year.  That's barely above the poverty line.  And our government doesn't cover any medical expenses.

The problem, in general, is that it's hard to have a good [definition of species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Problem), even if we use the strict [biological definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#Other). A good analogy, and one that may help creationists understand the complexity of trying to categorize a universe that doesn't always lend itself to categories, would be that of the [visible spectrum](http://www.eatthedamncake.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/spectrum3.jpg): When does green become blue...When does blue become indigo? There are, if you will, shades of gray. 

Another example, with very real evolutionary implications is: When does a Central African human become a North Eastern African, become a Middle Easterner...

Path A: become an Indo Pakistani --&gt; Asian --&gt; Indonesian --&gt; Aboriginal of Australia

Path B: become a Mediterranean --&gt; European --&gt; Northwestern European

Hopefully I can tie this idea all up with this last idea. Let's go back to Path A: 

Central African --&gt; North Eastern African --&gt; Middle Easterner --&gt; Indo Pakistani --&gt; Asian --&gt; Indonesian --&gt; Aboriginal of Australia

I chose these groups for the usually apparent differences in facial structure and skin tone. That is, one could predict fairly well where someone with ""traditional features"" was from just by looking at her/his features. 

Now, suppose that 3 of these groups were wiped off of the face of the earth. Lets take the North Eastern Africans, the Indo Pakistani, and the Indonesians. Now it is *much* more difficult to trace the morphology and movements of early homo sapiens. 

So, to tie this back into the idea of ring species. Every living thing that has ever lived has the potential to be viewed as a ring species. In our full example, we can see the gradual change in characters as humans migrated out of Africa and into Australia. When we get rid of some groups, it becomes harder to piece the puzzle back together. But the key point is, getting rid of some groups is what happens to life all of the time. It is estimated that anywhere from 90 to 99.9% of every ""species"" (biological definition) that has ever lived has gone extinct. Given the impossibility for us to have information about every past species, we are left with a picture that would seem as incomplete as one with the 3 removed groups of humans (North Eastern Africans, the Indo Pakistani, and the Indonesians), but is fully congruent when it is understood that the majority of the past has been buried and eroded. What we are left with is the picture of what we actually see:

Haha, well.  Huh.  Not the expected reply!  Probably a good one though, because as it happens, I've nurtured an inconsistency in my approach to this topic.  Partly argumentative and partly smug in the face of thoughtless denunciations of religion, I've long held to the view that religion is merely justification for negative actions, but primary impetus for many positive actions.  That's not consistent; if it can motivate human behavior in one direction, I should acknowledge its potential to motivate it in the opposite, i.e. war v charity.

So religion can be a primary source of conflict in itself.  Granted.  

""Less vehemence, because religiosity is less severe in developed, open, educated societies.""

Not sure.  True in Europe.  The U.S. is widely recognized as a uniquely and deeply religious country, esp. in comparison with other developed societies.  It's rife with devout adherents to different religions who resolve their conflict with words or tolerance instead of force.  It's not clear to me that they somehow are less devout than their counterparts in, say, Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan.  Can we assume that strength of belief and physical (not rhetorical) violence are correlated?  Going with 'no' there.  

If we're citing specific examples, the Westboro Baptist group seems especially vehement, and yet they clearly eschew physical violence.  Are Tibetan Buddhists less committed to their religion (aside from the occasional club-wielding monk brawl), or Jains?  Religion is a common factor in all these societies.  Religion alone is not necessary and doesn't seem sufficient to generate violence.  Like you said, it's ""right in that list,"" but that doesn't discount other elements as well.  I suspect there are certain particularly combustible cultural cocktails, of which religion can be, yes, an important ingredient, but not the only one.  Ever.  I mean, can't be demonstrated anyway; can't ever tease it out as sole motivation apart from all the factors I keep citing.  Even with the 9/11 hijackers.  Your assessment of their motives is mostly right, but far too absolute and without support to accept.  Religion looms large, perhaps overwhelming other influences, but I don't think we can reliably say it was the only thing driving that handful of individuals.  Mob mentality, mental illness, etc.  

Motive is complicated; to say religion stood alone for those men is too reductionist.  Religion can't be isolated in that way; it denies the complexity of people and the world.  It's a cop-out that I think distracts from other societal problems that are at least equally essential to terrorism etc.

Religion is sophisticated because it's a response to fear of death, thunder, curiosity, etc.  It's a very frontal lobe thing, not instinctual.  I was asserting that the instinctual is the primary motivator for peoples actions.  Hm, that sounds a little too Freudian though.  Conscious beliefs can beget action.  Of course they can!

Well shit, even though it's a little disappointing, it's kind of exciting to know there are ways my thoughts and views can still evolve on this.  Turns out religion can provide primary instigation for, and perpetuation of, violent conflict.  Ha, look at that.  Learn something new every day!

What are they then? I have yet to know exactly what they are for. And lets get things strait, right means small government, left means big government, explain it in those terms.

&gt;the effects would be disastrous and far reaching on most of the population.


Compared to the effects that are current, I prefer they fail and we live with the effects. It is the less worse to let them fail on their own and have us suffer, than artificially prop them up, have them fail, and suffer twice as much.


&gt;for those with lesser income the burden is a lot more than those who still have a few million after taxation.

Because the rich would pay less, an economic domino effect would occur and in turn produce more wealth for the poor so more taxes could be paid. But there will always be those who still do not earn as much. Making a tax excuse for them will give incentive for people to find ways around getting taxed so that they find a way into that marginal population. That incentive will create a backwards economic domino effect and we will have more poor classes as apposed to middle classes. And plus, no one starves in the U.S., poverty here is basic cable and potato chips.

&gt;but the fact that these policies usually do end up making the rich richer and the poor poorer regardless of what other things you want to occur.

Wrong. They make a stronger middle class. The rich and the poor are equally as corrupt, the future lies in the middle class.

&gt;Liberals are more willing to forego the process of giving up a few liberties so that a more equal society is available for all.


Every attempt to equalize the society has made the society equally poor. When you give up freedom for equality, you get neither freedom or equality.

&gt;Conservatives are also for the abolition of some liberties (abortion is one example)

It's a states rights issue, not a federal. I can't speak for other conservatives, but I am for abortion because it is a natural way of reducing the populations, crime, and preventing vagabonds from being born. Plus if you outlaw abortion only outlaws will have abortions. And it creates jobs :)

&gt; So long as everyone is restricted equally, it's still an equal society, after all.

Well lets not mess around and be objective about this philosophy. Person X was born with a stronger body, a higher tenancy to concentrate, and good looks. Person Y was born with a weak body, low concentration, and he is ugly. Person X becomes more successful than person Y. They are unequal. Following the philosophy that everyone should be equal, we are going to prevent person X from fulfilling his perceived wants and we are going to help out person Y so that he gets to the level of person X. Person X could have done great things, but he shouldn't because that would make person Y less equal. Person Y, even though he was helped out and given the opportunity to get to the level of person X, didn't make anything useful, valuable or worth while. Now we have no one making anything because we don't want to be unequal.

This example illustrates that equating every one is only harmful to the society because it prevents people from acting. It is not that society makes people unequal, it is that some people by nature are unequal. Liberalism is folly because it tries to equate the unequal, an act that contradicts nature itself.

Furthermore, the idea of equating society is a classic Marxian ideal. The ""classless society"" is impossible because in order to eliminate the classes, or ""inequality"" if you will (it is the same thing), you need a strong state. But what is to stop that state from becoming a class itself? By trying to equate society, you make a greater unequal society because the state becomes a class itself; a place where person X can go and be corrupt.


&gt;Social darwinism, to liberals, is a lesser way to promote equality than governmental regulation.

Again, the state becomes a class itself and more inequality occurs. Just accept that you can't make the world equal and you will become a conservative.



&gt;Liberals see taxes as a fair price to pay for living in a civilized society.

That statement contradicts this one:

       &gt;for those with lesser income the burden is a lot more than those who still have a few million after taxation.

So... for or against taxing the poor?


&gt; For liberals, they often participate in both, like I'm sure most conservatives do as well.



That is not true. [Red states give more to charity than blue states](http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/June/200706261522251CJsamohT0.8012354.html), and the U.S., the most conservative country in the world (compare it to Europe, Canada, etc), [gives more to charity than all the other social democratic nations](https://www.cafonline.org/publications/archive/international-giving.aspx). So yes, it still holds true that the poor can be taken care of without government intervention.

The ""whole"" West (that is: including Russia, Japan, Australia, etc.) emits around 15,000 million tons, and so would have to emit about 38% less CO2. That's a *bit* more than shorter showers, no central heating, unheated streets (?), driving smartcars, etc. would be able to make up. And, the two clusters will come closer to parity each year, as China's emissions grew by 13.3% and India's by 8.7% from 2008 to 2009, while the West's generally fell by around 7% (albeit during an economic downturn). We may almost be at parity (absolute, not per capita emissions) *now*; in which case the West would have stop ALL its CO2 emissions to counteract China and India's collective footprint. So your statement was far more true for circa 2006 than 2011.

Anyway, I posted this article in r/environment because I wanted to see the reaction. There was less of one there than here. I agree with you on this issue that Western nations whining about China and India's CO2 emissions are being hypocritical and acting like they won the lottery because they developed first. Well, no, it doesn't work like that. If the West wants to forestall global warming due to CO2, it'll have to decrease its own emissions faster.",t1_c346ll4,[deleted],,,1,True,t3_murjt

Christianity didn't pose a problem to that development?  They used to call the Pope the Kingmaker.  Guy Fawkes was a Catholic mercenary that tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament of Protestant England, to assassinate the Protestant King and to put a Catholic on the throne.

&gt;Traditionally, the Christian vision has been to ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's"". 

Don't get me wrong, Jesus sounds like a stand up guy, but the Church in Europe had bugger all similarity with him.  They became hugely powerful, influential, rich and manipulative.  If progress is made by empowering the individual the Church prevented people from learning to read in their own language!  They didn't speak Latin.  You had to receive an education to understand that.  The Magisterium in England actually worked to suppress a complete English bible so that theirs was the interpretation people would hear.  That they could tell people what to do on threat of hell - something that would have been very real to them.

The Unam Sanctam papal bull of 1302, 90 years after the Magna Carta, actually stipulated that the Church was not only a spiritual leader above the  material, but also a secular leader.  That their secular leadership superseded other growing forms of secular representation.

             ""Certainly the one who denies that the temporal
              sword is in the power of Peter has not listened 
              well to the word of the Lord commanding: 'Put 
              up thy sword into thy scabbard' [Mt 26:52]. Both,
              therefore, are in the power of the Church, that is
              to say, the spiritual and the material sword, but 
              the former is to be administered _for_ the Church 
              but the latter by the Church; the former in the 
              hands of the priest; the latter by the hands of 
              kings and soldiers, but at the will and sufferance 
              of the priest.""

England had its first elected parliament in 1265, the Model Parliament in 1295, and even then the clergy would be present.  It took the Church 7 years from the first model parliament to announce its temporal and constitutional superiority to it setting it on a track which would lead to countless wars.

The reason I can't answer you is that when I say ""Yes, it might be solved with one single government"", it goes against every fiber in my body. Fixing a small problem (euro currency discrepancies) with a big overhaul (one government) does not take into account that the big overhaul might bring a lot more problems.

On the other hand, when I say ""no"" it goes against myself as well, because the single government might be a solution and I always try to be open for solutions as well.

The Euro currency was also in itself a big overhaul that gave the people a marginal benefit (not having to change currencies when travelling in between Euro countries). There are some other benefits, but try explaining those to the public, I don't even fully understand them myself. In the big picture the overall European economy should be stronger, but in my opinion it just averaged in between countries and that is where the whole problem with Greece and Italy comes from (argument being they are dragging the rest down).

The Euro was a big overhaul with small benefits. Fixing its problems, which are relatively small compared to the total scope, with another big overhaul just seems a bad idea to me. It would make the public feel less powerful and be hampering democracy. 

I could end on that note, but when discussing a single government, we might need to discuss if democracy is even a good thing. If you make a single government dictatorship, everyone should do what the government wants and thus there wouldn't be a cooperation problem. If the ""everyone does what the government wants"" part is a good thing, is an entirely different point and that is why I still can't fully answer your question.

1. The lack of democratic accountability of anything the EU does. MEPs are directly elected but as only 1 of 3 pillars of EU power they don't have as much sway as perhaps they should.

2. Specifically relating to the eurozone - it was doomed before it began it was always a case of ""when"" not ""if"" something bad would happen to one of the PIGS countries. This was hampered by France and Germany breaking the Stability and Growth pact.

3. Following on from above - the EU project is entirely political and for this reason far too much horse trading gets in the way of sensible decision making. E.g. Danone, maker of yoghurts is a ""strategic"" company according to France.

4. The EU as sold to the British in the 70s was that of the EFTA / EEC it was *not* what we have subsequently been drawn in to. Many of the older generations feel that politicians purposely mis-led people because they knew that a political union would have been voted against.

5. As a result of 4. we have not had a referendum on pretty significant Treaty changes which has riled a lot of people. I daresay we'd vote to stay in the EU but by not having the vote we are making people increasingly unhappy.

6. The EU constitution and Lisbon treaty debacle also shows that there is a ""political elite"" running the show with little consideration for what the people of Europe actually want.

7. The CAP. This is a disgrace.

8. In my opinion the EU is too left wing, the majority of the EU countries are not exactly free trade and this does not sit nicely with the majority of the UK.

9. While France and Germany remain allied on European issues it would be hard for any other group to push an agenda since those two countries make up a significant amount of the EU (this is also one reason why the UK has been keen on EU expansion)

When I was a kid I was very pro-American, having been there several times I still admire many things about the place but I do think we align closer with Western Europe these days. 

So I would say I am eurosceptic because it has been poorly set up and poorly thought out.

it was sci-fi with a pseudo realistic look. it had ingame events like morpheus running arround played by a real person .. he was able to change physics and the dynamic of an area. you had to do special event quests prior to the event itself to attend. during the event there were also quests that where fraction based. only one fraction could win and get the special quest items - and have insight into a secret story line. they also had random appearances of neos dead body floating arround. moments like those where pretty amazing for me. when matrix online first started there where a lot of servers. (lots for us, lots for europe etc) but when the player count decreased they ""merged"" those servers and you pretty much had one or two pvp/pve servers per region. this was actually pretty cool imo .. while i understand the technical reasons for multiple servers i always disliked the idea .. met somebody who plays the game ? different server .. meh! i don´t understand why nobody thought about this a little more - different planet -&gt; different server. wanna meet ? -&gt; go to the same planet .. (replace planet with continent if you like) but maybe thats just me. also i liked the different ""pvp"" &amp; ""pve"" approach. pve servers also had the ability to fight everywhere when you accepted it. (not special pvp regions like gw) but then everybody from the other fraction was able to attack you -&gt; lead to pretty intense mass fights 

i also tried GW .. i liked some parts of it but i just can´t handle the setting (for me gw, lotro, wow are the same setting - sorry i can´t relate with orks and stuff). also tried lotr:o but there is not enough ""action"" and too much traveling / running arround to get from point a to b. while i understand that exploring is a major part of a mmo i don´t see why i have to run 30 minutes from quest a to b and then another 30 minutes from b to a because i can´t efford a horse. boring ..

sorry for my bad english.

edit:
my ideal mmo ? neuromancer setting, only on server per region (euro / us / asia /  africa ), real time events, only 3 fractions, sci-fi/realistic look, pvp everywhere .. no ""go there kill x monsters of dungeon y that looks like the last 500 dungeons i´ve been in"" missions ..

She said that this is an issue of the differing opinions that the Democratic West and Islamic states have regarding the term ""freedom."" Freedom in my sense, and I assume most other European and Americans think, is the ability to peruse one's own ways of life and intellectual interests unfettered. More or less, I want to read and speak and do the things I want and as long as it doesn't subjugate anyone else, and the state should have no say in it.

The more fundamentalist Islamic interpretation of the term ""freedom"" means the freedom from things that distract from the connection to and the study of God. Now after this idea I can understand why things like flashy clothing and materialistic entertainment are so vilified in some of these places, alcohol in particular. To embrace these philosophically and religiously limiting things is to deaden your connection to the Divine. And whether you're an atheist or a devout faithful, I can say that Western culture is suffering from a very big deficit in spirituality.

However, I still come to the conclusion that the Islamic states on this planet are gripped in a tragic situation; there are two power dynamics that are both direct results of Western powers infringing on what we would call freedom. On one hand there are dictators that are financially propped up by foreign powers, and on the other hand there are extremists who take it totally 180 degrees and resist it no matter what (and would institute a repressive Theocratic Dark Ages given half the chance)... and both disregard the inherent respect that Islam has for intellectual pursuits while still thumping that Koran to support their own viewpoints.

The Arab Spring movements are truly the voice of the middle ground. A largely youth movement that has both embraced the ideals of Democracy while honoring the elements of their Islamic culture is an amazing thing. I wish NATO states would quit with violence, because the people there seem to already be moving in the right direction.

[Alaska has a rail network](http://alaskarailroadtours.com/Rail/Alaska_Railroad_Map.jpg), as does [Canada](http://www.canadamapxl.com/images/canada-rail-map.gif).

So, hypothetically, it becomes possible.

The AskScience nature of this question is a simple distance/speed=time calculation.  Now, the distance is going to depend heavily on the route chosen, and the speed will be dependent on type of rail installed. 

So, a bare minimum distance can be easily found by a segmented line following as close to a great circle as possible, crossing the Bering Strait.  [Image of that here](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v427/OrbitalPete/paris-LA.jpg).  That gives us an absolute minimum distance of about 15,500 km.  Assume we're installing high speed lines with average speeds of 200 km/hour and we get a minimum travel time of 77.5 hours (just over 3 days).  

Top of the range 300km/h rail would bring that down to 51.6 hours (just over 2 days).

Second, I am not disputing there is an imbalance among EU states that is causing major structural problems... i think that's obvious... but while Krugman, Goolsbee et al are blaming the currency area itself and exchange rates, to me it makes more sense to blame the actors involved within the EU. Why are we jumping to the conclusion that a EU currency area is the problem when there are so many other factors contributing to this crisis?

In my opinion, the reason Economists are so quick to rejoice over the EU's problems and blame the currency area currency is that currency devaluation as a policy tool is indoctrinated into their worldview.

I think its fair to say that a large proportion of the UK's papers are nominally or extremely euroskeptic, it's certainly true for the Mail, Express, Times, Telegraph and the Sun, and even those papers that are less inclined to take quite such a persistent negative position (including the indy and guardian etc.) go with the flow when stuff seemingly goes wrong...  However there has been more of a push in that direction since 2008 or so, UKIP coming through as a political force as well as a real hardening of the grass roots (and back bench) tory position on Europe has gone some way to move the agenda into more radical pastures.  

&gt;But this is exactly why I was saying that the Euro Zone will probably ask the UK to either join them, or to leave certain EU agreements (the UK is already the only EU country with intra-eu passport controls, so it's not like it's without precedent).

Possibly, but I doubt it.  The problem for the eurozone is that there isn't really a sensible framework for the fiscal and monetary aspects, at least not ones that wouldn't need to be applied to the wider market rather than the 17 Eurozone states. It is also decidedly unlikely that anyone is going to ask the UK to join the Euro at this point, it simply wouldn't help (and lets not get into the fact that snow in hell is more likely than the UK joining).

All in though, we have a European Union where 10 of the 27 members states aren't members of the Euro, they aren't going anywhere and you can add the 4 EFTA states to that too, nor are they likely to join the currency and frankly I seriously doubt that the EU is going to try to force them out...  Not to mention there simply isn't any way of forcing a nation out in this manner as far as I can see, certainly not quickly.

The PS3 wasn't released in Europe until March 2007. If you think  the fact that the platform enjoyed a 151% growth rate *in the first year it was available* is somehow statistically significant in comparing PC to console sales, then I find it difficult to take anything you say seriously.

Looking at the documents you're linking to, I can see that sales on the 360 and PS3 are continuing to grow at modest rates while the PC is staying largely stagnant and the PS2 is finally seeing its market collapse. Unfortunately, what your Nordic reports don't comment on is the change in installation base for each platform. Based on reports from other countries, though, I'm willing to bet that the increase in 360 and PS3 game sales is being largely matched by the increase in 360 and PS3 machines on the market. (While, of course, the number of people who own a PC hasn't changed.)

Something else to notice: Looking at the actual euro market for the PC vs. console market, the total PC market grew by a couple million.  The total console market? Lost 40 million. (The 360 and PS3 grew, yes. But the collapse of the PS2 market annihilates those gains and the Wii just makes it worse.)

**So the numbers aren't actually saying what you claim they're saying: In reality, the Nordic PC game market remained steady in 2010 while the console market suffered significant losses.**

If the PC market is suffering compared to the console market (bearing in mind that the numbers you've brought to the table actually indicate the exact opposite of that), I suspect the reality is that punitive DRM schemes are pushing a lot of PC customers to buy console versions of a game even when they would normally prefer the PC version. That's certainly been true for me: Bioshock, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed. All major titles I've bought for the console because of DRM on the PC. There are also lots of PC-only games that I simply haven't bought at all because of DRM. 

And now we're seeing Ubisoft and other developers simply refusing to release games for the PC in franchises which used to see PC releases.

I can provide you perhaps with some help on some aspects of education (against the background of my expertise: European history):

In medieval and early modern times education wasn't something that was highly theorized. There were these manuals on how a christian household should be run and should behave (Oeconomia Christiana = Christian housekeeping). There was always specific attention to how children (and adults) should be educated, in order to live by the christian ideal.
During the 18th and 19th century, together with the institutionalization of society, real pedagogical programs were thought out. And at first these programs were focused on getting the highest possible amount of the people educated.
Near the end of the 19th century a different approach was preached with the Pedagogical Reform. The critique on the 'education for the masses' was that it didn't focus on the individual capacities of students. So they tried to overcome this problem. But only in the 20th century it became part of the humanities, and it became a scientifically based discipline.
This is a quick sketch where I cut more than a few corners. If you'd want me to get more into detail, please let me know.

A good book on the history of ""housekeeping"" and the conduct/education of family members is the English translation of [Aries' Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Centuries-Childhood-Social-History-Family/dp/0394702867/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322735957&amp;sr=8-1).

Another great book on education is unfortunately a Dutch book, which hasn't been translated. Don't know where you're from, but if by any chance you speak or understand Dutch you should pick it up. It focuses on education in the Netherlands, but it contextualizes it in a European context. It's [Vijf eeuwen opvoeden in Nederland: idee en praktijk 1500-2000 by Noordman e.a.](http://books.google.be/books?id=mT9CrHjhTnUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vijf+eeuwen+opvoeden+in+Nederland:+idee+en+praktijk+1500-2000&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=4XvXTu7QJcXqOdKNnbcO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)(=5 centuries of educating in the Netherlands: theory and practice 1500-2000)

Also thought of the genre of the 'The Book of the Courtier'. A manual for the elite on how to behave properly. It educated the nobility on how to conduct themselves. For instance: when you dine, you should eat with knife and fork. 
And even if these books were meant for the nobility, they still have a profound influence on today's etiquette. 
One of the most famous of these manuals is [Castiglione's Il Libro del Cortegiano](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Book-Courtier-Classics-Baldesar-Castiglione/dp/0140441921/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322744510&amp;sr=8-1)

You could find yourself in organic, synthesising natural products; physical, investigating protein folding; analytical - anywhere from hospitals to Defense to big pharma.

Then there are the non-obvious career routes. Chemists are very numerate, so a lot transition easily into accountancy. If you take a law top-up course after a chem degree you can become a patent lawyer. Some people end up branching out into other sciences, like biology/biosciences and physics.

I personally have worked in big pharma and forensics, doing analytical chemistry, but am now doing a PhD in fuel cell technology, which is essentially equal parts organic and polymer chemistry, so if you have questions about any of those fields PM me.

*Exactly*. Both the Arab and Jewish nations are defined by *culture*, not by genetics. The right of self determination refers to *nations*, not ""genetic lineages"". That's why all of your talk about the ""European Jews"" and Palestinian Arabs being ""the original inhabitants"" is complete nonsense.

&gt; there's a reason european jews look like other europeans and arab jews look like other arabs.

Actually, even if you wanted to go by your completely false genetic definition, it was proven that even Ashkenazi Jews are related genetically to the Palestinians and other Middle Eastern nations.

I have a better idea.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/21/israel

&gt; If you are correct that is great news though, real peace will mean the wall can come down, and the muslim world can work with a progressive, inventive country that isnt full of corruption and poverty.

I agree.

&gt;Saudi are friends of the western powers.

They're still zealots in comparison to Iran, and there's no reason why Iran should be regarded as a threat by the West either.  The two term president before Ahmadinejad, Khatami, was moderate, progressive,  educated in Europe and wanted to emulate the EU model.  Cheney's office and the US shut him down.

&gt;The only achievements that matter are a dignified solution and a peaceful state of palestine that can live in peace with its neighbours.

Exactly but Israel isn't going to survive a one state solution, the longer it goes on the less likely a two solution is, and the right-wing people in control of Israeli the government forms a coalition with the far right and the authoritarian that rebuke any viable two state solution - [even though a former Mossad chief has said Israel must work with the Arab Peace Initiative](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=mossad%20accept%20arab%20peace%20initiative&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;ved=0CEUQFjAH&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.haaretz.com%2Fprint-edition%2Fnews%2Fex-mossad-chief-s-comments-on-iran-place-him-on-collision-course-with-netanyahu-1.365619&amp;ei=wmnXTvLoNczOsgbintjGCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtBh7-VSX4UKFGqpodBBEbynQEUA).

&gt;Ghaddafi wrote an article a couple of years back about a one state solution that had me agreeing with him.It doesnt make sense to divide the country

Which is exactly what the Israeli left wing post-Zionists would argue, a civic Israeli identity and not a Jewish one, but a one state solution will mean an Arab majority - and there's just no intention, inclination or mandate for that in the current Israeli coalition.  So whilst it's a nice idea, if only, it's not going to happen willingly.    ",t1_c34a5az,AgentOfMisdirection,,,5,True,t3_mvy1q

Secondly, the Meat Inspection Act as well as the Food and Drug Act were bills that **the Meat Packing Industry had been lobbying for for decades**. Sinclair's novel gave them the opportunity to exploit public outcry and finally push through their bill that eventually passed. The reason they did this was because major meat packing companies actually had to pay for their own safety inspections to get their meat sold in the European market. The bills that they introduced passed the cost of inspecting and standardizing on to the state (i.e. taxpayers), therefore making the Meat industry a larger profit.

Cutting your balls off has a chance of failure?

&gt;B) it would be completely impractical to tailor the rule of law for something like this, and impossible to regulate altogether.

Incest is illegal as it is now, unless one or both sexual partners are sterilised. One can not request marriage with next of kin unless either they or the other is sterilised. Voilà, you have regulations which are exactly as effective as the current regulations.

&gt;Mythology is fact now?

It's based on the ideas of the culture it developed in. What mythology considers good, the people who wrote it considered good. 

&gt;I thought we were past comparing this to homosexual situations?

No, we really aren't. As long as both concern a monogamous relationship rejected by a certain aspect of society, the comparison holds.

&gt;They're not permanently denying their kids happiness, they're saying ""hey, ANYBODY BUT ~~YOUR SISTER~~ the person you love most in this world.""

I'm not talking about some random case of affection or sexual experimentation here, I'm talking about the principle of the thing. If you love your sister like people love the people they marry and not divorce afterward despite being financially independent and not having anyone depend on their continuing marriage.

Whether it rule that forbids your love also forbids sexual intercourse with all people you are capable of feeling sexual attraction for is irrelevant to me.

&gt;You wouldn't be unhappy at all to know that you'll never have grandkids (or at least not normal ones)

Yeah, who knows, they might even be *Chinese*. This applies to homosexuality just as well, and all solutions available there are available here. (Having somebody else provide the sperm or the egg and womb, adoption, childless companionship).

&gt;that you'll have to deal with the shame of it going public

Shame? If I am a social pariah for doing/allowing what is right, I'll carry it with pride.

&gt;  or just plain and simple struggle with the knowledge that your son is putting his penis inside your daughter's vagina?

Or your son up your other son's ass. Or that your daughters are scissoring. Incest doesn't have to be heterosexual. But even that disgust were to exist, it wouldn't be *justified* because they aren't doing anything wrong. I would silence that disgust, just like I silence the disgust I experience when I see two men making out, or the touch of fear when I see a group of black people walking towards me in an empty street at night.

&gt; I think your mindset would change a lot if this situation became real to you. You can rationalize it all you want now, but once that happens the game changes.

Then I can only hope my rational mind defeats my emotional mind. But as someone who speaks from a distance, I can be objective. Regardless of my emotional state, my emotional state would not warrant the illegality of my children deciding to have sex with anyone. Emotional disgust at others is *never* a good enough reason to make something illegal.

&gt;But what I do know is that if there's a massive barrier in my way, I'm not going to go out of my way to break it and then fall in love with the person on the other side.

From what I understand it goes the other way around. Your physiology decides whom or what you fall in love with, the relationships then falling within certain categories, some of which are taboo. You hang out all the time, laugh at the same jokes. Then one day you look each other in the eye, one thing leads to another and before you know it you've screwed your sister. Oops.

There aren't any walls to be broken. Not if you have incestuous desires. I can understand why you wouldn't break through that wall, because for you that wall exists. But for them it doesn't. What makes that so terrible?

&gt; see it as a developing human being dying

Same difference. 500 living human stem cells parasitically bound to the uterus lining is the same as a developing human being at a week or two since conception.

&gt;because two people want to break some rules.

Which they do because they love each other.

&gt;They can find happiness elsewhere without killing something in the process.

So you're pro-life then?

&gt; but forced sterilization to do the same thing is okay? Both of these things are a restriction of liberties. And what if one day, these kids wise up (as they usually do) and decide they want to go have kids with someone else? What then? They're screwed for life.

As I've said before, there are hundreds if not thousands of facilities where human eggs and sperm are kept in cryogenic storage, to be thawed, fertilised and implanted into a willing host. Their reproductive capability isn't removed, it's just disentangled from their sex. So it doesn't restrict them freedom; it increases it, by giving them the ability to decide when and how to get pregnant.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, I was under the assumption that you would consider the ban of interracial marriage to be inherently wrong.

&gt;What the hell are you talking about?

The arguments you gave concerning interracial marriage outright stated that if the two found themselves in an environment which would stigmatise them for it, their marriage would be a bad thing. Since this was about legalisation, you said that under certain circumstances - specifically, social rejection - interracial marriage should be forbidden.

The youtube clip in the link concerns the first interracial kiss on American television. There was an entire shitstorm about it because many viewers might disapprove, and the studio actually wanted to air it without the kiss, but Shatner intentionally ruined the shoot where the kiss didn't take place, forcing them to air the episode with the interracial kiss. And thus they, unlike you, kept their ground against social taboo.

&gt; Culture is tyranny of the majority. But you'll never get rid of that.

Multiculturalism. Cultural liberalism. There are plenty of ways in which a government or a people can express their ability to accept ideas which offend them.  The United States was founded on the principle of multiculturalism: of a secular state which didn't choose one religion over the others, with free speech, freedom of congregation, relatively few sexual appropriateness laws, etc. And much Europe today still maintains a lot of this sense of openness, though the Islamic terrorist scare has reduced it significantly. People can do this.

&gt;And as I understand it, you think that the moment condoms were invented, all of humanity should have all of the sudden disregarded social customs grounded in thousands of years of culture as if that's easy to do. Social change doesn't happen overnight. I'm sorry to break that to you.

I'm not asking you to disregard social customs, I'm asking you to disregard *social condemnation*. I'm okay with you not being willing to consider the possibility of banging your sister. I truly am. I'm just trying to get you to accept the possibility that others might want to without warranting jail time or forced sexual re-education.

&gt;And no, that's not my problem with incest. That's simply one of my reasons to avoid it. 

So would you approve of an incestuous couple? Of interfamilial marriage? Would you support legislation which legalised it? Would you defend its legality in front of your peers, or at least anonymous internet folk? Could you accept people in an incestuous relationship as your friends?

&gt; Kind of like how I have no real moral issue with marijuana, but I wouldn't recommend smoking some if the job you're being interviewed for requires a drug test. Sir.

I've been to Turkey many times and although it appears secular and democratic in many areas it's Sharia law all the way despite it being supposedly limited to family or low level community issues.

Around 80% of adults in the US have a chemical dependency on it, and it is also administered to children almost indiscriminately.

Cocaine is also used by children in the form of chewing coca leaves, in countries where that is a cultural norm.  In other countries, it's the Areca nut (betel nut).  In other places, it's hallucinogens.

Alcohol has been a staple of countless cultures and was the only safe way to drink water in many places (watered-down spirits) before disinfection and purification were understood.  If your ancestors were from Europe, the UK, or Ireland, they drank alcohol as children -- and lots of it.

Smoking is fairly common among teenagers under 18, and not being able to buy cigarettes directly doesn't stop them.  Teenagers also rip off their parents' liquor cabinets, and raid old medication bottles.

Christianity in Scandinavia came later than most parts of Europe.

In **Denmark** Harald Bluetooth Christianized the country around 980.

The process of Christianization began in **Norway** during the reigns of Olaf Tryggvason (reigned 995 AD-c.1000 AD) and Olaf II Haraldsson (reigned 1015 AD-1030 AD). Olaf and Olaf II had been baptized voluntarily outside of Norway. 

Olaf II managed to bring English clergy to his country. Norway's conversion from the Norse religion to Christianity was mostly the result of **English** missionaries. 

The **Icelandic** Commonwealth adopted Christianity in 1000 AD, after pressure from Norway. The Goði-chieftain Þorgeirr Ljósvetningagoði was instrumental in bringing this about.

**Sweden** required a little more time to transition to Christianity, with indigenous religious practices commonly held in localized communities well until the end of the eleventh century. A brief Swedish civil war ensued in 1066 primarily reflecting the divisions between practitioners of indigenous religions and advocates of Christianity;

Dawkin's thinks Indoctrinating children with your religious (or political) ideals is pretty foul.

A work visa is, to my understanding the same process as the family visa, meaning it's a temporary residency permit. Now, it may be slightly different for a work visa, but standard practice with a visa you must reapply every year for five years in order to 'maintain' it (to prove you're not living off the state, basically). On your 5th application you will be granted permanent residency.

A family visa will allow you to work, yes. Like I mentioned previously though, it's not always granted as soon as the work visa is granted. Sometimes they make you wait 'x' number of days, or whatever, before you can apply for a family visa to be attached to your work visa in certain countries (that was the case when I lived in the UK). Since there is such a high number of ex-pats here that got job transfers and brought whole families I can't imagine that it would be TOO lenghty, but you need to both prepare yourself for the possibility. Like I said, since you're American you are allowed to be in Norway during the application process (but nowhere else in the EU). The average processing time for American's is 6 months, but it CAN take 11 or more. 

The fact of the matter is, skilled worker permits are very, very difficult to come by. There's a perception that if you're educated and want to contribute towards society that you will be welcomed, but there are strict quota's and regulations on this. The Norwegian government invests a lot of money to send it's citizens abroad to be educated in every area, so that they will return and fill the gap themselves. You may have many, many employeers wanting to hire you but it's not up to the company to decide if you can come in, it's UDI who looks over the application, your skills, and the position. There's a lot of scrutiny. Let's put it this way, my wife's father owns his own company and there is no way in HELL I could get in on a work visa no matter what position he decided to hire me as (an option we looked at). 

In addition, you may want to consider going the one work visa route with a family visa attached for the more practical purposes of 'uh oh, one of you lost your job'. If you both have a work visa and you lose your job and can't find another one you're pretty much screwed and can't switch easily to a family immigration permit in order to stay. Whereas if you have ONE work visa and ONE family immigration permit it's sort of only like having ONE visa you need to prove that you can maintain, versus two separate ones. So, even if your girlfriend lost her job, you could still prove that you can provide and income as well, and you're linked, not separate.   

There are some other specifics involving tax brackets and whatnot you may be interested about as well, in regards to what it means for pending visa's and family immigration, but I won't bore you with it now as it's a bit more of an annoying afterthought, but ask if you're curious.

I know the prospect of 6-11 months of no work seems utterly shite. This is the situation I'm in now, and my wife and I are both a year out of university. And you know what? It is fairly shite, but one income IS sufficient to function here with two people because the pay is high enough. 

Oh, side note, it's good that you're learning Norsk while in the US as it shows initiative. Try and get an official certificate stamped by the school verifying the hours you've completed. The norwegian government requires you to do shitloads of hours of language lessons and if you can prove you've done some of them it's less evening classes later on. They may not accept them as it may not be from a 'government accredited program' but it's worth trying. 

Sorry for the long rambling. There's just SO much when it comes to the whole immigration process (i've been through it so many times since I was 18...I loathe it) that I tend to spew slightly long, if not unrelated, stuff.

&gt;It is fundamentally wrong the the Palestinians land was grabbed from them, but they lost it in battle nearly one hundred years ago and we are where we are today, and its from that position that the solution must be found.

Hence why Hamas, the Arab Peace Initiative, the Israeli left, a former Mossad Chief, the EU, and international law all focus on 1967 borders and not 1948.

&gt;If the muslims demand it all back because they feel and want to go to war with Israel fair enough, but they will lose, Israel are a formidable force to be reckoned with, ;eading your people to constant defeat is a mugs game.

And if they do lose the situation either resorts to something along the lines what we already have now or Israel uses it to justify internment and ethnic cleansing - political pressure which it won't survive.  If it doesn't do that then it still has the demographic and refugee problem.  If it absorbs the Arabs then Israel either ceases to be democratic or Jewish.  Which for Israel's government and the Zionist project is end game.

&gt;The two state solution could be workable but only when peace reigns which isnt in the minds of enough of the players.

Exactly, which is why ultimately a one state solution will be the only alternative, which the Israeli far right won't accept.

There's a reason why a former Mossad chief has taken to his soapbox and said they must accept the Arab Peace Initiative.  He knows that if they don't Israel will implode and the Arabs will ultimately win everything.  Accepting the offer of a two state solution is what they have to do, but Israel won't.  Palestine will because it still leaves Israel with a growing Arab demographic and hobbled as a progressive state by a growing far right and orthodoxy.  Time is on the Palestinian side, and they know it.

&gt; Connolly, who is the director of Fisheries Science Services at the Marine Institute in Galway, advises the commission on ""total allowable catches"" and in 2013 is due to take over as president of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), the oldest marine scientific body.

&gt;artificial intelligence

We're reaching the limitations of polygons and a lack of graphical innovation will drive video game developers to seek other edges over the competition. AI has been sorely neglected for almost a decade. We could very well see a spurt in creating organic virtual beings.

Stem cell bans in the US are being lifted little by little, and I don't believe Southeastern Asia even has a ban. The immense potential in genetic medicine will find investors over the next decade.

&gt;space colonisation

&gt;universal provision

I'm not speaking from an Ameri-centric perspective here, but a European. Scandinavia currently provides everything from healthcare to education to housing.

Generally, if you are from a more sucessful country it automatically elevates your social status, even if your personal status is not that high. And generally women seek high-status men while men are kind of afraid of high-status women. This tends to result in intercultural couples where the man is from a more successful, the woman is from a less succesful country. The example here is the other way around.

This means if you are an American / Western European guy and lonely, moving to Eastern Europe will help your situation, the very fact that you are a Westerner will mean to a lot of women that you are ""cool"". However if you are an American / Western European woman, moving to Eastern Europe or some other poorer place could mean you stay lonely because the men are just too afraid to approach you esp. if your behavior is generally more professional and more empowered than the usual behavior of women in countries where feminism had less of an effect on the culture.

And if you are a lone guy from a poorer country moving to a richer one, prepare to suffer. You should probably find a GF at home and move together as your chances there are low, both amongst locals and fellow migrants. You will always be competing with the Western guys for even the fellow migrant women, and these guys just have those hard-to-describe air to them that you don't, a kind of cultural self-confidence that radiates ""I might be average amongst my folks, but WE are cool"". And local women will often look down on you because of your origin. I have been of speed dating events in the UK and soon as I opened my mouth and they heard my accent (not that hard but visible) I could visibly see the women look at me with some element of condescending pity, as a migrant from poorer country can only be a nobody (even though I made more than the average and tried to dress so that to reflect it).

1. Oops, you're correct. I think the ""anti-EU"" lot objected because it was a definite move to an integrated and federal state. As per point 4 I think the UK is generally hostile to this. I certainly think we should be given a referendum on it. Equally, it was clear from the ""No"" votes in France, Netherlands and Ireland that there was widespread unhappiness with the way in which things were changing.

4. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975) is a link which gives some information about the vote. As can be seen it was clearly a vote for the EEC and not the EU as it has become.

6.  ""I'd add that there is a political elite running being told how to run the UK by big businesses, so I'm not sure what the difference is. ""

Uhm, ok. Tin foil hats aside the people in the UK have the power to vite parties in and out of office. Lobbying happens across the EU as well as the UK. The point was that the EU Constitution/Lisbon treaty was steamrolled over the ""will of the people"". 

8. EU right-wing != UK right-wing; The UK has a greater free market tendancy than many countries in the EU. Take Sarkozy, technically a right wing party but, being French, he is far more protectionist by instinct than the Tories.

It doesn't make my point directly, but Ralph Raico's talk on ""[The European Miracle](http://mises.org/media/1263/The-European-Miracle)"" covers a bit of why I feel this way. How is it that Europe managed to explode in population and prosperity? The answer is the amount of liberty they enjoyed. At the time the governments were autocracies or nearly so. Obviously the form of government was not the primary reason they were so free.

Europe enjoyed a common culture provided mainly through the Catholic Church. This made it easy for merchants to cross borders into another jurisdiction if theirs became oppressive. The result was that states had to compete with one another, and this tended to promote freedom. The Church also provided a moral milieu in which the kings answered to a Divine moral authority, and were *not* above the law.

In the same way that actions begin as ideas, policy begins in the culture. Look at any popular movement that resulted in legislation. The instigating force was the culture, not the state. Government shows up to parties late, and then demands credit for the cake.

For example, we all celebrate the Midsummer Day, which is now named St. John's day in many places but it predates Christianity by a *very long* time. And the same case with the actual Christmas holiday, in Northern Europe we call it [Yule/Jõul/jól](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule) and the name originates from waaay before Christianity reached out lands.

It marked the end of the warrior as an enforcing class over the common citizen and allowed for the opening up of society.

Once kings and ministers at the top of society had no need for an expensive warrior class there was no 'societal police' to keep people in their place, it became possible to rise in the ranks much more readily. 

Secondly it allowed for defence to become a matter of technology rather than brute force. This allowed nation states to be able to fend off the advances of larger more populous countries or empires. As a consequence it caused an increase in the value placed on scientific progress as people saw the value of having the better technology (the best examples of this are the colonial conquests of Africa, often hundreds of European soldiers would face off against tens of thousands of African soldiers and win.).

I said

&gt;""Many were unwilling to leave in the early '30s because they could not conceive of what would happen. This was of course was not unique for the Jews. It was also true for many of the other populations and nations that suffered such genocides and holocausts.

This has nothing to do with the right of return. It is a reflection on human behavior -- that Jews were not unique in such behavior, and behaved as many other people did. That people in many cultures who may have had the opportunity to flee such areas, but stayed put for a variety of reasons -- denial, disbelief and more.

Immigration attitudes in the US during the 1930s became hardened in great part by the depression. Immigrants were seen as competing for US jobs. Rightly or wrongly, immigration in general was greatly discouraged, repatriation was encouraged, and with some immigrants forcibly deported to their origins. By the early '30s net migration into the US had become negative. 

Jewish immigration to Israel was controlled by the British who intermittently controlled the flow, and finally terminated it by 1939.  Jews had the opportunity to escape to Israel during the '30s. But the '30s were a very mixed period. Many Jews saw the actions of the Germans as a way to bring about a migration to Israel by actively promoting anti-Jewishness. This strategy was promoted by Herzl and others even before the Nazism existed. Some 10,000 Jews were members of the Italian Fascist Party before Italy's alliance with Germany changed the status of Jews in Italy.

If Jews on the scene were unable to see what was happening, how do you expect that the US, embroiled in its own economic issues, its own isolationist tendencies, and a profound desire to stay out of another war in Europe to have seen that and acted? You place the requirement of hindsight on others.

The problem is this: Israel has demonstrated over the last 30 years that it has no intention of using its nuclear weapons, except if its very existence is threatened. It is a nuclear power, but it is a rational nuclear power. It has made pre-emptive strikes, yes, but not nuclear ones, and not strikes aimed at civilian populations.

Can the same be said of Iran? We do not know. We do not know if Ahmadinejad would be willing to give Hezbollah a nuclear weapon and we do not know if Hezbollah would be a rational nuclear power. When you consider the suicide bombings and the rocket barrages, there is good reason to worry.

One atomic bomb would finish off Israel. One. It's the size of New Jersey, remember. Destroy Tel Aviv and there would be no more Israel. 

As for Iran having WW II rockets, I think you need to do a bit more reading. They now have missiles that can reach not only Israel, but much further. New rockets. They are not a technologically backward country.

We worry now--and rightly so--about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons--could they get into the hands of irrational players like the Taliban or even what's left of Al Queda? Would they attack India? Europe? The US?

The Cold War was conducted between two rational players, neither of which wanted to see its country destroyed and millions of its citizens killed. Would Hezbollah feel the same way?

Turkey is in fact in a significant struggle with those wishing to see a return to a more conservative and more Muslim state and this will continue. This (womens rights, article  301 regarding the punishment for insulting Turks and by default Muslims) and the issues surrounding land occupation/disagreements with Greece and Cyprus is the biggest stumbling block regards their EU membership.

But I've also encountered what I've called the ""entrepreneurial spirit"" and this is that ""thing"" many bosses at smaller businesses I've had have: the desire to own a company, make millions, not be told what to do or how to do it, ability to lord it over other people, avoid reality such as taxes, rub shoulders with other people such as themselves, treat employees like shit, find loopholes to avoid paying taxes and brag about their success stories and their ""pull themselves up by their own bootstraps"" mentality.

I will say that in every case it's been because they have either inherited the company, married into money, or gotten their contacts through political affiliation. I don't personally know anyone who has started something from scratch. 

Places I've worked:

Funeral home: the guy who owned it inherited it and the guy who managed it was the owner's wife's crush. Weird.

Moving company a. Guy married some lady who's family was worth money...as in *owned* a leer jet money. Got trucks and a warehouse out of the deal. 

Moving company b. Sons inherited huge moving business. Too busy collecting cars/building vacation homes/having employees do side work as a ""favor"" to manage anything effectively. 

Embroidery place: trohpy-ish wife marries a hardworking guy, convinces him to let her manage the shop, hires two sons. One ran his computer business out of this, taking up space and time, the other was a coach/child molester who went on the run after the police were on to him and got caught in Europe. Basically, the two sons were managers who got paid but didn't show up to work and used their time to do other things.

Coffee Shop/Bakery: attractive girls were hired and hooked up with the boss. Because he was always in the shit he tended to take it out on the manager who was pretty mousy and didn't know anything, and she took it out on you.

Computer animation company: pretty sure the CEO married his girlfriend because her mom was a higher up at a government agency that all of his lucrative contracts somehow came from.

Yep.

For the difficulties of getting credit cards in non-first world countries it is more difficult to get a listing of all of the precise reasons, but this should give you an example:

&gt; Russia's consumer-credit market -- installment loans, credit cards, car loans, and mortgages -- is still in its infancy. Total consumer debt makes up just 3% of Russia's gross domestic product, compared with 75% of GDP in the U.S., and around 20% to 30% in Eastern European markets such as Poland. Just 1 in 100 people has a credit card, compared with 2.5 cards per person in the U.S.

Gustav Cassel was Swedish economist who not only predicted that tight monetary policies due to a flawed gold standard would lead to world wide deflationary depression in the 1920's.  He also prescribed that the removal of the gold standard and monetary expansion to meet the surge in the demand for money would end the depression and allow countries to grow.  His insight allowed Sweden to reinlfate their price level and the country was the *first* to the leave the great depression in 1934.

Its great you also brought up Sweden, their early 1990's policy on their own housing bubble and banking crisis is a blueprint that the US should have followed in 2008.  And for the record I also support your second idea but view it as less feasible politically.

But what does that mean today and how does it relate to monetary policy during the great recession and more importantly the impending crisis in Europe?  I will allow Lars Christensen to reinterpret:

&gt;Cassel clearly explained how gold hoarding by especially the French and the US central banks was the key cause for the tightening of global monetary conditions that pushed the global economy into depression – exactly in the same way as “passive” monetary tightening due to a sharp rise in money demand generated deflationary pressures that push the global economy and particularly the US and the European economies into the Great Recession.

Hmmm, nothing about sucking cock there, just a good old fashioned understanding of the demand for money and its consequences when those demands are unmet.  If money demand increases 4 times but the money supply only 3, you have effectively tightened monetary policy, which is exactly what is happening right now in Europe.  Money demand is increasing for US dollars as the Euro zone implodes, which would effectively tighten monetary policy in the United States and slow the great recession into the great depression II. 

If you are still reading, here is a link to a comparison of [Sweden, Poland and Denmark](http://thefaintofheart.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/poland-didn%C2%B4t-miss-many-beats/) and the great recession, certainly there is a reason that Poland and Sweden where able to avoid the great recession?

You are correct with me being young (21) the goal of this money for me is saving for a house.

I actually really like the breakdown of your counter suggestion, I personally have never been a big fan of bonds though and I know in part it may be because I am young and naive to an extent so 20% is more of me placing a rule on myself so I don't kick myself later.

the reason I would do larger investments than 1% is that in total I have about 65k or so to invest 40k from the jnj and 25k I've managed to save up outside emergency funds. so I want to avoid too many commission costs. So my plan was to invest 30% (3% per stock) in about 10 stocks I honestly think I would have problems following more than about 10 stocks and being able to do decent research into them (I like watching web casts and reading reports to get an overall feeling of where a company is heading)

As far as my stock picks go:

Ford - I really like their direction and think that they are making great steps in bringing more of their European divisions style to the US. I am personally going to be buying one of their cars next year and I never expected myself to buy an American car in the past.

Bank of America - Beaten down way below book value, I have some family in the corporate structure who are big fans and think it is looking positive.

Power-One - a tiny bit speculative as it is mixed in with the solar industry but I think they are placed in very good spot once the solar industry finishes crashing and consolidates. Also has a lot of cash.

Corning Incorporated - need to do more DD on this one first but I think their current price is pretty attractive for running an efficient diversified business model that I don't think is going anywhere soon.

Molycorp - (speculative play) currently the only real major REE producer outside of China and will be able to get to market 1-2 years before competition really hits. I have a holding in this as of recently and will re-evaluate in early 2012 depending on China's quota limits.

The main focus of the Church when the rape cases came to light was to prevent a scandal, not stop rape, nor bring the abusers to justice.


Well that's not true at all! Didn't you hear what I said before about all the efforts the Church made in order to stop abuse? Of course, you can say all you want about why the Church wanted to stop abuse. But you have absolutely no way to show that the Church only did it to stop scandal; that's just biased speculation on your part. The pope has taken time to meet directly with several abuse victims in private to talk about what happened and try his best to apologize for being abused in what's supposed to be a safe area.

&gt;The Catholic Church supported Hitler and the Nazis.

The burden of proof is on you, buddy. In any case, I'd be very careful with this claim, as Pope Pius XII saved many of the Jewish people living in Rome during the Nazi occupation. The Nazis also did a really good job of messing everything up in the Church in Europe.

In the case of single bullies the teachers can solve it just by going to that kids parents and talking though the behavoiur, and in extreme cases moving the kid to a school for troubled kids where there is more teachers and where they are tough to deal with it. 

Anyways, when you do have a class of 28 kids, and one of the guys decides he wants to go to school with a pink hello kitty shirt and a barbie backpack he will most likely be bullied by the rest, since he is breaking the social norm. What is the teacher then to do? Gather up the 54 parents and have talks with the 27 kids who are either actively or passively making that one kid feel bad for trying to express something that doesn't fit the norm, or tell him to keep the pink shirts and bags at home if he wants the attention to cool down?

While in the perfect world you would see the first, and have the teacher trying to improve rest of the kids, it's just not feasible in most cases. If you want to start screaming gay rights, you are picking put the wrong case. This is just the way schools handle problems like this, no matter why the kid in question is being bullied, if it's something that he can easily change or hide, the teachers will ask him to conform for the sake of reducing the bullying.

Just random shit that happens all over the place…

&gt; but he is right that Quebec is a terribly inefficient province. I've lived in BC, AB, ON, and now QC and can confirm that provincially regulated and funded things are much more wasteful and inefficient.

I’ve known plenty of “freshly arrived” europeans, and they had nothing but praise for Québec bureaucracy. Latest one was a student staying at my place for a few weeks until he had his residence sorted out; he was totally flabberghasted to have his health insurance card less than 20 minutes after walking into the RAAMQ office…

Another fucked-up his tax papers, and was astonished that the clerk explained her what she did wrong and fixed it for her. She said that back in Italy, she would have fined for doing that.

&gt; The obvious go-to is the shitty roads, but I won't get into that because we all know how true it is. Drive across the QC/ON border and you can feel it instantly.

Yeah, 10 years ago, when you drove to Ottawa, the 417 was a horrible mess once you crossed into Ontario (they since fixed it).

&gt; In the same category, pretty much all construction here is delayed, but that's nothing different from any province. The issue in QC is the corruption involved with it. I don't want to hear your reply just saying ""You only read Anglophone media which spins the facts"". If that's true, I want you to show evidence that there isn't any corruption with the government.

The corruption happens under the watch of a liberal federalist government. Whenever they are in power, they always end up mired in corruption.

&gt; Health Care: Meh, not bad, but nowhere near as good/thorough/efficient as BC or AB. In both BC and AB, you call to book an appointment, and go. Here, you have to jump through hoops for at least a week before you can make any progress, then it usually results in a waste of an hour for a checkup with a GP who can't give you a referral.

This is bullshit. The walk in clinic at the corner will take me in any time, with only 1-2 hours waiting.

&gt; I don't care enough to write pages and pages like you do, but my experience with provincial government run services has been fairly dismal. Most things just seem so shady that they could be run by the mob, and the inefficiency shows it too.

How long have you been in Québec? Not very long, I think.

&gt; All this said though. I love it here and hope the culture and lifestyle of the City and Province don't ever change. I just wouldn't mind some smooth roads and efficient government services.

But isn't judging someone on their past sex life-- and finding certain numbers ""too high""-- a bit of the essence of insecurity?

Also, I should note that the constant anxiety of men policing one's sex life-- telling you not to be a ""prude"" or a ""cocktease,"" and simultaneously telling you not to be ""easy"" from the time you're, I don't know, 10, is enough to make any girl insecure.

False,gaming,1427956851,c34bu6f,,2,0,1322756315,t5_2qh03,t1_c34bu6f,False,0,0,"There is an MMO like that, but it's not popular due to many reasons. This MMO has no targeting, friendly-fire for everything from melee attacks to heals to aoe nukes, a large, seamless world, and a skill system similar to Morrowind (the combat is reminiscent of TES:3 as well). These are some reasons why it is not succeeding:

One - This game was made by a small European company that spent next to nothing in marketing, takes a very long time to change things due to its size, and refuses to grow like any company that wishes to succeed and improve. 

Two - It is a hardcore game. Not only is every ability and method of damage dealing in the game dependant upon player skill (because there is no targeting), but when you die, you drop everything on you, including your armor/weapons - everything. Your mount can be killed, you can be anihilated by veterans and griefed to oblivion. It has a clunky UI and the gameplay is so different than WoW that people cannot cope. 

Three - This is a blessing and a curse. There are no levels. There are skills and magic schools, but anyone can learn them. This creates a large disparity between the vets and the noobs. Vets have trained in all schools of magic and are powerful with multiple weapons etc, so people with a lot of playtime will have better, stronger characters. Although you can use any item and ride any mount, steer any ship, or operate and siege weapon at level one, you will still be utterly destroyed by most of the playerbase.

Finally, the culmination of poor PVE (since the game is built around PVP, player cities and wars), slow changes on balance and content addition, a weird UI and unintuitive acclamation to the world, 'grinding' skills, and no marketing have made this game pretty stagnant. 

-----

On the other hand, many of the things I mentioned make for an incredible experience. 

World - the world is huge and seamless. There is on continent with 4 large islands, and there is a portion of the game devoted entirely to naval combat. There are many many many large and small player cities that can be sieged and used as headquarters for various guilds, as well as fast travel between major guild-owned cities (the only fast travel in the game). Otherwise, hop on your mount. Be careful though, mounts can be killed or stolen (if you dismount without unsumoning it). There are many interesting biomes, but the graphics engine is fairly outdated. Apparently a rehaul is in the works.

Leveling - there is none. There are skill levels though. Like in TES:3, you get better at magic by using it, and the same goes for any skill. The best part about this is that people because imfamous by their guild or their name, but you could never tell how powerful someone is by looking at them. You can only see someone's health by having your crosshair on them, so sneak attacks are viable and effective. 

Combat - Melee is performed in third person while archery and magic are first person. Like I said, every form of damage and healing has friendly fire, so coordination and accuracy are imperative. There are very few forms of crowd control, so the focus is more on players skill and positioning. Sadly, since you get better at what you're doing by doing it over and over, there are people who have maxed stats in several or *all* weapons or magic schools, making combat often very difficult or bland (since everyone can do everything - there are no classes).

The final thing I would like to point out is the inventory system. Nothing special here, except that when you die, everything you were wearing or had equipped is up for grabs. This high stakes variable makes encounters very exciting, since coupled with the fact that you won't know the power of your opponent ahead of time and whether reinforcement are coming, the odds are often against you. Nothing feels better than winning a battle to the death with everything on the line - and receiving your share of the spoils of war. Coupled with this is the fact that things take time, so there are appropriate risks for everything. Donning and removing armor takes time, looting is done by dragging one item at a time into your inventory, and unsummoning a mount takes several seconds.

I really enjoyed this game, and I kind of went into a lot more detail then I intended. It is in a state of slow growth however, waiting for a rehaul. It's a good experience for people who have gotten tired of boring WoW combat, PVP (in comparison) and right-click auto-attacking. This game is hard, unforgiving, but will give players a never before felt rush and reward when victorious. I believe it also has a free trial.

And let me tell you something, if you really talk about *competitive high end* and WoW Arena in one post, then you are blinded much by MMOs and you actually never plaed a real competitive game. Why are you caring so much and asking that much about a MMOs PvP, if its ""competitive"" or not. 

The Answer is simple, and you SHOULD know it. It is what you make out of it. It will always be, farm gear, find right partners for a team, skill the right stuff and build the maybe best lineup for BG/WZ or Arena like gametype. Then you ""win"". There is so less skill involved in MMO type games, that you really can not talk about ""competitive"" here. 

I suggest you, try out Starcraft or real FPS games like UT/Quake (also i am a former UT professional player btw. - uhoho my ePenis grooooooowwwsss lol) :) - then you see what *competitive high end"" gaming is. Maybe you did, you can tell me then.

But you said, you made some Glads in WoW, so you are not a dumb Person and good at gaming i guess.

As i said, you should buy SWTOR, play it, enjoy for the sake of it. Then do WarZones, farm your gear, like you would have to do in every other MMO. 

Then you will see how it fits your needs of a ""competitive"" enviroment. Im pretty sure, that you will enjoy the game even without ""high end"" PvP. So far, none of us can tell anything about the PvP in SWTOR, of course there are some max level dudes who played WZ and they think they have the uber skills because they own lvl15 people with their lvl50 toon + gear. 

But you can analys the game itself. I played SWTOR last weekend only. I played the Sith Sorcerer, only to level 18. :( but by looking at the healing talent tree and spells etc.

It feels little bit like a Disc. Priest and rSham mix for me. There is a talent like riptide, a shield like Disc. bubble etc. pp.

The feeling itself during a WZ as a low lvl18 Sorcerer was kinda like in WoW Battleground.
You try to heal your team from the back, here and there you try to add a DoT or a DMG cast on someone low etc. And after like 24 hours of healing your team, the enemys realize that you are healing and none dies... lol. Then 5 people run after you and you try to kite. Thats pretty much the same shit as in WoW.

SWTOR has no Arena enviroment, there are only WarZones and *AFAIK* tehre is no Arena planned.

Some facts i read about last days (maybe smth is not true at all, i don't know everything about SWTOR atm)
You can not push your Force (mana) regeneration through gear or items. Only with talents.

As i said, i only made it to lvl18. But i already saw how it will work later on, you really HAVE to be good at mana (force) management otherwise you run out of it and the regeneration is not the fastet for the sorcerer, at least not on lvl18 with not so many talents.

Other healers like BH have totally another ressource, like heat and such stuff, they have to keep it low, the higher the heat is, the lower their regeneration is, so they have one heal for no cost or something, so i guess you can count 1+1 and imagine that there is some ""skill cap"", right?

The combat IS slow compared to WoW atm, but that has to do with WoW having HASTE on almost every item, and reducing most GCDs of all classes to like 1 sec instead of 1,5. I don't know if the ""haste"" attribute of SWTOR will reduce the GCD aswell, i hope so.

So, tl;dr

---&gt; Buy SWTOR, play it, enjoy it, at least the free 30 days, then see if PvP is good enough or not.


greetings

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_International#Controversy

&gt;Michael Bussee, one of the founders of Exodus and Gary Cooper, a leader within the ministry of Exodus, left the group to be with each other in 1979. In time, they divorced their wives and participated in a commitment ceremony in 1982, exchanging rings and vows. Bussee and Cooper lived together until Cooper's death from AIDS-related illness in 1991. Their story is one of the foci of the documentary One Nation Under God (1993), directed by Teodoro Maniaci and Francine Rzeznik.
In the documentary, Bussee and Cooper present themselves as ""two of the original co-founders of Exodus."" In an article regarding the history of Exodus International, Dr. Warren Throckmorton questioned whether Cooper should be considered a founder. However, Exodus International president Alan Chambers counts both Bussee and Cooper as ""founders"" in a September 2006 newsletter article.
As acknowledged by Exodus International in 2006, Michael Bussee ""has been a longtime critic of Exodus and its leadership."" In June 2007, Bussee issued an apology for his involvement in promoting orientation change through Exodus. Also apologizing were Jeremy Marks, former president of Exodus International Europe, and Darlene Bogle, the founder of Paraklete Ministries, an Exodus referral agency. The apology stated in part ""Some who heard our message were compelled to try to change an integral part of themselves, bringing harm to themselves and their families."" In April 2010, Bussee stated, ""I never saw one of our members or other Exodus leaders or other Exodus members become heterosexual, so deep down I knew that it wasn’t true.""

Also from the [reparative therapy article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparative_therapy#Studies_of_conversion_therapy):

&gt;Ariel Shidlo and Michael Schroeder found in ""Changing Sexual Orientation: A Consumer's Report"", a peer-reviewed study of 150 respondents[83] published in 2002, that 88% of participants failed to achieve a sustained change in their sexual behavior and 3% reported changing their orientation to heterosexual. The remainder reported either losing all sexual drive or attempting to remain celibate, with no change in attraction.

The ""moral majority"" Christians are just plain *wrong* on homosexuality.

Also, nations with the highest gay acceptance have the best functioning societies.  If there's something that makes society dysfunctional, it's [highly corrolated with religion if not religion itself](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP07398441_c.pdf).

Christians(and most americans in general) tend to have no idea we have more divorce, income inequality, teenage pregnancy, homicides, and STDs than the rest of the developed world who are less religious, and that in addition we have a higher percentage of our population in jail than *any country in recorded history*.

More religion isn't our salvation: It's our curse.  America isn't a beacon on the hill to the non-religious world: It's a hive of scum and villainy that only gets worse in the parts of the country with more religion.

It's time for evidence based policies, not fairy tales.  Let's try to catch up to the rest of the world instead of pushing ourselves back to the iron age from whence religion sprung.

So that's my thoughts on the issue.  As to what you should tell your mom: You might mention evidence above, but I wouldn't bother.

The issue with an autotransformer is reversal of polarity. When you plug it in the wrong way, the neutral prong and the hot prong get switched (only one actually has voltage). The neutral prong should be a the same potential as the ground. When the thing is plugged in the wrong way, the neutral become 220V AC, rather than 0V, and the hot is then neutral.

2) Install massive external i.e. publicly visible regulatory oversight to prevent cronyism

3) Stop the Wall Street revolving doors that put Goldman Sach execs into a position of control.

Such as lifting things in the warehouse or sharp turning in a car.

Long story. 
Went to a 30 day summer and day one is movie day as we all show up at different times.  So movie ends and most every one is there by now. So we head to cabins to finish unpacking. Those who finished went out to play kickball or soccer.
(most counselors there were from Europe or Australia. So this was pretty popular.) 

Now at this point I fell that two facts need be included. Me and my friend marc met at this camp a few years prior and hung out after camp some times. So we both went back basically to screw around.
And the second fact being that this wasn't normal kickball. This was bigass ball kickball. The ball was pretty much an exercise ball (2-3 foot diameter) but hit like a dodge ball.

So I'm up third a just rail this ball like someone had rolled a bomb my way and just wanted it gone way into right field. I made first base easy but stopped due to the ball being thrown at me. First baseman couldn't catch it.

 So I booked it to second and then third. The ball was now between third and the pitchers mound. I ran like a starving kid who just saw a hotdog vendor.  Ball gets thrown at me and I did some weird feet first slide halfway between third and home. Happy that I dodged it I push myself backup and as I make the move to home I just stop. 

At this point my arm (left arm) looked normal. But hurt horribly. And I just said I'm done. And walked off. Counselor comes over.
""what's your name again""
""pandadentist""
""well panda what's wrong?""
""my arm it's like on fire. 
so he being the genius he is takes a look at it now it's slightly red but not inflamed yet. And he just says that I probably sprained it and it looks fine.  Letting it hang hurt more so I rested it upon the top of a small soccer net. 

After an hour we go to dinner. And i see who I'm sitting with for the month. All small kids (7-11yrs) I'm 14 with two adult counselors. 

Dinner blows, and I see the nurse that night for night medications. And stick around after every one got their meds. And ask her to talk a look. 
Now this lady was the oldest lady I've ever met who still could kick your ass. But she's a nice lady anyway. Proclaims that it's just a sprain and ill be fine with an ibuprofen. Rennet that it's twice the size of my non fucked arm. And red. 
 
So I don't sleep that night from the pain. 

Three days go by when I finally get the nurse to take me into town to get it looked at. It's like a hour drive in an old ass station wagon from Isabella to Ely. The radio was some weird ass local station playing and I shit you not. 
Indian drumming and chanting 
Death cab for cutie
A female announcing that an old chain was found in the road by (somewhere)
Then local news. Something about lake pollution. 

We get to the hospital and wait and wait an wait. 
(I'm with a male counselor who has back trouble and a nurses assistant interning at this camp.) also my parents have not been informed that anything happened. 

This was the longest cordoor I've ever walked down.
Some 50 yr old women was lawn mowing and had a rock embedded in her knee cap. The cray was pretty cool. (they hung it in the hall.)

My xray comes back and says broken but healed. So the doctor has to rebreak it. Right before he injects the local anistetich he goes and gets the inter. I here roshambo from the hall way. And in they walk. Mr experienced holds my elbow and the untrained intern asks what to do. 

""Aww it's easy just squeeze until it pops back.""
So he does and they send for xray 2. 
It's misaligned. No shit.
So mr experience does it and concludes that it's fine and the xray does too. I think.

Now in a dripping wet splint(to allow the fluid to build, a cast would just make the arm stuck in there) we head back. Btw wet splint wrap smells like a mix of superglue and nasty. 

Two days later splint comes off, cast goes on.
I can't swim, do archery, canoe. Take my own pants button on or off.

I go home on day 7. My dad drove all night. 

So I bailed on my friend and left. 

But the story dosen't end there. 
When the cast néed to come off I went to tria. And the doctor took a look at it and told me It needed to be redone. This time I'm knocked out and it works well. Minus the pain of certain motions.

Ooooh, history! My favorite topic. Here we travel back to the mists of time, to pre-history, the time when the State was first set up....

But actually, some would say that the State itself was an institution, a control mechanism, imposed on the free people of the earth by the rich. I.e. those tribal leaders who (being the most sociopathic) were most successful at bringing their fellows and neighbors under their domination (and thus making available to themselves all the riches produced by their labor) were the ones who set about establishing the political order that we now know as the State. This seems to have been the case, e.g., in Ancient China (go read about the Xia dynasty, and what their fondness for Jade ornaments tells us about the character of their ruling elites) and also in Ancient Rome.

Closer to our own time, what we think of European nation States were of course established by invader elites whose kings parceled out the choicest lands (the wealth) to their most important followers (their *comitatus*). And is therefore clearly an instrument of domination and oppression, by the rich who had acquired their wealth by force. Not much has changed since then, except that the rich have gotten cleverer, and have learned to better disguise the nature of the system, who actually rules, the fraudulent nature of our politico-economic system. Etc.

&gt; Capitalism is the Feudal order minus the religious and monarchical component

Oy. I fear I've walked into a closet Socialist or Anarchist. But you're essentially right that what we have here is a neo-feudal rentier economy.

The argument between Socialists and Libertarians boils down to stuff like whether this system we have now can really be called ""Capitalism."" And whether the root cause of the problem is really private ownership of the means of production, or the collectivization of society under this thing called the State, or Government. Free market capitalism in the sense that libertarians speak of it, is an idealized abstraction that has never existed, and probably can never be made to exist.  

&gt; You of course wont be able to see this

Ha ha ha. I do hope you enjoy being wrong. I can go on at great length about how our economy is basically a series of rent extraction schemes, set up by our neo-feudal lords, the plutocrats. Using government power.

&gt; Seriously, you're the one who's here defending and propping up Capitalism

Sorry, nope. Remember your [Lenin.](http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/) 

In short, if you oppose Imperialism, you are attacking Capitalism (or ""Statism-Corporatism"" as Libertarians would insist we call this abomination we live under).

&gt; It's what we're educated about in school, it the framework into which all of our social relations fit into, it's glorified in every advertisement you see in every commercial break and gas station. 

Yes, but who controls all these institutions and channels? The Ruling Class. Are you sure that you, who parrot the stuff we've been taught about in school, listen to mainstream democratic talking points and propaganda, aren't, in effect, brainwashed yourself? Brainwashed to oh-so-slightly misdiagnose the problem and misunderstand people?

&gt; I don't know how I found time to be brainwashed against Capitalism

No silly. You've been brainwashed to think that what we have today is Capitalism in the sense that Libertarians talk about Capitalism. I'm suggesting there's a bit more to it than that. 

And you're brainwashed to think that if you vote for Libertarians like Ron Paul, our system will become *more* Capitalist (in the sense you use the word).

Some of us would be of the opinion that it's unethical to not challenge people in such conversations to help them look at the horizons beyond such partial cultural narratives like the one about the founding fathers of this country. 

Honestly, why only go back two hundred years into the history of our Anglo society on this continent? Why not turn the pages back over the two thousand years of history through the examples in our cultural roots in Europe? However, of course, the people and events from those times aren't taught to American kids in school... so it would be impossible to find common ground that way.

Barack Obama's speaking style is an example of using the cultural narrative you recommend, gratuitously. It really warms the cockles of Americans' hearts when a person does that sort of thing. However, it really grates on my ears, and the ears of others who might call themselves ""free thinkers,"" because it's also a very shallow way of speaking.

&gt; But you said, in other words, that speaking plainly could only be done by 'simple' people.

Honestly, I think that is best. There's certainly nothing wrong with being simple. Canadians and Australians do the simple lifestyle very well. Canada's a very rationalistic society, and Australia is a society where the good of the larger community is the prime directive. These societies are light years beyond the complex people of the UK, when it comes to making happy and healthy communities. 

However, everybody needs to find a situation where they are validated and appreciated by those around them, *for who they are at their best.*  Only a child is in a situation where he is willing to adjust his personality in order to be accepted and validated by those around him. That can be healthy or unhealthy for that child, depending on the character of the adults around the child.

The most important thing are already mentioned in the thread. Health care is nice in Germany, but the UK (for instance) has a better system. Germany hasn't big university fees (you pay around 400€ each year for stuff like public transport and the materials you use in your studies (computer or stuff like that). If you want children, that would be a good point. Our educational system is bad as fuck but from what I heard, it's better than the US one (English is a must have class. You can't leave it.  Second foreign languages are very common when your child goes to a ""Gymnasium"" (highest high school). The students learn a lot about foreign countries and world wide (or at least European) history. French revolution is a big topic).

The conditions of your work are better. 30 days paid holiday and stuff. Already said as well. As an American, I don't think you mind if your pension is lower than it was 10 years ago. Because of the break of the DDR we've got a lot of old people who get pension but didn't pay for it. And now, we haven't enough money to pay the same pension as we did 10 years ago. But when you're that age, if could've changed.

But I would recommend you should live here for a few month and take a good look how stuffs works here in Germany. But in the end, it is no problem to live in another European country if you don't like it here. The only problem you'll have in the UK is that you need a bank account for a place and a place for a bank account =P

To put it simple, if the definition means

**1) you always need outside sources for confirmation, to accept it as ""historically accurate"".**
Then you have a huge problem. Since most historical accounts (ancient, greek, egypt, middle ages, etc..) come from single sources written (or oldest known manuscripts) way after the event. Basically most ancient (and sometimes even not so ancient) history we learned in school was then fantastical bullshit.

**2) a text is deemed ""historically accurate"" as long as no archeological findings &amp; other sources tell a different story.**
Then it will depend on a) how much content is disputed
                                b) which source has more credibility
                                c) how good is my text overall (1 wrong part, will not disprove 100 verified ones)
                                d) how good is my archeology

So I treat the OT/NT text as a historical text. That can be critizised/analyzed/studied like any other manuscript.
Personally I belief the supernatural stories about god, Jesus, are true also, but that cannot be verified historically. That's, like in any religion, a matter of belief... But practically a lot of old manuscripts &amp; ""writting on stones"" (egypt, greek, ...) contain supernatural sayings, and god(s) who interfere. If you would discredit the OT/NT text on that basis, most of ancient history that you learned would have to be discarded as well.
And all that personal stories, like ""he said this"" &amp; ""she answered this"", you will be never to prove/disprove anyway. Only the surrounding text (language,names) and factual information (knowledge of time period, locations, etc...)

When it come to the OT/NT text so far, most things that can/could be verified archeologically seem to support the bible as an accurate historical text.
In the NT especially Acts as a mainly historical book stands out...

In the OT, the farther back you get, the fuzzier the answer will be. My problem with most criticism, like Finkelsteins, is that it depends heavily on ""evidence not found"" coupled with ""time dating the site"" (=""no evidence at the time wehre I date the event"").

This approach has 3 problems:
**1) exact locations** (cities, places, etc.) are often highly disputed. We often don't know the verified exact locations of roman and sometimes even middle age battles in Europe. So it seems a little strange, when some archeologist says for events 1000-2000 years earlier, this is definitively the site (while he most definitively never looked 2 miles to the west...).
**2) Dating** in Egypt, Israel, heck the whole Middle East ist pretty much a mess of its own for the OT time period. First there are not too many ""datable"" artefacts, and secondly Finkelstein &amp; Co don't believe in C14 carbon dating. O.K. that's highly simplified and blatantly wrong. The truth is: the ""established standard timeline"" based on Egyptology practically never corresponded really to C14 dating (a couple of hundred years difference). Since a few years back they think they can solve this technically (and with some hypothetical explanations), but it means that practically any C14 dating that doesn't fit the wanted result gets ignored. Basically a lot (mostly older) archeologists of that time in Egypt &amp; Middle East are ignoring C14 dating results for that purpose. There is a battle between archeologists fought here...and C14 seems to be winning lately...
**3) dating OT events** is always speculative, there are competing arguments e.g. for the time of the exodus (1450-1200) and some dispute the event it at all.

This means personally for me, that while archeological findings in OT times are fun, interesting and sometimes truly awesome, any claim based on ""at that time Israel did not exist, the city was not inhabited, long destroyed, we found no evidence"" depends too much on ""I accurately dated the site/event"".
And the absence of findings does not really disprove the existence of something historically. The question quickly becomes one of trusting the underlying  assumptions. So far I haven't found much that contradicts the confutable historical narrative parts of the OT/NT text. Archeological research that depends on ""exact"" location/time dating offers questions and definitive mistakes in the text. But the time/place dating of this research depends often highly on other factors and interpretations, and is mostly disputed.

Second of all, how about you offer some points as to how religion has not influenced modern society? You aren't refuting my points at all.  
Finally, how on *earth* was what I said vague? Here's my point:  
Every single modern government can trace it's roots back to the bible and medieval society. Classical liberalism was a reaction to the feudal way and the divine right of kings. The United States government was based off classical liberalism, and so are the governments of Europe and most of the democracies worldwide. So JUST with that, that alone, the Bible is incredibly influential today, in the way our governments work and were formed, even if we pretend that everyone stopped believing in the Bible in 1800. You say it's because we got rid of religion, and I agree, but that still means that they were reacting to religion, which means that it was influenced by religion.   
But that's not all. There are, last I checked, 2.2 billion Christians worldwide, and presumably they all feel that the Bible influences them.

Luke, Leia, and Han are the baddest of the bad. They're constantly being thrown into situations that determine the fate of the galaxy. Hoth, Endor, finding the Death Star plans, and setting up a trap for the galaxy's only Jedi and the face of the Rebellion (Leia) on Cloud City are BIG deals. We aren't talking about a secondary theatre or podunk insurrectionists.

Imperial Army troopers, Navy troopers, and the like were more than competent enough to handle your run-of-the-mill conflicts. Stormtroopers, on the other hand, are the cream of the crop. The Empire's shock troops. They were loyal (and accountable) only to the Emperor, the ideals of the Empire, and their officers. In that order, btw. Please note that ""officers"" only means stormtrooper officers. Orders from outside officers were only obeyed when their commanders placed themselves subordinate to Army and Navy officers.

Stormtroopers during the Galactic Civil War (for the sake of discussion, we'll ignore ROTS-era clone troopers and the Empire of the Legacy era) were about a 35/65 split between clones of various templates and traditional recruits. To be a stormtrooper, a recruit had to be in the top 5 percent of certain testing metrics, as well as being within a certain range for height, weight, intelligence, and loyalty. I could wax philosophically about stormtroopers all day, but I'll cut it short because I'm at work.

**TL;DR**- Stormtroopers are badass motherfuckers that appear to suck in the movies because they're up against Luke effing Skywalker and suffer from a lack of plot shields. They're actually a minority in the Imperial armed forces.

**--EDIT--** I remembered this comment I'd made, and went back and searched for it. It's about their armor. My virginity is legion:

Stormtrooper armor is the direct descendant of the clone trooper's Phase II armor (with a few iterations in between). However, in keeping with the New 

* Order's policy that life was cheap, they cut a few corners. Let me explain further:
Stormtroopers are indoctrinated from the start to be absolutely loyal to the Emperor, their commanding officers, and the Empire, in that order. The armor helps to instill a sense of conformity, as well as unsettling opponents with it's machine-like appearance.

* Stormtrooper armor consists of about 20 different plastoid pieces and a body glove (the black part). The body glove regulates temperature, wicks away body waste, and in a pinch can serve as a vac suit for 20 minutes. It's not designed to be absolutely blaster-proof.
The reason said armor isn't blaster-proof is twofold. The first reason being that armor that'd let you take a bolt to the chest and keep moving is horrendously heavy and expensive (ARC Troopers and RC Commandos had blaster-proof Katarn armor. Very, very expensive). Lighter armor allows for greater utility and mobility on the battlefield. Additionally, being a little vulnerable forces you to trust your comrades and officers. Again, with the conformity and obedience.

* It's stated in several places that stormtrooper armor offers fantastic ballistic protection, being damn-near invulnerable to small-arms projectiles. In addition, it's highly blaster resistant, like how real-world cops have bulletproof vests that slow down the impact of a bullet. They'll have a giant bruise and some broken ribs, but it's better than being dead. The bulk of stormtrooper casualties were wounded, and could receive first-aid and corrective surgery to bring them back to duty. This is hinted at in Episode IV when Vader walks onto the Tantive IV. Note the trooper to his right checking on a downed comrade.

* Energy weapons are restricted material throughout the galaxy. In 99% of actions, opponents will either be poorly armed or unarmed at all.  Stormtroopers aren't afraid of sporting blasters and slugthrowers, just military hardware.

* Death Stars ain't cheap. If you can shave 10% off the cost of a billion suits of stormtrooper armor, you'll be able to spend it elsewhere.
Again, life is cheap. At the height of the Empire, there were innumerable stormtroopers both clones and conscripts. It was easy to find more, even with stringent entry requirements concerning height, weight, intelligence, and loyalty.",t1_c349ys9,Caedus_Vao,,,13,True,t3_mvo0h

One thing you can be sure about though, is that this nowhere near as dangerous a situation as Chernobyl.  Radiation amounts are one thing, but you also need to consider delivery vectors when you are talking about danger to humans.  Up to this point the majority of the radiation released was in water leaking out of the reactor.  This is a relatively minor thing when you compare it to Chernobyl, where the pressure vessel exploded, exposing what may have still been a critical core to the atmosphere.

But it is true that the type of bribes you describe were endemic in the Brezhnev era, and in certain periods of Maoist China. These resulted from the Party *Nomenklatura* becoming a privileged caste and becoming obsessed with liberalization and productivism without any purpose.

And then members of the Nomenklatura and sivoliki (the Soviet military-industrial complex) went full-on traitor and restored (and profited greatly from) capitalism (ex-KGB and Party officials were transferred ownership of state corporations on no merit, just because the Harvard Gang sent by the U.S. to advise Yeltsin needed to build a formal capitalist ruling class, and now they are billionaires [Putin]).

However, my point still stands. The Paris Commune was crushed quite pathetically after surviving much less than a year. After the so-called ""socialists"" of Europe threw their weight behind their own countries during WWI it seemed like all hope was lost and there wouldn't be revolution for a century if not more, since each country's proletariat would be at each other's throats.

Now lets talk about the Dresden bombings themselves. 

In March 1945, the Nazi regime ordered its press to publish a death toll of 200,000 for the Dresden raids. Death toll estimates as high as 500,000 have been given.[6] An independent investigation commissioned by the city council in 2010 reported a maximum of 25,000 victims.[7]

The USAF report also states that two of Dresden's traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east-west along the central European uplands.[34] The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig.[34] Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that ""I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians.""[35]

He really doesn't bring much else to the table. Passing is horrible, at least Gibson has that long range shot. I think Gibson is being showcased to be sold in January, but the bastard played well. 
Evans always had a problem with big guys. Last year at Fulham as an example. I wonder if he let all the praise from his first season get to him. 

Towards the end of the game I was not too disappointed. Two games off our schedule. It is this stage that SAF starts playing first team players, so it wasn't going to be about the youth players anymore. Maybe if we had Cardif, but if we played against Liverpool or City, we would play with the first team.

Finally, the twins, as much as I love them, they're too fragile. You really can't rely on them. I saw you blaming the physio and others blame their style of play. Not sure I can blame physios, other players are not breaking down as often. I can't remember the last time they finished a game. Either they're injured or SAF wants height and brings in another player. 

Our roster sure looks think in midfield. Cleverley seems to fill that void when he plays, but surely we must have another player, maybe not as good that can still provide energetic and creative play. Carrick and Fletcher are very good, but that's not their role right now.

Lastly, and I hate to be so pessimistic, but maybe getting out of Europe won't be too bad either. We won't be able to beat the likes of Barca, Madrid or City in the CL.

Nu cred că suntem mai educați, mai frumoși, mai deștepți sau mai curați decât bucureștenii sau moldovenii. Dacă ai mai circulat prin țara asta sau dacă mai ai cunoștințe și prieteni și din alte zone decât din Transilvania, nu e greu să îți dai seama de asta.

There have been many revolutions that were charged by the populus that took out democratic forms of government and put in monarchy. The British did it, the Dutch did it, (democratic republics being most eurocentric, I can't think of a noneuropean example). 

When a system, democratic or not, has such a level of corruption, you change the power structure to get rid of it. All government types have pluses and minuses and nondemocratic ones do have some very good was of breaking up corportism even in a nonviolent manner.

Secondly, democracy is not a single type of government like you choose in a video game. There are MANY different ways to setup democratic power. (US Presidential elections being a prime example of complexity) While 'first past the post' is the current most used method, there are many others that might be tried to prevent corporate corruption.

I mean, come on, you can say a lot about the Chinese government, but they do have their shit under control.  This proves nothing either way.

China occupied the Uighurs.  It is a completely normal way of dealing with people living in a land you occupied and want for yourself to genocide them.  In Europe this was done for centuries (600-900 to be more precise) with peoples large and small; Julius Caesar genocided some tribes, women, infants, didn't matter, for giving his army bad press in Rome.  

China is de facto trying to destroy all signs of Tibet as a people by forced relocations, and for Uighurs probably as well.  Be Han or be gone is China's motto.  But no, I don't believe they attempt to genocide them.  Why should they if they can disperse them, or jail and beat and shoot them at will?  Genocide became uneconomic and the world tends to frown at you for it nowadays.  

Because it's not the organ harvesting and whether it happens or not which is the core of the problem.  It is rather that, when the Chinese authorities, local or federal, want a man dead, for whatever reason, they can easily see to it that he dies, completely legally, no matter what he did or did not.

I don't ignore what's been done, I admit a lot *has* been done. But I don't even feel like we're to the middle. The fact that we still have to have debates to treat gay people like regular citizens is the problem. I feel like we've gone up a hill pretty quickly, but now we're slowing down. 

No one is ""teaching"" me anything. I'm simply observing what's going on. I just see the US becoming more and more totalitarian every year and it makes me want to move to a free country. You can't deny the US is certainly closer to north korea practices than say over a decade ago. I really don't feel ""free"". I feel like this country has become an Orwellian novel. 

To be honest, I'm actually shocked that OWS is taking place. And yet, I still feel the outrage isn't enough. More people are outraged over a dead blond girl they never knew, rather than corporations literally buying politicians and laws to further their own interests. 

In 20 years, many of the older conservative people in this country will have died off. I know every generation says ""we will be the different generation"".

When kids are growing up with the internet, seeing both sides of the argument, conservatism loses. We've never had information accessible like this before. It's the old people who only watch fox news who continue to hold us back. 

edit: also a couple more things. 

The healthcare bill that was passed, disappointed most liberals like myself. And I really can't figure out why conservatives are mad about it. It didn't do hardly anything. I literally don't know what else you could do to make it a weaker bill. We need *reform* not a tiny bill that covers more people. 

Also, it seems europe and asia are the place to be now. US is on the way out. I really feel that way. Instead of trying to reform and fix out education system, they're talking about cutting it. We're doing nothing to fix our broken infrastructure. We have so much money in this country, and it just goes to waste. We talk and talk and talk about doing something every election, and nothing ever gets done. This country really hasn't made actual progress since FDR.

At least if your in Europe, the best to do this is write a curriculum vitae and a separate presentation of yourself.

Then apply to ALL! the workplaces you find. These days you need to look at job hunting like a full time job. I mean 8 hours a day of going around in person asking for work. Most employers will take your papers but never call so make sure to got a lot of copies. 

The first goal is to get a face to face with an actual manager. Sending application to an advertised position is a long shot. But if you show up at their door you usually get to speak to someone in charge. Then it's all up to you to leave an impression.

The US has its own interests in that region, mainly consisting of preventing terrorism and maintaining the oil supply. On top of that, there is the concern that Pakistan is too dangerous to be left alone.

It wasn't so long ago that there were dozens of training camps set up in Afghanistan by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda to train terrorists who launched attacks on the US, India, and several European countries. Afghanistan was, in effect, an entire country ruled by a fundamentalist Islam faction that was happy to do deals with various terrorist organizations across the world to provide them safe harbor. Osama bin Laden lived there and planned his attacks from there. Most of the 9/11 attackers, while Saudi citizens, visited those camps in Afghanistan, and some trained there.

This is the situation that Afghanistan will return to if we leave it entirely. It is in Pakistan's interests to promote the Taliban in Afghanistan, because they can control the Taliban and ensure that Afghanistan remains firmly in their hands. They have been doing it ever since there was a Taliban in Afghanistan, throughout these years of war, and will continue to do it when we are gone.

Pakistan is a dangerous country. There is widespread and massive corruption, a population that has been brought up in an atmosphere of incredible paranoia and conspiracy theories, with a tendency to turn the blame outwards to anyone else, whether the US or India, for all their internal problems. They have a huge army. And they are a nuclear state, with possibly 90-100 nuclear weapons. And they are increasing that nuclear stockpile faster than any other country on earth.

It is foolish to think that if you leave Pakistan alone, it will mind its business and everything will be fine. They were running a rogue network that sold nuclear materials and technology to North Korea and Libya. They will do such things again, repeatedly, if the scrutiny is lifted from them. They are still dirt poor and open to taking cash from Saudi Arabia or other rich countries that fund terrorism, in order to provide materials, training, and safe harbor within their country. They have a huge region in the west which is still largely run by tribal warlords and home to various terrorist organizations that operate out of there.

As North Korea periodically rattles their sabers and talks shit when they think the world isn't paying enough attention to them and they need another infusion of cash, so does Pakistan. They have lived on massive foreign aid, much of it from the US, but also indirectly from the west through the world bank and IMF. Only a fraction of this makes its way to the poor; the rest goes into mansions and Swiss bank accounts for the military and political elite. If Pakistan were just another country, who would pay them so much cash? It is essentially a bribe, and they have an interest in keeping it coming. For this purpose they do the same thing North Korea does - foment trouble which causes the west to take notice and bribe them some more.

I am very much against continuing this state of affairs. I also hate to see us in Afghanistan, or giving the Pakistanis more money and more weapons. But like it or not, this is to some degree a problem that we have brought upon ourselves, and now we are trapped in it. For decades, we supported Pakistan unquestioningly, because it was a useful proxy against the USSR in Afghanistan, or because we wanted to teach India a lesson for choosing to stay independent rather than joining the cold war on our side. These policies go back to Henry Kissinger, they are not new. Things are a mess, and I sure don't know how to fix them. But one thing I know - just going away and burying our heads in the sand won't make the problem go away. It will come back twice as bad to bite us in the ass.

In short, Afghanistan and Pakistan need a cure. This can't be a purely military cure, the problem is too bad for that now. The world needs to work together to slowly change the culture in those regions. To get people to live normal lives again, centered around the usual daily concerns of living rather than jihad. Countries like Saudi Arabia which fund Wahabism and promote proxy terror need to be stopped. Commerce and industry needs to be introduced, the standard of living raised so that young men aren't so susceptible to falling under the influence of jihadists. The status of women needs to be improved, they are one of the strongest bulwarks against random acts of war and violence.

Unfortunately, not only the US but most of the west is currently in the opposite mood. We have been burnt, and we are withdrawing into ourselves, isolating ourselves. We want these problems to go away. This is why there is such a strong anti-foreigner and specially anti-Muslim sentiment in a lot of western countries. People don't understand subtleties, they don't understand details, they just see a Muslim world that scares them and they want to draw back from it.

But none of these things will work. Problems like this don't go away if you refuse to look at them. You can't isolate yourself from the rest of the world forever. They need to be engaged. I am no strategist and I have a poor understanding of military matters. I cannot say if we need to stay in Afghanistan or if we should leave. Perhaps it might be better to get our military out of there and exert pressure to change on that region in other ways. Perhaps not. But I do know one thing, that Pakistan (and to a lesser extent Afghanistan) pose a long term problem for southeast Asia and for the west, that this problem must be dealt with somehow, and that simply disengaging entirely in the hopes that it goes away would be foolish.

Obviously, I would be surprised if there were any direct consequences, but it seems Rome's destiny was often shaped by the presence of absence of enemies at its borders (like following Varus' disaster in Germania).  As much as the near-east is not what people have in mind when thinking about the Roman empire, the area in general remained very important for the empire as a whole - Egypt's grain resources, etc.  I imagine there would have been periodical threats from Parthia at times, although if I recall correctly there was a period of inter-regnum between the Parthian and Sassanid empires, when I imagine Rome didn't have to worry about attacks coming from there.

As for Iran, I went there in 2004, and I'm a white girl (from Canada).  On the one hand, it is the country in the Middle-East I've felt the safest, people genuinely happy to have tourists around.  I also met Americans, and they shared similar feelings.  However, the entire time I was there (apart from 4-5 days in Tehran) I was with a tour guide and a driver from a travel agency (these are ridiculously cheap in Iran).

Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia or even Slovakia, Czech Republic ,...) is not as rich as the west. It changed a lot in the last 10 years (european union reached there), but as we are talking about recent past, I will stay in past. Average pay was far bellow the minimum wage in the USA for example.

That's fine. But what about software? You could go for free or cheaper software, but why when you can pirate it? So you will. You will pirate your windows (instead of paying half of your monthly income for it), you will pirate all your games, office, and so on.

That's a significant claim, and the fact that civilizations have historically tended to have supernatural beliefs doesn't itself mean it is innate. Murder happens in every civilization, but murder isn't innate in humans. You might counter with supernatural beliefs being much more widespread than murder, but look at a lot of Europe.

No. I simply said that certain factors make it incomparable to the incest scenario. You inferred all the rest on your own by either misreading my post or misinterpreting it. 

&gt;Multiculturalism. Cultural liberalism. There are plenty of ways in which a government or a people can express their ability to accept ideas which offend them. The United States was founded on the principle of multiculturalism: of a secular state which didn't choose one religion over the others, with free speech, freedom of congregation, relatively few sexual appropriateness laws, etc. And much Europe today still maintains a lot of this sense of openness, though the Islamic terrorist scare has reduced it significantly. People can do this.

People can do it, but you can't rush it. So far, the US has yet to wind up with any cultural minority that actually favored incest, so until that time comes it's likely to remain unpopular and illegal. Again, even the freest of countries have their limits, and no matter where you are law still reflects the common consciousness of the people. That is culture, culture *is* a tyranny of the masses, and culture manifests itself in law. You may not agree with it, but that's sociology for you.

&gt;I'm not asking you to disregard social customs, I'm asking you to disregard social condemnation. I'm okay with you not being willing to consider the possibility of banging your sister. I truly am. I'm just trying to get you to accept the possibility that others might want to without warranting jail time or forced sexual re-education.

I don't think people should go to jail for it, or be forced any kind of re-education. I do think they should *opt* for that re-education though, because they would be doing themselves a favor.

&gt;So would you approve of an incestuous couple? Of interfamilial marriage? Would you support legislation which legalised it? Would you defend its legality in front of your peers, or at least anonymous internet folk? Could you accept people in an incestuous relationship as your friends?

Most incestuous couples I don't approve of. If they were to be one that took ultimate precautions regarding pregnancy, didn't cheat on each other or on their partners with each other (almost all of them seem to do that), and somehow managed to not hurt their family in the process, then I would say sure, do what you want (though I would still be pretty grossed out about it, there's no way around it). Unless they manage to fulfill these conditions, I wouldn't approve of the idea. They rarely do.

Would I defend its legality? I don't know. It's a gray area for me. I don't like the thought of it being allowed because of the complications regarding pregnancy (and because I would never support the forced sterilization of anybody), but I can't think of any reasonable way to enforce it.

About interfamilial marriage, depends on what you mean. I'm okay with people marrying their cousins, but siblings, no.

http://www.science20.com/curious_cub/fukushima_radiation_california-81727

Based on a study done in San Diego CA.

Here are various radiation levels and how common they are and their associated risks.

2 mSv/yr (millisieverts per year)	Typical background radiation experienced by everyone (average 1.5 mSv in Australia, 3 mSv in North America)    
9 mSv/y  Exposure by airline crew flying New York-Tokyo polar route     
20 mSv/yr	Current limit (averaged) for nuclear industry employees     
50 mSv/yr	Former routine limit for nuclear industry employees. It is also the dose rate which arises from natural background levels in several places in Iran, India and Europe       
100 mSv/yr	Lowest level at which any increase in cancer is clearly evident.       
350 mSv/lifetime	Criterion for relocating people after Chernobyl accident       
1,000 mSv single dose	Causes (temporary) radiation sickness such as nausea and decreased white blood cell count, but not death. Above this, severity of illness increases with dose      
5,000 mSv single dose	Would kill about half those receiving it within a month      



this http://www.wealthwire.com/news/global/1697 website states that the avg amount of radioactive sulfur in the atmosphere in San Diego is 950 atoms per cubic meter of air, now this is not the only way we receive radiation so it is does not contribute anywhere close to the 2 millisieverts per year of radiation that your average person experiences, but lets say it does. 

The measured amount of sulfur  in the atmosphere is 1501 atoms per cubic meter. That is an increase of 63% yielding a total of 3.26 millisieverts a year, which is equivalent increase of half the radiation of one mammogram a year per person, which is essentially nothing.",t1_c34e94o,geeeoooort,,,1,True,t3_mw130

Right now the Service Sector of Spain makes up for 70% of the GDP.  You have to have a balance.  Spains industry is only 14% as opposed to Germany's 30%.  As we all know Germany is top dog in the EU, and is probably going to end up owning the rest of the EU if things keep going the way they are.

I totally agree with what you want to see - visionary coaches, European model, etc. I also know that the club agrees. When Frank Arnesen was with us, he brought in Ricardo Moniz as a ""skills coach"" - Moniz uses the Coerver Method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiel_Coerver) and was, I gather, seen as totally inspirational at Spurs. 

I interviewed our Academy Director, John McDermott, for the COYS forum two years ago, and he said that Moniz had a massive influence on the players and, arguably more importantly, the coaches. He has since moved on, but the coaches now teach some of his methods to our youngest kids. Obviously it takes time for this to trickle down, but the players coming through now have had some of this coaching and, as a result, are excellent technically and consistently more capable of playing tiki-taka than previous cohorts.

I even think that we have Moniz to thank for players like Mason, Pritchard and Carroll - all excellent technicians.

Re: Bostock... I've never been his greatest fan. I think he's a good player in some ways (he strikes it well, he's strong/athletic), but always doubted his awareness of others/team play.

I'm not sure why Volcano is taking their sweet time selling them in the US, but from what I understand, the manufacturing all happens in the same place. So when Volcano does get them, you'll be getting the same batches we all have.

In my case, I got the one with the color buttons. I'm sure the paint will come off eventually but I don't really care. In later versions, they just stopped painting the buttons. As far as the vent holes go, it's a hit or miss. Seems the bottom caps are on a their own assembly line, so you could wind up with a black button unit (""newer model"") and still not have a vent hole. Alternatively, you could wind up with a color button model that has a vent hole, which was the case with mine.

Mine also has the slightly crooked 510 connector on it.

The U.S isn't just an easy target, it is directly responsible for many of the world's common woes.

Vast wealth inequality globally, and even within the western nation's themselves. Some starve whilst others gorge on gourmet meals. It is unacceptable, and this globalist consumerism and greed is ultimately perpetuated by the United States of America. 

This is an undeniable fact. Britain has been a key player, making MANY wrong turns and helping to prop up dictators, but Britain isn't the one throwing it's weight around the world with secret police supporting military coups.

By now, many of us will agree that we need to change our way of thinking about that.

I live in a small town where people without high education, if lucky, can work for around 120$ / month in a workshop or grocery store. Major population of young people (20-30 years) is still living with parents. Many of my friends, with high education, are unemployed. We get donations from European union, but in my opinion are spent wrongly, to beautify our cities instead of investing into economy.

Our organization of state is old, with non-modern ways of approving papers (example if you need to get an approval of building a residential building, you need to hang around state institutions around 3-6 months to get needed papers just to start building).

Our oil prices are very high, because it is the most sure way of funding our government (no great tax income from companies, all are weak). Our road fare taxes (not sure how you call this, tax you pay to travel using major roads...) are among highest in region. Tobacco, alchohol are at low prices because they are an industry of vice. Bread and basic supplies are relatively low, but milk is expensive - all milk industries are bought by a single owner).

Communication services are expensive. For about 20$ you get about 1mb/s rate of download. Mobile companies are holding together and are forming so called ""trust"" or false sense of competition, where all of them are offering same service for same amount of money.

Most rich men, excepting the most rich. Are without school, who used gray times in the past to get rich and now are exploiting workers for a petty pay.

The government is basically blackmailed by hooligans and extremist organizations, not to do as it wish, and if it will to behave and suppress any kind of extremist behavior they threaten to cause major havoc around cities. Not sure how much real power they are holding.

I guess that sums it up, I for sure left a lot to say... but there is a lot of things to describe... Maybe I said something harsh but I'm sorry if I said something offending or ignorant... This comment is just to small for all things...",t1_c34ewdq,trileletri,,,2,True,t3_mwfct

Come beginning of 2011, precisely march 4th, I start coughing randomly, out of the blue. I deside to give it some time, but after 2 days, it doesnt seem to go away. I head over to the doctor, he says its probably bronchitis, and puts me on antibiotics. I stay at home for a few days whilst taking the antibiotics. Nothing happens, coughing increases in cough per minute (cpm). I go back to the doctor, he says he's baffled and puts me on some other medicine. A week later, that doesnt help either. I go to the doctor again and he basically doesnt know what the fuck he should do, so he sends me to an ashtma specialist. I have rather bad asthma any ways so I already know the guy. When I tell him the happenings of the past 2-3 weeks, he basically also was baffled and gave me that ""WTF?"" look. He puts me on a high dosage inhaler and some other pills that I cant remember the function of. At this point I was coughing until about 5 AM in the morning, so I basically slept for 5 hours and then coughed the rest of the day. It was horrible. That medication did not work, so I go back to the doctor, he gives me the same ""WTF"" look, and gives me some more medication. Remember this is about 4.5 WEEKS into this drama. It was only getting worse. Those meds end up not working either, and the coughing just got worse. The asthma doctor now thought that I had something wrong with me that had nothing to do with my lungs. I get blood taken and have various scans done. They still cannot find ANYTHING. The asthma doctor says he is out of ideas and sends me to another asthma/allergies specialist. She does not know what to do either so she gives me a fungi based inhaler (not as horrible as that sounds). That doesnt work, it just makes the coughing worse. I go back to her and report that the fungi hasnt worked. She asks when the last time I had an allergy test was, I say 2007 ish. She asks me to have that renewed. A few coughing sleepless nights later, I get the test done. As I am in the waiting room, I see one gigantic bump from number 18 or so on the test. THe doctor looks at my arm and says, ""Well, opoipo, you are extremely allergic to birch tree pollen, there is a high concentration of that stuff floating around now."" At this point, my only thought is ""WHy the FUCK did someone not think of that earlier."" I go back to the first doctor I ever visisted for this and he says ""Go to the ocean"" (btw I live in europe). So 2 days later, I catch a flight to Portugal and stay there a few nights. I feel perfect, like I could run for hours. I catch a flight back to my hometown, and the minute that I step out of the airport the coughing starts again. That was one of the most depressing moments of my life. A few sleepless weeks pass and I catch a flight to America to visit relatives for Easter. I feel almost perfect there with minimal coughing. Was very, very fun. I take a flight back to Europe a week later and the coughing starts the fucking minute that I get out of the plane. At this point my lungs were horribly aching from everything, so it was almost unbearable. 4 days later I take a flight to California and stay there with relatives for a total of 6.5 weeks. THe coughing basically stopped there and I was able to actually go on with my life. I was a happy, burrito eating son of a bitch. All goes fantastic, and I fly home, 6.5 weeks later. I step out of the airport, taking a breath of fresh air. I do not cough. I have never and will never be as relieved as I felt that day. I was free, the chains removed from my body. I could be part of normal society again. I was the happiest non burrito eating son of a bitch ever to exist. All in all the whole catastrophe took about 4.5-5 months to settle completely. 

As of 3 days ago from today, I have started coughing again. I hope to god that I do not have to go through what I went through earlier this year again. Only time can tell now. Yesterday I coughed horribly until 2 AM in the morning. I really really want to not have to do this again.

**EDIT:** I coughed until 3AM last night, I'm really really afraid of this whole thing happening again

**EDIT** Just bought it, count me out of the competition

SO there it is, the weirdest time of my life, ever. 4.5 months of asthma and allergy hell, that moved me to 2 different countries for more than a month. I fear this cycle may be starting again.

That causes hyperinflation.  Your money can become worthless very fast if you do that.  Which is my point.  If your deficit spending immediately causes inflation, that is a check against rampant deficit spending.  Using loans allows them to borrow all they want with no immediate negative effect.  So after 10 years of lending, if the system falls apart, all that deficit spending hits the economy at once and royally fucks stuff up.

&gt;Related question, someone must have printed money in order to lend it to the Europeans anyways right?

Not really.  Since a bank still cannot spend more money than it has.  And if a loan fails, the bank has to use it's profit from other loans to back the accounts the money was from.

The reserve rate does have an effect on the money supply, and the government controls the reserve rate.  The reserve rate is the amount of money the bank has to keep internally and cannot loan out.

Basically a dollar can be loaned out X times before it is used up.  But this type of inflation is already built into the system and accounted for in the price of money.

They need to have a certain number of dollars on hand in order to be allowed to continue to hold such assets (ie, they need liquidity).  In a typical market, they would get this liquidity overnight through a repurchase agreement (""repo"") where they sell some of the assets (usually U.S. Treasury bills, or ""treasuries"") to a bank with excess liquidity and agree to repurchase them the following morning for slightly more.  In this untypical market, nobody has liquidity (or those that do are not willing to provide it to those that don't).  The central banks (the Fed in the U.S., ECB in Europe) can provide the liquidity themselves.  This carries a stigma to it (as it indicates that nobody else will lend) and is usually quite expensive.  They've just cut the rate for doing so which enables many to look past the stigma.

The effect we saw yesterday was that the increased liquidity meant that the banks could lend more (they no longer needed to hoard cash in fear that they wouldn't meet their overnight position requirements).

I travel between Europe and the US 10 months a year and I've met four kinds of jazz musicians. Be them young or old they seem to fall into this personal categorization I've come up with:

1) The robots: like the guy in the video, no explanation needed.

2) The ""Jazz Nazies"" (predominantly in the US): where if you say something bad about Monk you'll get decapitated, and their playing is nothing but Lego-bricks solo building. Nothing personal to say about the tune they're playing. Not the same kind of robots as no.1 but close enough.

3) The ""I wanna be like the USA cats"" (mostly Europeans): who instead of masterfully inserting their own culture into the music they're playing, they pretty much just want to sound like Metheny, Mehldau and Chris Potter.

4) The ""I'll just play whatever I want"" - double-edged kind of musicians, where ""free"" jazz is almost king, whilst renouncing harmony, time, dynamics and just playing whatever they want (usually performed by not very skilled musicians). A small portion of the guys in this category actually play music from the heart and soul.

So the problem is that jazz players today fall mostly in the first 3 categories. There are far too few people of the second part of the 4th category around.

People who innovate and make music that reflects their own generation and society and time. (Pretty much what the old school cats did anyways).

I'm personally sick, in 2011, of listening to the same black-and-white Basie's One o' Clock jump to say that I'm listening to Jazz.

I also know how losing  pints of blood from a hole in your leg feels. When your brain still works but the eyes can't see from lack of oxygenation. 

Perhaps since we are on this morbid subject there's also research on what happens if you instantly decapitate a person. How long does the brain stay conscious.

It's possible the human brain can stay conscious for minutes after, since fainting is not immediate from lack of blood supply ( the articles claim 15-20 seconds), and it takes about 5 minutes for the brain to start dying from lack of blood.

On the water, especially inland navigation. There is much less hostility and much more teamwork. People work with each  other so everyone can go where they need to go. They communicate with each other on radios and decide what is the best way to go about dealing with a situation when one arrives. 

Last week I was navigating out of a harbor and onto a busy river. But  the mist was so thick I couldn't even see the front of the ship (It's only 60 meters). So I radio'd I was coming out of the harbor and wondered if there was any incoming traffic. And instantly people were reporting in, deciding who should wait for who without any arguing at all. 
Everyone just wants to go from point a to b as fast and as safe as possible. When everyone thinks rational there shouldn't be any arguments since everyone has the same goal. 

Compare this to the aggressive driving you see in most urban environments and you can see why people are more happy with each other on the water. 


Of course there are exceptions, I've heard a couple of arguments on the radio. Pretty funny, reminds me of Xbox Live.

It is difficult to overstate the level of disruption that Europeans had on the native cultures. Many tribes changed their entire way of life, their home land, their organization... During the period of the Indian Wars after the Civil War many of the tribes had strong central leaders, but this was mostly based on charisma and need rather than on a cultural norm. People like Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, Black Elk, and ~~Hawthorne Wodziwob~~ Wovoka all became important leaders of their respective peoples in the nineteenth century and could rightly be called ""Chiefs"". 

That being said, these late developments were most defintly in response to pressure from white settlers, were generally based on the natural leadership ability of those men (rather than a choice by the community) and did not necessarily represent the historical practice of the tribe.

Not exactly, both Arabs and Jews are defined by culture. Language is one aspect, and one that the Jews share as well, but it's not the only one.

&gt;First, van der Wiel's knee did in fact make slight contact with Iniesta's back leg.

How did I formulate my link? Iniesta made a meal out of it and was unsportsmanlike to say the least. 

&gt;Yes, Iniesta made it seem worse than it was, but truly it's no different from Torres' so-called ""dive"" against Chile.

Here you use yourself a method you later label as irrelevant when I bring up other incidents that didn't play a role in the final to make a point. Make up your mind please, if it is appropriate or not to go that way.   

&gt;If you watch that video, you'll also notice that van der Wiel voices no dissent when Webb issues the card. Clearly, the behavior of a man who's been wronged.

Webb was on a trip and would have giving another yellow for protesting. Webb was totally out of control and after the final a didn't refereed EPL games for a period as he was not himself anymore. The corner that should have been given to Holland being the most clear example. If you miss that you have lost the plot. Van der Wiel was very professional, the captain van Bommel did protest and the game moved on. Another example of great Dutch sportsmanship. 

&gt;You don't think that Iniesta would've kept going if he felt that he could've gotten on the end of that pass?

I think he knew he wouldn't make it and that with one man down they had a better change of winning. I have seen Iniesta do this more. He is no stranger to flopping. 

&gt;It doesn't make any sense to accept a free kick outside the box and a Dutch red card instead of a potential game-winning chance on goal.

That's right. We see the video. You can click on it again. No person would have fallen down from that light touch. He made a meal out of it and disgraced the game just as much people like to blame on the Dutch.

&gt;Heitinga knew the danger of Iniesta's run and held him to slow him down just enough for Stekelenburg to come out and collect the ball. The amount of contact or force involved is irrelevant, as it is a tactical foul.

Yeah this is cynical. We now see guys like Suarez also doing this in EPL. Making a meal out of everything. Going to the ground whenever there is an opportunity to benefit from. It's a cancer for football but there will always be people that defend it. Not me. Heitinga barely touched him and actually let loose before Iniesta could experience any resistance. Iniesta felt a hand and thought BINGO. Cheap, football destroying tactics as much as the Dutch anti football. This is how I like football to be played:

[Lens could have get the keeper red but keeps on going and scores magnificent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dyHMsCxPFs) 

But I don't have to give this example. We can just look at what Robben did and kept his feet. That's the difference. 

&gt;As for your final two points, these are issues with the officiating, not Spain. Yes, they both were incorrect calls, but what does that have to do with your criticism of the Spanish team?

Dude they where defining. If the free kick was given we would have made it to penalty's. We were with 10 men and Spain was quickly to attack and benefited from that moment. The free kick illustrates how Webb had lost the plot. Everything went Spain's way. Netherlands didn't even get a damn corner anymore. 

&gt;It just strikes me as sour grapes.

How so? Somebody posts a video of the Netherlands but somebody just can't resist to start again about the final. Didn't we played 14 games to get there? Didn't we played 8 qualification games and 6 WC matches that we ALL WON. Is it too much to ask to have some respect for that too? 14 straight competitive games won is a record by the way held only by France, Netherlands and just recently Spain. If Spain win their first group game on the Euro 2012 they are on 15. However it's a (European or world, don't know) record that deserves some respect.

&gt;Again, a poor call but, nonetheless, irrelevant to the discussion. But calling it a ""crime against the Netherlands?"" Please. He merely tried to pull a bicycle kick and didn't take into account de Zeeuw's position. It certainly should've been a red, but I doubt that anyone thought it was malicious.

Don't trip over my terminology. It is how I felt de Jong was put down after his action vs Alonso. Fact is Alonso stood up, played further. De Zeeuw was kicked into the hospital and the guy did not even receive a card for it. This only got a fraction of the attention (while a half final), yet de Jong is always brought up again. Did you remember this Uruguay foul on the Netherlands? I don't think you did and that's my point. Also when Uruguay is payed some respect on this forum, or how they managed to win recently in a friendly I don't bring it up over and over again, like many people like to bring up de Jong. 

&gt;Melo was rightfully reamed by everyone on here. No one tried to defend it, and pretty much everyone agreed that it was ridiculously stupid and childish. Regardless, it still has no relevancy to the Spanish team and their conduct in the Final.

Yes it does. This video was about the Dutch campaign. We have talked about the final endlessly and how wrong the behavior was. You address the Melo action with that it was discussed, but that only got a fraction of the negative attention the Dutch received for their final. I think the Dutch used anti football methods, but that doesn't mean Spain didn't make a meal out of any form of contact.

&gt;Yes, but 1 was for Iniesta removing his jersey after the goal, and the other was for Xavi delaying the game near the end of extra time. Hardly comparable to the 8 yellows that were issued for Netherlands, 7 of which (I believe) were awarded for poor tackles.

The vd Wiel yellow was no yellow. Van Bronckhorst yellow was harsh. Webb was on a role to penalize everything with yellow at a certain moment and was so pro Spain at the end that he didn't saw the corner and the clear free kick that cost us the game. Also delaying tactics is just as unsportsmanlike as we only had minutes to equalize and get to penalty's. Puyol should have an extra yellow but thanks to Robben he didn't so then it would be 6 for Spain and also their left back should have had another yellow. De Jong should have had a red card by the way. Intent or not, it was wrong. 

However many people miss this point:

&gt;World Cup winners Spain and their opponents Netherlands have been fined by Fifa for their players' poor discipline in July's final. Football's governing body fined the Dutch federation £9,080, while the Spanish association must pay £6,053.

Both federations have received a fine, while I feel like all blame is put on the Dutch. 

&gt;Clearly, we should take his word for it. This coming from the man who's also responsible for breaking the legs of both Stuart Holden and Hatem Ben Arfa. Regardless of whether or not we believe him, who the hell goes up for a ball with the spikes up? If he truly didn't see Xabi Alonso, then why is he trying to spike away a ball with the sole of his foot? I'm sorry, but nobody who's played the game can reasonably say that he was going for the ball (which honestly doesn't matter anyway according to the Laws).

You cut my sentence off. Quote my whole piece. I clearly stated that after another incident the Dutch took matters in own hand and put him to shame in public. So van Marwijk did not take it any longer also. De Jong is a hard player, van Marwijk was done with it and he wasn't called up for a period of time. One thing though. He wasn't that at Ajax. When he started playing in DM and especially in the EPL where the public starts to clap as hard as they can when a player throws in another tackle, demonstrating toughness and masculinity he started to behave like a tough guy instead of a technical player. In the Netherlands we clap for vision, technique and beautiful passes. At Ajax the focus is on technique and I have seen him also give beautiful passes at that club. Then they come back to the Dutch NT and we are frowned upon yet we don't carry his education and development anymore in Eredivisie. That also pisses me off. I am sure that his tendency to hard play would have been softened when he would have stayed at Ajax and played in Eredivisie. Maybe he would even have been quite a nice player to look at football wise.     

&gt;You're absolutely right. The Dutch played some very good ball throughout the tournament. van Bronckhorst's strike against Uruguay was one of my favorite goals of the tournament. However, to deny that the Dutch played rather disgracefully in the Final is ridiculous.

Where did I deny that? My post was to point out that two incidents were treated unjustly and cost is the game and that Spain`on their turn did made a meal out of many situation. You can focus on physical game play, but Robben kept his feet and didn't screw Puyol with a red card like Iniesta did to Heitinga. Screwing others over is disgraceful too. Why is this never highlighted by anyone? FIFA fined both Holland AND Spain. Why are they portrait as saints? After the WC it was a one sided Holland bashing, while nothing of the other 14 games was ever said again. I saw this video as a attempt to finally put that to the front also. Yet there are the sore remarks about the final again.

Do you think muslims, or anyone for that matter, waits for national census results before action?


**Dearborn, MI, USA** has 33% of its population Arab. Let's be **really** fucking generous and say that only half of them are muslims. 

According to your *'plausible'* scal-o-meter that means we should see:

&gt;When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. 

Nope.

Let's go to europe. Bradford is 26% Asian, of which I'd say is about 20% pakistani, which we can take as Muslim. What do we gleam from this?

&gt;After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, 

Now bradford isn't personally where I'd go for a walk, and there is a lot of feral asian youth (and white too) there. That said, sporadic killings, burnings of churches, all that stuff? Not so much. 

It's complete bollocks. Without doubt, many countries with a higher muslim population are more oppressive, but that's because of culture and, yes, a certain type of islam. Indonesia has more muslims than any other country, and while I wouldn't want to live there, it isn't ** oppressively** bad.

It is the very ability of printing money that gives fed its power. The ability to print when needed keeps fed as the loandesk of choice for the whole world. The benefit of that to America is immense. Beyond 
imagination. Now if some politician makes a back room deal to borrow
a few billion dollars for country x for favor b. It can be done. If Fed did not have that power.. Well. The country b would have no reason to deal with America in the first place.

Non-fiction books I've read in the last few years that I would recommend (I have a left-leaning political stance, so I'm not sure if these would appeal to you):

- The Dark Side (incredible book examining the steps the Bush White House took during the post-9/11 era to make legal grounds for rendition, Guantanamo, etc. and the role Cheney's office played in it)

- Too Big to Fail (regarding the financial crisis).  Also All the Devils Are Here - another good one.  The Big Short is a simpler but good read about the same.

- Game Change (covering the Obama, Clinton, McCain, Palin and Edwards camps in 2008)

- The Forever War - which is one of the most depressing but interesting reads of an embedded journalist following troops in Afghanistan.  If you're into that, there's The Good Soldiers following troops in Iraq.



On a lighter note:

- Heat - which is a great book following life in restaurants.  A New Yorker writer decided to drop his job and take a job as a line cook in one of Mario Batali's restaurants.  He ends up in Italy learning how to make pasta, taking on an apprenticeship with a world famous Italian butcher, and you get a great inside glimpse of life in the kitchen.

- The Secret Life of Lobsters - ever wonder how lobsters have sex?  This book follows life among the lobstering community and examines the life of lobsters, lobster fishermen in Maine, and regulations put on the industry.

- The Lost City of Z - follows the exploits of an early-20th century explorer in the Amazon who disappeared searching for a lost city, and the writer's attempts to follow his tracks.

- Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning - if you're a baseball fan and/or from the NYC area this one is for you.  It follows the 1977 Yankees season (after signing Reggie Jackson) against the backdrop of late-70s NYC in recession.

- Operation Mincemeat - fascinating story of a secret operation during WWII made by the British to deceive the Germans of the Allies' plans to invade Europe from Africa.  Really good stuff.

- Plain, Honest Men - examines the constitutional convention and especially the role that different states played in being for or against the Constitution we have today, and the role that individuals (both those that would become future Presidents as well as members of the convention forgotten to history) played.


And then you have books like Freakonomics.....or anything by David McCullough (like 1776) or Stephen Ambrose (like Band of Brothers) or Malcolm Gladwell (like The Tipping Point or Blink).

Oh!  One more!

- Unbroken.  Following the incredible life of a man named Louis Zamperini.  You cannot put this one down.  I don't know anyone who doesn't rave about this book.  It's written by the same author who wrote Seabiscuit (I think).

Firstly the Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have been firebombed during the lead up to a ground invasion of Japan(and if the Japanese surrendered without the 100% proof that they were in an unwinnable war by witnessing the complete destruction of two cities in an instant many military leaders were preparing a coupe already). I should not need to explain further about how much worse a ground invasion of Japan would have been for all sides as this fact is completely established. Secondly Nuclear Warheads placed a freeze on tensions between the two most powerful countries in the world essentially making a war between them too costly for either side and unwinnable. The Soviet Union was in a place at the end of WW2 where they could have marched west to Portugal with far less resistance then they had faced for the rest of WW2. The Germans put the vast majority of their army on the eastern front and the troops the US, UK, and Canada had in Europe(which remained true for the entire Cold War, nuclear warfare is what protected western Europe from the USSR. The UK had naval and air power over the Soviet Union so it would have likely survived but only after a potentially longer second Battle of Britain. Without nukes continental Europe would have fallen to the USSR) would have been grossly outnumbered. We also needed Japan to surrender before the USSR spun up its war machine in invading Japan to avoid splitting it in the middle like we had just done to Germany(they had just finally gotten around to declaring war on Japan). Also EVERYTHING about WW2 had told us that the Japanese military was not one to surrender a fight they knew they would lose so our only hope was unimaginable force. The increased military funding for nuclear research also lead to huge leaps in our understanding atomic physics and the practical applications of them. Also modern space exploration is heavily dependent on an unintended bi-product of nuclear weapon creation.

Even counting WW1 and WW2 the 20th century was the most peaceful century in human history(ironic considering it had the two most violent wars) as far as percentage of humanity who died in war and you can thank nuclear warheads for that.

* Mixed economies are where some aggregate inputs and industries are managed or regulated by the government (supply of money, natural monopolies, production that generates large positive and negative externalities, incentives for and against production that generates positive and negative externalities) while letting the price system manage the rest. This is where the West generally landed.

* State centrally-planned economies are where the price system is theoretically eliminated and all production targets are centrally determined. FDR threw pretty much every idea against the wall during the 30s, short of massive government spending sufficient to fill the shortfall, but the command-economy ideas he tried failed miserably. The ideas of social insurance, infrastructure building, etc., worked well enough and stuck, but they all make large use of the price system.

Europe has a long history with science and engineering and particularly physics. After World War 2 a lot of European scientists left Europe because there was no point sticking around and landed in the US. Those European scientists were leaders in their field and often a lot more intelligent than their American counterparts as well. Einstein and Tesla are just the well known ones, the contributions made by British scientists to Henry Ford's Le Mans winning car and to Project Manhattan are well documented.

Furthermore as Europe was recovering from World War 2 a lot of money was thrown at engineering and science. Engineering feats undertaken in Europe were huge and they resulted in France developing a high speed rail network system while Germany came back from devastation of its country and economy to become a power in the automotive industry once again.

Nowadays Europeans are spending more on science than ever. The Large Hadron Collider is just one of a number of projects. In the US in the 80's they had the idea for ""Superconducting Super Collider"" which was an enormous project and incredibly advanced. It was only because the funding for that project was pulled that the Large Hadron Collider came into existence. America and American physicists got fucked by congress and then the Europeans put their heads together to build the LHC.

To say science is somehow disrespected in Europe is puzzling when the funding for science is growing rapidly and Europe constantly sets targets for itself and has on tap some of the biggest and most complex machines ever built.

Aside from building the LHC the European Space Agency has also built the worlds biggest telescope and recently announced record funding for future science projects and ambitious targets.

You make it sound like science is dead in Europe while this is probably a better time than ever for European science. While it is bad to suggest a nation the size of the US is full of anti-science people it is worth noting that things like teaching evolution are still issues in the US and funding for something like the Large Hadron Collider would never pass the Senate.

I think Europe has done admirably in both engineering and science and if it can keep up the pace then some of the best trains, cars and scientific projects will be coming out of the EU.

You're making assumptions about what I'm suggesting, which is leading you to falsely assuming I'm missing your point.

That what socialism purports as the ideal and what Cuba has are different, is no surprise. When socialists try to create a nation, they create authoritarian ones, as they claim the intermediary step is a statist one. That you defend Cuba's horrible living conditions shows that you still have loyalty to the authoritarian brand of socialist ideology, as manifested in statist nations, and favor it over market-based nations.

&gt;Thus, the significance of my identifying myself to you as an anarchist was to demonstrate the obviously conflicted feelings I have of Cuba, both theoretically in how it is structured, and practically in how I have experienced it myself. 

I never suggested you don't have conflicted feelings about it, only that you have socialist leanings, because you do.

&gt;A.&gt; The UN is a far more ""impartial"" source than the CIA.

I strongly disagree. The UN is a more political organization with more ideological objectives. The CIA is a fact-finding (and other functions) organization that while carrying out the objectives of ideologically minded politicians in intelligence operations, is impartial in its fact-finding mission. 

Its profiling of nations is not part of a propaganda effort, it's part of its mission to better understand the world so that it can more effectively carry out intelligence operations.

The CIA also has a much larger budget than the UN.

And monthly wages are now $30 a month, while people are afforded next to zero economic or political liberty.

The world has seen improving literacy, health care, life span, etc statistics since 1950s. What the whole world hasn't seen is per capita GDP that has failed to improve since the 1950s.

In any case I don't trust the HDI statistics coming out of Cuba, for the reasons I mentioned before.

&gt;C. I can't find any sources stating that Cuba was ""the leading economy in Latin America,"" 

You're right, it was among the leading economies of Latin America, I don't think it was at the very top.

Look where Cuba went wrong, socialist morons lobbying against the market economy:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba#Early_20th_century

&gt;Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[51][60] Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[51] The middle class, which was comparable to the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with the unemployment. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.[49][51]

Like usual, the anti-business people killed the source of prosperity, because of a lack of understanding of how wages and the standard of living rise.

&gt;...As opposed to Haiti, and other market-based economies, where people are far worse off? 

Haiti was EXTREMELY poor in the 1950s, and since then, it has had a completely incompetent government that has not instituted a ""market economy"". Rampant violence, contracts that are not enforced, and officials that demand huge bribes, are all the opposite of what defines a market economy.

&gt; You're comparing a tiny island nation under economic embargo to the wealthy minority of countries that comprise the First World.

Cuba's size is not a disadvantage when it comes to growing its per capita GDP. Cuba is also only embargoed by the US. It can trade with Canada, Europe, Russia and China. If its form of economic organization was even mildly effective, it would have significantly increased its wages since the 1950s.",t1_c34gczz,Toava,,,1,True,t3_mw7gv

A friend of mine was in a similar situation once. He told his brother that some kids in school harass him - this only stopped when the older brother drove to the home of one of the bullies and confronted him and told him to stop this kind of shithead behaviour. It worked.

I myself have tried not to be violent for most of my almost 30 years now, but I'm beginning to question if this really is the best approach one can have. There are people that simply don't give a shit about you and simply want to dump their inner mess onto someone outside to feel better. Take a rock and hit one of them on the head, take a iron pipe and beat it into one of the bully's balls as hard as you can. Take all the anger and frustration that you feel inside you in this situation and direct it against these assholes. Rip one of their earlaps apart or kick the knee of one of them repeatedly as hard as you can. Grab a glass bottle and throw it at their heads or try to grab and twist their fingers when they hit you. Bite their finger as hard as you can, don't stop until it's bleeding and he is screaming in pain. The screaming part is especially powerful because it signals the others that you are serious. 

They have to sense that you are a threat to them, and I'm not speaking of a hypothetical threat (school board, police) - they have to sense it, they have to see it with their own eyes, they have to understand that you are a potential threat to them. 

You are fooling yourself by trying to convince yourself that you are the samaritan that  is standing on a higher moral ground by renouncing violence. By doing that, you allow them to be violent against yourself. By renouncing violence, you are causing yourself to get hurt, making violence possible in the first place. That's not the smartest thing to do, and from what you've written you begin to realise that. This behaviour destroys you and kills you from the inside. 

Stand up for yourself. [Take this advice and adapt it to your situation (esp. the part starting at 3:20).](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf67tlAtiRY) There are other forms of self defence that are not as reliant on physical strength, for example pepper spray, which should be legal for self defence purposes in EU.

If you are going to mexico city, Teotihuacan is obligatory. Most impressive piramids around.
[Teotihuacan](http://i.imgur.com/sAaHP.png)

Some great places to visit are the [Historic center](http://i.imgur.com/5GiYd.jpg) great if you like culture and history.

[Condesa](http://i.imgur.com/Wc4C2.png) and roma. Great bohemian colony full of ""hip"" young people and awesome bars and nightclubs


[Coyoacán](http://www.metroscubicos.com/imgM3/guias/foto_coyoacan3.jpg) Similar to Condesa but it has left wing young people instead of hipsters and some nice bars

 Reforma [avenue](http://www.richard-seaman.com/Wallpaper/Travel/Mexico/PaseoDeLaReforma.jpg) Most beautiful avenue in mexico city. Has some nice bars and places around too.

The turibus can take you to most of this places for 120 pesos or 200 in weekends (about $15 dollars).

Mexico city is the city with the highest number of museums in the world, some extremely interesting like the [Antropology musem](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/1x8608068/aztec_calendar_museo_nacional_de_antropologia_k89-820679.jpg) musem.

Polanco is the most bussines center (and most expensive) in the city. Around Parque Lincoln [Parque Lincoln](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunnij/3844464996/) there are some great restaurants with the best expensive food in the city and in [Presidente Masarik](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Avenida_Masaryk.jpg) there are some great bars (expensive too)

Universitary city ([Ciudad Universitaria](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/UNAM_Ciudad_Universitaria.jpg/800px-UNAM_Ciudad_Universitaria.jpg) Is the biggest university campus in mexico, it has about 200,000 students and it is considered a World Heritage Site.

Another great place to visit is [Xochimilco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trajinera.JPG) but it is enjoyed a lot more when visited with friends. Specially to take a trajinera (the boats) and drink inside them.

I have been to various countries around Europe and the best world food I have tasted (and at the best price) has been in mexico city since it holds various of the best restaurants in the world and with a great service and price. Mexican food recommended is Tacos al pastor and Pozole between others but other recommendations are depending on your taste. Answer me and I will recommend some restaturants and places.

Mexico city is safer than Los Angeles, you just need to be smart enough not to show off your money in shady areas. Use condoms.

Yes they are, Ireland is our fifth biggest trading partner. As of 2010 our exports were:

Primary exports partners: US (14.71 percent), Germany (11.06 percent), France (8 percent), Netherlands (7.79 percent), Ireland (6.89 percent), Belgium (4.65 percent), Spain (4 percent)

So six of the top 7 are European with two of those nations being PIIGS as of the 2009 figures, the most recent annual figures available from HMRC. We are deeply mired in the Eurozone problems.

&gt; It was only because the funding for that project was pulled that the &gt;Large Hadron Collider came into existence. 

Not true, the SSC got cancelled, yes, but at this time the LHC was already decided upon. The SSC was huge, the LHC is a medium sized machine in comparison. The US even started building, such a project would have never even come close to this stage anywhere else.  Even the LHC, a great project, is built into the LEP tunnel. Why not building it bigger, better, making sure we discover something? Easy, too expensive to dig a new tunnel. BTW, CERN receives funding worldwide. In contrast to any other Lab (DESY, NIKHEF, Fermilab etc) it is de facto protected by international treaties like the UN or so. That is a great asset. If I'd tell you what the countries/institutes have to pay for any single scientist going there, you hardly would believe it. It's very expensive. Then again, while all of Europe hat in the 90s LEP and 2010 onwards LHC, the US funded in parallel RHIC, Tevatron and SLAC, three different machines for different physics. 

 
&gt;You make it sound like science is dead in Europe while this is probably a better time than ever for European science. 

I didn't say that. European science is excellent and as it is in the US. Problem are common, e.g. a lack of funding these days due to the financial crisis.

&gt;While it is bad to suggest a nation the size of the US is full of anti-science people 

You are generalizing here. The US is a bit bigger than all of Europe together. If there is some superstitious crap going in the most backwater corner of Eastern Europe, to we to assume this applies to Germans or Spanish people too? The media just overstates. I haven never met a person so far who actually believes in e.g. creationism. They do exist, but there are people who believe in ghosts in Europe, too.

&gt;  funding for something like the Large Hadron Collider would never pass the Senate.

Let's not kid ourselves, if the LHC would have been decided upon today we probably wouldn't get it too. Look what happened to the ILC, the funding is barely enough to maintain it and in many countries basically scrapped. 

All I am saying, I have met some people who e.g. in the ""Land der Dichter and Denker"" were tending to be bit single minded regarding humanities. Those ppl are everywhere (as there are scientist who disregard humanities). Just there was a tad more of this attitude in some European places compared to the US.

* a small amount of currency in each of the countries you're travelling to

* comfortable shoes (I swear by my birks when I travel)

* extra contacts or glasses for the sight-impaired

* the 6 makeup items you can't live without (mine are foundation, concealer, mascara, liner, blistex, and a shadow palette) - don't bring more than this! bare makeup essentials 

* at least one sports bra and a pair of trainers

* something light to connect quick and easy to wireless (small laptop or netbood, iPad, chromebook whatever)

* an open mind...don't show up thinking you know exactly what you want to get out of it. You don't - every stop is an adventure. 

Things to leave behind: 

* Let your hair dry naturally - don't bother with a blowdryer/straightener, or really any hair product at all besides some small bottles of shampoo/conditioner (and maybe an anti-frizz if necessary). 

* Your favorite dress and heels - if you wind up needing a party outfit, it will be more fun to go and buy something cheap anyhow. Heels take up a lot of unnecessary space.

* the lonely planet or another hefty travel guide - there are lots of good phone apps for this, and most places you stay will have suggestions in the lobby if you really don't know what to do

* the clothes that you don't often wear but 'you're sure you'll wear in europe because it's so different there' - you won't. There's a reason you don't wear those clothes at home. Bring fav pieces only.

* Stereotypes. You will look like an idiot if you start giggling and taking pictures when you see the french drinking an espresso with a cigarette and croissant on the Champs-Elysees while a street-performing mime acts in front of them. These are just people living their lives, and for every stereotype you confirm there will be 400 others breaking it.

To ask for from your Mom:

* Mini everything! All the minis! Lotion, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, qtips, toothpaste...all of them

* Pocket games - small decks of cards or little things that fit in the front pouch of a backpack and can be pulled out on the train to pass the time. Maybe trivia or brainteasers?

* Luggage tags

* A new camera/video camera/phone with a good camera/video camera (but don't waste your whole trip taking pictures, live it too!)

* Ponys, small brush/comb, bobby pins

* A nice rollable carry-on (with backpack converter)

* It is not at all clear that austerity can solve the problem under any circumstances.  Thus, this might be a problem of throwing good money after bad merely to delay an inevitable comeuppance.  

* It is definitely not clear that the structure of austerity is being implemented in a ""fair and equitable"" fashion.  Thus, this might be a problem of group of people A being unhappy with being asked (forced) to sacrifice for the greater benefit - while group of people B who will equally (or better) benefit are not being asked to make a pro-rata sacrifice.  

* Its not clear that the process by which the Eurozone crisis is being addressed (i.e., meetings among EU ministers) in a fashion that is understood as just and fair by the people affected by the decisions.  That is, it is one thing to volunteer to sacrifice - it is another thing to be appointed for sacrifice without your voice being heard.  Even if you would have chosen to sacrifice if asked.  

* At a higher level, it is unclear what exactly is going on at a global and EU level.  There have been efforts to explain the EU debt crisis in terms that are relatively narrow (and relatively easy to address): the Greeks (et al) spent too much money and now the rich countries need to bail them out while they get their act in order.  However, there is good reason to believe that the global crisis in 2008 and the current EU crisis are both part of larger dynamics (schumpeterian creative destruction, Kondratiev waves, cultural forces driven by the shift to a networked world, etc.) and that looking at the current EU crisis without this context will inevitably lead to bad decisions.

The Superconducting Super Collider was cancelled in 1993 but the writing was on the wall already. The LHC was destined to become the most powerful machine of its kind after the Super Collider was foolishly killed. Like I said the LHC was largely born because of the US cancellation. The amount of support required internationally for the LHC wasn't entirely there, when the Super Collider got cancelled the LHC was deemed as necessary, it was the tipping point.

It doesn't matter how big the SSC is, what matters is that it was cancelled. We can sit here and argue about the merits of something that doesn't exist all day or accept that the Europeans had the fortitude to actually put together a project like the LHC when the American government went ahead and killed arguably one of the most important scientific projects undertaken.

The most important thing is to get something done. If you are getting funding from the martians and putting the LHC in an old womans garden at least you are making some tangible progress. It is a better position to be in than building nothing at all.

SLAC, RHIV and Tevatron are not nearly the same machines as LHC or the Supercolliding Super Collider. The LHC is a a machine that is designed to answer the fundamental questions of physics. SLAC, RHIC and Tevatron are all useful in answering other questions that are also important but LHC is a very different beast. It is important to fund something like the LHC, there isn't really a replacement for it in the world at the moment.. that is IF it does its job.

The point isn't that European science is bad, the point is that European science and engineering has been improving. Look at France building high speed rail infrastructure and their investments in nuclear power or Germanys investments in EV's and how well their car industry is doing.

Again the point is that it's a good thing to be a scientist or engineer in Europe at the moment. They are quite lucky, they get paid quite well and they work on some amazing things. Scientists and engineers are held in high regard.

You need to re-read my statement, I said it is a BAD thing to suggest that the US is anti-science because while there may be some anti-science people there are also a LOT of people that don't have a problem with science.

I'm not trying to turn this into a dick measuring contest, this isn't ""mine is bigger than yours"". I don't really care for nationalism, I think intelligent people come from everywhere but I also think implying that Europe has problems while downplaying the fact that the US has problems stinks of bias. How about both countries have problems? I still maintain the science and engineering projects in Europe are gathering more steam though.

I doubt the LHC would have been approved all those years ago. The US Senate cancelled the Supercolliding Super Collider in 1993. It was a much much bigger and much more expensive machine but it was an incredibly important machine, a watershed moment in science. The fact that they would cancel it shows their lack of understanding, they could have taken 1% of the budget from the military away for a few years and funded it quite easily. They cancelled it because they were foolish.

I think the LHC would have still found funding even in this financial climate. It's just too important a tool not to have, it's probably the most incredible things built by humans and IF it works it is going to be a real big moment in science. I think scrapping the Supercolliding Super Collider was one of the worst mistakes made in the last 25 years, it was a truly horrible decision.

Just because you met some people you disagree with doesn't mean you should label 700 million Europeans as anti-scientist. Honestly Europe is home to incredibly accomplished organisations like Mercedes Benz, ARM Holdings, CERN, TGV and many more. Europe is hardly anti-scientist or anti-engineer when a lot of the best scientists and engineers are increasingly travelling to Europe to find some of the best facilities in the world.

Right now engineers in particular are having an incredible time in Germany and France with Germany rolling out incredible cars and France rolling out high speed rail. Some scientists and engineers are living the dream. Can you say the same for GM or Amtrak?

You seem to be extremely patriotic so I'm not going to bother dangling that in front of you but theres a reason your trying to find the Boson in Europe and not the US and that is because the Europeans(and they deserve credit for this) have been able to provide us with something nobody else did.

OP - whatever your attackers say, they are not going to kill you. But the bad news is that they are not going to leave you just so. They just do not respect you, and you do not respect yourself too, that is the problem. You will get zero respect if you deal with this with the help from the adults. If I may suggest, join local gym, start working out. Not to build some muscle and kick their asses, but to boost your own confidence. Join martial arts class, either at school or in the town. There must be some adults in your school that the bullies respect - usually it is the teacher of PE, or sometimes a school has a gym that is run by someone - try to become if not friends with them, but be at least in contact. You do this by joining their club, or classes, try having smalltalk with them. This will get you some points, bullies will not want to mess with a friend of a friend. Also, really strong (and here I mean mental strenght, not physical) people hate when physically weaker are attacked, so they will tend to help you. But be careful here, you do not want tearful symphaty or a shoulder to cry on here - you are trying to establish man - to - man relationship with them and get their respect. Talk to them about your situation, they may help more than anyone online. When choosing martial arts class, try to go to the one your bullies are going (if they are, and they probably are). Coach will do everything to avoid nonsence in his classes, and will keep them down. 

Try to avoid involving any women (mother, female teachers etc), or you will be pussy - boy forever. Remember the most important thing here: this is **your** problem, and you must deal with it. Police, teachers etc will help only temporarily, you must take care of yourself yourself. I was bullied mildly in my school years too, I know how shitty that feels. But always remember: it is way way better to go down fighting, than to go down in tears. Best of luck!

One more thing: when you decide to fight, go for the mob leader. There is always someone with ""higher authority"" within the gang. Don't go for the weakest one of them thinking you have better chances against him, as this will show lack of your confidence.

Used to be they'd give allergy shots; the recent trend is towards sublingual drops- put them under the tongue. It's not FDA-approved, but it's been in use in Europe for &gt;20 years. A doctor buddy of mine says there's another advantage: anaphylaxis. He related a story to me on how a patient who had received allergy shots had a massive anaphylactic reaction, and died despite the best attempts of two physicians (who, in an allergy clinic, would have been prepared for that sort of thing).

They make these special combs that fit into hives that knock off the pollen as the bees come home. This gets packaged and sold for several purposes, including allergy management.

Things escalated incrementally throughout the interwar period with a brief camaraderie during the second world war and then resumed shortly thereafter.  After the formulation of NATO in 1949, tensions rose sharply and The Soviet Union reacted with the Warsaw Pact in 1955.  The two ideologues sought out as many member-states as possible to justify the supremacy of their economic systems.
Two years after the Warsaw Pact was promulgated, Sputnik was successfully launched in 1957 which effectively began both the space race and the arms race which characterized the worst of the Cold War.  From here on, relations became very strained between the two powers and conflict began surfacing throughout Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe, often pitting an American-backed ~~capitalist~~ ""democratic"" political group vs. a Soviet-backed socialist movement.  If one were to have to pick a side ""responsible"" for the war, one would have to agree what event precipitated it, and this is the sticky part.  There are too many of these events to definitively pick the prime mover.  At its heart, ideology was the main driving force of the conflict and so it could be argued Marx and Engels were mainly responsible.   My two cents.

The fact that you don't know anyone else in the tea industry is actually a good thing. You will probably face very little competition at the start. Obviously down the road it will be beneficial to start networking and meeting other people work with tea (distributors, people in your supply chain, etc.) but as far as I can tell there should be nothing stopping you from jumping into it right now. Obviously there are plenty of tea drinkers, many of whom can be as devoted as coffee drinkers, so there is plenty of demand for your product. I suspect people will be glad to shop in your tea store, rather than simply buying their tea from a grocery store which would have less selection and a less friendly atmosphere.

The question is, where are you going to open up? I assume you are located in the United States, which has significantly fewer tea drinkers than most European or Asian countries. But you mentioned your area is somewhat of a yuppie area, which is a group of people that does tend to drink more tea than the average American. 

In my expert opinion, you already have everything you need to make a successful go of this tea shop, except for the money. Tea is somewhat of a novelty as well, with many different flavors and compelling reasons for people to walk into your store. I have no doubt that you will be able to find lots of creative ways to market tea to the people around you. My suggestion would be to consider a location in more of a mall than a strip mall, where you are more likely to get foot traffic. Your store will be relatively small, so the store front shouldn't be too expensive even in a mall. Foot traffic will draw a lot more curious customers into a tea shop than if people had to drive to it as a destination shop.

Here is what the Fed said the very day that the House voted on the bank bailout:

[Fed Pumps Further $630 Billion Into Financial System](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a9MTZEgukPLY):

&gt;Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve will pump an additional $630 billion into the global financial system, flooding banks with cash to alleviate the worst banking crisis since the Great Depression.

&gt;The Fed increased its existing currency swaps with foreign central banks by $330 billion to $620 billion to make more dollars available worldwide. The Term Auction Facility, the Fed's emergency loan program, will expand by $300 billion to $450 billion. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are among the participating authorities.

&gt;The Fed's expansion of liquidity, the biggest since credit markets seized up last year, **came hours before the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a $700 billion bailout** for the financial industry. The crisis is reverberating through the global economy, causing stocks to plunge and forcing European governments to rescue four banks over the past two days alone.

&gt; ...

That was on Monday. The Dow fell by 777 points that day.  By Friday, Congress had reversed itself and passed the bailout.

So, there you have $1070 billion mentioned in the newspaper the week that Congress voted. Those are the ""secret"" bailouts.

Being that the OP says he isn't in good shape AND outnumbered, fighting back would probably not get him very far, I definitely agree with you on that point.  On the other hand, I think that this
 &gt;This isn't the kind of problem you should ever face, much less solve on your own. It's only happening because you are not being provided a safe, fair environment, and those who would take advantage of lax oversight are taking advantage of lax oversight.
Bullying like this doesn't happen when you're an adult, and if it does the police quickly solve it.""
is largely wishful thinking.  

There are many things on this planet that ""nobody should have to face"", especially if every human being has the same inalienable rights (which unfortunately is not the case, as a child in an African or Chinese village by station of birth will likely not be afforded the opportunities that most Americans and Western Europeans take for granted as commonplace).

As far as bullying not happening when you're an adult, no, you likely won't be bullied, but unless you live somewhere where there's never been any act of crime ever, it might not be a bad thing to learn how to proactively protect yourself rather than leaving yourself open to being victimized.

The reality is that just because we shouldn't have to face things like bullying, violence, homelessness, crime, or starvation, billions of people experience these things all over the planet daily, and this sort of thinking teaches over-dependence on authority that won't always be able to help an individual out, or in some cases doesn't even exist to begin with.

While violence may not be a ""mature"" answer, there is a difference between violence for the sake of violence, vigilantism, and violence to protect yourself.  If OP did fight back, it would not be a case of ""taking the law into his own hands"", but rather a case of ""the right to swing your fist ends where another man's nose begins"".  

If, in this case, the school and police DO effectively get involved and these issues are solved, then that would be the obvious best case scenario.  If they act anything like their bumbling American counterparts though, it will likely be ineffective mediation, and the bullying will continue until the OP learns to stand up for himself on one way or another.  People like bullies, who are usually going after other people to make themselves feel tougher or just to vent frustration, will have a field day with people who they see as weak.  Even without violence, if the OP can learn how to stand up for himself either verbally or at least carry himself with more self confidence, I wouldn't be surprised if these instances in the future diminished.  

Also, keep in mind that there will not always be adults or even his friends watching where this kid is 100% of the time all day every day to make sure he's protected, and if the bullying continues then the best case scenario is reactive punishments, which won't accomplish anything until the kids picking on him are expelled or arrested for assault.

1. Wanting to live by the bible  to be a christian  means that you are a lot farther along in your journey  to know God then many people who call themselves Christians. I define myself as a christian  because I try to be a ""follower of Christ"" which means believing his words and  trying to follow his example. By reading the bible  (especially the new testament, I suggest reading the book of Mathew, Luke or John first) You learn that God though Jesus wants to have a relationship with you because he loves you and your fellow humans. Because humanity has done horrible things,  by hurting ourselves and others we turn away from God. God being Just as well as perfect cannot have as deep of a connection with us as he would like because our sin (our badness). So Jesus (being both God &amp; human simultaneously) came down to teach us and heal our relationship with God  by taking the punishment  for every-bodies bad words, thoughts or actions on himself or others. By recognizing that, wanting God's forgiveness and promising to try to follow Jesus' teaching and actions  we are a ""savior follower"" which is really what the word christian means.  If we say we believe this but that knowledge does not effect the way we live our lives and treat other people  then  we really are not following him.  Don't take my word for it, read the bible and ask God to guide you in your decision to follow Jesus. Becoming a christian should be a scary and wonderful thing,  no human is perfect  but though faith (trust) belief and action it is one heck of a ride. Many Baptists believe that you also need a physical , public and symbolic  ceremony to become a christian which is baptism. This was practiced even before Jesus began preaching and  by going underwater  or having water poured over your head you ""die"" and ""rise again"" with Jesus and your sin (bad things you have done) are washed away metaphorically.
2. You do not have to say a member of a particular denomination of church forever. Even within denominations churches can vary depending upon the leanings of the head pastor or priest. If you are happy with your church (they are welcoming, will answer your questions, they are positive actors in the community) stick with them.  My mother was raised and baptized catholic but is now a Anglican because she didn't like  the catholic church's stance on contraception or ordaining women and the closest church to our house that she really connected with happened to be an Anglican church. The old church she went to doesn't bother her or anything.
3.  May I suggest a christian European tradition? Go to Midnight Mass on Christmas eve and open your presents when you get home from the service. If you are not free go to the Christmas day service in the morning. Either way your church  will read and explain the Christmas story as it relates  to Jesus and his birth. I think it is particularly magical to do so at midnight, sometimes you reach a certain clarity  or peace only at night. Some may say that you shouldn't have a evergreen tree or hang holy as those are pagan symbols. I disagree, the pagan symbols for the winter solstice were adopted by early European Christians for a reason. Yes to help reach pagans but also  because the symbolism is universal. Evergreen trees  are ""alive""  when all other trees are ""dead"" in the dark of winter. Look up christian symbolism of many holiday traditions and you will see that it celebrates Jesus birth just fine. Besides Santa may now be commercialized  but the legend started with a real saint Nick! Give presents to be generous, loving and to celebrate the best gift of all Jesus. Have fun, Jesus came to give us life and life to the fullest.
4. It may be different in baptist churches so I recommend you ask a church leader but from what I understand  step 1.you stand in line until you get to the front. step 2. you kneel and if you don't consider yourself a christian or a full member of that church, cross your arms over  your chest if not hold both hands palm up  in front of you. step 3 A)if your hands are crossed  the church leader coming around will give you a blessing  by speaking some words and he or she may touch your head. B)if your hand are out someone will put a bit of bread or a cracker in your hands  and say ""this is his body broken for you"" eat and swallow the bread understanding that this is supposed to symbolize the sacrifice Jesus made by allowing his body to be hurt to get rid of everybody sin (evil acts/thoughts). Next someone will come around with wine or grape juice and say ""this is his blood, shed for you"" and then either you drink a sip or dip your leftover bread/cracker in it and eat it. Step 4 get up and calmly go sit back down where you were sitting before you got in line. While you wait for others to do the same think about what Jesus did for you or pray silently  in thanks  for what he did or to ask forgiveness for something that you may feel guilty about. The tradition is from the last supper Jesus had on earth before he was killed. Don't feel pressured to go up and take communion if you are not comfortable. It is in remembrance of Jesus's sacrifice and if you are not sure what you believe it is better to be honest.There is no shame in that.
5. Prayer doesn't always have to be structured.  Remember God wants you to know him and love him as he loves you.  Jesus actually answers your question with ""the Lord's Prayer""  (Google it) which I pray when I feel like I need to talk to God but I don't know where to begin. Above all be open and honest. He knows what your thinking anyways but sometimes you have to say it (or think it) out loud. I usually try praising him, then thanking him then telling him what is bothering me  or what I am curious about and ending with asking  for something or thanking him again. It's best to do this after you have read some of the bible on your own to gleam wisdom and God's will but really any time you feel like you want to talk to God, go for it.  (eg. ""Hey God that is a really cool cloud!""  or ""I don't know what to say to that Jesus! Help!"")
 Finally something that I wish I knew earlier was  to get a Bible, read it  and don't worry if you have doubts or question it!  I used to get a doubt, worry about it, let it fester and I'd drift away from God. But when I research it, pray about it and look for bible verses on the subject I would gain understanding and have an even closer relationship with God then before. If someone says the bible says something weird, look it up. If you have a question about God, ask a church leader ( and If they don't know get a book out from the library on the subject.) As a new Christian I used to think that I was the only one with doubts or that if I shared them I would hurt others faith. But Honestly Christians have been doubting and asking questions for 2 thousand years before you came along and someone somewhere has answered your question before.  I wish you well on your journey to follow Jesus. May God Bless you and Keep you.
P.S.  For Christmas decorations I would say a Christmas tree, Menorah, stockings and hang up all the Christmas/Hanuka/Holiday cards on a string or on the wall like a mosaic. Ask your Gay room mates if they have any secular family holiday traditional decorations (like stings of popcorn) that they would like to do and have fun.

Hitler managed to put up a good fight against the Allies as is, with America, imagine what he'd have done without America and with more of Europes resources to make into plane,s tanks, guns, soldier,s etc.  Even if the Soviets had won, they would also then control all of those west Europe resources after the war, I'm guessing that with all of Europe for Stalin to play with, the Cold War would've been much warmer...",t1_c34j141,snubdeity,,,1,True,t3_muiiy

DNS has very little to do with physical infastructure, past the point that it is a protocol that uses it, like any other. A traditional DNS system requires a great deal of computational power to keep track of the various layers its in charge of and to answer requests, but otherwise it has no special requirements. It would be large task to build out an alternative root to rival the one we use now, but it is completely possible. 

When it comes down to shutting off core infrastructure, yes, the US goverement could serverly injure the internet *as we know it.* If the goverment stepped in and severed the various back bones, the Internet of today would schism and split into several hundred or thousands smaller, community Internets (maybe better classified as Intranets at that point). Its likely the Internet would reshape with Europe at its core, and the US would enter a type of digital dark ages.

The US is supremely unlikely to shut off core infrastructure at any point, though. There is conjecture that about 1 trillion (yes, with a T) dollars of commerce is conducted online, every day. The day the US cuts the cord is the day the world economy takes a hit no one has ever seen. It would be akin to cutting off your own head to get a little saliva in your enemies eye. Its much more likely that the US will continue to apply pressure to ICANN and Verisign to break DNS. Much easier, much quieter, for now. The day that someone steps up and slams down a new DNS root will be a very loud day.   

The thing is, that at this point, you cant kill the internet. It was designed to compensate for failure. Hell, responding to failing nodes is perhaps the core competency of the Internet. It is its real feature. 

The Internet of today will break apart into little regional nets, but they will be slowly linked again. It may not happen in our lifetime, but as long as the lights go on, so will the Internet.

Also the Danish government somehow persuaded the Nazis not to send the Danish Jews they did round up to the extermination camps.  The Danish Red Cross helped, monitoring the conditions of the Danish Jews that had been sent to Nazi concentration camps (concentration camps but not extermination camps).  As a result only 102 Danish Jews died in the Holocaust [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews#Arrests_and_deportations).

Contrast this with the other nearby European countries: 90% of the Jews in Poland were killed, 70% of those in the Netherlands, 50% of those in Belgium [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoah#Jewish).

So I'd say the Danish are about the last people you could claim are bigoted against non-Christians.

My original point was, in the the U.S., religion is as big of a deal as you make it. r/Atheism (and reddit in general) consists largely of people who are from the U.S., Canada, or Europe. Of these places, I think its safe to say the U.S. treats atheists the worst. Even then, it's mostly just the ignorant southerners who hate ANYONE who isn't exactly like them. Regardless of this, people in r/Atheism act as if they're in the middle of an Atheist holocaust.

I understand that *some* of them have a reason to seek refuge. I have a hard time believing it is the case for the majority of the community. It does make for a convenient excuse though. Literally any time r/Atheism is called out, you can expect a tsunami of ""refuge"" comments. To me, this just comes off as an excuse not to better the community. I would go to r/Atheism more regularly if it weren't the most sickening circlejerk I've ever seen. I've got no problem with science or philosophy. It's the inflated egos and militant opinions that I don't like.

and speaking of survey methodology and sampling techniques, the EU is fairly well abreast of the latest statistical techniques I think.
 
&gt; Sample designs
 
&gt; The EU LFS is a rotating random sample survey of persons in private households. The sampling units are dwellings, households or individuals depending on the sampling frame.The sample design and rotation patterns are not fully harmonised. Different schemes are used to sample the units ranging from simple random sampling to complex stratified multi-stage sampling methods of clusters. Most countries use a variant of a two-stage stratified random sampling of households. All of the Member States apply a rotating pattern so that part of the observations can be directly paired to the observations one survey instance earlier. These rotating patterns range from 2-() (participating 2 quarters consecutively before leaving the sample) through 2-(2)-2 (2 quarters then skipped for 2 quarters and finally participating for another 2 quarters) to 8-().

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/threat

I understand that you don't think there was a direct physical threat. And I agree, by your meaning of the word. But to me, *fuck you, go back to your fucking country, you're the people who are ruining my fucking country, Are you British? You are not British etc.* is a threat, in the sense of the second definition: an indication of impending danger or harm. Let me explain why.

If I believed she were alone or one of a very small minority of people who think this way, and that as an ethnic minority person I am secure and wanted by the vast majority of people in my community, then yes, I would react same as you: I would not take it seriously, would not take it to heart, and I would just feel sorry for her the same way I feel sorry for a mentally ill person ranting at me about harmless things on public transport. She speaks with no power, and I know my community has my back.

Here's the thing: I do not feel like I know my community has my back, or indeed want me in it. I would say maybe a fifth does, if we're optimistic push that up to a quarter. About half or more is always ""ambivalent about immigration"", and yet the discussion rarely sticks to immigration and the practicalities of integration, but always goes back to race and [the ethnics](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/07/express-british-national-party), as if however long your family has lived in the land, if you look different you are always and forever a guest, with your sense of security and your right to your *home* easily revoked, if there are too many of you, or should you step out of line or be perceived to be jumping the queue to benefits that rightfully belong to the ""natives"" first. Some of them might even consider voting BNP as a ""protest vote"", because why not? It's not like they are putting up their ethnic minority friends and neighbours and work colleagues as a bargaining chip, if they even have or know any. And then there's about a fifth or so who would cheer the Rivers of Blood speech, vote for the BNP every election knowing full well who they are, the ones boiling with hate. As a person of ethnic minority, I watch every BNP election result, and then do a calculation of percentages -- is it every fifth or sixth random person I meet in the street who would be someone who hates my guts?

Thank fuck for the BNP's incompetence though, and there has been enough ""prosperity"" until a few years ago that we muddled along, a few BNP results here and there but mostly people are secure enough not to need someone to blame. But not any more.

Hey I just noticed this, from the definition of ""threat"": ""[Middle English, from Old English thrat, oppression; see treud- in Indo-European roots.]""

I know the history for people of ethnic minorities in times such as this. The far right's rise in Europe. So when she says *fuck you, go back to your fucking country, you're the people who are ruining my fucking country*, it is a *threat* to me. I do not brush it off as a lone person's crazy raving, because it is not.

The police have apparently discovered these too in the past few days and are looking into them now. Meanwhile, don't know if it's true for you, but when I google ""Emma West"" the very *first* link goes to british resistance.co.uk, where they discuss whether her points were valid or just ""racist"" (their quotes), ""and it is clear that Emma is a very brave..."" -- Google cut off there, and I didn't click, didn't want to give them more Google juice/hits somehow. I hope either a lot of people are just linking to make fun/roll eyes, or these people are just *really* good at evil SEO.

You are clearly someone who doesn't feel that threat, and genuinely, I am glad for you. You are right, in that your response is better, healthier. But you know what it reminded me of? The people who got out of poverty through a lot of hard work, and because they got out, believe that if they could do it, anyone can, and if they don't it's just their own weakness, and they only have themselves to blame.

You may want to consider that not everyone can respond the way you did, and that while it would be great if they could, that they can't does not mean there is something wrong with them, and that *the problem does not lie with them*. That you may be fortunate in many ways in your personality or upbringing or repertoire of life skills that you've built up or sense of security in your environment and community that other people of ethnic minority may not have, and that while you are free to consider your response better and healthier (and I agree with you), there is nothing wrong with their response either, because it is not the fault of the people on the end of racist abuse if they don't cope with it well. Because it is *not* just life, given that black people sitting at the back of the bus was just life, sexual harassment was just life, gay people having to stay in the closet was just life, [""if you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGAOCVwLrXo) was just life. That was changed not by people who laughed it off, who took it in stride, but by people who would not accept it.

You may also like to consider, and I say this genuinely with no wish to minimise your experiences at all, just to remind you of how you may not be aware of the depth of other people's experiences: being accosted by crotchety old ladies, one time being an issue of race, is not the most threatening experience of racism. That you felt able to however politely insult one of them implies some sense of safety and security in your community, and in your surroundings. I ask you to consider that not everyone has that.

I read this on another site the other day, someone's comment about the same video:

'Substitute ""poles"" with ""dirty irish"", and this woman's rant would be almost identical to the kind of vitriol my mom experienced from time to time when she emigrated from rural Ireland to London back in the 1950. It left her a pretty bitter person and to this day she is still a little uncomfortable when someone notices her accent, as if she's bracing herself for verbal abuse. When I was a child she would have me schedule appointments over the phone for her, saying that she didn't want people to know that she was irish. She still doesn't quite believe that most americans find her accent charming.'

Irish, in this day and age! It stays with people. It may not do so with you, but this is how it affects many people. And the fault is not with them. 

But is it worth the freedom of speech though?

""I'd personally rather be insulted on a train than not have the right to speak my mind."" Are you wanting to racially abuse people? Because if not, this is false dichotomy, or at least a *really* slippery slope. And she did not *insult* them. If she said their grandmother was a whore and their grandfather fucked goats, that would be an insult (to some people). She did not insult their heritage. It was *abuse*, directed to intimidate and to hurt. 

I think I am just as concerned and wary as you are of government exploiting laws to shut down freedom of speech and dissent. Here's the thing though: there are so many fucking loopholes they are already doing it through, that the idea it would be done through the very narrow charge of racial abuse or racial harassment just doesn't seem realistic. ""Disturbing the peace"" is a perfectly fine one already, for example. They've been using health and safety codes to clear out the Occupy protesters too -- should we do away with health and safety codes altogether? That's another thing -- many American Redditors react with horror at this and on hearing about European laws against Holocaust denial, because they are used to the sacredness of their First Amendment, the absolute protection offered by it. So tell me, would you feel safer voicing a complaint at the American border or the British border? Would you feel safer speaking up against British authorities or American authorities? (Of course, the UK's not far behind, as we follow the US off the cliff.) How is American media compared to the British media? How well informed is the average American citizen, compared to the average British or European one? Which government do you think is closer to tyranny, the denial-of-holocaust-banning German government or the free-speech-and-First-Amendment-respecting American one?

I'm not in any way wanting to say the way we do things is better or is fine. I have plenty of worries about the British government, and it is my opinion as I said that they are following the US right off the cliff. I am simply reacting to this belief in absolute free speech, which is like the belief in the free market -- if we take away the restraints, we will prevent tyranny, and the forces of good will naturally win out (and when they don't, ""it's just life""). Except as in the free market, they don't -- it just ends up with the vulnerable without protection, as always.

I've mentioned why I think the slippery slope doesn't tilt that way; let me tilt it the other way. We don't have to go very far to imagine if the woman in the video was a man, or three, or drunk on a Friday night, on the upper deck of a night bus with a person of ethnic minority riding home. We also don't have to go very far to imagine that the person of ethnic minority may have to take this bus regularly. It may be their bus to and from work. We don't write these laws for the woman-with-a-baby-in-her-lap scenario or the crotchety-old-lady scenario. Thing is, it's not even just about racism -- say a man with no life takes a fancy to a woman on his regular bus route, and when she rejects his advances decides to call her a slut and a whore and subject her to the same abuse every single time he sees her on the bus. He knows enough to never do anything physical though -- what then? A transgendered person is hounded by a group of youths on his walk home, and now it happens every time they bump into each other, which is often. They never physically threaten her though. So should she just accept it as ""just life""? Or should she throw some abuse back, take a fucking chance that she won't end up on the (niche, GLBT community) news? These are power imbalances, where there's every chance they won't have people standing up for them, defending them. These are the real descendents of your civil rights activists, socialists, White Rose members.

What I don't understand is, if we take away everything else and it's just a person shouting fuck you aggressively and repeatedly at you, I can't imagine you or anyone else would just shrug and accept it if it happened with any regularity. Even if you're fond of insulting back, some day you would just get tired of it. It very quickly becomes intolerable. So why not give the people on that tram that same protection? And be vigilant and fight to make sure that any laws regarding this is used in the right way, as we must do with all the laws that are used to protect us anyway?

It seems to me you are off to a weak start. If x policy is not ""philosophically"" palatable yet demonstrably improves the situation, that's a policy I prefer.

But I disagree with your entire schema:

&gt;It punishes savers

Only a very particular kind of savers, that is, savers of money. In a usury system it makes sense to cut down the rainforest and turn it into money, because money always grows. In a demurrage system it makes sense to keep the rainforest alive, because whatever we might get from a one-time slash-and-burn will inevitably diminish. On the other hand, keeping it alive and productive will guarantee continuous revenue streams. So who exactly is in favor of immediate gratification?

&gt;On a more philosophical note

Even more philosophical than your original philosophical argument?

&gt;I work hard and save my money so I can remove myself from the labor pool for occasional extended periods of time.

I just disagree. I think labor can be dignified, and I think the conception of it not being so is a major problem in modern society, but then again, I'm far left.

&gt;Am I not a free man?

This must be a joke. The expansion of usury economies depends on debt. So no, you aren't free in the current system, or if you are it's on someone else's back.

&gt;almost every historical example of demurrage takes place in the context of a failed or failing monetary system

What might be of interest is the ""almost"" given that the origins of capitalism as we know it today were local demurrage currencies in medieval Europe, which were eventually turned into usury currency monopolies in the Renaissance. Kind of a big exception to ignore.

&gt;demurrage is the final expression of monetary incompetence.

Since the Renaissance, demurrage currencies have largely emerged as a popular and successful *response* to monetary incompetence, not an expression of it. If the monetary incompetence was in a usury system, how is an alternative demurrage system an expression of that incompetence?

EDIT: You added your final paragraph after I responded. No, I don't think the policy you describe is identical to a demurrage currency (especially given that most of the country is entirely unaware of it or its implications), and no, I don't believe that policy can be blamed for our economic woes. I look forward to your response.

EDIT 2: actually, your final TWO paragraphs. As to FIRE economy, BS. History shows that demurrage currencies lead to productivity in *all* sectors, not just FIRE, and actually, is an easy contrast with FIRE economies in that the emphasis is on real, palpable production rather than its illusory counterpart. Just claiming there's a smell ain't convincing at all.

Your argument that a demurrage currency ""produces stores of value outside of the social mechanisms of account"" is similarly nonsensical, in that demurrage itself is just such a social mechanism of account. Your argument that demurrage currencies are always shut down down by central banks is a point for them, not against.

Go ahead and laugh if you want but it's true--just do some research and you will see the countless contributions to Western Civilization from the Jewish People over the last century.  This trend must not be allowed to stop.  Western civilization cannot afford to let Israel be compromised. We need the Jewish peoples inspiration, motivation, creativity and culture to maintain our own culture and to continue to make advancements that make our standard of living better for all of humanity.

And about getting off the original topic: the reason I have gone off on this 'tangent' is because you are trying to push this idea that the Israeli-American relationship is a one-way relationship with benefits to Israel only.  I am not apologizing for anyone here. I'm just stating the facts and trying to show you that there are benefits to America and the world from the Israeli-American relationship.  The Christians had their renaissance in France, Italy, Germany and other parts of Europe and the ideas, inventions and inspirations are still providing spin-offs to our modern day economy.. so why not let the Jewish people flourish?  Do you not want a better standard of living?  Aren't you interested to see what a highly creative and thriving culture can provide to the world when they are finally able to cast off their shackles and flourish in a non-prejudiced environment?  

Any support that is requested by Israel from America is due to Israel's concerns over her national security and her right to exist.  The Jewish people have been relentlessly persecuted for over five thousand years and have every right to be concerned for their safety.  America knows this is true and America knows it can provide military support to Israel and is being a good big brother in doing so.  There is nothing wrong with this.  It is quite obvious that if America would have given the same military support to either Jordan or Syria or Lebanon or any one of many other middle eastern countries that Israel (and Possibly Europe and other Western nations) would be smoking craters.  While the American-Israeli relationship may not be perfect (and NO RELATIONSHIP in the history of humankind EVER has been) Israel is still by far and away the most trustworthy American ally in the region.

Now i'm not jumping on the bash China bandwagon but I believe the high barriers of entry of foreign companies to gain access to China is causing this.  China has been on a subsidized manufacturing binge the last decade.  This is primarily due to the unwillingness of China to inflate its currency and unpeg it from the dollar.  This has created a sort of shitstorm in the world economy.  They have funded much of the US and Euro debt and are unwilling to allow those economies access to its internal economy.  This has created a hording effect on China and has created a ""Great wall of China.""  Part of the reason the US and EU have flourished the last 50 years was the trade parity that we shared.  Our foreign balance sheets were almost equal and the middle class rose in both zones.  The US had started transitioning its manufacturing base to the EU years ago and focused on innovation as its primary export.  The US has not been hit as bad as it has transitioned to a more serviced based  economy.  That and major printing of money by the fed which in my opinion is the best economic tool in a major world wide recession.

The EU had fueled its growth on a manufacturing export economy from 1950 to present and China is slowly replacing that function.  

I think China needs to start a high tech buying bing and open consumer credit for its population.

The problem here lies in the fact that many financial institutions/banks have risked getting Greek bonds and bonds of similar rating (there are even rumours of foul play at the rating of these bonds) distributed throughout Europe/US. Thus (undercapitalized) banks/financial institutions/insurance companies will have to take their losses and close down. 

Without the euro one could argue that the problem would be just as widespread with much more dire consequences to trade, as exchange rates of countries would oscillate too much in the aftermath of the crisis. The advantage of the euro here is that internal consumption and trade inside the Euro-zone is spared. So I reckon that things would be much worse without the euro. 

The affected institutions mentioned however are squirming not lose their bets and are taking out on social programs and spreading the debt among the general population. This is inherently wrong as any bail out would just buy some time but hardly solve any of the systemic problems present where financial institutions/banks are gambling with money they cannot afford to lose.

Financial reform is imperative before taking any other action.

Entertainment piracy actually helps domestic economy. Piracy trials also cost money and compensations and punishments cost more.

Even if you aren't prone to allergic reactions to anything, you have no idea what you're going to encounter in a hotel/hostel, what plant will be in the air, etc., and finding medication like that can be very difficult when you don't have a common language. Two summers ago a friend and I were in Europe for six weeks total, and in Rome he had a terrible allergic reaction (we much later figured out it was probably the detergent on the sheets in the hostel). The spots all over didn't go away with my benedryl, but the itching was calmed at least. He had none with him because he's not typically an allergic person.

In terms of items, your own towel. It's not just a Hitchhiker's Guide thing. Sometimes the hostel website will SAY linens and just mean sheets and you'll have to buy horrible towels from the sketchy store down the street that shed lint all over you (truth). It's just nice to have, otherwise, and worth the space.

Sunscreen. If you're out every day I don't care how much you tan instead of burn, you don't want to be red and ouchy while you're trying to have fun. This one can actually be difficult to find in some places. I had to argue with a woman in a store in Taiwan who claimed I didn't need it because my skin was already so light. 

Advice I got and stick to on the Passport end of things is to make sure there is a color copy at home with someone (or multiple someones) you trust. I scanned mine and email copies to my mom, stepdad, dad and brother before trips. That way they have it, I have a copy saved in my email (along with a paper copy as said above) and I feel just that much less likely to end up detained in an airport somewhere. 

Learn how the public transportation works in the cities you'll be visiting before you go. You don't have to know everything, but being aware of London's zones, for example, can save you some time and hassle. I also always try to stick to things on tracks (read: no buses in foreign languages) but that's just from some bad personal experiences getting lost.

Finally, plan ahead for things you want to do in the cities you'll be visiting. I'm not talking daily itineraries down to the hour, I'm just talking about things like knowing about Roma Pass and how to get it. Make a list of things you want to see and take a look at a map: what's close together? What's going to take a whole day to get to and see properly? Does something have weird hours? Some of the catacombs in Rome close during lunch, for example. You won't want to waste time figuring out what to do when you're there; you'll be too excited to just go do it!

I haven't changed a single argument I've made, I've only provided a wider array of examples and pulled from larger sources to help make the point.

Every time I mention legitimacy, you keep bringing up your preconceived notions of what that word means and using that to condemn me. It's pretty clear you don't have a clue what legitimacy actually means (as evidenced by your accusation that I am using the ""statist"" definition of it).

Legitimacy is a social process. This has been known in social science for decades. It is the process by which people come to see a particular person, organization, or institution's ideas and rules as ""legitimate"", and worthy of being made the status quo. When the majority of Germans agreed that Hitler killing Jews was a-OK (a great many of them agreed passively, by simply accepting it, but it was agreement nonetheless), then Jewish persecution became the status quo in Germany. In the eyes of Germany, he had legitimate power. In the eyes of most of Europe, he did not. If, hypothetically, the rest of Europe HAD deemed this legitimate, then Jews in every other European country would have been rounded up and killed by their respective governments.

At no point have I suggested, or will I suggest, that this was right or fair. Only that it was a natural consequence of the social process of legitimacy. And, likewise, the consequences of being thrown in jail for defying the state are not ""right"" or ""fair"" - they are the natural result of the state being given legitimacy by the majority of its citizens.",t1_c34jtsw,[deleted],,,0,True,t3_muqaz

Make sure you can actually get it to the bag racks that are generally over your head. 

Know the embassy locations in any country you go to. Have copies of your passport. We had some on the laptop we brought, printouts on us, plus the actual passport. My parents had printouts, as did my (UK) grandparents. 

If you go to Portugal, those lovely olive and random appetizers they give you? They charge, just an fyi.

Also, when I went, I had an Anne series book, and ""Are you there, God, it's me, Margaret."" Totally make room for one, comforting thing. At some point everything is going to be horrifyingly alien, and the thing you love will help.

And pay as you go phones? If you buy it in Germany? It might not be refillable in the Czech Republic. Ask about that if you get one. Same with payphone cards. Also, payphone are super hard to find. If I had my trip to do over again, I would have found out rates from my US carrier, gotten their value pack, and turned it on so I could call my parents. You don't want to be the almost crying girl in country x because you ran out of coin for you pay phone and you miss your mom. Get that communication set up now. Either through your US provider, or Skype, if having US phone communication matters.

I'd also not do traveler's checks. A few were great to have, but they are much harder to deal with these days. Just call and talk to your bank and find out International costs, and make sure they know where you are going. Also make sure you have their 1-800 number multiple places, plus their international number, if they have one. You need to be able to call if you get robbed.

Also, make sure you have enough stuff to be warm/too hot. You do not want to treck to your hostel in a sweater when you are boiling any more than you want to when frozen. May to June means you need a full range of stuff. Love layers. Pack a hat and gloves, just in case.

tl:dr: ask for socks, undies, first aid kit, travel sizes of shit you love. And read the whole thing if you are traveling. If you are backpacking, take a towel and some wash clothes.

edit: Will edit over and over again as I think about my trip, sorry.

Edit 2: If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer. I think I have, at this point, covered everything. If you have any questions about what to bring or where to go, please let me know. But I am also going to add, if you like applicator tampons? Bring enough for three periods. I rarely saw those in Europe.

Sigh.  He can't.

Here's the reality: Congress and Wall Street have made a deal.  (Understand that Wall Street controls the Federal Reserve Bank - the ""Fed"" board is made up of top officials from the big banks.)

Wall Street keeps interest rates disgustingly low - 2% or less, when real inflation is several times that PLUS we get a series of ""bubble economies"".  In the US alone we've had the tech bubble, the housing bubble and the education (costs!) bubble all in a row and overlapping.  In Europe and China the low interest rates spawned by the Fed had bubble effects there too.

When the interest rates are so low as to cause chain-bubbles PLUS the interest is nowhere near the real inflation rate, people's savings are being ripped off en mass.

So why the low interest rates?

So that Congress can run massive budget deficits ever - single - year, in violation of every basic economic principle.  Including Keynes, who argued for gov't debt in bad times but also said that it needs to be paid down in good times!  Congress is buying our votes with our own (future) money.

So what did Wall Street get out of this?

The ability to fleece US taxpayers and citizens dry with literally billions of dollars in fraud, and regulators all look the other way.

Look...the S&amp;L bank scandal of 1985/86 was 1/70th the size of the bank frauds that blew up in 2007/2008.  In the S&amp;L scandal, 1,000 people were criminally convicted for fraud.  But now, with 70x more fraud, we've had...well, lesse, we jailed Bernie Madoff, big whoop.  One, maybe two others.

What the fuck?

Well the fuck(ed) is us.  Because there's a deal between two  devils, Congress and Wall Street and we're caught in between, getting chain-fucked sans lube from both sides.

Nothing else can explain why the Fed didn't raise interest rates when the housing bubble was obviously going to blow, predicted as early as 2003 (and not just by Ron Paul and Peter Schiff).  Why not raise interest rates to bring the bubble under control?  Because the federal deficit would have blown the fuck up from the interest rates.  The Fed (run by Wall Street) serves as an enabler to the Congressional drunken binge spending.

We.

Are.

I never said you're not an engineer. I just said you're full of shit.

&gt;They are wholly the same thing, what you are claiming is nothing other than a strawman.

Strawman! You've been slinging nothing *but* strawmen arguments this entire fucking time, and then say ""my"" arguments are weak. Don't tell *me* about strawmen.

&gt;To say that your ability to choose should be limited by your class, is unto itself amoral to this I will point to the immoral treatment of Black Americans as slaves.

What are you talking about? If you have wealth, you have far more choices and, by definition, more autonomous and more *free* than someone without wealth. 

&gt;If people only wish to be cogs in a system, they get no sympathy when the need for cogs is fulfilled, leaving them idle.

People *are* cogs in a system. That system is called the universe. There's not a fucking thing any of us can do about it. Whether or not we want to order our society within this universe by legislation and law enforcement won't change that.

&gt;So, you're exhibiting the Back-fire Effect form of Cognitive Dissonance. Cool.

No.

&gt;So cannibalize the companies to the point they either cannot survive

What? No! More strawmen. Jesus christ. I've said it and I'll say it again: you're full of shit.

You don't tax companies, profits, investment, or any of that, you tax *wealth.* As a matter of fact, I'm quite favorable to the idea of the FairTax (though there are good arguments against it).

&gt;Thus the true ultimate end of progressivism: only when we are all dead from starvation are we all equal

Europe is pretty progressive. Canada, too. Last I checked, they're *not* starving. This is nothing more than ignorant rhetoric.

&gt;It is then of no coincidence that the OWS movement in toe with ""progressivism"" is sharing numerous parallels to the early stages of the Bolshevik Revolution. 

Oh, god, really? The Bolshevik Revolution was the *second* of two revolutions, in which a certain minority took power after completely toppling a monarchy. I'd like to have some of what you're smoking if you think this is anything like the Bolshevik revolution.

By the way, the Bolsheviks were funded by Wall Street via the Red Cross. In fact, it probably would have been impossible for them to take power without that money.

&gt;Under your system, yes it would implode because any given corporation would only accumulate until dead.

*My* system? What, exactly, is ""my"" system? I'm not the one here pretending to know what system is best. I'm neither libertarian nor progressive; I just like to participate on these boards and call people like yourself out on their bullshit.

And convince me it *won't* happen in *your* system. I've had this discussion many times with many libertarians. Nobody has presented any concrete evidence that this won't happen in a free market. It's all fucking handwaving and theorycraft.

&gt;This fable you're telling does nothing to give itself any kind of believable or rational foundation. 

*I'm* telling? You started the story. I just finished it. And you *know* I'm right: once most of the wealth is accumulated in the hands of the few, the economy simply can't function.

&gt;In the end, humanity has gone through cycles of power grabs by ""noble crusaders"" who have done massive harm under the banner of good.

There's also domestic German politics that play into this, so let's get this off the plate first. Skip to *[Part II]* below if you don't care to read all this.
 
As you probably know by now, the ruling coalition in Germany isn't doing all that well and is widely seen as dysfunctional. Here are the [latest polls](http://i.imgur.com/upjSg.jpg). The (neo-liberal) FDP, the junior partner of Merkel's conservative CDU, wouldn't even make it into the parliament with the 3% they're at now. The opposition rather vocally supports Eurobonds, but Merkel would have a hard time convincing her coalition to support them, and this coalition might even break apart under such stress. Normally, the conservatives could try to form a new coalition with the Social Democrats, but presently the opposition parties would make significant gains if new elections were held (likely resulting in a SPD/Green coalition, depending on how well the Pirates would do), so that's what they'd play for instead. You do not want to see a government crisis in Germany right now.

Two other relevant factors that are Germany-domestic play into this. One is the Weimar Hyperinflation, which still affects the collective psyche and economic thinking. That paying for government debt by printing money is bad is dogma. The other is that Germany went through its own crisis when we held the ""sick man of Europe"" title a decade ago, and austerity measures like the reform of the social net along with wage moderation are part of the reason why Germany is doing so relatively well right now, even though they were highly unpopular and eventually cost the SPD/Green government the reelection.  
What is ""asked"" of the GIIPS right now is of course on a different level, and at this extend even counterproductive in the present situation, but perception of how deep the cuts actually go are obviously skewed when looking at it from a distance through a lens of righteousness.

*[Part II]*

Against this backdrop and in the face of *immediate necessity*, Merkel doesn't have much room to maneuver. Of course, had she acted more decisively earlier on, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.

Several countries are in a tight spot right now, but the underlying reasons are really quite different. There are those with good or even exemplary government financials that got in trouble when housing prices collapsed because they had an overleveraged financial sector and/or have structural problems because they were too reliant on construction. They need space to breathe and time to figure out their problems. In others, governments acted irresponsibly, and they actually do need some austerity (and the pressure to make it politically feasible), although the extend to which this is happening right now might go too far. Those countries also have a problem with corruption and nepotism, and those are issues that can't be solved over night.

The latter are the reason why the potential moral hazard of Eurobonds or allowing the ECB to act as a lender of the last resort might have negative long term effects, both for their own economic development due to the lack of necessary reforms and in the form of permanent transfer payments. Without a mechanism to ensure reforms and long term fiscal responsibility, the fear is that we'd find ourselves in the same spot we're in now a couple of years down the line, but this time with a precedent of how avert collapse by simply handing over a checkbook.  
However, the immediate need to act along those lines is clear. Otherwise we'll all be fucked.

*[Part III]*

What I *think* Merkel *might* be trying to do is to use the collapse scenario to force the EU into a solution that is at least somewhat palatable for Germany domestically and would minimize the potential negative long-term effects. IMHO, this would be a tighter integration of the Eurozone in which members have to give up some sovereignty over their budgets in exchange for core countries (at least partially) underwriting their debt in the form of Eurobonds and/or an ECB funded bailout. This would cost the core in the form of permanent transfer payments and higher interest rates that go beyond the current EU structural funds, but in return there would be stability. Also, the core benefits rather handsomely from having a common currency, and could keep doing so.  
This is a scenario isn't really popular anywhere. The Eurozone core doesn't like to foot the bill, the periphery doesn't like austerity and the loss of full sovereignty over their budgets, and those outside the Eurozone don't like to see it push ahead with European integration. But for everybody it would be preferable to economic and political collapse.

Obviously this is a high-stakes gamble and the risk of failure is immense. However, you can imagine that negotiations over measures to ensure long term fiscal responsibility would go very differently without the immediate need to find a solution. I think it's obvious that we need a reform. The question is whether our politicians are able to for once be pragmatic and find a compromise that will work in the long term and is acceptable for everybody. We'll find out very soon. I have my doubts, but I'm certain that they wouldn't be able to agree on a solution when the pressure was gone.

Amnesty International has criticized it it in the past, especially in regard to its policies against criminal foreigners.

On the religion thing, let's talk about the separation between church and state in Denmark. Oh, right, there isn't one. Surely you've heard of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church? And on the societal level, religion does play a role, despite the atheist population; or maybe it's just plain racism against brown people. I mean, have you even heard of [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders)?

Contrary to your assertions, this isn't an issue that's going away. Racism and Islamophobia are tendencies on the rise since the 1970s, ever since increasing amounts of brown peoples started flocking to the lands of Cnut the Great.

I'm not saying Denmark isn't a great country. It is, primarily because many of its institutions are committed to creating a progressive society. But I'm not willing to blindly participate in the Scandinavian circle-jerk. There are substantial racial and anti-Christian tendencies in *both* the young and old populations. To ignore those problems would indeed make anyone ignorant, never mind his or her pedigree. And for the record, my grandparents are Danish and I've visited twice before. You guys are very friendly. But that might be because I'm white.

I'm sure your experience with Danish society has been great, tolerant, and blissful. I commend Denmark for helping foster that which gave you the blissful ignorance to rail against a non-Dane.

The following line of reasoning is a bit fallacious because I'm putting the cart before the horse, but it does help with understanding the ratings. The USA, while downgraded to AA+ by S&amp;P, has an interest rate that reflects a AAA rating. In effect, investors are ignoring the rating agency and saying that there is no default risk. To some extent, that's the truest rating because these people are putting their money where their mouth is.

Meanwhile, the interest rates in many eurozone countries reflect relatively high possibilities for default, especially among PIIGS. A common-area eurobond would involve some of these countries guaranteeing the bond, which is little guarantee at all given the very real possibility that Italy and Greece especially might not be able to fulfill its financial commitments in the near future. Ratios are good and all, but the question at the end of the day is ""will I get paid?""

I think it is a valid method, given the inter-reliance of European economies; Similar to the subprime mortgage backed securities that ushered in the US crisis, the risk characteristic of higher-rated tranches are contingent on the lower-rated tranches, so the rating of the eurobond as a whole should rest on the guarantee with the highest possibility of default.",t1_c34ga7a,[deleted],,,5,True,t3_mwl2u

* I am saying however that there is MUCH more to Euopean history than religious power plays. Yes, Church and state were often one in the same, but if you look at the large majority of ""negative"" proceedings you will see that they originate in the state. This is what Martin Luther was essentially talking about when he nailed his list of complaints to the door of the Church. 

Do you honestly believe the rulers at the time thought that the crusades were to reclaim the Holy Land? Europe needed a common enemy, Jerusalem used to belong to the west, and the Muslims had wealth to plunder.

**I am vehemently opposed to the war in the middle east.  You know nothing about me, and you made a completely baseless assumption from the fact that I don't believe war should be declared based on a fucking plebiscite.  It's a serious decision, and if it's made by an increasingly ignorant, lazy, decadent and self-absorbed populous, it's almost always going to be a poor decision, or even when correct, correct for the wrong reasons.  As it is, the level of support for the Republican candidates demonstrates that the majority of Americans don't understand jack shit about economics - and the ones who vote liberal are right by coincidence.**

We live in a *republic*, because direct democracy is simply tyranny of the majority, whether that tyranny involves a Christian majority banning gay marriage (or science, or atheism, or...), or it involves a poor majority deciding to impose a 90 percent tax rate on the high-income households, or any other kind of tyranny, it's simply *wrong*, and it has *never* lead to a functioning society when more than a city's worth of people were involved - and *that* was in Ancient Greece.  

There is *no* developed nation on earth that goes to war based on a fucking *public vote* - there's a reason for this, and the reason is that it's completely retarded.

Is that clear enough?  Does that explain to you why your ideas of how democracy works and how people behave are childish and completely unthought out?  Or are you going to disprove my argument and argue with an imaginary strawman again?  Because that's all you did.

&gt;What exactly have any of the ""countries"" in the middle east ever done to America? Really. Go on and find some things. I'll wait.
My prediction is that the answer is, nothing to really speak of. Nothing at all really. They provide no real military threat to us, or really anyone who doesn't poke their nose in how they govern themselves. I would imagine that the number of US citizens or US property damaged by ""arabs"" prior to 9/11 paled in comparison, as in orders of magnitude, to the number of civilians that our military has murdered while their over there.

&gt;Like it or not, under Hamas, the small but vibrant Christian community in Gaza has disappeared. Not that Fatah has been terribly better: numbers of Christians in the West Bank have been dwindling as well. There have been numerous cases of violence perpetrated against them. Those aren't opinions. They are incontrovertible facts, not up for debate.

Attacks in Gaza against the Christian community have been very isolated, and by no means are they the norm. You see the same type of violence against minorities by fanatics in every society in the world, including much of Europe - I've seen it first hand in the UK, more than I have ever seen it anywhere in the Middle East. Hamas has not pursued a policy of persecuting Christians nor are such occurrences the rule. They are the exception.

In the West Bank, the dwindling numbers are down to higher growth rates among the Muslim population than the Christian one, not persecution. 

&gt;If you truly think that a rising tide of extreme views, particularly among the Shias, was not responsible for a good chunk of the strife in Lebanon, you're pathetically wrong.

&gt;Their leadership, and not just in Hezbollah, frequently makes explicit threats against the Christian community and the Druze.

Welcome to Lebanese politics. All the sects hate each other - that's what civil war results in. They are all trying to gain dominance and all act blindly in the perceived interests of their individual sects, the interests of the country as a whole be damned. 

Hezbollah and the Shi'a bloc happen to be the most powerful political/military force today. Threats against the Christian and Druze communities are not a result of their religion - that is how relations between the various sects and political blocs are in Lebanon, and have been for decades. 

If you've lived in Beirut, you should know this. Back during the civil war, it wasn't just threats that were being made - those with Muslim names were executed at checkpoints by Christian militias, and vice versa. Tens of thousands were senselessly killed. It all existed way before Islamic extremism became a major factor in Lebanese factor. 

The problem in Lebanon is much deeper than extremist Islam, which is but one (relatively new) player in a Lebanon that has always been divided and suffered from sectarian strife. ",t1_c34k9d0,Breakingbad8,,,1,True,t3_mvy1q

Google up the Zoeller [interview](http://upload.the-force.eu/podcast/q_and_a_with_georg_z.mp3) at the summit. He is OK with the game as it is. They want you to start a new char as soon as you reach 50 and play it's single player story. Why should anyone bring such a statement? 

&gt; I think you're forgetting that MMO means Massively Multiplayer Online. Both games actual fulfill this very simple requirement

There is not even anything massive about it btw. Instanced Planets...I mean. Sure Orgrimmar can get full but it is at least alive. 

&gt; This presents many options that singleplayer and multiplayer games don't offer such as dynamic grouping (Hey, we both need to kill these monsters, lets team up) meeting strangers and becoming friends, forming guilds to tackle the advanced content together.

My point is that I've never seen a game where this is unneccessary or even a bad choice (see companion points excample above). Guilds are a topic for itself. Atm the game has not even a guild bank...

&gt; However, SW:TOR actually has more features designed to encourage group interaction than WoW does. IE; the previously mentioned roll for conversation options and social points, and these will be available at release.

You did not read my post did you? As I said. The social points are crap and they are already implemented. How did you miss them? You can buy a Leia [bikini](http://i.imgur.com/fArAL.jpg) for it and you lose a 50% chance (in a 2 person grp) to win a conversation and therefore a chance to get the relevant companion points. It makes more sence to do the conversation seperated. 

Have you played WoW recently? I think since BC there is a system that rewards groups with 3 or more players with additional XP. Since LK there is a system where you get additional guild XP (know this? You can buy stuff with it or advance with you guild granting your bonuses.) if you join dungeons in a guildgroup. You can even do guild achivements. Anything of that in TOR? Not even close to it. And as I asked before: have you ever seen a questchain in WoW where you get seperated at the end of it to kill the boss alone?

&gt; WoW doesn't have features like these and has become little more than a glorified lobby from which to raid, run dungeons, and PVP

You have no idea what the endgame content for TOR is do you? I asked you about Ilum but as I said above, you've propably not even read my post. 

&gt; Leveling a character is a JOKE. I actually have an interest in leveling up other classes not because I want to play that class but because I want to hear their story. You simply can't say that about Wow

Really? I have around 10 chars in TOR now. I've heard 2 stories. I spaced the other away. I don't even do the sidequests anymore because it is a waste of time just to hear that I have to kill another x NPCs or click this or that. You don't really belive that you would hear that story again. To come back to your anti-game WoW. they've just redesigned every old quest including the whole questingareas. This and the phasing made thousands of new characters grow because ppl wanted to replay all their old areas in a advanced way. With quests that are far more interesting that the stuff is inbetween the cutscenees in TOR. But from what I read, you have no idea about it do you?

&gt; Personally, I don't know about Ilum or Tattooine.

So you missed the most MMORPG part of it. And I'm talking about Ilum only. Tatooine is a joke for itself. 

&gt; I haven't had a chance to play that far and the game's current state doesn't reflect release 

In fact it does. What I'm playing atm is the RC. 

&gt; I look forward to seeing how Bioware develops social points

Funny how you missed them. You propably never played in a group. They are implemented since many builds and I mentioned them in the post above. But as I said: you propably did not read it at all.

&gt; I think, in the end, that you sound like a person desperately clinging to WoW like a man drowning.

I am also from Europe, a pretty squallid part of it as far as morals and kindness go, but I can tell you that I also have asthma and when I was your age I also got beaten, luckily not in my own school but kids from other schools came around to beat us since we were a language school. Anyway, at the time I weighed half my leg nowdays, and was completely unable to phisically defend myself. I could run a bit, but that made me feel awful.
There is no easy way out of this. Snitchin will only get you in trouble , especially if you call names, and you gonna grow up into a half man unsecure individual that will always depend on others to stand up for him. It is imperative that you start taking care of your body and grow strong. I started training around your age and today I am a martial arts master even tough I still don't look too mean,but  I had problems with asthma and all that, hardgainer, but the body always finds a way to capitalize from it's flaws, you must believe that. For example, my condition and constant training were a no go, but I kept on, used my Ventolins (at the time it was the most efficient drug), and just worked really hard. In years I have developed a pretty decent anaerobic endurance, so the first time I ran 400 m I went under a minute  (28 yrs old). Never doubt yourself and your body. You must do that in order to gain the confidence necessary to become a strong and able individual.
It is hard. Pick up something easy for starters, like karate or those soft kickbox classes they offer. If that is too hard, go for tai chi, you can't believe the amount of benefits it provides and it develops some very nice skills in a completely discrete way (i.e. you don't have to get beaten or break your back in training+it improves breathing drastically).
First step is to start training, improving yourself and gaining conscience of your own skills and abilities. That is as far a global plan goes.
As for your current situation I suppose it is ok to talk to the kids parents, but that will only postpone the problem. YOu'll come to other schools and classes and there's always gonna be some asshole that will smell the weakness in you and exploit it. It can be awful and get you to do something stupid and immoral to prove yourself. Don't fall  on that path. Have your parents talk with his but try to avoid school staff. That way you will show that idiot that you are not a snitch, and perhaps he gets it and leaves you alone. Seriously, play your cards right. First card is talking to his parents, second is school staff. Because once you make it official there will be repercussions for you socially, other kids will disrespect you for being a crybaby, so try to keep that in check. Parent talk (hoping his parents aren't also wild cavemen) can work out just fine. Don't snitch, don't mention booze and stuff, play it as it is:you're no match for these kids due to natural disadvantages so you ask them to stop nicely, if not, there is a system that punishes such behaviour and you will use it. And if you do use, do so in the full extent! Once you take that road make sure you have him in loads of trouble with the school, police, what not. 
But always remember, you gotta arm yourself with something. And I don't mean weapons. You need to grow a pair, have confidence, outrun them, outtalk them, whatever...just have something you believe in. And don't let asthma be an excuse for not training, you are in the best years to start developing skills.

That and it's not painting an evil threat.  That's from your perspective.  I dare say Putin doesn't consider himself evil but that that he still stands by the points the article makes.  It's elaborating on a pending  Putin Presidency and his own goals which he's made clear.  He will control Gazprom, he does want to revitalise a Eurasian Union.  It has threatened New Start if the missile shield does not come down.  Any progressive European should be able to empathise with all of those.  Gazprom should be nationalised, or at least come under strict regulation and pay into a sovereign wealth fund, much as Norway has successfully done.  It makes sense for Russia to establish an EU based free trade area with its own satellites.  The missile shield does compromise New Start and puts the broader Europe at risk.  It's designed to stop ICB missiles from hitting their targets by blowing them up over Eastern Europe instead!  It's also consistent with what Russia has said all along.  It's the US that agreed to scale it back and then announced a month after agreement that it would slowly start extending its capabilities to include ICBMs by 2020.

Tisdall is putting an informed opinion out there based on fact.  It doesn't make him right, but the higher-browed reader knows that.  He's a columnist employed to write topical commentary.  Many people, myself included, may well not agree with the lack of transparency and corruption in Russian politics, the FSB, but will welcome that the article pitches that Russia may become a counterweight to the US and drive Europe to alternate fuels.

We found that hostels tended to be about the same price for the two of us as a cheap hotel room, which is why we ended up at a lot of hotels instead of hostels.

We did travel with my sister as well for a few months. When we shared a 3-person room, the cost was usually about the same per person as it was with just 2 people, but sometimes it was a bit cheaper.

This essay will discuss the most important changes in the constitution brought about by referendum of the citizens since 1937. In addition it will show how the majority of these important changes, which include divorce, abortion and the Good Friday agreement, are all tied together and to perhaps the most important change of all: the decision to join the EC.
One of the most significant changes to the constitution is the 3rd amendment, enacted in 1972, which permitted the state to join the EC. As a result, the states involvement in international affairs increased dramatically and economic growth rates increased. Indeed, the changes to the constitution are further reaching then those brought about by the 1937 constitution itself.1 The amendment was passed with a large majority of 83.09% and a voter turnout of 70.88%. This has been highest turnout ever seen, and it shows the public felt that joining the EC was of high importance.2

By joining the EC, Ireland opened itself up to many new opportunities and the positive ramifications can still be felt today. One of these in particular was access to the European Regional Development Fund, which was proposed in 1972 and was set up and running in 1975. This fund was established to create sustainable jobs and economic growth, and to encourage transnational cooperation. Ireland benefited greatly from these innovative features and they smoothed the country’s path for the coming decades. Following the 1988 restructuring of this and other funds, Ireland received vastly increased funding which in turn increased the number of jobs throughout Ireland.3 It should be noted that while this did contribute to the decade known as the Celtic Tiger, the subsequent crash had little to do with the funding Ireland received from the EC and EU. Other factors such as adopting the Euro may have contributed, but that has no bearing on the successes enjoyed before the crash.

Another significant change to be considered is the constitutional amendment concerning divorce. A similar change had been proposed in 1986, but it did not pass the referendum issued. Less than ten years later, it passed. However, it passed with the narrowest margin ever recorded in the history of the state, with only 50.28% of the vote.4

Ireland’s population has become younger and more urban. Continuing emigration has meant that traditional rural communities are no longer isolated against social change. The Irish people face pressure to change from those both within and outside of their society, and they are relenting.5 This is partly a result of the decision to join the EC, as the younger generation wanted to be able to compare itself to other Western European countries. This was most noticeable because, for once, there was an bipartisan consensus in favour of divorce.

In contrast to the other amendments mentioned in this essay, the amendment concerning abortion is the exception that distances Ireland from other Western European countries.  While the vast majority of the referenda held and passed seem to bring Ireland closer to other countries and Europe in particular, this amendment separates Ireland from them. It passed with 66.90% voting for prohibition, with a turnout of 53.67%. 
While abortion was already illegal in 1983, the 8th amendment was introduced to prevent it from being legalised any time in the future. At the time Ireland was influenced by the Catholic Church to a certain extent, though religion had ceased to play a significant role in European politics. In some countries religion has no direct influence on political behaviour, in others the relationship is there but largely passive.6 To date, there have been five constitutional referenda on the subject of abortion in Ireland—the most recent on 6 March 2002. Despite these repeated referenda and ongoing debate at the national level, Ireland’s abortion laws continue to be among the most restrictive in the world.7
To this day Ireland receives criticism from the United Nations and non-governmental organisations, ranging from Amnesty International to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Woman.  However, these criticisms seem to fall on deaf ears.8 

The 19th amendment, concerning the changes made to the constitution in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, is another important change. It was perhaps the most popular referendum put to the Irish people.  It was one of the most successful of all time, with a turnout of 56.26% and the approval of 94.39% of the people who voted for it.9 The withdrawal of territorial and jurisdictional claims in the Irish constitution was an extremely important event. Ireland went from 32 counties down to 26, and consequently the Troubles ended.
In contrast to many amendments, the 12th in particular is one that most probably effected a large number of people in Northern Ireland and the Republic. Ireland had strived for an end to the troubles for many years. While at the time there was uncertainty over whether it would be lasting, after more than thirteen years it seems that even the most pessimistic of people have come to accept the change as definitive. The border checks are gone, and while there are still occasional attacks, it can be said that they are at an all-time low.
It is debatable whether the EU contributed to the peace process and thus consequently to the Belfast Agreement in any way, and it has been discussed in great lengths. One of the principal architects of the Belfast Agreement, John Hume, strongly believes that the EU contributed to the Northern Ireland peace process.10 
Over the last twenty five years, Ireland has experienced increased sovereignty as a proactive member of the EU and, hence, as a more visible member of the international community.11 Additionally, as Ireland and the U.K. were both members of the EU they gained a more balanced footing than had been seen in hundreds of years. One can suggest that this contributed to making cooperation between Ireland and the U.K. more palatable.

In conclusion, this essay argues that the amendments mentioned were some of the most important changes to have happened in Ireland in the last seventy four years. Perhaps the most important change of all was the decision to join the EC. This decision benefited Ireland greatly and, while current affairs highlight the negative effects, the positive ones should not be forgotten. The statement that was made in the introduction that these four amendments were interlinked by the decision to join the EC is perhaps a flawed one. While it is true that the majority were influenced by European standards, there is at least one exception. 
The amendment concerning abortion is one that makes Ireland stand out in a large way. With it, Ireland has clearly separated itself from the moral and social views held by the majority of Western Europe. While Ireland has definitely become more liberal over the years and other European countries have influenced that, Ireland is still one of the more conservative European countries. For example, divorce is no longer banned. However, getting divorced is not a simple process.
The Good Friday agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles that plagued the north for over 30 years, was the most effective. It can be argued that the EU contributed to the chain of events that lead to the completion of the peace process, but this view is not shared by everyone.
