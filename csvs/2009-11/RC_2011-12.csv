Adoptions of children from the United States, especially those in the Midwestern poverty-stricken states have risen by 600% since the news network first began airing the undercover footage.
PM of the Southern European Union made a public plea last week urging others to offer assistance to these children.  “We all should be offering a hand to those fallen on hard times.  Not merely a wave of the hand as we walk past, but an outstretched arm, pulling those who have been trampled on so harshly, and grasp them tight until these churning waters subside.”
The TMZ reports describes the conditions to be an affront to the senses, poorly lit, a hanging smell of urine and haunting, feral yells of countless children.  The orphanage, exposed in the undercover report, is a makeshift shelter originally used as a children’s hospital and contains an estimated 850+ children.  There are volunteers shown in the report who do what they can, but as the report explains, far too few.  One volunteer remarks, “It’s a place used for so long to benefit sick children… and now has become a last stop for so many healthy ones.”

The entire report can be viewed on the TMZ website for those with an active monthly subscription.

I don't believe in Christianity at all, prayer doesn't work, the bible is plagiarized and ridiculous to boot. I think christianity has some good morals and ways of life but that doesn't mean it has a monopoly on them.

That said I base my morals on what makes the most amount of people happy at the least amount of pain or other negativity. It's basically utilitarianism but I add compassion to it. I'm always seeking for better morals and big questions. I don't think I have a soul or purpose but I do have a conscience and choice.

I can be selfish at the expense of others or I can be charitable and help others; so I would want to be charitable and help the most people. If I was low on funds however, I would be less charitable because I could go bankrupt and wouldn't be able to be charitable at all.

As far as sex goes I'd say it's between partners on what is allowed and what isn't, I think most sexual lifestyles are fine as long as they don't hurt anybody. So I'm pro lgbt and anything in between. Legalize love.

I'm not too savvy as far as law goes but some basic things I believe in are personal freedoms, a fair social net that provides shelter, food, water, healthcare and other necessaries, direct democracy and ultimately whatever works best. I'm also in favor of internationalism but right now I'm trying to figure out the basics so my political views will probably change as I learn more.

I think that humanity should take care of itself as individuals and as a whole. It makes sense to me that you would help a family member in need, even if it's your spouses side or a distant relative, why not go the extra inch and help out a stranger in need? A broken leg is broken no matter what your income and lifestyle. As far as paying for that I think America could learn from countries in Europe that have experience with a more socialized medicine, or our Canadian neighbors.

In many ways I felt like I was learning the art of courting all over again given how different America was at times. I got myself into situations that at least taught me a lot. I think European women tend to be a little more assertive than American women when you are talking to them, American women in my experience tend to be more reserverd.

So in other words if I'm talking to say a Swedish woman she is a lot more likely to smile, turn her body towards me and joke with me but Swedish women are just laid back, it's not always a sign of ""sleep with me, now"".

American women like I said tend to be more reserved but the reserved women are bloody hard to read. I remember going to a party and spending a while talking to a pretty blonde. She didn't seem too interested, hardly made any eye contact and basically when she came back my way she didn't sit too close to me.

A couple of days later at Berkeley(most of my friends were Berkeley students in the US as my cousin studied there and introduced his friends to me) I find out that shes avoiding me.. because I didn't ask her out despite the obvious signs she was giving me. Are you bloody serious?!?.. I didn't say that but I was thinking it lol. I did ask her out and we dated for a while and got along great.

As for the women who are open with you, well to be honest I think all women should be like that. I mean don't get me wrong theres nothing wrong with being a little nervous though it takes a very confident person to ask somebody like that out so you are probably reducing your chances significantly, but it's a good thing to be open and honest. That doesn't mean be rude just don't be afraid to reciprocate the treatment you are receiving, if somebody is being nice to you then try and return the favour regardless of whether you are male or female.

If I mistake a womans ""signs"" she can always say no when I ask her out or ask for her number, it isn't a blow, if you aren't willing to take that risk then you are losing more than your gaining. Rejection for a lot of men in the US seems to mean some sort of horrible wounding blow. It's not that big of a deal though and if you are avoiding asking people out then you may be missing out on a great lady you have read wrong. I certainly learnt that the hard way and changed my attitude towards women that seem reserved. I don't think you should change what you are doing, that particular fault tends to lie more with men but a easy putdown is something you should practise IMO.

Even when places like Europe have a stagnant or even negative birth rate, there are places like Africa where the birth rate is sky high.

Eventually, whether it be 100 years or 1,000 years, there's going to be a serious food shortage.

I believe that proactive steps to prevent, or at least delay, that inevitable event should be taken - one of which is to implement a population control plan. Nothing as drastic as say China, but at least some sort of plan to slowly control the birth rate. 

At the same time, in an unrelated manner, I think that our space agencies should all be working towards a single goal: the eventual colonization of space. Humanity has all of its eggs in one basket, and Earth definitely wont last forever, be it a nuclear holocaust, uncontrollable population growth, or some other third thing.

People from different parts of the world have different skull shapes, for example.  Different skin tones.  Different eye and hair colors.  Different muscle densities or bone structure.  These things all tend to differ from one geographic area to the next.  For example, the negroid race (Africa/Indian ocean/native Australians) differs significantly from the mongoloid race (East Asian/native Americans).

You seem to be working off of a different definition of race than everyone else.  Whether you want to admit it or not there are genetically divergent groups of human beings.  We call these groups races.  People who don't fit neatly into one have a mixed ancestry or exist in the tails of phenotype distributions.

Phasing out the word race is a politically motivated endeavor.  A biologist or forensic anthropologist will tell you that people belong to certain groups, usually called races.

EDIT:  This may be more reading than you care to do on the subject, but there is a great Nova article about this that explores both sides.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html  If you read nothing else of this comment I really recommend giving it a read.

The article has opinions from an anthropologist on each side.  I tend to agree with the ""pro race"" stance, especially because a number of arguments used by the ""anti-race"" side are fallacious.  first:

&gt;I should point out that this is the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. To this day, few have actually made the observations and done the calculations that led those Renaissance scholars to challenge the universal perception that the sun sets in the evening to rise again at the dawn.

I'm an Astronomer, and I can tell you straight away that this is factually incorrect, and the two issues aren't all that similar to begin with.  

&gt;As a rule, the boy marries the girl next door throughout the whole world, but next door goes on without stop from one region to another.

This is factually incorrect as well.  There are very sharp geographic (and climate) delineations that create sharp divisions between populations.

These are both dwarfed by the massive admission the author makes here:

&gt;There is nothing wrong with using geographic labels to designate people. Major continental terms are just fine, and sub-regional refinements such as Western European, Eastern African, Southeast Asian, and so forth carry no unintentional baggage. In contrast, terms such as ""Negroid,"" ""Caucasoid,"" and ""Mongoloid"" create more problems than they solve. 

The problem with race is not it's definition but it's connotation.  There is no difference between differentiating people based on geographic region of ancestry, which this author says is alright, and races.  It's a syntax argument, made for political correctness.  The problem is the ""baggage"" carried by the terms, not that the terms are incorrect.",t1_c342qe9,[deleted],,,2,True,t3_muszw

Hippopotamus. The service is unbelievably bad. 15 minutes after being seated, we were asked what food we wanted to order. They hadn't given us any menus. Even then, the waitress just wandered off and we had to go and pick up menus ourselves. One of our party had to ask four times before they would deliver her non-alcoholic drink. An hour or so in, some random waiter appeared and tried to top up our water glasses with a carafe of tap water. This was despite them all being half full of bottled sparkling water. And the water bottle being in the middle of the table. And us serving the water ourselves for the preceding hour. Fuck knows where he'd been since we sat down. All this in a restaurant with only three tables full. I'd hate to think what it was like when it was busy.

Martin Bosley's. The wine waiter doesn't know how to serve wine (i.e.: you don't serve it without asking if someone wants to taste it first, and you don't pour it into a glass that's still half full from the first bottle. Especially when they're different wines). They have no idea what stocks the kitchen has, so they'll come back 30 minutes after you order and tell you that you have to change because they've run out of tigers toes or whatever.

here is an explanation of US EPA TierII

which also covers CARB, so no need to worry about California or special case states.

NOx in bin 5 (which is what your fleet must average) is limited to 0.05g/mile

Up until the last 10-15 years, soccer (now known as football officially) was primarily played by migrants and the children of migrants.

And the migrants came mostly from UK, southern Europe (Italy, Greece) and the Balkans (Croatia, serbia, etc...) but some also came from Hungary and Poland.

When they moved here, they really didn't know English and tended to stick together and participate in sports they knew like soccer as it was called. They also formed clubs based along ethnic lines. So in Melbourne there were teams like Brusnwick Juventus, South Melbourne Hellas, Melbourne Croatia.

In the mid 70's, the ASF formed the National Soccer League and every team was ethnically affiliated somewhere.

And it continued like that for a while, but they found it hard to compete with the VFL/NSWRL. The only time they usually made the papers is when say Melbourne Croatia played a team with Serbian heritage and there were riots.

It still kept going but they switched the season to summer but they realised they were struggling to attract non-ethnic supporters so they started bringing in franchise like teams like Perth Glory. Collingwood FC had a team called the Warriors who played at Vic Park and Carlton had a team called Carlton SC. While Carlton only lasted a couple of years, they did manage to produce some great players like Bresciano and Archie Thompson.

But by the start of the 2000's the NSL was on life support and coupled with the Socceroos inability to qualify for a WC, the Australian government ordered an inquiry and the report suggested 4 main points...

1. Get rid of the NSL
2. Ban existing state teams  from using ethnic names
3. Create a new league with no ethnic affiliations
4. Join the Asian confederation

This created the A League. Also in the first year, Australia finally qualified for the WC and due to the fact they're playing more often, qualified for the 2010 WC as well.

This has created problems for RU. Up until 2006, the Wallabies were the premier national team brand as there is no internationals in AFL and int RL is a joke.

Soccer isn't so much part of the code wars. The AFL/NRL administrators don't see soccer as a threat because although alot of kids play it, most don't stick to it and will eventually cross over to AR/RL/RU.

I attribute Europe's birth rate problem to a culture that is highly secular, and a society where a high standard of living and a high level of education (as well as the easy availability of birth control) have prompted families to choose not to have children. This isn't a reality for places with high birth rates like Africa, and probably won't be a reality for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I don't think that it is likely that the entire world would see a dramatic decrease in birth rates.

Also, we need to remember that all of the factors that are attributable to low (and high) birthrates aren't static.

While he was gone, she sent threatening eMails (thinking he was just avoiding her), cheated on him, went through every emotional outbreak there was (jealousy, anger, vindication, lies, mental manipulation, just to name a few), and finally realized that he was gone. The last eMail was titled ""IF YOU LOVE ME YOU WILL READ THIS ONE AND DELETE ALL OF THE OTHERS WITHOUT READING THEM"". Needless to say, he read them, and posted the unfortunate hilarity online.

Before that distance, that doubt was created, they were strong. All it took was a breakdown in communication for the entire thing [to go to hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg-heCy0CbQ).",t1_c346wtg,AbsolutionJailor,,,3,True,t3_mvia0

The reason I responded somewhat harshly is becuase in a lot of ways, the public is badly misinformed about HCV. EDIT: Just take a look below at a comment by castellammare where this user COMPLETELY misreads a report and tries to claim that cure rates for Hep C are at 99%./EDIT  My immediate family member was part of 4 clinical trials over 14 years that all eventually became FDA approved drugs, so I've been keeping up to date and am very well informed about Hep C treatment.

Basically, the statistics saying that cure rates exceed 80% only apply to Genotypes other than 1a and 1b.  The problem is that in North America and Europe, the vast majority of people have Genotype 1 HCV.  In other words, those statistics make it seem like HCV is less of a serious issue than it really is.  I havent seen any numbers showing up to 40% with PegInf. and Ribavarin alone, but I do have documentation showing 0-5% for Genotype 1.  I do know that in the last study my family member participated in, PegInf. and Ribavarin along with an NS3/4A inhibitor achieved cure rates of up to 40%.   The problem is that there is essentially no hope for the other 60% of Genotype 1 infected people because the next wave of anti-virals, Polymerase inhibitors and NS5 inhibitors, are at least 3 years away.  

Also, we REALLY need to develop more treatments that exclude interferon, because simply put, it is extremely brutal to endure.

Also, I have seen PSI-7977, which looks very promising.  Hopefully they can push more drugs in that class through faster.

I think most of my frustration comes from the fact that back in 1997, doctors were saying that the first wave of anti viral drugs would be out in a maximum of 5 years.  Well 14 years later, there is only 1 class of drugs currently approved.   It mostly stems from a lack of attention and resources.   Even the CDC listed HIV as a 'beatable' virus, but completely failed to acknowledge HCV as a problem.  I know there are tons of fantastic drugs in the pipeline, but we really, badly, needed them 10 years ago.  IF HCV had even a fraction of the media attention and resources that HIV has had, then perhaps BOTH diseases would now be manageable with a drug cocktail. Now, it is too late for millions of people who will die on the liver transplant waiting list.

Portugese?

Look, I never wrote expressly Portugal. All European nations were involved, and the United States did not exist as a nation until 1787. It was Europe that did this. It took 72 years to pass the 13th amendment to outlaw slavery explicitly. But it didn't just happen on the 72nd year.

As I also wrote, in *Commonwealth v. Jennison* in 1781, *

It has been a usage -- **a usage which took its origin from the practice of some of the European nations,** and the regulations of British government respecting the then Colonies, for the benefit of trade and wealth. But whatever sentiments have formerly prevailed in this particular or slid in upon us by the example of others, **a different idea has taken place with the people of America, more favorable to the natural rights of mankind, and to that natural, innate desire of Liberty,** with which Heaven (without regard to color, complexion, or shape of noses-features) has inspired all the human race. And upon this ground our Constitution of Government, by which the people of this Commonwealth have solemnly bound themselves, sets out with **declaring that all men are born free and equal -- and that every subject is entitled to liberty, and to have it guarded by the laws, as well as life and property -- and in short is totally repugnant to the idea of being born slaves. This being the case, I think the idea of slavery is inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution; and there can be no such thing as perpetual servitude of a rational creature, unless his liberty is forfeited by some criminal conduct or given up by personal consent or contract** ....

.

You are just parroting what your teacher is saying in your class, that is all. Or does he or she say something different?

&gt;Plus, I not an American, I don't have the bias of the Ameican civil religion to burden me.

So this is to mean that you have no bias??? Pssh. Exactly from which country do you hail?

&gt;Is the Constitution a great document? Yes. Is it perfect? No

It is you, as a young (?) college student that demands perfection. I, and most, would never say perfect. The only thing that is close to perfection that I know about is me.

If you move to Europe you won't see close to as much propaganda against China, even if you see some from time to time. Moving to Canada might actually be moving far enough, but I admit I do not know enough about Canadian politics to state that with any certainty.

My point was, the only country I know of in the west where the propaganda against China is so incredibly bad that the general conception you spoke of could be that of them being crazy, would be the United States. In the United States it's as if both politicians and the media jump at every opportunity they get to portray China in a bad way. It is rather one sided. I doubt many Americans could name many of the good things the Chinese government has managed to do for its country in past decades, while most Americans can likely name a lot of things they've been told about China's wickedness.

Perhaps I was simply mistaken, but it seemed to me that you believed that most of the west somehow shared the Republican Party's opinions on China. I should probably point out that most of Western Europe probably considers the Republican Party to be more dangerous and aggressive than the current Chinese government. I'm being quite literal here. The last time the Republican Party was in power they were extremely aggressive towards Western Europe and said quite some nasty things. They even fuelled a massive anti-Europe propaganda war over in the United States.

I can't say I have ever seen such aggressiveness from China in my lifetime. If China hates us more than the Republican Party does, then they sure go about it much more quietly and less rudely.

We really weren't spending like crazy on other things, either. We were pretty tight in Europe, but once we hit Asia we started being able to afford more food/alcohol/sites because lodging was so cheap. Probably one of the reasons we enjoy Asia so much more than Europe...

I personally am quite happy with how much we ended up spending. It was well worth it to me. Glad you have been able to do the same.",t1_c33zq61,rixie,,,1,True,t3_muofe

Never forget 90% of all start-ups fail.  VC-funded start-ups only do slight better at 70-80% failure.  If the expectations of anyone were any different, that would be Epic Fail on *their part*.

The part I suspected before this and this article confirms as the biggest mistake was actually targeting the US as the primary customer market.  

This was fail because the US has largely already been bypassed on most Green technology and in terms of [Technology Adoption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle), the US ""Green Market"" is very definitely a ""Late Adopter - Laggard"" that is risk-averse to even the concept of Green Energy, let alone a new, untested (market-wise) technology.  Late adopters always wait until everyone else has ""proven"" the technology - they are never the first ones into the water.

With that particular market, you can not sell based on premium performance or price - those are Early Adopters.  Who would those folks be?  Europe first.  Asia second.  US a very distant third.  Currently 95% of world wide PV consumption is Europe and Asia combined and has been for while.  

Probably doesn't fit with the ideology of patriotism that probably came with the founders and any government money, but facts are facts.  If you want to target the US you'll have to do it with minimal risk and price which is why First Solar with it's more ""conventional"" manufacturing probably has a good shot in the US as their beachhead.  Conventional means lower perceived risk for the Late Adoption US market - it's a better impedance match, sales-wise.

What would have been the ""right"" strategy would have been to target that far larger market of risk-tolerant Early Adopters to generate the volume to move the technology down the learning curve as quickly as possible.  I.e. focus on Germany primarily and the rest of Europe, and if that worked out OK, next Asia, then finally the US.  Of course that begs the question about siting in the US in the first place.

As the article mentions, Solyndra had the highest unit price in its competitive space AND was trying to sell to risky new technology first to laggard market rather than beach-heading in a richer, more risk-thriving market in Europe or Asia.

To me, aside from the technical market fitness questions, this was the biggest problem.  

Of course hindsight is 20-20 and looking more ""macro"" like this is typically one of the 2nd or 3rd order skills you'd like to have and cover as a start-up but often can't.  It's often a roll of the dice and as I said, statistically there's a strong ""Darwinian cleansing"" that occurs with start-ups.

&gt;They are at least an even match with us, or will be within the next 10 years.

At *least* 10 years, if not longer. This is assuming that their economy doesn't crash and a lot of economists are predicting it will. I hear their economic policy being called ""unsustainable"" a lot. I'm not an economist, though.

&gt;sustain it for longer

They couldn't sustain a force on U.S. soil large enough, or for long enough to force us to surrender. If they're going to win this hypothetical war, they won't win it with their infantry. Infantry with inferior equipment and training that is inferior to the U.S.

&gt;They also exceed us by orders of magnitude in technical degrees per year.

Their population also more than triples ours. We should be producing fewer lawyers and more scientists though, not going to argue that. However, number of graduates is somewhat irrelevant. The United States still has the finest university system in the world and we're still ahead in terms of research and development. At least for now. If anyone is going to surpass us, it's Europe. And Europe is a lot more buddy-buddy with the U.S. than the Chinese.

&gt;The only way we would ""win"" would be if other nations came to our aid, and I'm not sure that would happen.

There's a good chance that we could. And if it got to the position where we needed help, we could probably get some. If Beijing is in a position where they feel confident enough to declare war on the U.S., they've probably already ruffled more than a few feathers. Odds are, some of those feathers belong to various European nations. Nations that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: the most powerful military alliance on Earth, which the United States just happens to be a part of.

&gt;considering our foreign policy mainly consists of taking a shit on anyone who doesn't agree with us.

No, we only shit on little countries. Countries who wouldn't help us anyway. We may claim Pakistan as our ally, but we still shit on them, just like they shit on us. They wouldn't help us, just like we wouldn't help them if/when they attack India. Which is where they would fire their nukes, not at us or the Chinese.

&gt;Even then, we would lose in the sense that our country, economy, and standing in the world would be ravaged.

I'd rather lose in that sense than in the sense where Washington D.C. is occupied by Chinese troops. I'm sure the federal government will agree with me, as will the military. This whole scenario assumes that China declares war/attacks first. They are the aggressors, not us. That makes them the ""bad guys"". Just look at what happened at the end of World War II. Were the nations of the world looking at the United States and going ""Aw, mean 'ol America, bombing Germany and Japan."" Hell no. They both declared war first (*in Japan's case, after they already hit us with a sneak attack, but I suppose that was unintentional*) and so they were the aggressors, the bad guys. You could honestly claim that WWII did more for the image of the U.S. than almost anything else in history.

I don't want to see a Sino-American War, but we would *probably* win if we had to fight it.

The english came about and simply took our handiwork and used for their own purposes, and have treated us like garbage.

Our culture is rich, intense and recognized around the world as a world-class culture. It is the only thing that differentiates us from the anglo-saxons, so we want to keep it dearly, it’s the most precious thing we have.

And that most precious thing can be freely shared, unlike money that has to be hoarded and niggardly dispensed if anyone wants to attain some wealth.

That precious culture, we hand it out freely, but we will never allow it to be wrenched away from us permanently. We have fought tremenduous forces and temptations designed to have us ditch it and espouse the conqueror’s.

We have steadfastly refused to do so for a quarter of millenium now.

You are welcome to come here and help us build it.

But be aware that we will never tolerate anything that remotely threatens the survival of our culture against the unfavorable odds that surround it — we’re outnumbered more than 40 times in North-America.

And having been “nice” for two centuries have brought us close to extinction. So this is why I am not “nice” and will fight with all my might to protect my culture.

Having had been consistently short-changed by the english, it’s not surprising that we are progressive; we have seen first-hand what an unfettered  “frea-mahkit” can do to a country, and we certainly want no more of it.

A lot of people are startled with the “separation” thing.

lol. I've literally stayed in ROYAL CHAMBERS for less than that. I've lived like that in India, Nepal, Thailand, Egypt, Ukraine, Russia, Italy etc. All of those places you can easily find a place that is ok and costs under $15 a night for a single and usually around $30 for a double. In certain places like India, you can get even cheaper. I had a double room at the top of a greek-style villa with a landscape view overlooking the ganges for 400 rupees per night, that's less than $8 AND luxurious. I stayed in *ok* places that were only 100 rupees per night in Nepal. In Ukraine and Russia I stayed mostly around hostels, but usually got a room to myself for around $10.

If you get away from the standard chains and look for smaller hotels, you're sure to find amazing deals. Shop around, haggle over room price, especially if you're going to be there for more than 2 nights, and it's ok to play hotel managers against each other for your business. Saying, ""hey, this guy at Blah Blah Inn says I can have his room for blah blah price and that room has a nicer bathroom, but I want to stay at your hotel because I like the location (or whatever), if you can make me a deal.""

&gt; €10/day for food

That's about right for food costs, if you don't mind your budget and are ok with eating in restaurants. You can survive for as little as €3 per day if you only buy from street vendors or cheap diners (if you have concerns about food safety, then only buy grilled or fried things and fresh fruit from the street vendors.) In Egypt, a normal shawarma wrap costs about 12 pounds, which is $2, that's a full meal unless you're a glutton or a body builder. In India, you can easily eat big meals twice a day for less than, say, $7 per day.

Even living like that, I still have lots of money for souvenirs and transportation, buying drinks in clubs, going on tours, etc. I even bought out a movie theater in Darjeeling once because nobody else bought any tickets, so they weren't going to show the movie unless I bought 10 tickets (only $0.50 each, though).

What are they then? I have yet to know exactly what they are for. And lets get things strait, right means small government, left means big government, explain it in those terms.

&gt;the effects would be disastrous and far reaching on most of the population.


Compared to the effects that are current, I prefer they fail and we live with the effects. It is the less worse to let them fail on their own and have us suffer, than artificially prop them up, have them fail, and suffer twice as much.


&gt;for those with lesser income the burden is a lot more than those who still have a few million after taxation.

Because the rich would pay less, an economic domino effect would occur and in turn produce more wealth for the poor so more taxes could be paid. But there will always be those who still do not earn as much. Making a tax excuse for them will give incentive for people to find ways around getting taxed so that they find a way into that marginal population. That incentive will create a backwards economic domino effect and we will have more poor classes as apposed to middle classes. And plus, no one starves in the U.S., poverty here is basic cable and potato chips.

&gt;but the fact that these policies usually do end up making the rich richer and the poor poorer regardless of what other things you want to occur.

Wrong. They make a stronger middle class. The rich and the poor are equally as corrupt, the future lies in the middle class.

&gt;Liberals are more willing to forego the process of giving up a few liberties so that a more equal society is available for all.


Every attempt to equalize the society has made the society equally poor. When you give up freedom for equality, you get neither freedom or equality.

&gt;Conservatives are also for the abolition of some liberties (abortion is one example)

It's a states rights issue, not a federal. I can't speak for other conservatives, but I am for abortion because it is a natural way of reducing the populations, crime, and preventing vagabonds from being born. Plus if you outlaw abortion only outlaws will have abortions. And it creates jobs :)

&gt; So long as everyone is restricted equally, it's still an equal society, after all.

Well lets not mess around and be objective about this philosophy. Person X was born with a stronger body, a higher tenancy to concentrate, and good looks. Person Y was born with a weak body, low concentration, and he is ugly. Person X becomes more successful than person Y. They are unequal. Following the philosophy that everyone should be equal, we are going to prevent person X from fulfilling his perceived wants and we are going to help out person Y so that he gets to the level of person X. Person X could have done great things, but he shouldn't because that would make person Y less equal. Person Y, even though he was helped out and given the opportunity to get to the level of person X, didn't make anything useful, valuable or worth while. Now we have no one making anything because we don't want to be unequal.

This example illustrates that equating every one is only harmful to the society because it prevents people from acting. It is not that society makes people unequal, it is that some people by nature are unequal. Liberalism is folly because it tries to equate the unequal, an act that contradicts nature itself.

Furthermore, the idea of equating society is a classic Marxian ideal. The ""classless society"" is impossible because in order to eliminate the classes, or ""inequality"" if you will (it is the same thing), you need a strong state. But what is to stop that state from becoming a class itself? By trying to equate society, you make a greater unequal society because the state becomes a class itself; a place where person X can go and be corrupt.


&gt;Social darwinism, to liberals, is a lesser way to promote equality than governmental regulation.

Again, the state becomes a class itself and more inequality occurs. Just accept that you can't make the world equal and you will become a conservative.



&gt;Liberals see taxes as a fair price to pay for living in a civilized society.

That statement contradicts this one:

       &gt;for those with lesser income the burden is a lot more than those who still have a few million after taxation.

So... for or against taxing the poor?


&gt; For liberals, they often participate in both, like I'm sure most conservatives do as well.



That is not true. [Red states give more to charity than blue states](http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/June/200706261522251CJsamohT0.8012354.html), and the U.S., the most conservative country in the world (compare it to Europe, Canada, etc), [gives more to charity than all the other social democratic nations](https://www.cafonline.org/publications/archive/international-giving.aspx). So yes, it still holds true that the poor can be taken care of without government intervention.

&gt;Hopefully I don't just get downvoted to hell, because I'm tired of all the hate mongering here and want to participate in some actual informed debate.


This place has more liberals than /politics. I, an actual conservative, will probably get the down votes.

1. The lack of democratic accountability of anything the EU does. MEPs are directly elected but as only 1 of 3 pillars of EU power they don't have as much sway as perhaps they should.

2. Specifically relating to the eurozone - it was doomed before it began it was always a case of ""when"" not ""if"" something bad would happen to one of the PIGS countries. This was hampered by France and Germany breaking the Stability and Growth pact.

3. Following on from above - the EU project is entirely political and for this reason far too much horse trading gets in the way of sensible decision making. E.g. Danone, maker of yoghurts is a ""strategic"" company according to France.

4. The EU as sold to the British in the 70s was that of the EFTA / EEC it was *not* what we have subsequently been drawn in to. Many of the older generations feel that politicians purposely mis-led people because they knew that a political union would have been voted against.

5. As a result of 4. we have not had a referendum on pretty significant Treaty changes which has riled a lot of people. I daresay we'd vote to stay in the EU but by not having the vote we are making people increasingly unhappy.

6. The EU constitution and Lisbon treaty debacle also shows that there is a ""political elite"" running the show with little consideration for what the people of Europe actually want.

7. The CAP. This is a disgrace.

8. In my opinion the EU is too left wing, the majority of the EU countries are not exactly free trade and this does not sit nicely with the majority of the UK.

9. While France and Germany remain allied on European issues it would be hard for any other group to push an agenda since those two countries make up a significant amount of the EU (this is also one reason why the UK has been keen on EU expansion)

When I was a kid I was very pro-American, having been there several times I still admire many things about the place but I do think we align closer with Western Europe these days. 

So I would say I am eurosceptic because it has been poorly set up and poorly thought out.

it was sci-fi with a pseudo realistic look. it had ingame events like morpheus running arround played by a real person .. he was able to change physics and the dynamic of an area. you had to do special event quests prior to the event itself to attend. during the event there were also quests that where fraction based. only one fraction could win and get the special quest items - and have insight into a secret story line. they also had random appearances of neos dead body floating arround. moments like those where pretty amazing for me. when matrix online first started there where a lot of servers. (lots for us, lots for europe etc) but when the player count decreased they ""merged"" those servers and you pretty much had one or two pvp/pve servers per region. this was actually pretty cool imo .. while i understand the technical reasons for multiple servers i always disliked the idea .. met somebody who plays the game ? different server .. meh! i don´t understand why nobody thought about this a little more - different planet -&gt; different server. wanna meet ? -&gt; go to the same planet .. (replace planet with continent if you like) but maybe thats just me. also i liked the different ""pvp"" &amp; ""pve"" approach. pve servers also had the ability to fight everywhere when you accepted it. (not special pvp regions like gw) but then everybody from the other fraction was able to attack you -&gt; lead to pretty intense mass fights 

i also tried GW .. i liked some parts of it but i just can´t handle the setting (for me gw, lotro, wow are the same setting - sorry i can´t relate with orks and stuff). also tried lotr:o but there is not enough ""action"" and too much traveling / running arround to get from point a to b. while i understand that exploring is a major part of a mmo i don´t see why i have to run 30 minutes from quest a to b and then another 30 minutes from b to a because i can´t efford a horse. boring ..

sorry for my bad english.

my ideal mmo ? neuromancer setting, only on server per region (euro / us / asia /  africa ), real time events, only 3 fractions, sci-fi/realistic look, pvp everywhere .. no ""go there kill x monsters of dungeon y that looks like the last 500 dungeons i´ve been in"" missions ..

Sure, it was a developing economy.

Nobody claimed Romania was an economic powerhouse like Germany.

It's not a question of morality.  I don't know why you keep mentioning morality, as it's only you that has used this word in the entire thread.  Certainly I have not used the word, so how you conclude I see it as a question of morality is beyond me.  It's a question of whether the Austrian controls on their banks are needlessly strict and will do more damage in the long run.

The PS3 wasn't released in Europe until March 2007. If you think  the fact that the platform enjoyed a 151% growth rate *in the first year it was available* is somehow statistically significant in comparing PC to console sales, then I find it difficult to take anything you say seriously.

Looking at the documents you're linking to, I can see that sales on the 360 and PS3 are continuing to grow at modest rates while the PC is staying largely stagnant and the PS2 is finally seeing its market collapse. Unfortunately, what your Nordic reports don't comment on is the change in installation base for each platform. Based on reports from other countries, though, I'm willing to bet that the increase in 360 and PS3 game sales is being largely matched by the increase in 360 and PS3 machines on the market. (While, of course, the number of people who own a PC hasn't changed.)

Something else to notice: Looking at the actual euro market for the PC vs. console market, the total PC market grew by a couple million.  The total console market? Lost 40 million. (The 360 and PS3 grew, yes. But the collapse of the PS2 market annihilates those gains and the Wii just makes it worse.)

**So the numbers aren't actually saying what you claim they're saying: In reality, the Nordic PC game market remained steady in 2010 while the console market suffered significant losses.**

If the PC market is suffering compared to the console market (bearing in mind that the numbers you've brought to the table actually indicate the exact opposite of that), I suspect the reality is that punitive DRM schemes are pushing a lot of PC customers to buy console versions of a game even when they would normally prefer the PC version. That's certainly been true for me: Bioshock, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed. All major titles I've bought for the console because of DRM on the PC. There are also lots of PC-only games that I simply haven't bought at all because of DRM. 

And now we're seeing Ubisoft and other developers simply refusing to release games for the PC in franchises which used to see PC releases. That will further deflate PC sales, but it won't tell you anything about piracy. It will only tell you about the effect that publishers' extreme paranoia and anti-consumer practices are having.",t3_msqre,hamlet9000,,,1,True,t3_msqre

I can provide you perhaps with some help on some aspects of education (against the background of my expertise: European history):

In medieval and early modern times education wasn't something that was highly theorized. There were these manuals on how a christian household should be run and should behave (Oeconomia Christiana = Christian housekeeping). There was always specific attention to how children (and adults) should be educated, in order to live by the christian ideal.
During the 18th and 19th century, together with the institutionalization of society, real pedagogical programs were thought out. And at first these programs were focused on getting the highest possible amount of the people educated.
Near the end of the 19th century a different approach was preached with the Pedagogical Reform. The critique on the 'education for the masses' was that it didn't focus on the individual capacities of students. So they tried to overcome this problem. But only in the 20th century it became part of the humanities, and it became a scientifically based discipline.
This is a quick sketch where I cut more than a few corners. If you'd want me to get more into detail, please let me know.

A good book on the history of ""housekeeping"" and the conduct/education of family members is the English translation of [Aries' Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Centuries-Childhood-Social-History-Family/dp/0394702867/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322735957&amp;sr=8-1).

Another great book on education is unfortunately a Dutch book, which hasn't been translated. Don't know where you're from, but if by any chance you speak or understand Dutch you should pick it up. It focuses on education in the Netherlands, but it contextualizes it in a European context. It's [Vijf eeuwen opvoeden in Nederland: idee en praktijk 1500-2000 by Noordman e.a.](http://books.google.be/books?id=mT9CrHjhTnUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vijf+eeuwen+opvoeden+in+Nederland:+idee+en+praktijk+1500-2000&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=4XvXTu7QJcXqOdKNnbcO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)(=5 centuries of educating in the Netherlands: theory and practice 1500-2000)

Also thought of the genre of the 'The Book of the Courtier'. A manual for the elite on how to behave properly. It educated the nobility on how to conduct themselves. For instance: when you dine, you should eat with knife and fork. 
And even if these books were meant for the nobility, they still have a profound influence on today's etiquette. 
One of the most famous of these manuals is [Castiglione's Il Libro del Cortegiano](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Book-Courtier-Classics-Baldesar-Castiglione/dp/0140441921/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322744510&amp;sr=8-1)

Cutting your balls off has a chance of failure?

&gt;B) it would be completely impractical to tailor the rule of law for something like this, and impossible to regulate altogether.

Incest is illegal as it is now, unless one or both sexual partners are sterilised. One can not request marriage with next of kin unless either they or the other is sterilised. Voilà, you have regulations which are exactly as effective as the current regulations.

&gt;Mythology is fact now?

It's based on the ideas of the culture it developed in. What mythology considers good, the people who wrote it considered good. 

&gt;I thought we were past comparing this to homosexual situations?

No, we really aren't. As long as both concern a monogamous relationship rejected by a certain aspect of society, the comparison holds.

&gt;They're not permanently denying their kids happiness, they're saying ""hey, ANYBODY BUT ~~YOUR SISTER~~ the person you love most in this world.""

I'm not talking about some random case of affection or sexual experimentation here, I'm talking about the principle of the thing. If you love your sister like people love the people they marry and not divorce afterward despite being financially independent and not having anyone depend on their continuing marriage.

Whether it rule that forbids your love also forbids sexual intercourse with all people you are capable of feeling sexual attraction for is irrelevant to me.

&gt;You wouldn't be unhappy at all to know that you'll never have grandkids (or at least not normal ones)

Yeah, who knows, they might even be *Chinese*. This applies to homosexuality just as well, and all solutions available there are available here. (Having somebody else provide the sperm or the egg and womb, adoption, childless companionship).

&gt;that you'll have to deal with the shame of it going public

Shame? If I am a social pariah for doing/allowing what is right, I'll carry it with pride.

&gt;  or just plain and simple struggle with the knowledge that your son is putting his penis inside your daughter's vagina?

Or your son up your other son's ass. Or that your daughters are scissoring. Incest doesn't have to be heterosexual. But even that disgust were to exist, it wouldn't be *justified* because they aren't doing anything wrong. I would silence that disgust, just like I silence the disgust I experience when I see two men making out, or the touch of fear when I see a group of black people walking towards me in an empty street at night.

&gt; I think your mindset would change a lot if this situation became real to you. You can rationalize it all you want now, but once that happens the game changes.

Then I can only hope my rational mind defeats my emotional mind. But as someone who speaks from a distance, I can be objective. Regardless of my emotional state, my emotional state would not warrant the illegality of my children deciding to have sex with anyone. Emotional disgust at others is *never* a good enough reason to make something illegal.

&gt;But what I do know is that if there's a massive barrier in my way, I'm not going to go out of my way to break it and then fall in love with the person on the other side.

From what I understand it goes the other way around. Your physiology decides whom or what you fall in love with, the relationships then falling within certain categories, some of which are taboo. You hang out all the time, laugh at the same jokes. Then one day you look each other in the eye, one thing leads to another and before you know it you've screwed your sister. Oops.

There aren't any walls to be broken. Not if you have incestuous desires. I can understand why you wouldn't break through that wall, because for you that wall exists. But for them it doesn't. What makes that so terrible?

&gt; see it as a developing human being dying

Same difference. 500 living human stem cells parasitically bound to the uterus lining is the same as a developing human being at a week or two since conception.

&gt;because two people want to break some rules.

Which they do because they love each other.

&gt;They can find happiness elsewhere without killing something in the process.

So you're pro-life then?

&gt; but forced sterilization to do the same thing is okay? Both of these things are a restriction of liberties. And what if one day, these kids wise up (as they usually do) and decide they want to go have kids with someone else? What then? They're screwed for life.

As I've said before, there are hundreds if not thousands of facilities where human eggs and sperm are kept in cryogenic storage, to be thawed, fertilised and implanted into a willing host. Their reproductive capability isn't removed, it's just disentangled from their sex. So it doesn't restrict them freedom; it increases it, by giving them the ability to decide when and how to get pregnant.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, I was under the assumption that you would consider the ban of interracial marriage to be inherently wrong.

&gt;What the hell are you talking about?

The arguments you gave concerning interracial marriage outright stated that if the two found themselves in an environment which would stigmatise them for it, their marriage would be a bad thing. Since this was about legalisation, you said that under certain circumstances - specifically, social rejection - interracial marriage should be forbidden.

The youtube clip in the link concerns the first interracial kiss on American television. There was an entire shitstorm about it because many viewers might disapprove, and the studio actually wanted to air it without the kiss, but Shatner intentionally ruined the shoot where the kiss didn't take place, forcing them to air the episode with the interracial kiss. And thus they, unlike you, kept their ground against social taboo.

&gt; Culture is tyranny of the majority. But you'll never get rid of that.

Multiculturalism. Cultural liberalism. There are plenty of ways in which a government or a people can express their ability to accept ideas which offend them.  The United States was founded on the principle of multiculturalism: of a secular state which didn't choose one religion over the others, with free speech, freedom of congregation, relatively few sexual appropriateness laws, etc. And much Europe today still maintains a lot of this sense of openness, though the Islamic terrorist scare has reduced it significantly.

&gt;And as I understand it, you think that the moment condoms were invented, all of humanity should have all of the sudden disregarded social customs grounded in thousands of years of culture as if that's easy to do. Social change doesn't happen overnight. I'm sorry to break that to you.

I'm not asking you to disregard social customs, I'm asking you to disregard *social condemnation*. I'm okay with you not being willing to consider the possibility of banging your sister. I truly am.

So would you approve of an incestuous couple? Of interfamilial marriage? Would you support legislation which legalised it? Would you defend its legality in front of your peers, or at least anonymous internet folk? Could you accept people in an incestuous relationship as your friends?

No, they've said they won't RECOGNISE Israel and made the distinction clear about how they perceive the difference between ACCEPT and RECOGNISE.

         Because of many factors, we now accept to build a 
         Palestinian state within the borders of 1967. But that
         doesn't mean that we recognize Israel. But we are 
         prepared to make a long-term truce with Israel. 
         Accepting the status of Israel without recognizing it.

     Rainer Rupp: But no recognition? Doesn't that mean 
         continued tensions and war? 

     Khaled Meshaal: No. There are plenty of examples 
         where no recognition does not mean war. China and 
         Taiwan, for example, have not recognized each other, 
         but they trade and cooperate with each other. By 
         withholding a formal recognition, we just don't want to 
         give Israel the legitimacy for having taken our land in the 
         first place.

http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rupp.php?articleid=10195

&gt;It is fundamentally wrong the the Palestinians land was grabbed from them, but they lost it in battle nearly one hundred years ago and we are where we are today, and its from that position that the solution must be found.

Hence why Hamas, the Arab Peace Initiative, the Israeli left, a former Mossad Chief, the EU, and international law all focus on 1967 borders and not 1948.

&gt;If the muslims demand it all back because they feel and want to go to war with Israel fair enough, but they will lose, Israel are a formidable force to be reckoned with, ;eading your people to constant defeat is a mugs game.

And if they do lose the situation either resorts to something along the lines what we already have now or Israel uses it to justify internment and ethnic cleansing - political pressure which it won't survive.  If it doesn't do that then it still has the demographic and refugee problem.  If it absorbs the Arabs then Israel either ceases to be democratic or Jewish.  Which for Israel's government and the Zionist project is end game.

&gt;The two state solution could be workable but only when peace reigns which isnt in the minds of enough of the players.

Exactly, which is why ultimately a one state solution will be the only alternative, which the Israeli far right won't accept.

There's a reason why a former Mossad chief has taken to his soapbox and said they must accept the Arab Peace Initiative.  He knows that if they don't Israel will implode and the Arabs will ultimately win everything.  Accepting the offer of a two state solution is what they have to do, but Israel won't.  Palestine will because it still leaves Israel with a growing Arab demographic and hobbled as a progressive state by a growing far right and orthodoxy.  Time is on the Palestinian side, and they know it.

1. Oops, you're correct. I think the ""anti-EU"" lot objected because it was a definite move to an integrated and federal state. As per point 4 I think the UK is generally hostile to this. I certainly think we should be given a referendum on it. Equally, it was clear from the ""No"" votes in France, Netherlands and Ireland that there was widespread unhappiness with the way in which things were changing.

4. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975) is a link which gives some information about the vote. As can be seen it was clearly a vote for the EEC and not the EU as it has become.

6.  ""I'd add that there is a political elite running being told how to run the UK by big businesses, so I'm not sure what the difference is. ""

Uhm, ok. Tin foil hats aside the people in the UK have the power to vite parties in and out of office. Lobbying happens across the EU as well as the UK. The point was that the EU Constitution/Lisbon treaty was steamrolled over the ""will of the people"". 

8. EU right-wing != UK right-wing; The UK has a greater free market tendancy than many countries in the EU. Take Sarkozy, technically a right wing party but, being French, he is far more protectionist by instinct than the Tories. 

9. Yes, though cant find any suitable references for it. The UK was/is keen for EU enlargement and was a supporter of getting Turkey in as well as most of the former Eastern Bloc.

&gt;""Many were unwilling to leave in the early '30s because they could not conceive of what would happen. This was of course was not unique for the Jews. It was also true for many of the other populations and nations that suffered such genocides and holocausts.

This has nothing to do with the right of return. It is a reflection on human behavior -- that Jews were not unique in such behavior, and behaved as many other people did. That people in many cultures who may have had the opportunity to flee such areas, but stayed put for a variety of reasons -- denial, disbelief and more.

Immigration attitudes in the US during the 1930s became hardened in great part by the depression. Immigrants were seen as competing for US jobs. Rightly or wrongly, immigration in general was greatly discouraged, repatriation was encouraged, and with some immigrants forcibly deported to their origins. By the early '30s net migration into the US had become negative. 

Jewish immigration to Israel was controlled by the British who intermittently controlled the flow, and finally terminated it by 1939.  Jews had the opportunity to escape to Israel during the '30s. But the '30s were a very mixed period. Many Jews saw the actions of the Germans as a way to bring about a migration to Israel by actively promoting anti-Jewishness. This strategy was promoted by Herzl and others even before the Nazism existed. Some 10,000 Jews were members of the Italian Fascist Party before Italy's alliance with Germany changed the status of Jews in Italy.

Funeral home: the guy who owned it inherited it and the guy who managed it was the owner's wife's crush. Weird.

Moving company a. Guy married some lady who's family was worth money...as in *owned* a leer jet money. Got trucks and a warehouse out of the deal. 

Moving company b. Sons inherited huge moving business. Too busy collecting cars/building vacation homes/having employees do side work as a ""favor"" to manage anything effectively. 

Embroidery place: trohpy-ish wife marries a hardworking guy, convinces him to let her manage the shop, hires two sons. One ran his computer business out of this, taking up space and time, the other was a coach/child molester who went on the run after the police were on to him and got caught in Europe. Basically, the two sons were managers who got paid but didn't show up to work and used their time to do other things.

Coffee Shop/Bakery: attractive girls were hired and hooked up with the boss. Because he was always in the shit he tended to take it out on the manager who was pretty mousy and didn't know anything, and she took it out on you.

Computer animation company: pretty sure the CEO married his girlfriend because her mom was a higher up at a government agency that all of his lucrative contracts somehow came from.

Gustav Cassel was Swedish economist who not only predicted that tight monetary policies due to a flawed gold standard would lead to world wide deflationary depression in the 1920's.  He also prescribed that the removal of the gold standard and monetary expansion to meet the surge in the demand for money would end the depression and allow countries to grow.  His insight allowed Sweden to reinlfate their price level and the country was the *first* to the leave the great depression in 1934.

Its great you also brought up Sweden, their early 1990's policy on their own housing bubble and banking crisis is a blueprint that the US should have followed in 2008.  And for the record I also support your second idea but view it as less feasible politically.

But what does that mean today and how does it relate to monetary policy during the great recession and more importantly the impending crisis in Europe?  I will allow Lars Christensen to reinterpret:

&gt;Cassel clearly explained how gold hoarding by especially the French and the US central banks was the key cause for the tightening of global monetary conditions that pushed the global economy into depression – exactly in the same way as “passive” monetary tightening due to a sharp rise in money demand generated deflationary pressures that push the global economy and particularly the US and the European economies into the Great Recession.

Hmmm, nothing about sucking cock there, just a good old fashioned understanding of the demand for money and its consequences when those demands are unmet.  If money demand increases 4 times but the money supply only 3, you have effectively tightened monetary policy, which is exactly what is happening right now in Europe.  Money demand is increasing for US dollars as the Euro zone implodes, which would effectively tighten monetary policy in the United States and slow the great recession into the great depression II. 

If you are still reading, here is a link to a comparison of [Sweden, Poland and Denmark](http://thefaintofheart.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/poland-didn%C2%B4t-miss-many-beats/) and the great recession, certainly there is a reason that Poland and Sweden where able to avoid the great recession?

Now the banks, via the rating agencies have shown their gratitude by driving some countries' debt way up, so that e.g. Greece would have no way of ever repaying without outside help.

As a former member of this community of spiritual interest (like many of you, I was forced into membership when I was a child) I would like to defend moderate Muslims to whom I used to belong and who are a majority in Europe.

First of all, these are really the hardcore crazy fundies, they wouldn't say this in their own countries for it would both shock their countrymen and lead them to jail or to meet their creator. Most of the guys in the picture are as sane and balanced as Anders Behring Breivik (I let you google for yourself who the man is), only with a different faith.

Now, because of irrational fear of a minority, a majority of Muslims who came to Europe - especially to be free from political and religious repression - as well as many Atheists/Agnostics/irreligious people belonging to the community (you know how fucking hard it is to quit Islam, even in Europe) are uselessly suffering  and paying for a bunch of nutty fundies.

You can't say Islam is invading Europe, some overtly fundamentalist Muslims would love it, but it is far from the case.

Because those aren't his reference points. Thelynx has lived overseas for four years... and he's seen that the world is bigger than the USA and its parochial perspective.  Some of us would be of the opinion that it's unethical to not challenge people in such conversations to help them look at the horizons beyond such partial cultural narratives like the one about the founding fathers of this country. 

Honestly, why only go back two hundred years into the history of our Anglo society on this continent? Why not turn the pages back over the two thousand years of history through the examples in our cultural roots in Europe? However, of course, the people and events from those times aren't taught to American kids in school... so it would be impossible to find common ground that way.

Barack Obama's speaking style is an example of using the cultural narrative you recommend, gratuitously. It really warms the cockles of Americans' hearts when a person does that sort of thing. However, it really grates on my ears, and the ears of others who might call themselves ""free thinkers,"" because it's also a very shallow way of speaking.

&gt; But you said, in other words, that speaking plainly could only be done by 'simple' people.

Honestly, I think that is best. There's certainly nothing wrong with being simple. Canadians and Australians do the simple lifestyle very well. Canada's a very rationalistic society, and Australia is a society where the good of the larger community is the prime directive. These societies are light years beyond the complex people of the UK, when it comes to making happy and healthy communities. 

However, everybody needs to find a situation where they are validated and appreciated by those around them, *for who they are at their best.*  Only a child is in a situation where he is willing to adjust his personality in order to be accepted and validated by those around him. That can be healthy or unhealthy for that child, depending on the character of the adults around the child.

The most important thing are already mentioned in the thread. Health care is nice in Germany, but the UK (for instance) has a better system. Germany hasn't big university fees (you pay around 400€ each year for stuff like public transport and the materials you use in your studies (computer or stuff like that). If you want children, that would be a good point. Our educational system is bad as fuck but from what I heard, it's better than the US one (English is a must have class. You can't leave it.  Second foreign languages are very common when your child goes to a ""Gymnasium"" (highest high school). The students learn a lot about foreign countries and world wide (or at least European) history. French revolution is a big topic).

The conditions of your work are better. 30 days paid holiday and stuff. Already said as well. As an American, I don't think you mind if your pension is lower than it was 10 years ago. Because of the break of the DDR we've got a lot of old people who get pension but didn't pay for it. And now, we haven't enough money to pay the same pension as we did 10 years ago. But when you're that age, if could've changed.

But I would recommend you should live here for a few month and take a good look how stuffs works here in Germany. But in the end, it is no problem to live in another European country if you don't like it here. The only problem you'll have in the UK is that you need a bank account for a place and a place for a bank account =P

While reading your article, I asked myself which traits that I would find desirable if I were looking for a team to manage these days, and I believe that a player's capacity to listen to his teammates is first and foremost.  While teams consisting of solo queue stars dominated Season One (see: CLG), there's been a pretty swift movement by pro squads to an emphasis on training together (see: TSM).

In my mind, LoL has yet to come into its prime.  However, with the prize money in Season Two and the events that are coming up in the next couple of months (WCG and IEM Kiev) I think the level of competition is going to go through the roof.  It takes a couple of years for players to understand a game well enough to make truly amazing plays, and SC2 was no exception to fans who remember the first few GSL's.

But it is true that the type of bribes you describe were endemic in the Brezhnev era, and in certain periods of Maoist China. These resulted from the Party *Nomenklatura* becoming a privileged caste and becoming obsessed with liberalization and productivism without any purpose.

And then members of the Nomenklatura and sivoliki (the Soviet military-industrial complex) went full-on traitor and restored (and profited greatly from) capitalism (ex-KGB and Party officials were transferred ownership of state corporations on no merit, just because the Harvard Gang sent by the U.S. to advise Yeltsin needed to build a formal capitalist ruling class, and now they are billionaires [Putin]).

However, my point still stands. The Paris Commune was crushed quite pathetically after surviving much less than a year. After the so-called ""socialists"" of Europe threw their weight behind their own countries during WWI it seemed like all hope was lost and there wouldn't be revolution for a century if not more, since each country's proletariat would be at each other's throats. Then the Bolshevikii launched a brave, unorthodox experiment after they helped overthrow the tsar which lasted for almost a century. The gains over time are obvious.

That's a significant claim, and the fact that civilizations have historically tended to have supernatural beliefs doesn't itself mean it is innate. Murder happens in every civilization, but murder isn't innate in humans. You might counter with supernatural beliefs being much more widespread than murder, but look at a lot of Europe.

Come beginning of 2011, precisely march 4th, I start coughing randomly, out of the blue. I deside to give it some time, but after 2 days, it doesnt seem to go away. I head over to the doctor, he says its probably bronchitis, and puts me on antibiotics. I stay at home for a few days whilst taking the antibiotics. Nothing happens, coughing increases in cough per minute (cpm). I go back to the doctor, he says he's baffled and puts me on some other medicine. A week later, that doesnt help either. I go to the doctor again and he basically doesnt know what the fuck he should do, so he sends me to an ashtma specialist. I have rather bad asthma any ways so I already know the guy. When I tell him the happenings of the past 2-3 weeks, he basically also was baffled and gave me that ""WTF?"" look. He puts me on a high dosage inhaler and some other pills that I cant remember the function of. At this point I was coughing until about 5 AM in the morning, so I basically slept for 5 hours and then coughed the rest of the day. It was horrible. That medication did not work, so I go back to the doctor, he gives me the same ""WTF"" look, and gives me some more medication. Remember this is about 4.5 WEEKS into this drama. It was only getting worse. Those meds end up not working either, and the coughing just got worse. The asthma doctor now thought that I had something wrong with me that had nothing to do with my lungs. I get blood taken and have various scans done. They still cannot find ANYTHING. The asthma doctor says he is out of ideas and sends me to another asthma/allergies specialist. She does not know what to do either so she gives me a fungi based inhaler (not as horrible as that sounds). That doesnt work, it just makes the coughing worse. I go back to her and report that the fungi hasnt worked. She asks when the last time I had an allergy test was, I say 2007 ish. She asks me to have that renewed. A few coughing sleepless nights later, I get the test done. As I am in the waiting room, I see one gigantic bump from number 18 or so on the test. THe doctor looks at my arm and says, ""Well, opoipo, you are extremely allergic to birch tree pollen, there is a high concentration of that stuff floating around now."" At this point, my only thought is ""WHy the FUCK did someone not think of that earlier."" I go back to the first doctor I ever visisted for this and he says ""Go to the ocean"" (btw I live in europe). So 2 days later, I catch a flight to Portugal and stay there a few nights. I feel perfect, like I could run for hours. I catch a flight back to my hometown, and the minute that I step out of the airport the coughing starts again. That was one of the most depressing moments of my life. A few sleepless weeks pass and I catch a flight to America to visit relatives for Easter. I feel almost perfect there with minimal coughing. Was very, very fun. I take a flight back to Europe a week later and the coughing starts the fucking minute that I get out of the plane. At this point my lungs were horribly aching from everything, so it was almost unbearable. 4 days later I take a flight to California and stay there with relatives for a total of 6.5 weeks. THe coughing basically stopped there and I was able to actually go on with my life. I was a happy, burrito eating son of a bitch. All goes fantastic, and I fly home, 6.5 weeks later. I step out of the airport, taking a breath of fresh air. I do not cough. I have never and will never be as relieved as I felt that day. I was free, the chains removed from my body. I could be part of normal society again. I was the happiest non burrito eating son of a bitch ever to exist. All in all the whole catastrophe took about 4.5-5 months to settle completely. 

As of 3 days ago from today, I have started coughing again. I hope to god that I do not have to go through what I went through earlier this year again. Only time can tell now. Yesterday I coughed horribly until 2 AM in the morning. I really really want to not have to do this again.

**EDIT:** I coughed until 3AM last night, I'm really really afraid of this whole thing happening again

**EDIT** Just bought it, count me out of the competition

SO there it is, the weirdest time of my life, ever. 4.5 months of asthma and allergy hell, that moved me to 2 different countries for more than a month. I fear this cycle may be starting again.

That causes hyperinflation.  Your money can become worthless very fast if you do that.  Which is my point.  If your deficit spending immediately causes inflation, that is a check against rampant deficit spending.  Using loans allows them to borrow all they want with no immediate negative effect.  So after 10 years of lending, if the system falls apart, all that deficit spending hits the economy at once and royally fucks stuff up.

&gt;Related question, someone must have printed money in order to lend it to the Europeans anyways right?

Not really.  Since a bank still cannot spend more money than it has.  And if a loan fails, the bank has to use it's profit from other loans to back the accounts the money was from.

The reserve rate does have an effect on the money supply, and the government controls the reserve rate.  The reserve rate is the amount of money the bank has to keep internally and cannot loan out.

Basically a dollar can be loaned out X times before it is used up.  But this type of inflation is already built into the system and accounted for in the price of money.

On the water, especially inland navigation. There is much less hostility and much more teamwork. People work with each  other so everyone can go where they need to go. They communicate with each other on radios and decide what is the best way to go about dealing with a situation when one arrives. 

Last week I was navigating out of a harbor and onto a busy river. But  the mist was so thick I couldn't even see the front of the ship (It's only 60 meters). So I radio'd I was coming out of the harbor and wondered if there was any incoming traffic. And instantly people were reporting in, deciding who should wait for who without any arguing at all. 
Everyone just wants to go from point a to b as fast and as safe as possible. When everyone thinks rational there shouldn't be any arguments since everyone has the same goal. 

Compare this to the aggressive driving you see in most urban environments and you can see why people are more happy with each other on the water.

It is difficult to overstate the level of disruption that Europeans had on the native cultures. Many tribes changed their entire way of life, their home land, their organization... During the period of the Indian Wars after the Civil War many of the tribes had strong central leaders, but this was mostly based on charisma and need rather than on a cultural norm. People like Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, Black Elk, and ~~Hawthorne Wodziwob~~ Wovoka all became important leaders of their respective peoples in the nineteenth century and could rightly be called ""Chiefs"". 

That being said, these late developments were most defintly in response to pressure from white settlers, were generally based on the natural leadership ability of those men (rather than a choice by the community) and did not necessarily represent the historical practice of the tribe.

What has posting video after video to do with growing up? Bothers you people can draw their own conclusions?

&gt;This is some of the most biased tripe I've ever seen.

More like restoring balance after a worldwide bashing campaign of the Netherlands. Sick and tired of having to here about how disgraceful the final was and so not be allowed to carry something of a good feeling about a 14 games victory run from the start to the final, in our WC campaign.

&gt;First, van der Wiel's knee did in fact make slight contact with Iniesta's back leg.

How did I formulate my link? Iniesta made a meal out of it and was unsportsmanlike to say the least. 

&gt;Yes, Iniesta made it seem worse than it was, but truly it's no different from Torres' so-called ""dive"" against Chile.

Here you use yourself a method you later label as irrelevant when I bring up other incidents that didn't play a role in the final to make a point. Make up your mind please, if it is appropriate or not to go that way.   

&gt;If you watch that video, you'll also notice that van der Wiel voices no dissent when Webb issues the card. Clearly, the behavior of a man who's been wronged.

Webb was on a trip and would have giving another yellow for protesting. Webb was totally out of control and after the final a didn't refereed EPL games for a period as he was not himself anymore. The corner that should have been given to Holland being the most clear example. If you miss that you have lost the plot. Van der Wiel was very professional, the captain van Bommel did protest and the game moved on. Another example of great Dutch sportsmanship. 

&gt;You don't think that Iniesta would've kept going if he felt that he could've gotten on the end of that pass?

I think he knew he wouldn't make it and that with one man down they had a better change of winning. I have seen Iniesta do this more. He is no stranger to flopping. 

&gt;It doesn't make any sense to accept a free kick outside the box and a Dutch red card instead of a potential game-winning chance on goal.

That's right. We see the video. You can click on it again. No person would have fallen down from that light touch. He made a meal out of it and disgraced the game just as much people like to blame on the Dutch.

&gt;Heitinga knew the danger of Iniesta's run and held him to slow him down just enough for Stekelenburg to come out and collect the ball. The amount of contact or force involved is irrelevant, as it is a tactical foul.

Yeah this is cynical. We now see guys like Suarez also doing this in EPL. Making a meal out of everything. Going to the ground whenever there is an opportunity to benefit from. It's a cancer for football but there will always be people that defend it. Not me. Heitinga barely touched him and actually let loose before Iniesta could experience any resistance. Iniesta felt a hand and thought BINGO. Cheap, football destroying tactics as much as the Dutch anti football. This is how I like football to be played:

[Lens could have get the keeper red but keeps on going and scores magnificent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dyHMsCxPFs) 

But I don't have to give this example. We can just look at what Robben did and kept his feet. That's the difference. 

&gt;As for your final two points, these are issues with the officiating, not Spain. Yes, they both were incorrect calls, but what does that have to do with your criticism of the Spanish team?

Dude they where defining. If the free kick was given we would have made it to penalty's. We were with 10 men and Spain was quickly to attack and benefited from that moment. The free kick illustrates how Webb had lost the plot. Everything went Spain's way. Netherlands didn't even get a damn corner anymore. 

&gt;It just strikes me as sour grapes.

How so? Somebody posts a video of the Netherlands but somebody just can't resist to start again about the final. Didn't we played 14 games to get there? Didn't we played 8 qualification games and 6 WC matches that we ALL WON. Is it too much to ask to have some respect for that too? 14 straight competitive games won is a record by the way held only by France, Netherlands and just recently Spain. If Spain win their first group game on the Euro 2012 they are on 15. However it's a (European or world, don't know) record that deserves some respect.

&gt;Again, a poor call but, nonetheless, irrelevant to the discussion. But calling it a ""crime against the Netherlands?"" Please. He merely tried to pull a bicycle kick and didn't take into account de Zeeuw's position. It certainly should've been a red, but I doubt that anyone thought it was malicious.

Don't trip over my terminology. It is how I felt de Jong was put down after his action vs Alonso. Fact is Alonso stood up, played further. De Zeeuw was kicked into the hospital and the guy did not even receive a card for it. This only got a fraction of the attention (while a half final), yet de Jong is always brought up again. Did you remember this Uruguay foul on the Netherlands? I don't think you did and that's my point. Also when Uruguay is payed some respect on this forum, or how they managed to win recently in a friendly I don't bring it up over and over again, like many people like to bring up de Jong. 

&gt;Melo was rightfully reamed by everyone on here. No one tried to defend it, and pretty much everyone agreed that it was ridiculously stupid and childish. Regardless, it still has no relevancy to the Spanish team and their conduct in the Final.

Yes it does. This video was about the Dutch campaign. We have talked about the final endlessly and how wrong the behavior was. You address the Melo action with that it was discussed, but that only got a fraction of the negative attention the Dutch received for their final. I think the Dutch used anti football methods, but that doesn't mean Spain didn't make a meal out of any form of contact.

&gt;Yes, but 1 was for Iniesta removing his jersey after the goal, and the other was for Xavi delaying the game near the end of extra time. Hardly comparable to the 8 yellows that were issued for Netherlands, 7 of which (I believe) were awarded for poor tackles.

The vd Wiel yellow was no yellow. Van Bronckhorst yellow was harsh. Webb was on a role to penalize everything with yellow at a certain moment and was so pro Spain at the end that he didn't saw the corner and the clear free kick that cost us the game. Also delaying tactics is just as unsportsmanlike as we only had minutes to equalize and get to penalty's. Puyol should have an extra yellow but thanks to Robben he didn't so then it would be 6 for Spain and also their left back should have had another yellow. De Jong should have had a red card by the way. Intent or not, it was wrong. 

However many people miss this point:

&gt;World Cup winners Spain and their opponents Netherlands have been fined by Fifa for their players' poor discipline in July's final. Football's governing body fined the Dutch federation £9,080, while the Spanish association must pay £6,053.

Both federations have received a fine, while I feel like all blame is put on the Dutch. 

&gt;Clearly, we should take his word for it. This coming from the man who's also responsible for breaking the legs of both Stuart Holden and Hatem Ben Arfa. Regardless of whether or not we believe him, who the hell goes up for a ball with the spikes up? If he truly didn't see Xabi Alonso, then why is he trying to spike away a ball with the sole of his foot? I'm sorry, but nobody who's played the game can reasonably say that he was going for the ball (which honestly doesn't matter anyway according to the Laws).

You cut my sentence off. Quote my whole piece. I clearly stated that after another incident the Dutch took matters in own hand and put him to shame in public. So van Marwijk did not take it any longer also. De Jong is a hard player, van Marwijk was done with it and he wasn't called up for a period of time. One thing though. He wasn't that at Ajax. When he started playing in DM and especially in the EPL where the public starts to clap as hard as they can when a player throws in another tackle, demonstrating toughness and masculinity he started to behave like a tough guy instead of a technical player. In the Netherlands we clap for vision, technique and beautiful passes. At Ajax the focus is on technique and I have seen him also give beautiful passes at that club. Then they come back to the Dutch NT and we are frowned upon yet we don't carry his education and development anymore in Eredivisie. That also pisses me off. I am sure that his tendency to hard play would have been softened when he would have stayed at Ajax and played in Eredivisie. Maybe he would even have been quite a nice player to look at football wise.     

&gt;You're absolutely right. The Dutch played some very good ball throughout the tournament. van Bronckhorst's strike against Uruguay was one of my favorite goals of the tournament. However, to deny that the Dutch played rather disgracefully in the Final is ridiculous.

Where did I deny that? My post was to point out that two incidents were treated unjustly and cost is the game and that Spain`on their turn did made a meal out of many situation. You can focus on physical game play, but Robben kept his feet and didn't screw Puyol with a red card like Iniesta did to Heitinga. Screwing others over is disgraceful too. Why is this never highlighted by anyone? FIFA fined both Holland AND Spain. Why are they portrait as saints? After the WC it was a one sided Holland bashing, while nothing of the other 14 games was ever said again. I saw this video as a attempt to finally put that to the front also. Yet there are the sore remarks about the final again.

By saying science is treated in a derogatory manner in Europe he is saying that Europeans are trying to attack the merit or reputation of science hence disrespect. I really don't know where he gets these ideas from, to be honest I think he may be trolling.

The Large Hadron Collider was partially a sort of propaganda victory for the European Union, a sort of look what we can do when we combine our minds. It was also aimed at establishing a relationship with other scientific communities around the world and also attracting more of the worlds best physicists to Europe. It isn't only a sort of ""start of big science"" in Europe, it's also a point of pride for many Europeans.

I'm not sure how anybody can work at the LHC and decide that European science is fucked because people in Europe now find science ""derogatory"".

A friend of mine was in a similar situation once. He told his brother that some kids in school harass him - this only stopped when the older brother drove to the home of one of the bullies and confronted him and told him to stop this kind of shithead behaviour. It worked.

I myself have tried not to be violent for most of my almost 30 years now, but I'm beginning to question if this really is the best approach one can have. There are people that simply don't give a shit about you and simply want to dump their inner mess onto someone outside to feel better. Take a rock and hit one of them on the head, take a iron pipe and beat it into one of the bully's balls as hard as you can. Take all the anger and frustration that you feel inside you in this situation and direct it against these assholes. Rip one of their earlaps apart or kick the knee of one of them repeatedly as hard as you can. Grab a glass bottle and throw it at their heads or try to grab and twist their fingers when they hit you. Bite their finger as hard as you can, don't stop until it's bleeding and he is screaming in pain. The screaming part is especially powerful because it signals the others that you are serious. 

They have to sense that you are a threat to them, and I'm not speaking of a hypothetical threat (school board, police) - they have to sense it, they have to see it with their own eyes, they have to understand that you are a potential threat to them. 

You are fooling yourself by trying to convince yourself that you are the samaritan that  is standing on a higher moral ground by renouncing violence. By doing that, you allow them to be violent against yourself. By renouncing violence, you are causing yourself to get hurt, making violence possible in the first place. That's not the smartest thing to do, and from what you've written you begin to realise that. This behaviour destroys you and kills you from the inside.

[Condesa](http://i.imgur.com/Wc4C2.png) and roma. Great bohemian colony full of ""hip"" young people and awesome bars and nightclubs


[Coyoacán](http://www.metroscubicos.com/imgM3/guias/foto_coyoacan3.jpg) Similar to Condesa but it has left wing young people instead of hipsters and some nice bars

 Reforma [avenue](http://www.richard-seaman.com/Wallpaper/Travel/Mexico/PaseoDeLaReforma.jpg) Most beautiful avenue in mexico city. Has some nice bars and places around too.

The turibus can take you to most of this places for 120 pesos or 200 in weekends (about $15 dollars).

Mexico city is the city with the highest number of museums in the world, some extremely interesting like the [Antropology musem](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/1x8608068/aztec_calendar_museo_nacional_de_antropologia_k89-820679.jpg) musem.

Polanco is the most bussines center (and most expensive) in the city. Around Parque Lincoln [Parque Lincoln](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunnij/3844464996/) there are some great restaurants with the best expensive food in the city and in [Presidente Masarik](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Avenida_Masaryk.jpg) there are some great bars (expensive too)

Universitary city ([Ciudad Universitaria](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/UNAM_Ciudad_Universitaria.jpg/800px-UNAM_Ciudad_Universitaria.jpg) Is the biggest university campus in mexico, it has about 200,000 students and it is considered a World Heritage Site.

Another great place to visit is [Xochimilco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trajinera.JPG) but it is enjoyed a lot more when visited with friends. Specially to take a trajinera (the boats) and drink inside them.

The fact that you don't know anyone else in the tea industry is actually a good thing. You will probably face very little competition at the start. Obviously down the road it will be beneficial to start networking and meeting other people work with tea (distributors, people in your supply chain, etc.) but as far as I can tell there should be nothing stopping you from jumping into it right now. Obviously there are plenty of tea drinkers, many of whom can be as devoted as coffee drinkers, so there is plenty of demand for your product. I suspect people will be glad to shop in your tea store, rather than simply buying their tea from a grocery store which would have less selection and a less friendly atmosphere.

The question is, where are you going to open up? I assume you are located in the United States, which has significantly fewer tea drinkers than most European or Asian countries. But you mentioned your area is somewhat of a yuppie area, which is a group of people that does tend to drink more tea than the average American. 

In my expert opinion, you already have everything you need to make a successful go of this tea shop, except for the money. Tea is somewhat of a novelty as well, with many different flavors and compelling reasons for people to walk into your store. I have no doubt that you will be able to find lots of creative ways to market tea to the people around you. My suggestion would be to consider a location in more of a mall than a strip mall, where you are more likely to get foot traffic. Your store will be relatively small, so the store front shouldn't be too expensive even in a mall. Foot traffic will draw a lot more curious customers into a tea shop than if people had to drive to it as a destination shop.

In other countries like Japan, it's an even bigger issue because some schools are purposely negligent of bullying since acknowledging it publicly would portray their school in a negative light.

Being that the OP says he isn't in good shape AND outnumbered, fighting back would probably not get him very far, I definitely agree with you on that point.  On the other hand, I think that this
 &gt;This isn't the kind of problem you should ever face, much less solve on your own. It's only happening because you are not being provided a safe, fair environment, and those who would take advantage of lax oversight are taking advantage of lax oversight.
Bullying like this doesn't happen when you're an adult, and if it does the police quickly solve it.""
is largely wishful thinking.  

There are many things on this planet that ""nobody should have to face"", especially if every human being has the same inalienable rights (which unfortunately is not the case, as a child in an African or Chinese village by station of birth will likely not be afforded the opportunities that most Americans and Western Europeans take for granted as commonplace).

As far as bullying not happening when you're an adult, no, you likely won't be bullied, but unless you live somewhere where there's never been any act of crime ever, it might not be a bad thing to learn how to proactively protect yourself rather than leaving yourself open to being victimized.

The reality is that just because we shouldn't have to face things like bullying, violence, homelessness, crime, or starvation, billions of people experience these things all over the planet daily, and this sort of thinking teaches over-dependence on authority that won't always be able to help an individual out, or in some cases doesn't even exist to begin with.

While violence may not be a ""mature"" answer, there is a difference between violence for the sake of violence, vigilantism, and violence to protect yourself.  If OP did fight back, it would not be a case of ""taking the law into his own hands"", but rather a case of ""the right to swing your fist ends where another man's nose begins"".  

If, in this case, the school and police DO effectively get involved and these issues are solved, then that would be the obvious best case scenario.  If they act anything like their bumbling American counterparts though, it will likely be ineffective mediation, and the bullying will continue until the OP learns to stand up for himself on one way or another.  People like bullies, who are usually going after other people to make themselves feel tougher or just to vent frustration, will have a field day with people who they see as weak.  Even without violence, if the OP can learn how to stand up for himself either verbally or at least carry himself with more self confidence, I wouldn't be surprised if these instances in the future diminished.  

Also, keep in mind that there will not always be adults or even his friends watching where this kid is 100% of the time all day every day to make sure he's protected, and if the bullying continues then the best case scenario is reactive punishments, which won't accomplish anything until the kids picking on him are expelled or arrested for assault.

False,Christianity,1427960399,c34j9d1,Church of England (Anglican),1,0,1322799570,t5_2qh6c,t1_c34j9d1,False,0,0,"Disclaimer: I am a Anglican  (a protestant sect as baptists are) who has lots of baptist friends but also believes  that all christian churches/secs are equal  in merit.
1. Wanting to live by the bible  to be a christian  means that you are a lot farther along in your journey  to know God then many people who call themselves Christians. I define myself as a christian  because I try to be a ""follower of Christ"" which means believing his words and  trying to follow his example. By reading the bible  (especially the new testament, I suggest reading the book of Mathew, Luke or John first) You learn that God though Jesus wants to have a relationship with you because he loves you and your fellow humans. Because humanity has done horrible things,  by hurting ourselves and others we turn away from God. God being Just as well as perfect cannot have as deep of a connection with us as he would like because our sin (our badness). So Jesus (being both God &amp; human simultaneously) came down to teach us and heal our relationship with God  by taking the punishment  for every-bodies bad words, thoughts or actions on himself or others. By recognizing that, wanting God's forgiveness and promising to try to follow Jesus' teaching and actions  we are a ""savior follower"" which is really what the word christian means.  If we say we believe this but that knowledge does not effect the way we live our lives and treat other people  then  we really are not following him.  Don't take my word for it, read the bible and ask God to guide you in your decision to follow Jesus. Becoming a christian should be a scary and wonderful thing,  no human is perfect  but though faith (trust) belief and action it is one heck of a ride. Many Baptists believe that you also need a physical , public and symbolic  ceremony to become a christian which is baptism. This was practiced even before Jesus began preaching and  by going underwater  or having water poured over your head you ""die"" and ""rise again"" with Jesus and your sin (bad things you have done) are washed away metaphorically.
2. You do not have to say a member of a particular denomination of church forever. Even within denominations churches can vary depending upon the leanings of the head pastor or priest. If you are happy with your church (they are welcoming, will answer your questions, they are positive actors in the community) stick with them.  My mother was raised and baptized catholic but is now a Anglican because she didn't like  the catholic church's stance on contraception or ordaining women and the closest church to our house that she really connected with happened to be an Anglican church. The old church she went to doesn't bother her or anything.
3.  May I suggest a christian European tradition? Go to Midnight Mass on Christmas eve and open your presents when you get home from the service. If you are not free go to the Christmas day service in the morning. Either way your church  will read and explain the Christmas story as it relates  to Jesus and his birth. I think it is particularly magical to do so at midnight, sometimes you reach a certain clarity  or peace only at night. Some may say that you shouldn't have a evergreen tree or hang holy as those are pagan symbols. I disagree, the pagan symbols for the winter solstice were adopted by early European Christians for a reason. Yes to help reach pagans but also  because the symbolism is universal. Evergreen trees  are ""alive""  when all other trees are ""dead"" in the dark of winter. Look up christian symbolism of many holiday traditions and you will see that it celebrates Jesus birth just fine. Besides Santa may now be commercialized  but the legend started with a real saint Nick! Give presents to be generous, loving and to celebrate the best gift of all Jesus. Have fun, Jesus came to give us life and life to the fullest.
4. It may be different in baptist churches so I recommend you ask a church leader but from what I understand  step 1.you stand in line until you get to the front. step 2. you kneel and if you don't consider yourself a christian or a full member of that church, cross your arms over  your chest if not hold both hands palm up  in front of you. step 3 A)if your hands are crossed  the church leader coming around will give you a blessing  by speaking some words and he or she may touch your head. B)if your hand are out someone will put a bit of bread or a cracker in your hands  and say ""this is his body broken for you"" eat and swallow the bread understanding that this is supposed to symbolize the sacrifice Jesus made by allowing his body to be hurt to get rid of everybody sin (evil acts/thoughts). Next someone will come around with wine or grape juice and say ""this is his blood, shed for you"" and then either you drink a sip or dip your leftover bread/cracker in it and eat it. Step 4 get up and calmly go sit back down where you were sitting before you got in line. While you wait for others to do the same think about what Jesus did for you or pray silently  in thanks  for what he did or to ask forgiveness for something that you may feel guilty about. The tradition is from the last supper Jesus had on earth before he was killed. Don't feel pressured to go up and take communion if you are not comfortable. It is in remembrance of Jesus's sacrifice and if you are not sure what you believe it is better to be honest.There is no shame in that.
5. Prayer doesn't always have to be structured.  Remember God wants you to know him and love him as he loves you.  Jesus actually answers your question with ""the Lord's Prayer""  (Google it) which I pray when I feel like I need to talk to God but I don't know where to begin. Above all be open and honest. He knows what your thinking anyways but sometimes you have to say it (or think it) out loud. I usually try praising him, then thanking him then telling him what is bothering me  or what I am curious about and ending with asking  for something or thanking him again. It's best to do this after you have read some of the bible on your own to gleam wisdom and God's will but really any time you feel like you want to talk to God, go for it.  (eg. ""Hey God that is a really cool cloud!""  or ""I don't know what to say to that Jesus! Help!"")
 Finally something that I wish I knew earlier was  to get a Bible, read it  and don't worry if you have doubts or question it!  I used to get a doubt, worry about it, let it fester and I'd drift away from God. But when I research it, pray about it and look for bible verses on the subject I would gain understanding and have an even closer relationship with God then before. If someone says the bible says something weird, look it up. If you have a question about God, ask a church leader ( and If they don't know get a book out from the library on the subject.) As a new Christian I used to think that I was the only one with doubts or that if I shared them I would hurt others faith. But Honestly Christians have been doubting and asking questions for 2 thousand years before you came along and someone somewhere has answered your question before.  I wish you well on your journey to follow Jesus. May God Bless you and Keep you.
P.S.  For Christmas decorations I would say a Christmas tree, Menorah, stockings and hang up all the Christmas/Hanuka/Holiday cards on a string or on the wall like a mosaic.

Also the Danish government somehow persuaded the Nazis not to send the Danish Jews they did round up to the extermination camps.  The Danish Red Cross helped, monitoring the conditions of the Danish Jews that had been sent to Nazi concentration camps (concentration camps but not extermination camps).  As a result only 102 Danish Jews died in the Holocaust [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews#Arrests_and_deportations).

Contrast this with the other nearby European countries: 90% of the Jews in Poland were killed, 70% of those in the Netherlands, 50% of those in Belgium [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoah#Jewish).

So I'd say the Danish are about the last people you could claim are bigoted against non-Christians.

Disclosure: I'm neither Jewish nor Danish.  I just saw the story of the Danish Jews in the Holocaust Museum years ago and have always remembered it.

My original point was, in the the U.S., religion is as big of a deal as you make it. r/Atheism (and reddit in general) consists largely of people who are from the U.S., Canada, or Europe. Of these places, I think its safe to say the U.S. treats atheists the worst. Even then, it's mostly just the ignorant southerners who hate ANYONE who isn't exactly like them. Regardless of this, people in r/Atheism act as if they're in the middle of an Atheist holocaust.

I understand that *some* of them have a reason to seek refuge. I have a hard time believing it is the case for the majority of the community. It does make for a convenient excuse though. Literally any time r/Atheism is called out, you can expect a tsunami of ""refuge"" comments. To me, this just comes off as an excuse not to better the community. I would go to r/Atheism more regularly if it weren't the most sickening circlejerk I've ever seen. I've got no problem with science or philosophy. It's the inflated egos and militant opinions that I don't like.

By the way, does my opinion on this matter become more or less valid if I tell you I'm also an atheist?

Now i'm not jumping on the bash China bandwagon but I believe the high barriers of entry of foreign companies to gain access to China is causing this.  China has been on a subsidized manufacturing binge the last decade.  This is primarily due to the unwillingness of China to inflate its currency and unpeg it from the dollar.  This has created a sort of shitstorm in the world economy.  They have funded much of the US and Euro debt and are unwilling to allow those economies access to its internal economy.  This has created a hording effect on China and has created a ""Great wall of China.""  Part of the reason the US and EU have flourished the last 50 years was the trade parity that we shared.  Our foreign balance sheets were almost equal and the middle class rose in both zones.  The US had started transitioning its manufacturing base to the EU years ago and focused on innovation as its primary export.  The US has not been hit as bad as it has transitioned to a more serviced based  economy.  That and major printing of money by the fed which in my opinion is the best economic tool in a major world wide recession.

The EU had fueled its growth on a manufacturing export economy from 1950 to present and China is slowly replacing that function.  

I think China needs to start a high tech buying bing and open consumer credit for its population.

I haven't changed a single argument I've made, I've only provided a wider array of examples and pulled from larger sources to help make the point.

Every time I mention legitimacy, you keep bringing up your preconceived notions of what that word means and using that to condemn me. It's pretty clear you don't have a clue what legitimacy actually means (as evidenced by your accusation that I am using the ""statist"" definition of it).

Legitimacy is a social process. This has been known in social science for decades. It is the process by which people come to see a particular person, organization, or institution's ideas and rules as ""legitimate"", and worthy of being made the status quo. When the majority of Germans agreed that Hitler killing Jews was a-OK (a great many of them agreed passively, by simply accepting it, but it was agreement nonetheless), then Jewish persecution became the status quo in Germany. In the eyes of Germany, he had legitimate power. In the eyes of most of Europe, he did not. If, hypothetically, the rest of Europe HAD deemed this legitimate, then Jews in every other European country would have been rounded up and killed by their respective governments.

At no point have I suggested, or will I suggest, that this was right or fair. Only that it was a natural consequence of the social process of legitimacy. And, likewise, the consequences of being thrown in jail for defying the state are not ""right"" or ""fair"" - they are the natural result of the state being given legitimacy by the majority of its citizens.",t1_c34jtsw,[deleted],,,0,True,t3_muqaz

High school kinda sucked for me. I wish I had tried for an exchange, even for 6 months. That experience in university totally changed my life for the better.

And for the guys talking about suicide, that's not even an option until you've seen Angkor Wat or a sunrise in Koh Samui. And even after that, I still need to check out Lake Titicaca.

There's also domestic German politics that play into this, so let's get this off the plate first. Skip to *[Part II]* below if you don't care to read all this.
 
As you probably know by now, the ruling coalition in Germany isn't doing all that well and is widely seen as dysfunctional. Here are the [latest polls](http://i.imgur.com/upjSg.jpg). The (neo-liberal) FDP, the junior partner of Merkel's conservative CDU, wouldn't even make it into the parliament with the 3% they're at now. The opposition rather vocally supports Eurobonds, but Merkel would have a hard time convincing her coalition to support them, and this coalition might even break apart under such stress. Normally, the conservatives could try to form a new coalition with the Social Democrats, but presently the opposition parties would make significant gains if new elections were held (likely resulting in a SPD/Green coalition, depending on how well the Pirates would do), so that's what they'd play for instead. You do not want to see a government crisis in Germany right now.

Two other relevant factors that are Germany-domestic play into this. One is the Weimar Hyperinflation, which still affects the collective psyche and economic thinking. That paying for government debt by printing money is bad is dogma. The other is that Germany went through its own crisis when we held the ""sick man of Europe"" title a decade ago, and austerity measures like the reform of the social net along with wage moderation are part of the reason why Germany is doing so relatively well right now, even though they were highly unpopular and eventually cost the SPD/Green government the reelection.  
What is ""asked"" of the GIIPS right now is of course on a different level, and at this extend even counterproductive in the present situation, but perception of how deep the cuts actually go are obviously skewed when looking at it from a distance through a lens of righteousness.

*[Part II]*

Against this backdrop and in the face of *immediate necessity*, Merkel doesn't have much room to maneuver. Of course, had she acted more decisively earlier on, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.

Several countries are in a tight spot right now, but the underlying reasons are really quite different. There are those with good or even exemplary government financials that got in trouble when housing prices collapsed because they had an overleveraged financial sector and/or have structural problems because they were too reliant on construction. They need space to breathe and time to figure out their problems. In others, governments acted irresponsibly, and they actually do need some austerity (and the pressure to make it politically feasible), although the extend to which this is happening right now might go too far. Those countries also have a problem with corruption and nepotism, and those are issues that can't be solved over night.

The latter are the reason why the potential moral hazard of Eurobonds or allowing the ECB to act as a lender of the last resort might have negative long term effects, both for their own economic development due to the lack of necessary reforms and in the form of permanent transfer payments. Without a mechanism to ensure reforms and long term fiscal responsibility, the fear is that we'd find ourselves in the same spot we're in now a couple of years down the line, but this time with a precedent of how avert collapse by simply handing over a checkbook.  
However, the immediate need to act along those lines is clear. Otherwise we'll all be fucked.

*[Part III]*

What I *think* Merkel *might* be trying to do is to use the collapse scenario to force the EU into a solution that is at least somewhat palatable for Germany domestically and would minimize the potential negative long-term effects. IMHO, this would be a tighter integration of the Eurozone in which members have to give up some sovereignty over their budgets in exchange for core countries (at least partially) underwriting their debt in the form of Eurobonds and/or an ECB funded bailout. This would cost the core in the form of permanent transfer payments and higher interest rates that go beyond the current EU structural funds, but in return there would be stability. Also, the core benefits rather handsomely from having a common currency, and could keep doing so.  
This is a scenario isn't really popular anywhere. The Eurozone core doesn't like to foot the bill, the periphery doesn't like austerity and the loss of full sovereignty over their budgets, and those outside the Eurozone don't like to see it push ahead with European integration. But for everybody it would be preferable to economic and political collapse.

Obviously this is a high-stakes gamble and the risk of failure is immense. However, you can imagine that negotiations over measures to ensure long term fiscal responsibility would go very differently without the immediate need to find a solution. I think it's obvious that we need a reform. The question is whether our politicians are able to for once be pragmatic and find a compromise that will work in the long term and is acceptable for everybody. We'll find out very soon. I have my doubts, but I'm certain that they wouldn't be able to agree on a solution when the pressure was gone.

The following line of reasoning is a bit fallacious because I'm putting the cart before the horse, but it does help with understanding the ratings. The USA, while downgraded to AA+ by S&amp;P, has an interest rate that reflects a AAA rating. In effect, investors are ignoring the rating agency and saying that there is no default risk. To some extent, that's the truest rating because these people are putting their money where their mouth is.

Meanwhile, the interest rates in many eurozone countries reflect relatively high possibilities for default, especially among PIIGS. A common-area eurobond would involve some of these countries guaranteeing the bond, which is little guarantee at all given the very real possibility that Italy and Greece especially might not be able to fulfill its financial commitments in the near future. Ratios are good and all, but the question at the end of the day is ""will I get paid?""

[Here is an article about how a common-area eurobond would be rated by its weakest link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-03/joint-euro-bond-would-get-rating-of-the-weakest-link-s-p-official-says.html). I think it is a valid method, given the inter-reliance of European economies; Similar to the subprime mortgage backed securities that ushered in the US crisis, the risk characteristic of higher-rated tranches are contingent on the lower-rated tranches, so the rating of the eurobond as a whole should rest on the guarantee with the highest possibility of default.",t1_c34ga7a,[deleted],,,5,True,t3_mwl2u

&gt;Like it or not, under Hamas, the small but vibrant Christian community in Gaza has disappeared. Not that Fatah has been terribly better: numbers of Christians in the West Bank have been dwindling as well. There have been numerous cases of violence perpetrated against them. Those aren't opinions. They are incontrovertible facts, not up for debate.

Attacks in Gaza against the Christian community have been very isolated, and by no means are they the norm. You see the same type of violence against minorities by fanatics in every society in the world, including much of Europe - I've seen it first hand in the UK, more than I have ever seen it anywhere in the Middle East. Hamas has not pursued a policy of persecuting Christians nor are such occurrences the rule. They are the exception.

In the West Bank, the dwindling numbers are down to higher growth rates among the Muslim population than the Christian one, not persecution.

Welcome to Lebanese politics. All the sects hate each other - that's what civil war results in. They are all trying to gain dominance and all act blindly in the perceived interests of their individual sects, the interests of the country as a whole be damned. 

Hezbollah and the Shi'a bloc happen to be the most powerful political/military force today. Threats against the Christian and Druze communities are not a result of their religion - that is how relations between the various sects and political blocs are in Lebanon, and have been for decades. 

If you've lived in Beirut, you should know this. Back during the civil war, it wasn't just threats that were being made - those with Muslim names were executed at checkpoints by Christian militias, and vice versa. Tens of thousands were senselessly killed. It all existed way before Islamic extremism became a major factor in Lebanese factor.

I am also from Europe, a pretty squallid part of it as far as morals and kindness go, but I can tell you that I also have asthma and when I was your age I also got beaten, luckily not in my own school but kids from other schools came around to beat us since we were a language school. Anyway, at the time I weighed half my leg nowdays, and was completely unable to phisically defend myself. I could run a bit, but that made me feel awful.
There is no easy way out of this. Snitchin will only get you in trouble , especially if you call names, and you gonna grow up into a half man unsecure individual that will always depend on others to stand up for him. It is imperative that you start taking care of your body and grow strong. I started training around your age and today I am a martial arts master even tough I still don't look too mean,but  I had problems with asthma and all that, hardgainer, but the body always finds a way to capitalize from it's flaws, you must believe that. For example, my condition and constant training were a no go, but I kept on, used my Ventolins (at the time it was the most efficient drug), and just worked really hard. In years I have developed a pretty decent anaerobic endurance, so the first time I ran 400 m I went under a minute  (28 yrs old). Never doubt yourself and your body. You must do that in order to gain the confidence necessary to become a strong and able individual.
It is hard. Pick up something easy for starters, like karate or those soft kickbox classes they offer. If that is too hard, go for tai chi, you can't believe the amount of benefits it provides and it develops some very nice skills in a completely discrete way (i.e. you don't have to get beaten or break your back in training+it improves breathing drastically).
First step is to start training, improving yourself and gaining conscience of your own skills and abilities. That is as far a global plan goes.
As for your current situation I suppose it is ok to talk to the kids parents, but that will only postpone the problem. YOu'll come to other schools and classes and there's always gonna be some asshole that will smell the weakness in you and exploit it. It can be awful and get you to do something stupid and immoral to prove yourself. Don't fall  on that path. Have your parents talk with his but try to avoid school staff. That way you will show that idiot that you are not a snitch, and perhaps he gets it and leaves you alone. Seriously, play your cards right. First card is talking to his parents, second is school staff. Because once you make it official there will be repercussions for you socially, other kids will disrespect you for being a crybaby, so try to keep that in check. Parent talk (hoping his parents aren't also wild cavemen) can work out just fine. Don't snitch, don't mention booze and stuff, play it as it is:you're no match for these kids due to natural disadvantages so you ask them to stop nicely, if not, there is a system that punishes such behaviour and you will use it. And if you do use, do so in the full extent! Once you take that road make sure you have him in loads of trouble with the school, police, what not. 
But always remember, you gotta arm yourself with something. And I don't mean weapons. You need to grow a pair, have confidence, outrun them, outtalk them, whatever...just have something you believe in. And don't let asthma be an excuse for not training, you are in the best years to start developing skills.

&gt; A decade later, perhaps the only thing that should truly cause surprise is how little has been learned in Washington.  The military-first policy of choice that rang in the century — there were, of course, other options available — has become the only option left in Washington’s impoverished arsenal. After all, the country’s economic power is in tatters (which is why the Europeans are looking to China for help in the Euro crisis), its ""soft power"" has gone down the tubes, and its diplomatic corps has either been militarized or was long ago relegated to the back of the bus of state.

&gt; What couldn’t be stranger, though, is that from the whirlwind of policy disaster, the Obama administration has drawn the least likely conclusion: that more of what has so visibly failed us is in order — from Pakistan to Uganda, Afghanistan to Somalia, the Persian Gulf to China.  Yes, COIN is out and drones as well as special operations forces are in, but the essential policy remains the same.

I think suing is an option but it is not the best way to go. The reason you are hit and others are not is not that school fails to protect you. Is that you.. Ok lets see. I would suggest to see it as a problem and approach it as I do with all  problems, means analysis first, solution 2nd. I suspect the reason you are hit is because you act and position yourself as a weakest person in class. You said yourself you are too weak. That's the biggest mistake. From this point either you sue the bullies and depend the rest of your life on society protecting you (bad option especially if you are somewhere from Eastern Europe = failure at life) or you learn to protect yourself and come from this point as a winner in life. 

I am sure there is a way to protect yourself and it depends least on your physical abilities but more on psychological aspect. Bullies work on simple psychological pattern, they target differently behaving and vulnerable people. You are different but you can be not easy vulnerable. Oppose the psychological pattern, do analysis and find a way to do a workaround. Now you fit in this pattern very well, they punch you and you react as a punching bag = they are punchin you more. React differently. Forget your asthma, grow the shell. Punch him back. Afraid? Don't be. It would be bad only for the first time. As I said it's not about physical abilities but psychological. Punching him back will make him fight you, you'll get hurt, but only for the first time, they'll realise you are not a punching bag anymore. Or strike them first, come to class and hit him, make some witty hummiliating joke about him. So first thing - protect yourself physically and it is possible to do. I remember the smallest guy in our class was the fierciest, never agressive, but nobody could just catch him and hold for whatever reason, never giving up he would make his best to fight you. The idea pushing him seemed to be good only for guys who didn't know him before, but soon they learned.

Remember that bullying is a psychological moment? So another thing what is even more important is stopping acting as a victim. This does not come naturally, but requires training. And your age is about beeing trained. I am convinced that everything is learnable by practice. So start practicing this now. Act as a boss. Not screaming and litterally bossiing around but having a solid and mature pose. If you learn it well, that will be very usefull skill in life (first of all for getting girls also for your carrier).

So I wish you a good luck. It's not an easy way, but you take it from life and make lemonade. I know bullying was almost encouraged in british public schools. They thought only this way they could educate a true disciplined gentlemen capable of functioning in life independantly and being able to take care of unexpected situations in life where you depend mostly on yourself.

Greek businessmen saw that the Greek Government was unable to catch tax evaders, and run amok with not paying taxes and not paying VAT.

Greek people, seeing all this, organized themselves in strong worker unions. There is nothing wrong with that, except the fact that the worker unions' leaders are corrupt and only care about maintaining their status in the union.

The Greek crisis is not a simple economic crisis. It is a moral crisis, above all. We have been corrupt to the bone. We have been nurtured with the mentality that the only thing that counts is ourselves and our family, and our close friends. The rest of the society can go fuck itself.

All the above have a direct consequence in economy: established businesses cannot be maintained, new businesses cannot be created, the government is not functioning as it should, the debt keeps piling up, unemployment is on the rise.

I am saying all this to highlight the fact that the crisis is not capitalistic or socialistic. It's a moral crisis. What I describe above is more or less what goes on in other countries as well, in various degrees.

And since it is a moral crisis, it cannot be resolved unless its dire consequences are felt strongly by the majority of people.

The figures are produced by the local police forces.  I'd like to know how often they test bank notes for cocaine, but the sample is going to be biased as they'll be testing the bank notes of people arrested, not of normal people (unless they are testing their own bank notes).

The quotes from the PC have no place here.  They are anecdotal.  He even says so:

&gt; He said there were anecdotal reports of groups of young men for a night out on the town using powder cocaine to block out some of the effects of alcohol so they could carry on drinking – bluntly to help them stay awake.

Police saying this doesn't make it true nor does it mean that its an excuse for police to be heavy handed at late night pubs.

Finally, it does not ""reinforces surveys that show use of cocaine powder in Britain is the highest in Europe"". It would do that if it had a comparable figure with European cocaine stats on their bank notes.

You are *most definitely* the one percent, and I didn't mean that in the occupy movement sense. You are nowhere near middle class. You are middle class in your own narrow national definition, ignoring the fact that capitalism is not limited to your borders. Like I said, all the major US firms have most of their employees and production in the developing world. If you work for apple as a designer, you could be middle class in the US, but in the big picture you are doing better than the thousands of workers who make the products.

Capitalism only survives because it has made use of a global reserve army of labor, to use the jargon. This reserve army of labour is more than twice as large as the world's employed people. To keep being profitable, all the manufacturing of the US moved to poorer countries to exploit the difference in labour laws, this is called labor arbitrage. So you end up with a highly hypocritical existence where the US has all kinds of laws on child labour and minimum wage, and simultaneously all the firms are using Chinese and Vietnamese slave labour. So you act like capitalism is fine, because you belong to the lucky minority born in the west, and ignore the fact that there are almost 3 billion people in the capitalist world in indentured servitude with no way out. 

You say incredibly naive things like ""In capitalism you are responsible for what you become"" when for the vast majority of people under capitalism this is utterly untrue. Capitalism is a global system, not limited to your borders. If you study economics you'll find that the only reason you are middle class in your own country, is because all the pressures of capitalism to push you into the lower classes has been transferred abroad. If China and Vietnam and others enacted minimum wage laws or shortened the working day like what happened in Europe 100 years ago, none of those American firms will be as profitable, and thus the pressures to lower costs will hit American workers, lowering their wages and increasing their work hours incrementally.


&gt;Socialism looks good on paper. But in practice it has failed EVERY single time.

This is utter nonsense. First of all, socialism is an economic order, and most of the time it has been mixed with all kinds of political and national ideologies. Soviet Russia and China ceased to be socialist nations very early on. Cuba, although it has had to deal with years of embargoes from the world's most powerful economy, has a higher literacy rate than the US, and less infant mortality. So go figure. Socialism also worked excellently in Spain in the 30s until the anarco-syndicalists were conquered militarily, and in France during the Paris Commune until they too were conquered militarily.

And just so you know, capitalism is clearly failing as we speak. And it only needs to happen once. ""Bailouts"" have nothing to do with capitalism. In capitalism, failed banks should be allowed to fail. They are being bailed out by the government (not a capitalist thing to do) simply because of the political power of the people who run those banks.",t1_c34gzne,kerat,,,2,True,t3_mwhmc

It is really, really, really normal to have to wait out that 6-12 months without a job and get an awesome job without any problem after. Immigration is very common, and you're a Westerner who has made an effort during the wait to learn Norwegian you're most likely going to be just fine. 

Pretty much all the couples I know that have one (or more) foreigners in the relationship have had to do this, and everyone has got a job without any problem right away once the wait period was done. Actually, the biggest hurdle was knowing the language, which often the gap can help with as it gives you time to study, at least independently (if nothing else). Jobs are really, really, really not hard to come by in Norway because there is such a strong economy here still. I don't know anyone who hasn't found a job within a month of looking and I know for a fact (because of family friends who are employers themselves) that they hire foreigners without a second thought who have had to wait out the immigration process. 

In regards to work visa's I'm not 100% as sure as family immigration. I've had to look at both, however, so I have an idea. I can inform you of what I know in regards to your questions but if you'd like I can get the info from my wife of the super helpful charity in Oslo that you can call who can answer complex questions about the process for free, which is awesome. 

In regards to the work visa, it is my understanding that you must have the visa BEFORE you come to Norway, meaning you apply for it from the US. If it is a job transfer I believe the process is quite smooth and goes very quickly. If you apply for a job, get hired, and have a company sponsor you it may not necessarily lead to a permanent work permit, from what I know, because this again falls under 'filling gaps in the Norwegian system'. If you can't prove that you can fill a gap then your chance of UDI approving your application is remarkably slim. 

Example: A Norwegian and American couple I know were trying to figure out how he could immigrate. She was two years out of university and was doing unpaid work experience abroad for the previous year and thus had no income. Family immigration applications rely on the Norwegian (or sponsoring family member) to have a job and minimum income, so he figured he would apply for a work visa as a result of her not having any from the work experience. He has training (an MSc actually) in a very specialised type of physical fitness education that virtually does not exist in Norway and had multiple job offers. His application was denied as his area was still not seen as 'specialised enough'. 
 

Looking at your situation and questions about when/where to apply you would want to apply for the work visa in the US (in fact, I think you have to). Wherever you apply for your visa is where you pretty much have to stay for the duration of the application, for logistical purposes. Now, again, in regards to adding on the family visa to the work visa you will definitely have to contact someone who is more of an expert in regards to specifics of works visa situations, but I can tell you what the officials expect. If you apply for a visa while in the US you wait in the US until a decision is made. If you apply in Norway (as an American) you can be in Norway (but Norway only, you cannot travel anywhere in the EU) while the decision is being made. If you chose to travel outside the EU away from Norway there is technically no legal obligation on the part of airport immigration to let you back in. Basically, where you apply is where you stay. 

In regards to temporary permits I can't advise you there, but I again only again strongly recommend NOT getting two individual work permits because nothing is legally tying you two together if one of you were to lose your job and unable to find other work, and it is VERY difficult to switch from one type of visa to another (the gov't wants you on one type of visa, not 'working the system'). I know of an Australian/Norwegian couple who ran into that problem of the Australian going the route of work visa first, and then being unable to switch to a family visa when they lost their job, despite the spouse being Norwegian. You need to think carefully about the type of visa you two plan on going for. 

In regards to not getting a job transfer? Well, two (maybe three) options occur then. 1). Apply for jobs anyway and hope you get lucky with a work visa. 2). Study an MA (which are all taught in English at the University of Oslo and have FREE TUITION) and have one of you job hunt here in Norway during the process. Despite being sticky about the whole 'switching to different visa's' thing, most countries allow or encourage you to work after doing a degree there.  3). Find a job in the US that will instantly transfer you to Norway, but knowing the economy in the US that option isn't quite as likely, but still possible (I know a couple who have done that). 

The thing with immigration is that because it is so widespread in Europe now it is REALLY difficult to do. The absolute easiest route in IS as a student to every country, which is why there are so many fake schools out there that are just fronts to get people in and working. Once you have studied in a country it is almost always easier to get a work permit/visa afterwards. The second easiest route is marriage, but since you guys are already married and probably not polygamists who are into acquiring (illegal) visas for the sole purpose of entering a country, this isn't exactly an option for you, lol.  

In regards to just going for it an applying for a work visa, and wondering if companies will wait the 6+ months, it really depends on each company, what the position is, and when they need it filled. 

The immigration issue is the primary issue you will face and deal with as a couple if you chose to try and move to Norway. It affects everything in your daily life and will heavily affect your relationship if you are both not instantly granted visas. It's complicated, it's a pain in the ass, and it goes on for quite a few years. HOWEVER, it is doable! Don't be under the illusion that you can get here just because you're a Westerner and have good intentions, you can't, but be aware that it does help a bit being from the US or Canada and white (though, fyi, if you're Jewish people are kinda anti-semetic here because they literally have no Jews and can't dissociate being Israeli from being Jewish, so that could be a bit of a shock at first). You're going to spend a lot of time and a lot of money on this (my initial application cost us at least 3000kr, almost $600, and I don't get it back if I'm rejected). It is a BITCH of a process.

If you are serious about moving here though it will be worth the investment. Yeah, shit's expensive here but damn is the quality of life good. I lived in London for a number of years after high school (in the US) and Norway provides the type of living that only the filthy rich could afford there. Even the simple things like having a gym membership is affordable and the facilities will ALWAYS be top of the line and brand new. The quality of food, overall, is way above the average in the UK and most of the US. Bread is actually fresh, and only lasts one day because it's not pumped full of crap! You can't even get the shitty stuff; how awesome is that!? You will always have easy access to nature and anything outdoors related as people are incredibly keep on keeping fit and staying close to the outdoors. People here are all fluent in English, so even if you're struggling in Norsk you're never going to be completely lost if you're language skills are totally failing you that day. You get the whole of July or August off every year and travelling is DIRT CHEAP so you can experience loads of awesome places with the benefit of working with NOK, which is fucking strong currency (more for your money abroad!). 

Basically, don't let my 'this is what you REALLY will be getting into with immigration' reality check discourage you in any way from coming here. I just want to give you the realistic logistics about how this will work, which is a fucking bitch, but again doable if you are really set on it.

  2) Again I want to point out the influences of the Danish Folk party in the past. Up untill the last election they were a part of the sitting government (we have several parties forming a government based on mandates distributed by voters). Politics will be politics and DF was very manipulative and operated in a quid pro quo-fashion. They would often have the decisive vote in political manners, and would manipulate the other parties. Quid pro quo. The politics would heavily reflect this, especially with immigration laws and the likes. The recent controverse regarding our barriers bordering Germany was an initiative towards reducing the amount of eastern Europeans working illegally here, without paying taxes (they would still live in their own countries). Sure, they were controversial, but it's not like we BUILT A FUCKING WALL ACROSS THE ENTIRE BORDER.
  ""Islamophobia"" is not a an issue exclusive to Denmark. Since you are so fond of reading internet-articles, try reading a bit more and see if you can draw any parallels between this behaviour in Denmark and in the rest of western Europe. Can you?

You make absolutely no critical assessment on articles you read, you fail to take psychological factors into mind and you are heavily biased. You are simply wrong. I've never said that racism doesn't exist here, it definately does in different degrees. Some are just unenlightened and others are hateful. But, as a member of the young generation, having grown up and been friends with several msulims from both Arabian and African countries I am fairly sure I have greater insight towards how the mindset is in this younger generation.
  The sad thing is that you share traits with the average racist. You're uninformed, you're hateful, you rely on specifically hand picked articles to document your ""facts"" and statements.

His Mom left him when he was young, left right out the door and moved to Europe to marry another man.  They still talk, but it tore their family apart.  His sister moved to Europe after high school and their Dad is a compulsive gambler.  He lost 2 homes and was evicted from numerous apartments, which all he faked some kind of identity to get.  It comes down to me loving my cousin like a brother - he grew up with me most of his life and we were so close.  I could never let him go.  I still help him to this day but not monetarily anymore.  He knows that I can't.

But, I cosigned for a phone for him... and it just didn't work out.  He paid me for 1.5 years, then it went all downhil..  He couldn't pay it anymore, and after 3 months they disconnected the line and put the $200 fee on it.  So I owed $400 in disconnection/monthly charges.

One is the importance of a decentralized enforcement power. Iceland's decentralized legal system managed to keep its leaders on a short leash for much of its history. Chieftains only had power if they could convince people to follow them, without the use of coercion. This minimized the principal-agent problem. Who wants to voluntarily follow an incompetent or evil leader? And even if an evil leader did sucker a few free farmers into following him, in the long run he would lose credibility.""*

The reason american workers get fucked over is because they are totally unable / inept / unwilling to protect their own rights. You are owned by your employer because generations have let them get away with just that.


This is why it's so important to curb the power any company has over his employees, and to bolster the employees' rights.   But in the US, people holding that opinion are regarded as communist pinko's by the same people who get fucked over on a daily basis.


Fired on unjust / unreasonable grounds? A union brings it to court (at no cost to you), wins by having the law on its side, and the company gets convicted to continue paying your salary until you find something else.  Not getting paid for overtime? A union brings it to court, if possible leaving you anonymous, and a judge will force the company to change that policy. A company retaliates by firing you? See first example, unjust grounds leaves them with footing the bill.  And no, this is not a worker's paradise, but at least there's a protective legal umbrella that shields employees from shit like described in the OP.


Reading stuff like this makes me RAGE.  Why are you letting them do this to you? When does it stop?  Where are you drawing the line? Not until what, you're back in the 19th century with all property in the hands of the few oligarchs, and you slaving away in their factories, on their conditions, 24/7 at their call, living in their rented housing, spending money on their products and their food?  Because this was the reality we came from, and where you're heading back to again.

That's what I had thought too before starting out on reading the Pali Canons. 

Religion vs. Culture - I think this is probably a really important topic which, oddly enough, we don't talk about very often. How much of what we think is religion is in fact cultural? Why do we see such enormous differences between American Christian fundamentalists and Christians in Europe and other parts of the world? Why do we see more violence and oppression in Middle Eastern Islamic countries than we do in South East Asian Muslim countries? Why do we see Hindu Tamils using suicide bombings in Sri Lanka; but we don't see Indian Hindu's doing likewise. Each violent group justifies their actions in religion. Yet conversely, those who oppose it can justify their opposition on religious grounds too.

Obviously, this isn't a discussion about 'is there' or 'isn't there' a deity. We can justify violence on political, sociological, economic, or any other grounds (thinking of Jonathan Swift and the eggs). I'm not sure if you've seen ""The Book of Eli""; but I think the premise what spot on - religions are weapons. Just as we can say that guns don't kill people, people kill people.

&gt;The police report referred to is Voldtekt i den globale byen (Rape in the global city) which provides a detailed analysis of the rape statistics in Oslo during 2010. **The report in fact shows that, of 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified, 45.8% were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin while the majority – 54.2% – were of Norwegian, other European or American origin.**
&gt;
&gt;The claim that “all rapists in Oslo are immigrants” is based exclusively on the figures for “assault rape”, i.e. rape aggravated by physical violence, a category that included only 6 of the 152 cases and 5 of the 131 identified individuals. All of those 5 individuals were indeed of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin. However, the police report adds that in other cases of assault rape, where the individual responsible was not identified and the police relied on the description provided by the victim, “8 of the perpetrators were African / dark-skinned appearance, 5 were Western / light / Nordic and 4 had an Asian appearance”. Which falls some way short of substantiating the claim that all perpetrators of aggravated rape in Oslo are of non-western origin, never mind the assertion that “Muslim immigrants” are responsible for all rapes in the city.
&gt;
&gt;The police report also points out that “it must be stressed that the strong over-representation of people from minority backgrounds for several types of rape can not be interpreted as meaning that foreign culture is a causal explanation of rape” and that “the statistical difference in criminal behaviour between ethnic groups disappears when controlling for socio-economic conditions”. It concludes: “Gross generalisations that have given the impression that the rapists are only foreigners – and largely Muslim – prove inadequate and erroneous.”

If you read Stephen Ambrose, the famous WWII historian, he is quick to point out that the American and British armies were generally respectful to the natives that they met throughout Europe, of course with some bad apples. However, the Red Army was notorious for gang rapes, random killings, and etc. Another scholar, Victor Davis Hanson, bolsters this argument with the idea that democracies typically provide the strongest fighting force throughout world history because when they do commit to a war, their armed forces have the full backing of their citizenry. There are counterpoints to this (Vietnam), but those are exceptions to the rule.

Generally speaking, it is an army of volunteers that will outfight an army of conscripts, but is even more impacted by the government above them. If you're fighting for the USSR in WWII, you're only fighting so that your commanding officer doesn't shoot you on the spot for treason. They ruled by fear.

If you're fighting for the US or British army in WWII, you're fighting for different reasons.

What you see happening now, is a work in progress. You're seeing the EU becoming more like an union. With an economic and legal union established, fiscal oversight is just a rung down from political union.  It's going to need a totally different setup than the one currently used now, and it will be shaped in next few decades. Along the way, more than once a wrong decision will be made, then corrected.

I also admire David Duke. They are great men. However, I am fed up with all the mindless abuse in the Zionist-controlled media of our white European Christian culture.

It took me a long time to understand that the attacks on Christianity didn't just arise from the general group mind, but were actively triggered and sustained by a media campaign. Similarly, it was a media campaign that caused the current contempt for white males that we see everywhere.

I mean, it makes no rational sense for white people to bash their own culture, a culture that created Western civilization. We as a people have a glorious history and magnificent art. Our Christian religion is superior to any other major world religion.

What opened my eyes was the insight that it was insane for a people to mock and revile its own greatest achievements. This just does not happen. If you look through the civilizations of the past, the peoples of those civilizations celebrated their achievements. They recognized those achievements as signposts of their greatness.

For a people to attack its own achievements is diseased. It could not happen of itself, it had to be introduced into the culture, the way a bacterium or a virus is introduced into the blood stream. The instrument of delivery for this social pathogen was the mass media, which shapes our world view and our view of ourselves as a people. We have literally been infected with a social disease -- a disease that is poisoning and corrupting our society.

Who controls the media in the West? Predominently, it is controlled by Jews. I asked myself, why would Jews be so eager to control newspapers, magazines, book publishing, movies, radio, and more recently, television, popular music and the Internet? The answer is obvious.

Mostly it was, dare I say it, ""The Jews"".

 Excerpt from the book, ""Jews and Judaism in the United States: A Documentary History"" by Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael: 
""Jews also took an active part in the Dutch colonial slave trade; indeed, the bylaws of the Recife and Mauricia congregations (1648) included an imposta (Jewish tax) of five soldos for each Negro slave a Brazilian Jew purchased from the West Indies Company. Slave auctions were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday. In Curacao in the seventeenth century, as well as in the British colonies of Barbados and Jamaica in the eighteenth century, Jewish merchants played a major role in the slave trade. In fact, in all the American colonies, whether French (Martinique), British, or Dutch, Jewish merchants frequently dominated. 

""This was no less true on the North American mainland, where during the eighteenth century Jews participated in the 'triangular trade' that brought slaves from Africa to the West Indies and there exchanged them for molasses, which in turn was taken to New England and converted into rum for sale in Africa. Isaac Da Costa of Charleston in the 1750's, David Franks of Philadelphia in the 1760's, and Aaron Lopez of Newport in the late 1760's and early 1770's dominated Jewish slave trading on the American continent."" 

Fact: Jews were SO involved with the majority of the slave-trade in New Orleans, that all the slave-auction houses/blocks were CLOSED ON THE SABBATH. Not Sunday, the Christian, European Sabbath... but Saturday, the Jewish-original sabbath. That alone should speak to the truth.

What they did was forcing unemployed people into common social work projects (like constructing the national highway system (Autobahn) etc.) which were mainly paid for by massive borrowing thereby raising national debt excessively (but hey… no one had to know, right?).
He also simply abandoned the treaty of Versailles which had made Germany (possibly rightfully) accountable for the outbreak of the WWI and forced her to pay massive reparations. This had of course worsened the economy during the global finical crisis in the 1920's and with Hitler simply refusing to pay and no other nations standing up to him, it of course seemed like a huge economic burden was taken of the country.

With the unemployment problem solved, the Nazis went on claiming all assets by people they deemed inferior to the German race (People of Jewish believe mainly). But even that couldn't pay for the massive amount of war machinery Hitler needed to conquer what he had dubbed ""Lebensraum im Osten"" (could roughly translate to ""living space in the East""). Götz Aly (a famous German historian) argues that no matter what Hitler initially intended, by the end of 1938 Germany was so massively in debt that war and the robbing of national assets, natural resources and works of art from other countries was the only way to keep Nazi-Germany solvent. So war was not just an ideological aim, but also an economic necessity.

Also never forget: Hitler's Germany relied on slave labour in all its industries it deemed important for the war since 1939. And with the war going on and all the unjust extraction of capital Hitler was able to keep the machine going until the total surrender in 1945.

So the only way for Hitler to generously ""feed the poor"", keep the unemployed employed, strengthen the economy and right social wrongs in Germany was through stealing, massive borrowing and the occupation of almost the whole of Europe. After this Europe and especially Germany lay in absolute shatters, so no one actually gained anything from his actions.

It makes me goddamn bloody furious whenever I meet people telling me that Hitler was kinda alright, because he like built the freeways and such.  

The post-war economic success had absolutely nothing to do with the events of the 30s and 40s. The intense help through the Western Allies (Marshall Plan etc.) and the careful development of Germany's ""social market economy"" by Ludwig Ehrhart under the Adenauer administration made the ""Wirtschaftswunder"" (""The economy wonder"") possible.

The first games were some of the most intriging... what is this foul, what just happened? etc etc. But these days I get almsot all calls. I also somehow hated the Browns for their name.. (note I didn't understand the meaning of it at that point) Who calls their team the color they use. And so they fell of the list straight away. 

And I ended up with Ed Reed and Brian Dawkins (at that time still an Eagle). In retrospect I was a birdman because also Michael Vick was a curiosity to see when he was still a Falcon.
So after looking into all of their playing styles Vick fell out because he was in jail, Brian fell away because he was more of a hard hitter and Reed shone out of it with his record int and his swagger in that interview where he says not to throw it to him. And thusly I dedicated myself to the Ravens. And even if (god forbid) Reed would change teams I would cheer for him but remain a Ravens fan.

No doubt, India’s participation in the Moscow meeting is a matter of particular interest.  Washington will take note.  Russia virtually got the BRICs to censure US’s interventionist policies in the Middle East.”

Things are turning in Russia's favor, as the world looks on in disgust at the bloody ""Might Makes Right"" war-making of U.S. / Israel.  

Incredibly, the dead-enders who run the empire (into the ground) still don't get the message.  These days, they ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity"".

&gt; A decade later, perhaps the only thing that should truly cause surprise is how little has been learned in Washington.  The military-first policy of choice that rang in the century — there were, of course, other options available — has become the only option left in Washington’s impoverished arsenal. After all, the country’s economic power is in tatters (which is why the Europeans are looking to China for help in the Euro crisis), its ""soft power"" has gone down the tubes, and its diplomatic corps has either been militarized or was long ago relegated to the back of the bus of state.

&gt; What couldn’t be stranger, though, is that from the whirlwind of policy disaster, the Obama administration has drawn the least likely conclusion: that more of what has so visibly failed us is in order — from Pakistan to Uganda, Afghanistan to Somalia, the Persian Gulf to China.  Yes, COIN is out and drones as well as special operations forces are in, but the essential policy remains the same.

Many distributors have ""exclusivity"" agreements with various manufacturers.  Small companies have to deal with distributors and that means the middle-man increases the price.

There's a reason why some of B&amp;H's retail prices are lower than the cost of retailers in Canada:  the Canadian retailers are forced to deal with a middle man (sometimes a middle-middle-middle man, even) who charges an atrocious markup.

The same problem even happens for north america as a whole.  Mamiya Sekkor anyone?  Mamiya products were 50% higher in North America than in Europe &amp; Asia because of the exclusivity deals Mamiya Sekkor had with Mamiya.

Yes, some products require one to purchase in large quantity from the manufacturer which is difficult for individual retailers to do.

But the trouble is that, for example, Cox Communications in Southern California has an effective cable monopoly (though not an ISP monopoly) on a huge swath of land, including much of southern California, Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona, and 13 other states. While, as a cable monopoly in many of these places, Cox gains a competitive advantage in some respects, they are also often forced to maintain similar access levels over huge areas of land. This makes it prohibitively difficult to focus all of their infrastructure efforts on urban areas. In places like Europe it's much easier to pull off this sort of system. In Western Europe rural areas aren't quite so vast and in Eastern Europe providers typically don't provide the same level of access to all areas of the country.

The common ancestral population of humans would probably have had dark skin, and the loss of that pigmentation in certain populations is thought to be an adaptation due to the lesser need for UV protection at high latitudes vs. the nutritional cost of making so much pigment. It looks like Asians and Europeans independently lost their dark skin in somewhat different ways (convergent evolution, sort of).

Of course, the original dark skin would itself have been an adaptation we gained after splitting off from other apes and losing (most of) our fur; if you shave a chimpanzee, it's ~~pink~~pale underneath.

&gt; ""My point is that the world did not tire of the church's ideal, but of its reality. Monasteries were impugned not for the chastity of monks, but for the unchastity of monks. Christianity was unpopular not because of the humility, but of the arrogance of Christians. Certainly, if the church failed it was largely through the churchmen. But at the same time hostile elements had certainly begun to end it long before it could have done its work. In the nature of things it needed a common scheme of life and thought in Europe. Yet the mediaeval system began to be broken to pieces intellectually, long before it showed the slightest hint of falling to pieces morally. The huge early heresies, like the Albigenses, had not the faintest excuse in moral superiority. And it is actually true that the Reformation began to tear Europe apart before the Catholic Church had had time to pull it together. The Prussians, for instance, were not converted to Christianity at all until quite close to the Reformation. The poor creatures hardly had time to become Catholics before they were told to become Protestants. This explains a great deal of their subsequent conduct. But I have only taken this as the first and most evident case of the general truth: that the great ideals of the past failed not by being outlived (which must mean over-lived), but by not being lived enough. Mankind has not passed through the Middle Ages. Rather mankind has retreated from the Middle Ages in reaction and rout. The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.""

Later in the same chapter, he explains,

&gt; ""Whatever is the matter with modern England it is not that we have carried out too literally, or achieved with disappointing completeness, either the Catholicism of Becket or the equality of Marat. Now I have taken these two cases merely because they are typical of ten thousand other cases; the world is full of these unfulfilled ideas, these uncompleted temples. History does not consist of completed and crumbling ruins; rather it consists of half-built villas abandoned by a bankrupt-builder. This world is more like an unfinished suburb than a deserted cemetery.""

Chesterton's point, made about the Catholic church but applied to the church as a whole, is that Christianity has never been enacted in the church in a manner that lives up to the Christian ideal.  It's relevant today in that Christianity is often maligned for the way it has been practiced when the way that it has been practiced has *always* strayed from the paragon of the philosophy (embodied, perhaps, in Christ Himself).",t1_c34q6gj,keatsandyeats,,stclement,9,True,t3_mxrks

In many ""northern"" Euro-countries (like Austria) the crisis isn't really noticeable in everydays life (yet). Many citizen of these countries feel like the EU want to make them pay for other people's mistakes. So the support for the german point of view is strong there. A rise of euro-sceptic parties (supporting, for example, a split-up of the Euro) is likely to happen there.

Especially the periphery thinks that the issuance of Eurobonds is the only solution. Obviously, big parts of the populace is opposed to austerity measures. They doesn't seem to think that they are responsible for the debt made by their governments. 

Non-Euro-countries, like the UK and Poland, fear both a collapse of the Eurozone and a too tight integration of the Euro-countries as it would mean that they would lose influence. 

I don't know what will happen, but there are some scenarios:

-) Germany give up its resistance. Eurobonds are issued, the ECB buys government debt, the market are flooded with money. The inflation rises, Euroland becomes a transfer union. The reforms get to a standstill because the pressure to tackle them diminish.

-) The periphery gets hit by more austerity. Their economies will shrink for some years at least. Depending on the loss of tax money caused by the recession, their debt will rise or fall. Eventually, their competitiveness will improve, but only if they aren't driven into default by market forces before the austerity measures deploy their positive long-term impact. Deflation is also likely to happen.

-) Worst-case: The countries can't agree on a resolute way to solve the crisis and keep muddling through it. The crisis would worsen and the Eurozone would get shattered. Dire economic consequences would lead to the destruction of approximately half of our wealth.

-) The most likely thing to happen is a combination of the first two scenarios. For example, Eurobonds will get issued, but the countries will have to surrender their fiscal sovereignty to the EU if they aren't able to keep their books in good order by themselves.

If your father was a tailor, you were a tailor. If your father was a tanner, then you were a tanner. And so on and so forth.

The word ""Caste"" is a Portuguese word first applied to the class system of Portugal, then to Europe. When the British colonized India, they saw a system of segregation according to professions but understood it as a racist system because racism was the dominant way of thinking for the British colonialists. Around 1900 they classified the four different professions - priests, governors, merchants, and laborers - in the official census.

Underneath these professions - denied a professional rank at all - were the Dalits. In ancient times, they were made the out-group so the majority could feel more godly (a kind of mob rule). They don't have a choice over their status given the collective thinking and pressure to think the same. The one choice they had was to change their last name and lie about their ""caste"", and many have and do as we speak.

As far as I am aware, the poor have not migrated since the beginning of history. They have been told that their state is ordained by God and often died of disease.

Regarding your main point: your caste is understood through your clan (think, your 200 nearest relatives). Your family name and/or place-of-origin indicate your clan.
