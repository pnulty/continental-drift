WTF,"I compared Rosa Parks to the power you have as an individual to change things as opposed to waiting for laws to change. There's a great passage about civil disobedience in a book called the Ethics of Climate Change; because when it comes to our changing environment, we will be pretty screwed if we wait for everyone to have laws to abide by to regulate the changes which are desperately needed. It's great that you're such a Rousseauian in your way of thinking about human nature and its regulation but that can be pretty utopian in a society where people are still taking the wheel after one too many despite it being made illegal...

I haven't been to China so I'll believe what you say, I know they have a very very poor record when it comes to treatment of animals (and human rights..); it isn't as much of an ethical concern over there as it is in the West (I am generalising-everyone is obviously not like that, the concept of animal rights is just as not embedded in the culture from what I've been told.) Are you sure about the very little pain they suffer? Can I have some sources? Because given what I've seen in Europe, in the US (things improved briefly about a decade ago when Temple Grandin was somewhat involved in the ways Cattle were taken to the slaughterhouse for example-only to absolutely plummet) and elsewhere, things have, as said before, plummeted (and I'm not getting this from Peta by the way). We've had several cues about it in the news this month alone (Australia banning live exports to Asia, Iowa and other states trying to make it a criminal offense to film inside abatoirs and livestock areas etc), I mean just look at the price of meat around you, something that cheap must not have cost much to keep alive.. I remember when tesco brought out their £1 or whatever it was chicken, and that was the first time I thought about it. Oh and these practices aren't just bad for livestock, they're bad for you too as a consumer; the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, to give you a popular example, is linked to meat and bone meal which was one of the cheapest ways to eat cows.

&gt;I'd still eat one though, they're going to be there whether I do or not, so I will.

But see this is exactly where we disagree. When a city sets up a bus route running once an hour from say, 10pm to 12am, this bus route is only set up because there is a demand for it. You can think, 'well it doesn't matter if I take that bus or not, it'll still be running', but if thirty people think like that and stop taking the 11pm and 12am, the city would eventually cancel this service. It's basic economics. It's this precise logic which leads to people not voting and to idiots being elected into office by a minority of the population. In Europe for example, whenever there is an election, the extreme-right voters almost always come out en masse because they know that other people won't bother.


*I have never in my life, met a proselytizing vegetarian, neither has anyone I've ever asked about this, this despite my intense fear of taking a few in as a flatmates and thinking I was going to be berated for grilling some frankfurters. What I have however met are needlessly aggressive omnivores who at the mention of 'does this have meat in it?' will absolutely lose it on my friends. Saw it but this past saturday at a hen do when two girls started sniggering about someone explaining that they just don't want to encourage bad farming practice. Also saw it in a tapas bar when two friends tried to trick another into tasting a ratatouille-type dish that had meat and then laughed and said ""¡Haha ! ¡ El plato tenía carne!"". Tell people in the context of outings that you're vegetarian/ask if there's a veg option, do it for ten days and come back and tell me you haven't heard the majority of these without any provocation on your part: http://www.flickr.com/photos/smiteme/4170866438/

islam,"&gt; I do care that Palestinians are wronged, that is why I oppose Syria and Lebanon and Saudi and Egypt.

Do you think they were wronged though?

&gt;What colonial power do you mean? 

Yes the British, the ones who promised to create a land for the Jews, the ones who liberated the death camps, the ones who allowed mass migration from Europe, all while occupying the local population and ignoring their voices.

If it was right of the Zionists to resist European Rule, then surely it was the right of the Palestinians to resist European Rule, be it by Brits or Jews.

&gt;In fact, I wonder who you mean lived and died on the land. The people there did not consider themselves or call themselves Palestinians until the middle of the 20th century at the least. So I am not sure why you assert that some particular group has some identity and right.

There most certainly where Palestinians living in the region for generations. Are you claiming that it really was a land without a people? I find that too strange to even engage with, the Zionist knew this not to be true.

There are Israelis alive today, whose place of birth is listed as British Palestine. If you mean there wasn't a country called Palestine, most countries following the collapse of empires didn't have the names they do now, but they certainly had people. There where Serbians before Serbia for example.

&gt;A claim? Sure. And in 1948 they took a chance and claimed everything and they lost the war.

Who took a chance on war. Be precise.

I'm not sure how Jordan is relevant at all, and the status of the children of refugees is not one of automatic citizenship. Israel has a very strict policy of it's own in this regard.

Thanks for the link to the Jordanian website, but I think you missed my point. If Israel has the right to be recognised as the *Jewish* state despite it's makeup, then how can it object to Jordan making that same request?

&gt;No, it is a clear example of the problem, but it is not the central issue.
What do you mean, it was the impetus behind it's creation, and the justification for it's excesses. 

&gt;Yet you brought it up and I denied it was the issue. Are you actually a Zionist?
I bought it up to explain how it is used. If you deny was the issue, then how do you explain this passage:

&gt;Because they joined in that crime, because they used violence to prevent Jews from escaping the Holocaust. 

It does look rather strange given the circumstances of the Palestinians, and the magnitude of the crimes of Germany, Italy, Spain. If you want to say the Palestinians are paying the price for participating in the Holocaust, I agree. I wish more people would say the same. It only illustrates the very strange nature  of Israelis creation to the world with regards to the local population. 

&gt;I was talking about the Sudanese crimes. The Sudanese are not Arabs either.

That should illustrate to you why talking about the 'Muslim mind' or whatever the phrase was, is so blunt as to be meaningless. Many Sudanese do identify as Sudanese Arab btw.

&gt;Do you have the same advice for Jews in America, to not get involved in Americas Middle East Policy?

I'm not sure I got an answer to the question. I know many American Jews would like it if Israels opponents shut up, but thankfully that won't happen. It seems rather hypocritical given AIPAC, JStreet, and figures like Palin and Beck taking an interest. The reason I bring Palin and Beck up, is not for guilt by association, but because they talk Israel all day long. They back it to the hilt, but I don't hear many people  tell them to shut up and concentrate on the Congo instead.

&gt;No, Israel is not central and the ""War on Terror"" is not an election. Are you admitting you were wrong or are you going to double down and just lie?

Right so since 9/11 middle east policy has become less important, and no one ever says Israel is the front line in the War on Terror, is that truthy enough for you?

If you really think the Congo is more important than the spat in Israel, please tell  American Jewish groups to stop making Israel a central issue. Stop funding AIPAC, and don't make campaign donations due to a candidates stance on the conflict.

&gt;And you have yet to explain why you ignore multiple genocides and argue that others should as well.

answers,"I would, of course, defer to those that have a better understanding of the industry than I... but from an environmental standpoint I would advise against this as a career.

Gas prices will continue to be a volatile aspect of the viability of this profession, not to mention the expense of maintaining the highway system in a country with very low population density.

Gas prices as you probably know are heavily subsidized by the government, which leads the cost of gas in the US to be about half of what it costs in Europe. A recent study has determined that the true cost of gas (if you factor in all of the externalities of pollution) is $15 per gallon. I'm willing to guess that the trucking industry will shut down well before the price reaches that high.

The deficit being what it is, both at the federal level and the state level will inevitably result in the number of viable interstate roads shrinking rather than growing over the next 30 years.

And lastly, trucking isn't very efficient, particularly compared to rail transport. Which means that while trucking won't likely die as an industry, it's likely that trucking will be used more and more for short haul rather than long haul freight forwarding.

If the population density were higher for most of the US (like it is on the east coast) then trucking would have a more secure future, but it isn't and many geographers/environmentalists/city planners will tell you cross-country trucking may not be around for the duration of your anticipated career.

islam,"&gt;Do you think they were wronged though?

I just said that. I think that the Palestinians have been horribly treated. 50 million refugees by 1950. All of them were helped to build new lives, all except the Palestinians. The rest of the Arabs betrayed them in 1948 by invading Palestine and they betrayed them for the next 60 years by refusing to treat them fairly. 

&gt;Yes the British, the ones who promised to create a land for the Jews,

Other than a wartime propaganda document what the the British *do* to set up the Jewish state? Nothing. Very soon after that document they lined up with the Arabs against the Jews. At best the British tried to play both sides against each other so the British could hold their colony.

&gt;If it was right of the Zionists to resist European Rule, then surely it was the right of the Palestinians to resist European Rule, be it by Brits or Jews.

Did the Jews have the right to resist dhimmi laws? And you seem to have slipped from talking about the Arab right to oppress the Jews to the Arab right to fight the British. I'll remind you again: the British set up the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan and armed, trained, and led its army.

&gt;I'm not sure how Jordan is relevant at all,

How is the country that is 70% Palestinian not relevant? How is one of the other countries targeted by the PLO not relevant?
&gt;If Israel has the right to be recognised as the Jewish state despite it's makeup, then how can it object to Jordan making that same request?

Israel has not objected to that. The *PLO* objected. Are you actually unaware of Black September? In 1970 the Palestinians were still claiming Jordan (home to most of the Palestinians) as Palestine. They [tried to take over Jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan) (like they tried, and might finally have succeeded in taking over Lebanon). Some 3-5,000 Palestinians were killed and the PLO gave up even claiming Jordan. Israel has been far easier on the Palestinians than have their fellow Arabs.

&gt;There most certainly where Palestinians living in the region for generations. 

There were people living there, yes. They did not consider themselves Palestinian and lots and lots of people immigrated to the area in the 20th century. 

&gt;If you mean there wasn't a country called Palestine, 

There has never been a country called Palestine. But my point is more central that that: there has never until the mid-20th century been a people who called themselves Palestinian. They had no distinct poetry style or art style. In 1900 and in 1948 there was major political argument in the Arab world over who should control the Area. The Syrians called it Southern Syria. The Jordanians called it the West Bank and saw it as part of Jordan. The Egyptians saw it as part of Egypt. And so the attacks in 1948 were in part set up so those countries could enforce their claims.

&gt;There where Serbians before Serbia for example.

I wonder if you bother to think about this stuff at all. There was a [Kingdom of Serbia in 1100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_in_the_Middle_Ages). There have been Serbians longer than there have been Muslims. Serbia pre-dates Yugoslavia, what that what you meant?

&gt;Who took a chance on war. Be precise.

Every single Arab nation and the Palestinian Arabs who decided to leave, who refused to return to Israel, and who refused Israeli citizenship. Not their children and grandchildren, the word rarely treats the grandchildren of refugees as refugees.

&gt;If you want to say the Palestinians are paying the price for participating in the Holocaust,

I don't and I didn't. This is your strawman.

&gt;The reason I bring Palin and Beck up, is not for guilt by association, but because they talk Israel all day long.

No, it is guilt by association. Neither Palin nor Beck is an influential figure in American politics nor in the decisions by American Muslim groups. You bring them up to try to connect Israel to disliked American figures. Would you like me to do that, it is far easier for me.

&gt;Right so since 9/11 middle east policy has become less important, and no one ever says Israel is the front line in the War on Terror, is that truthy enough for you?

Yeah, it is about as truthy as I expect from you. Israel is a factor in the Middle East. But your original claim was that Israel was a major factor in American elections. Keep changing your claim, maybe you will find one that is not horrible inaccurate.

&gt;If you really think the Congo is more important than the spat in Israel, please tell American Jewish groups to stop making Israel a central issue.

They are protecting Israel. I wonder why you need to attack Israel. 

&gt;Have I?

Yep, over and over.

&gt;I have told you many times, America has more leverage in Israel Palestine than in Sudan. 

So? Maybe 5,000 people have died in the conflict in the last 10 years. Compare that to the Congo or Darfur or Southern Sudan and tell me why you want the U.S. to turn against Israel.

Still wrong. Do you know any history at all?

europe,"I'll take a look at the documentary (thx! I heard of it and thought I should take a look, but slipped my mind w time), but re the speech by the green MEP, I agree almost completely; I don't think its shameful that currently loans are given at a small interest, given that there's a large risk these won't be repayed in full, and markets would demand much much higher interests to take that risk. And while he speaks of 'Germans' etc selling them weapons, I think we can agree he really means some of their companies and he makes no accusations that these are a condition for getting the loans. I wouldn't expect they were because europe is sufficiently scared of a default because of its banks not to be able to reject giving a loan if greece refused to buy weapons to make it more likely to pay the debt off.

All major media sources I saw were speaking about these protest as being against the severe austerity measures, and described them as a mix of pay cuts, tax raises and privatizations. Never saw the word 'lazy' used, and re tax avoidance, the fact their tax administration is factually inefficient (and I'd expect richer citizens to profit more on this basis) speaks of structural problems of greek administration, rather than about some moral depravity.

Now re 'deserving' what has happened, again ignoring the moral undertones of such language, I do think that given their standards of living grew partly on the basis of such money borrowed and hidden in the books, they should be ready for severe reduction of their standard of living to pay this off, to the extent that is even possible. So I certainly don't agree with the protests against austerity measures, and think greek are wrong to refuse it merely on the basis of destroying their expected economic futures (but doubt population of any country in such a situation would react differently).

&gt; Silly silly, a bigot, according to the Merriam Webster dictionary is “ a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions or prejudices…one who regardes or treats the members of a group with hatred and intolerance…” So let have a look at your behavior… You’ve blatently referred to my people as kikes.

Okay, I should have referred to “your people” (your words) as assholes. Nobody likes assholes.

&gt; You’ve disparaged their story as somehow meaningless and insignificant (by the way hundreds if not thousands of third tier educational institutions in the world have departments solely devoted to the study of Jewish history, so yea people do care ;)

Big fucking deal. In those third, second and first tier educational institutions, there are also departments of theology.

&gt; You’ve suggested that Jewish schools should be banned completely, indicating that you want Jews to completely abandon their culture, their traditions and assimilate to the miserable existence you wake up to every morning. 

This is not culture, but religion. Over the last 50 years, we have totally ditched the roman scatholic religion, and although it was claimed it was an integral part of our culture, our culture has since been flourishing like it never had before since we got rid of those mental chains. Surely the same thing should happen to an eventual jewish culture!

&gt; Not only that but you call Jewish schools madrassas. You understand that that’s an Arab word, right? It simply means school, nothing to do with religion.

It’s a place where kids are indoctrinated with a goddammed fucking retarded religion.

&gt; Yep. So you call me a kike because you have an innate animosity toward me since I am a Jew. Not much space for you to dodge the “anti-Semite” label, mr. anti-Semite.

The jewishness has nothing to do with it. It’s all in the assholiness. And yes, I know you don’t like me, mr jew, so you call me “antisemite”. Believe me, nobody takes that word seriously anymore.

&gt; By the way, I eat bacon too. It’s quite delicious. I also don’t go temple all that often. So yea, keep on trying to “piss me off” – you’re doing quite poorly at that – by telling me your doing some stuff that only makes you sounds like a juvenile fucktard.

Oh well. You can’t always win all the time, you know? So, if you eat bacon, aren’t you afraid of pissing-off rabbi Rosenblumenthalovitcheinstein and he’ll send you straight to what passes for hell to jews???

&gt; Yes, which is why the UN recognizes the state of Israel

After some pretty matches of arm-twisting, yes. Was it Liberia who was threatened with the US witholding investment in rubber plantation who cast the deciding vote? Or something like that.

But soon enough, the UN pretty well regretted doing this, particularly after the 1967 war, where the zionist-occupied Palestine doesn’t recognize the UN’s resolutions…

&gt; Woops, nope. At the end of WWII and even during it, many of the Jews arriving to the Yishuv and then Israel were in fact stateless people, 250,000 men, women and children who left the DP camps (that’s displaced people) who needed a home. The Jews that had already been there were mostly citizens of the British mandate.

Well, you can count on the britshit not doing anything about that… Recall that, at the time, canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King famously said “one jew is too much” with regards to admitting refugees…

Those people arriving in Palestine left Europe, yes. But they didn’t get expelled; the nazis were totally defeated, so there was nothing the jews could fear anymore.

&gt; As for the bullshit premise, you clearly never learned that the first Zionist pioneers in the region were socialists, many of which were atheists. They didn’t come for God or anything religious. 

Big fucking deal, socialists/communists aren’t pure; they, too, have their share of disgusting stuff. Looking upon bullshit premises to displace the population of another country to ultimately take control of it, no matter who does it, left or right, is still wrong.

&gt; They, along with much of the world, understood the unbroken connection between Jews and their land thats lasted throughout recorded history. Then again, I shouldn’t expect you a little shitstain like you to know that since you never bother yourself to learn about Jews.

Why should I bother, indeed? There are far more interesting subjects to study indeed.

&gt; Ok, so the first definition of nation that comes up in google reads as the following: A large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory. Hmmm…so Jews are an aggregate of people….you’d call us kikes….with a common ancestry dating back millennia , a long and bloody history, a shared and vibrant culture, a distinct language known as Hebrew and…and ….AND what is now a particular country and territory known as the modern state of Israel.

Which is an artificial state based on religion (if I don’t have a truncated penis, I cannot become a citizen of that state) that was stolen from other people.

No matter how you slice it and dice it, zionist-occupied Palestine is wrong, wrong, wrong, because it has been stolen and the people who lived there were expelled or exterminated.

&gt; No. LOL. No. You just hate Jews.

Not jews but assholes. &lt;cue for a cliché — you may read it bobbing your head side to site&gt;“You know, I have very good jewish friends”&lt;/end of cliché&gt;…

&gt; LOL. Seriously? You know what…I forgot how gracious the Russians were….o wait, no….but the English….no they expelled us too....aha, the Spanish….o that whole Inquisition thing was kinda bad….

All a bunch of assholes who also based their stupid actions on their goddammed fucking religion. Just like the zionists do today to justify their exactions.

&gt; Na. Jews came to all these countries and many, many more, tried to assimilate, many even abandoned their identities as Jews or converted, but were still discriminated against. 

Well, yes. Thanks to the goddammed fucking stupid religion that ruled those countries; heck, that bullshit even claimed that the jews killed their god!!! How’s that for stupidity!!!

&gt; In Germany many of the greatest intellectuals were secular Jews. In France Alfred Dreyfuss, who I assume you’ve never heard of, was disgraced and imprisoned on false espionage charges despite being a loyal officer in the French military. Why? Because he was born a Jew and the French people needed someone to hate.

Do not insult my intelligence. I fully know about Alfred Dreyfuss, and I would have taken his side with the same energy I battle the bullshit of zionism and all those goddammed fucking religion-inspired crap with (that “with” goes with “energy” above, if you’re puzzled by my phrase).

&gt; Palestine is to the East.

No, no, no, it’s all over the place.

&gt; I think I’m a person better equipped for the realities on this world than you are. So yea, I’m better than you. You have a poor grasp on history and your emotions, evidently.

Ooooow, now comes the condescending crap… Well, what do you know… Who told you you’re better? יהוה?

&gt; Now, I don’t care if you’re not Jewish so don’t kid youself. I’ve met many many wonderful non-Jewish people who were educated and enlightening,

Libertarian,"Remember that before industrialization, most people lived in rural areas and most people that lived in the rural areas in the US were land owners themselves. This aspect of the US has made it unique in revolutions due to the fact that it was mainly driven by the interests of land owners people rather than the people that are commonly known as ""poor"", that is the people that own nothing. At this time, wage labor was known as wage slavery because owning or working land was basically what most people did. Of course you still had poverty, but it wasn't like what existed in France where people were starving to death while the aristocracy was happily eating their food in their mansions. People that were poor basically all lived on their own land and had their own worries which were completely different from the peasantry in for example France.

In France at the time, the landowner was a guy that lived in a big house and had a bunch of people living on his land who paid him taxes and he most likely got the place from his father who had gotten it from his father, and so on back to the point at which they had either bought the land or had been given it by someone who had a fuck ton of it, usually land was given to officers who usually also were sons of land owners as the profession was very restrictive. In short, becoming a land owner was institutionally restricted to a certain class and if you weren't part of this class you got fucked up the ass for pretty much your entire life. 

The states however was filled with land owners. Like completely fucking jammed with them. You had people basically just moving to a new area, plonking their stuff down and declaring that they now owned it. This was done on a massive scale, to the point where a huge portion of the population were land owners. Later on, as more and more land was cleared out and cross ocean travel become relatively cheap, huge waves of immigration came and it was primarily people that moved in and basically just took a piece of land. In Europe, each piece of land had long since been claimed and the people who owned it were usually very good at making sure they could keep owning it. North America had an ever advancing westwards frontier that constantly had land which someone could claim. 

The American revolution was that of landowner rising up and protecting their property. The poor, as in the people that owned nothing but their own labor and trivial possessions, was as a very small portion of American society and most of that group were simply slaves which weren't nearly enough or well thought of at the time to actually matter. It would be like if during a revolution we suddenly started taking the needs and desires of cows or horses seriously. It wasn't until the industrial revoluation and urban migration that ""the poor"" we now know today were created as people flocked into the cities to find jobs everyone in your area also wanted. The poor of Dickens simply didn't exist in the same numbers that we think they did before industrialization and thinking about white land owners as a minority simply isn't a realistic picture of society at the time. We like to think about farmers as poor people because they live in hovels and don't own a lot of things, but truth is that these people were in their own terms extremely well off, usually being able to live on the same piece of land for many generations without too much worry. 

Even if only 10%(hypothetical figure) of land owners supported the revolution in the US, the fact that there so many land owners in the US these 10% were close to being 10% of the entire population, meaning that these people wielded a collective power that was very considerable. 10% of land owners in France was a tiny portion of the country, far less than 1% of the total population. Not to mention that even if only a minority of people supported the revolution as in they provided financial aid and what not to them, most people didn't see any reasons in bothering with actively sabotaging the work that these revolutionaries did. Basically you had two active minorities of for and against, and a large passive majority. Most people didn't object to the new union since they either benefited from it or simply weren't persecuted in any way by it.

AskReddit,"&gt;Long-term, it's more important for the world economy as a whole that the most dynamic, innovative economies grow (US, Europe, Japan) than it is for these primitive, commodities export economies to grow. 

You haven't shown this, and economically speaking you are *just wrong.*  It's better for there to be *more* people because people provide the basis of economic activity (they are the generators of it; they make up the 'bottom' of both sides - production, and consumption).  The more people there are that can participate in the marketplace, the better it is for economic growth, and for all tertiary elements of an economy (eg, innovation.  I know you didn't read my post because it was too well-thought out for you to comprehend, but China is a great example of this - they have historically dramatically underperformed their population, and it has been a *drag* on the economy).  

&gt;Growth in emerging countries is not self-sustained, it's based on raw products exports, devalued currency, slave labour. 

You understand that many of the countries you are talking about as 'innovative economies' all had slavery less than 150 years ago, right?  How does a country become 'worth' growth in your book?  Executing the excess populace?  Being white?

&gt;These undeveloped countries need a strong US, a strong Europe and a strong Japan as markets and centers of innovation. 

The US and Europe *aren't* innovating.  They're cutting research and education funding in favor of paying for social services (which provide zero innovation).  

&gt;Poor countries do not invent anything but excuses for their own failures and shortcomings.

Yes, there's that jingoism again.  

&gt;The difference in birth rates in the US and India is an observable fact; India is a horrible, terrible place to live in nowadays. I prefer the North American standards and family model.

I'm thinking about submitting this to Merriam Webster as a definition for jingoism.  ""The US is the right way because I live here and I am comfortable.""  I know many Indians, either through work or school.  I can't remember any of them saying ""God India is such a shithole, they should just lock the doors and set the place on fire.""

You buy all the expensive stuff without ever having appreciated the lower and middle end stuff.  (Think rap artists ordering Cristal or Dom Perignon without ever having tried Chandon - the fuck is the point?)  They will go to the EU and miss out on staying in cheap hostels meeting fun young people and loose international women, instead they will stay at a stuffy 4 star hotel and blow their money shopping or some bullshit.

Their vision will become blind to all the amazing shit the world has to offer because it is inexpensive, and therefore not cool enough or ""just something that poor people do.""  The irony, they're not even rich.  When you are in the lowest level of the upper class making $500k/y, literally tens of millions of dollars separates you from the higher levels.  

Some women will fuck you because you have money and you aren't totally hideous, and will try to convince you that marriage is a good idea.  They had this planned since childhood.  Barely anyone actually respects you because you look young and most will assume the money is your parents' even if it's not.  Everyone will assume you're a douche even if you're not, because you're that ""young guy driving the Porsche.""  Nevermind that you're, say, a true car enthusiast who truly appreciates being fortunate enough to drive the car of your dreams at the track (for example).  

I went to a fairly affluent high school and far too many of the students there drove $50-100k cars (in high school, in the late '90s).  It was fucking disgusting.  One of my good friends (good guy) had a Mercedes SL 500 and hated driving it because he didn't want to be flashy, but the car was a hand-me-down from his dad who didn't want any less-than-premium cars in his driveway, so my friend had no choice but to drive it.  

Become an expert at what you love, you will love your life and if you're any good you will make money doing it.  All it really takes is a little self-motivation, a lot of independent research, and a lot of diligence.  In the end that means a lot more than being handed a job, or being able to drive a $100k SUV.  It is infinitely more satisfying achieving your own goals than a generic level of financial ""success"" without really trying.

worldnews,"That's interesting. If we value goods and services, then the 40 percent of gdp made by 17.5-25% of the workforce is a job well done by them. Of course Greece is not the richest country in the world, so even at twice their average gdp/capita, then surpassing USA, it still wouldn't impress your average Luxembourger (at ~$85k), but the public sector did well compared to the private at least.

&gt; Greece STILL has the highest debt in Europe

Depends on what you mean by debt. If we are talking about external debt then Greece owes 175% of its gdp. By comparison, we can mention Luxembourg again with ~3500% (that's two zeroes), Norway ~550% and UK ~400%. Oh and apart from Greece, the other of EU's two troubled children is of course Ireland ~1100% (two again).

You are exactly right that the government did spend a massive amount of money though (just not relatively), and one of the most important lessions for other countries must come from looking at who benefited from the expenditure, and who's going to suffer the cost.

The later part is easy. Bailouts, austerity measures, et al., are paid for by the public, and hits the poorest the hardest.

For the former part it's easy to see who it wasn't for. Public spending in Greece has been slightly lower than EU's average, but a touch higher than in USA. (By the way Sweden, commonly EU's absolutely highest spender, closing in on twice the % of USA, has a budget deficit of 0.5% of GDP.) I'll also take this opportunity to dispel another illusion: South Korea has the longest average yearly work hours in the world. Second place? Greece, 25% ahead of USA. Meanwhile France has a 35-hour workweek by law, and Germany has it through good unions. These last two countries will be relevant soon.

So what happened to the money? We should realize that this is not a Greek situation, it's a Eurozone situation, where as a weak party to the Euro, Greece has had no control over its own interest rates or exchange rates, and with an overvalued currency, especially next to Germany's strongly undervalued currency, credit was the only way to survive the financial crisis. A credit Germany (and France) was of course in need to lend. Which now leads to problems, as the German president-equivalent put it a while ago:

&gt;“The debt that had to be accumulated [by Greece], when it’s going badly, is now becoming the object of speculation by precisely those institutions that we saved a year-and-a-half ago. - That’s very difficult to explain to people in a democracy who should trust us.”

But this is of course from the same people who are pushing for the greek bailouts, who stands to lose the most if Greece would or would have defaulted on some part of the debt. Much like in USA a few years back a lot of powerful creditors are holding toxic assets. And while comprehensive audits would be revelatory, beyond the obvious violations of regulations lending banks knowingly did, towards expected ends, I expect that much like in USA we will se bailouts forced upon the people, and in this case they will even lose their control of their society until they have paid back debts they don't know who took or what for.",2,t1_c22x3sg,t5_2qh13,2,t1_c22y2tx,t3_id4v5,,True,False,1427302975,True,0,,c22y2tx,starlivE,0,,0,1309488726

news,"1) The comparison is not exactly the same, one was over the course of 4 years the other over 10.

2) Also, comparing the total cost of the war amongst allies would be a more useful comparison as the United States bears far more of the share in the War on Terror than it did to WWII.

3) Most of the benefits of WWII immediately following the war were perceptual at best and non-existent at worst. Might I remind you that the U.S. was still in a depression in 1945 and Europe's economy was decimated. Looking at the utility of a war during or immediatly after its completion is next to useless.

AskReddit,"Except your ignoring the massive dependence that China has on western demand and FDI/ FPI flows to maintain growth in the private sector (which is the most important for overall productivity and GDP growth). There is also the issue that many Chinese banks have holdings offshore in very risky assets that may be dragged down from the collateral damage of a meltdown in Europe. They have their own problems right now with SinoForest showing that even companies that seemed to have good corporate governance may default on their loans. Thers also a possible housing bubble that the government has claimed to have successfully stopped by all the RRR and interest rate hikes recently.

Finally there is the issue of how Chinese banks classify non-performing loans. Last I checked their classification system is much more lax than western standards (may have changed by now- as the data i got was from 2008-2009). With that old system, even if they have an apparent 1-2% loans underperforming today, it may be as high as 4-5%. This is before the housing problem, and corporate governance issues which would wipe out a lot more wealth.

Ofcourse no one wants to even talk about the Asset Management Companies that took on all the bad loans that the banks used to have (so many infact that in McKinsey Consulting estimated the bad loans ratio to be as high as 20-30% in 2005). An estimated 30% recovery was stated in 2006.

edit: Forgot to add the local government debt crises that seems to have peaked recently- alone it isn't a threat but with europe collapse, followed by world emand collapse, followed by housing bubble in china, followed by corporate collapse in china... well you think about it.

Your idea makes for a pretty boring trip. Also, you can't normally pass through Saudi Arabia unless you can give them a good reason why you can't fly. 

Jordan would be a whole lot interesting, and in fact is extremely safe. It makes much of Europe look like a slaughterhouse by contrast.

languagelearning,"I became fairly fluent in Portuguese the following way:

1. Took several years of Spanish
2. Looked up the differences between certain important verbs (you can figure out some of the most important verbs in everyday language on your own)
3. Met a Brazilian who spoke no English, and made friends with them
4. Tell them you need them to speak slowly so you can concentrate on what they're saying
5. (This worked for me) Teach them my language (English) in return for them teaching me theirs (Portuguese).

This was done over the course of a semester in school, but you start catching on very quickly. Honestly, I'd say the best way to approach fluency is immersion. 

Just know the basics - many verbs are the same as in Spanish. A few notable differences: [note, I am not using proper accents/markings, etc. in many of these words, because I'm lazy]
1. Yo (sp) = Eu (por)

2. Gracias (sp) = Obrigado (por) [Note: Brazilian Portuguese is kinda lazy and often drops letters (seemingly at random). Most Brazilians I know say ""brigado,"" as opposed to ""obrigado,"" but it means the same thing.

3. Tener [yo tengo] (sp) = Ter [eu tenho] (por)

4. Querer [yo quiero] (sp) = Querer [eu quero] (por) [Notice that there is no 'i' in the ""I"" form of the conjugated verb ""to want,"" as you would find in Spanish] Also, I'm not sure the exact difference, but another verb for ""to want"" in Portuguese is ""quiser.""

5. Estar [yo estoy] (sp) = estar [eu sou] (por) Conjugation is different, but the root verb is not. Also, this is one of those verbs where they drop the first few letters, sometimes. So, instead of saying ""ele esta"" (he is), one would say ""ele ta.""

6. Me llamo (sp) = me chamo (por) [This is pronounced 'shamo']

7. Know basic numbers - um, dois, tres, quatro, cinco, seis, sete, oito, nove, dez (des?) I'm not sure which.

8. Simple greetings like ""Hello, how are you"" are different in Portuguese. A lot of the language is slang or figures of speech. For example: in Spanish, you would say ""Como estas?"" for ""how are you?"" But in Portuguese, it's very unusual that you'd hear someone say this. However, they would know what you meant. Instead, they say ""Como vai?"" (How's it going?) Also, ""nossa"" is a very common expression. It literally translates to ""our,"" but means something along the lines of ""oh man!"" or some other thing you'd say when you're amazed, exasperated, surprised, etc.

9. Some simple word differences - [I'll add more if I think of any]
boy/girl = chico/chica (sp), menino/menina (por)
man/woman = hombre/mujer (sp), cara/mulher (por) [These terms vary by region]
he/she = el/ella (sp), ele/ela (por)
where is...? = donde esta...? (sp), onde ta...? (por)
for = por (sp), pra (por)
when? = quando? (sp), cuando? (por)
with/with me = con/conmigo (sp), com/comigo (por)
without = sin (sp), sim (por) [pronounced 'seem']


10. Pronunciation of letters/characters:
-Your 'y' sound is going to be spelled as ""lh"" as in the verb ""olhar"" (to look). [Ol-yar]
-Brazilians pronounce their 't' and 'd' differently. The noun 'tio' (uncle) is instead pronounced as if it were 'chio'. Similarly, 'cidade' (city) [this part is tricky] is pronounced 'ci-da-jee'.

AskReddit,"I wasn't saying those countries aren't free. But they are countries that use the state as a tool to heavily provide services and infrastructure. They all have strong social safety nets, laws that serve to help balance power between employer and employee, and vast government funded education systems. I would never propose ""less freedom"" for anyone, but I don't believe that taxes and government programs infringe freedom, either. Money generated within a society is generated with the benefits of the infrastructure the society has built, and paying your share to keep it going is only fair.

Economics,"&gt; Source on that? I think it must be true, but I'd like to see that we spend as much on public health care.

[The 2010 budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_States_federal_budget) shows a combined $743 billion on Medicare and Medicaid. We apparently spend [another $40 billion on healthcare for veterans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs). On top of this, state governments spend a ton of money too, but I don't feel like looking up those numbers now, so I'm just going to go with $783 billion.

That's $2550 per capita, and since that number doesn't include state government spending, it's undoubtedly a lowball estimate. Compared to other systems, [that's about the same spending as many prosperous European and Asian countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita).

&gt; Also, what's causing the waste? Unnecessary tests?

[This is a great article series on the issue.](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/what-makes-the-us-health-care-system-so-expensive-introduction) Unfortunately, the conclusion is:

&gt; If you listen to politicians, and sometimes advocates, you would think the solution  is easy.  It’s pharma’s fault.  It’s the insurance companies.  It’s trial lawyers.  It’s hospitals.

&gt; No.

&gt; It’s all of those things, and more.  Our system costs more because just about every part of it just costs more.  And curbing that spending won’t be easy.  Much of what we choose to spend money on is stuff that we as Americans seem to value.  Much of that value, unfortunately, isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

&gt; ...

&gt; There are a few things we all have to own up to.  The first is that most of the “extra” spending is in areas of *care*.  So, please, let’s stop pretending that cost containment can be painless or unnoticed.

&gt; ...

conspiracy,"""Brown people can enter a hotel where white people are staying unnoticed""?  

Disregarding the sheer bigotry of such a statement, it's also a rather weak logical leap.  That hotel was not a ""brown people"" hotel, it was a hotel that housed most of western media and intelligence apparatus.  It was also rather well guarded.  I'm not sure if you're familiar with what's been happening in Afghanistan over the last 10 years, but people aren't exactly flying and staying in Kabul for leisure.  

Too, these ""brown people"" were rather heavily armed.  Mortars, RPG's, automatic weapons...which is to say, they would have been noticed not just for ""being brown"" but also for being ""brown and heavily armed"" in a place that is saturated with American military and intelligence.  Getting into Kabul would have been difficult-- getting into THAT hotel would have been near impossible.

As to your other comments:  ""slipping"" past TSA in the manner this man did is not ""nothing.""  I don't know if you've ever flown out of LAX.  He went through security not only with just a bogus boarding pass, but also with a 5 year old student ID from Michigan-- neither of which would have got him through, and in order to get to the gate he would have had to shown them twice.  

The ""revolutions"" in the Middle East ""brought on by social media"" is also a rather difficult thing to accept.  After half a century of being dominated by oppressive dictators, a ""spontaneous"" revolution took place in one third of the Arab world because of Facebook?  Really?  You honestly believe that?  Not one country, but 7 out of 22 countries are revolting because of ""social media?""  

OBL? I can write a book about how ridiculous that story is.  

Iran conducting military exercises NOW?  Advertising their long-range missile capabilities two days after Israel announces they want armed Mossad agents quartered at ever airport in Europe and cancelling flights to airports that refuse to comply with that demand?

A flotilla mission going to Gaza?  Hezbollah removing there missiles in Syria and moving them to Lebanon?

egg in a basket $2: cut round hole in a slice of buttered toast, put in the frying pan, dump an egg in the hole sunny side up. flip.

fancy ramen $3: make some ramen/ rice. dont add the powder. add a single egg on top (scrambled/ sunny side. however you like it). if you want to live dangerously add sweet and sour sauce

hobo protein shake $1: powdered milk/ pancake mix/ flour (all 3 are pretty much the same thing) add in water/ milk. add chocolate syrup/ fruits/ ice/ crushed up cereal. if you get the serving size down this tastes identical to expensive protein shakes from GMC

baguette $2: a 3 foot long baguette from the bakery/ bakery part of the supermarket spread butter/ cheese. a great cheap snack. can get like 6 servings out of this.

grilled cheese $2: are you just adding cheese? the add-ons are endless. i recommend turkey bacon (bacon's cheap less satisfying cousin)

home made granola bars $4: melted marshmallows and cereal. (a tip on the cereal. buy the unflavored crappy cereal and add sugar).

stir fry $6: fry up some fresh cut pepper, onions, brocoli, various other veggies. add rice and some generic cheap meat/ scrambled eggs. then add sweet and sour sauce to bring it all together. this was a staple of my college diet and would yield me 2 large meals. the key is to never eat the same mix of shit, make each stir fry different.

Given, I do live in Asia, and it might be more traditional here.. But also in Europe, at least my hometown, typically it is expected for the man to pay.

And I promise you, If you dont or if you split the bill, and she tells you she is fine with it.. chances are that she is not. Chances are that she will talk to her girlfriends about this experience and chances are that you wont get to the third date with her.

Some women will often also, out of a false sense of ""taking care of her own"" offer to split the bill - and some men will then agree to that... however in my personal circle I never once heard that a date where this happened was seen as a successful date in retrospect.

To all the women, this is not about taking care of your own. I am fully aware that most women can take care of their own and I wouldnt want to be together with a woman who his completely dependent on me. This is about romantic protocol.

As a guy, you bring a girl flowers when you pick her up - If you dont do that, you are a schmuck.

As a guy, you open doors for her, take her coat when appropriate, pull her chair back, look out for her in a protective manner when she crosses the street - If you dont, you are a schmuck.

As a guy you pay the bill, its that simple - and if you dont, you are a schmuck. 

I personally agreed to split the bill once - and while it didnt completely destroy the date, it definitely left a shadow on the rest of the evening.

IMO guys who agree to that, or guys who even expect to split the bill are just plain and simple: cheap. Nothing more to it. 

I mean, come on, really? I just dont understand, typically every guy should _want_ to pay for a date without exception. I mean you _want_ to show her a good time, right? You _want_ to make a good impression to her, right?

ukpolitics,"The opinions of the Daily Mail pre-war were a reflection of the views of its editorial team- not necessarily Britain as a whole. For every Daily Mail reader, there was a Times reader, a Mirror reader, a New Statesman reader, and a (Manchester) Guardian reader- opinions on the war varied wildly across the literary world at the time. (Give Orwell's writings on the period a look, on a somewhat related note- fascinating glimpse into history.)

Your grandfather might not have felt that he was fighting for anything at the time, but as a whole? The war *meant* something. As a result, fascism was all but swept out of Europe- leaving the West to develop into the society we have today. Equal rights, regardless of colour or creed? *Human* rights? Multi-party democracy? The very freedom to *hold* anti-establishment opinions?

&gt;50% of the vote between them....50% of what? the amount of people who voted....how many people voted? 

54.5% of the people who felt the desire to engage with the political process at the time, not being content with indifference. In short, a majority of the people who *cared*- in Britain's system, the freedom not to give the slightest toss is embedded in the political culture. If somebody doesn't want to make their voice heard, they're entirely welcome to abstain- if the result's that they end up with the Tories in power, and they're not terrifically fond of seeing Osborne's smug face on the news every other day, they should have thought harder about their choices when they had the chance to make their voice heard within the system- a system crafted *specifically to allow the people to* ***choose*** *who represents them*.

To claim that ""nobody voted for this Government"" or that this Government lacks a mandate without applying the same standard to every British government for the past century is somewhat unsound reasoning. 

Please, back up your arguments rather than making sweeping, woolly statements. You're not making a great deal of headway.

worldnews,"&gt;Okay, I should have referred to “your people” (your words) as assholes. Nobody likes assholes.

Very good. You admit your bigotry. 

&gt;Big fucking deal. In those third, second and first tier educational institutions, there are also departments of theology.

Now if you were paying attention to what you were typing you’d notice that you are in fact proving my point. 

&gt;This is not culture, but religion. Over the last 50 years, we have totally ditched the roman scatholic religion, and although it was claimed it was an integral part of our culture, our culture has since been flourishing like it never had before since we got rid of those mental chains. Surely the same thing should happen to an eventual jewish culture!

Na, it is a culture. Go speak to any cultural anthropologist and have them talk to you about Jewish Culture.

Who is **we**? You’re aware that Catholicism is a cornerstone of Latin American society, in Africa, Asia and (of course) Europe as well.  Or do you only mean profoundly douchey atheist individuals like yourself, who are only as ignorant and offensive as their religious fundamentalist counterparts. You think you’re their antithesis but you’re just out to cram **your** own bullshit down peoples throats.

&gt;It’s a place where kids are indoctrinated with a goddammed fucking retarded religion

I’m really sad the public school system failed you. Maybe if you went to a madrassa you would have the capacity to differentiate between religious and ethnic groups. 

&gt;The jewishness has nothing to do with it. It’s all in the assholiness. And yes, I know you don’t like me, mr jew, so you call me “antisemite”. Believe me, nobody takes that word seriously anymore.

**The atheism has nothing to do with (it really doesn’t). It’s all in the assholiness.**

That’s for you. 

But yea, I don’t believe you. That boat kind of sailed once you started throwing around the word kike. 

&gt;And yes, I know you don’t like me, mr jew, so you call me “antisemite”. Believe me, nobody takes that word seriously anymore.

Actually many, many people take that word seriously. Not just Jews. You on the other hand, are a coward so you can’t own up to your bigotry, even though you entirely fail in concealing it. 

&gt;Oh well. You can’t always win all the time, you know? So, if you eat bacon, aren’t you afraid of pissing-off rabbi Rosenblumenthalovitcheinstein and he’ll send you straight to what passes for hell to jews???

Oy! Hahahahaha. You bigots sure know how to tickle me. 

By the way, I think God would allow Albert Einstein into Heaven even if he wolfed down 3 pork-chops at the gate. 

&gt;After some pretty matches of arm-twisting, yes. Was it Liberia who was threatened with the US witholding investment in rubber plantation who cast the deciding vote? Or something like that.

Hmmm, no. I believe the motion went forward with 33 votes yes, 13 votes against and 10 abstentions. O, I think you might find it interesting that among the states who supported the resolution were Australia, Sweden, Holland, France, as well as the US and Britain of course…you know…those forward looking countries who threw off  the chains of cliché and abandoned religion (You said Catholicism but since you mixed up Islam and Judaism once already I’ll use a broader term). 

&gt;Well, you can count on the britshit not doing anything about that… Recall that, at the time, canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King famously said “one jew is too much” with regards to admitting refuge
PM King sounds like he’s just your type of man. A Jew-Hater. Don’t worry though, today we have Israel and PM Harper loves us. YAY!!!

&gt;Those people arriving in Palestine left Europe, yes. But they didn’t get expelled; the nazis were totally defeated, so there was nothing the jews could fear anymore.

How enlightening. So thousands of severely traumatized people, who were often times individuals with no family left, should have upped and taken back homes and property that were confiscated and given to others. Yea, rambling about war-devastated Europe scrounging up fragments of a destroyed life should have been the plan. Btw, Have you ever heard of the Kielce Pogrom, a massacre of Jews that happened right after WWII.
Have a look see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_pogrom
Nothing to fear, aye?
Also, you might be interested to know that this would have been so impossible that a joint American and British committee was commissioned to investigate this. Their conclusion was that the vast majority of displaced Jews, 100,000, should have been transferred to Palestine. They were experts. You’re a cunt. 

&gt;Big fucking deal, socialists/communists aren’t pure; they, too, have their share of disgusting stuff. Looking upon bullshit premises to displace the population of another country to ultimately take control of it, no matter who does it, left or right, is still wrong.

Silly Jews. You can’t be religious. You can’t be atheist. See this is why you’re a true Jew-Hater. For you there is no good Jews. Just the one that forgets his identity and hangs his head down. 

&gt;Why should I bother, indeed? There are far more interesting subjects to study indeed.

Because then people, me included, won’t laugh at you because you don’t know what you’re babbeling about. 

&gt;Which is an artificial state based on religion (if I don’t have a truncated penis, I cannot become a citizen of that state) that was stolen from other people.

Actually, Israel is a state based on a parliamentary democracy system as well as 11 Basic Laws, not one of which mentions religion or God whatsoever.

&gt;Not jews but assholes. &lt;cue for a cliché — you may read it bobbing your head side to site&gt;“You know, I have very good jewish friends”&lt;/end of cliché&gt;…

LOL. I doubt it. And if you do they certainly aren’t aware that you spend your time calling their people kikes on the internet. 

&gt;All a bunch of assholes who also based their stupid actions on their goddammed fucking religion. Just like the zionists do today to justify their exactions
&gt;Well, yes. Thanks to the goddammed fucking stupid religion that ruled those countries; heck, that bullshit even claimed that the jews killed their god!!! How’s that for stupidity!!!

Interesting. At first you allege that these people were “gracious” enough to host the Jews. Now you say that they followed a “goddamned stupid religion”, you call them assholes. That was pretty nice of those stupid. I sure hope you stretched before all these psychological contortions. 

&gt;Do not insult my intelligence.

&gt;I fully know about Alfred Dreyfuss, and I would have taken his side

If you added a comma (→ ,) between “side” and “with” your phrasing would have been clearer. 

&gt;No, no, no, it’s all over the place.

No, no, no, what will someday be a Palestinian state is to the East of Israel. There’s a bit of it just south-west too. 

&gt;Ooooow, now comes the condescending crap… Well, what do you know… Who told you you’re better? יהוה?

Him? I don’t need him to know that I’m better than you. 


&gt;I do not have a religion that tells me to be ashamed to be human, that my body should be concealed. You just showed that you have been brainwashed by that goddammed retarded fucking stupid religion that pretends to rule everything.

Neither do I. In fact Jewish Teachings promote that our people be many and fruitful, that we be as many as the stars in the night and the grains of sand upon the shore. That pretty much means a lot of fucking. Something tells me that you wouldn’t like that. Just keep masturbating there, champ.

Health,"&gt; No, I'm going to tell you that measuring the circumference of your head isn't going to tell you a person's IQ, and checking someone's height and weight isn't going to tell you someone's fat quotient. Both of those are equally stupid.

Are you sure you don't use logical fallacies? lol

&gt; No actually, having 3 doctors in my immediate family has taught me that BMI is often incorrect. I see you check out xrays, are you an actual MD or just a technician...?

Ah, argument of authority **AND** an attempt at an ad-hominem. We're doing great here. Let's rephrase this comment to make it actually true: ""BMI **can** be inaccurate (for people with unusually high muscle mass, and ONLY THEN), but otherwise it's pretty accurate"". So, as I said, you either make the case that you're totally ripped (which could be true to some degree, as I told you in I believe my second comment) or you can stop trying to vaguely claim that BMI ""is often inaccurate"". Its inaccuracies are perfectly well known and understood, and yet it's still used... think about THAT for a second. Oh and to answer your question: I'm actually an MD. And going further than that, I'm currently participating in a study of obesity in kids. We use BMI (amongst other measures), even though for kids it actually IS pretty inaccurate (figure that, in kids bones can actually be of different sizes). Now I have a couple of questions for you: a) how many of those 3 MDs in your immediate family are either specialised in endocrinology or have in any other weight directly worked with obese people? and b) how sensitive must you be about this subject to bring such a specific subject up with them at family dinners? I can see the conversations now ""hey guys let me ask you something... I have a BMI of 31, am I obese?"" ""Ohhhh no, no neoform3, BMI is often innacurate, don't worry about that!"". Did I get it right?

&gt; Right, you've deluded yourself into thinking that you have to be a steroid freak in order to have above average muscle mass....

Uhm, no? You may be confusing me with that other commenter. I actually conceded you probably have above average muscle mass (do you even read what I said, or can you just have these discussions all in your head?). But ""above average"", unless you **are** in fact a steroid freak, isn't enough to account for a 31 BMI, and that's what I've been trying to get across to you.

&gt; I have a muscular physique, I have pecks, I have visible triceps, I can do 50 pushups in a row, I am quite strong, and have no ""gut"".. yet you've deluded yourself into thinking that the BMI is never wrong, and that means I must be obese...

Ah, again with the ""physical prowess"" attempts at convincing me. Dude, here's some harsh facts for you: **I** (the skinniest fucker you've ever seen) can do 50 freaking continuous pushups. Right now (as opposed to 2 years ago) I can too run 10km without a problem (that's just a bit more than what I walk to work everyday). 35"" waist is pretty hefty, even if it doesn't reach the 40"" that predicts **severe** cardiovascular risk (it's actually 38"" here in Europe, but I guess american doctors are more forgiving in that regard). So congratulations, you're not **morbidly obese**. You are, however, at the very least overweight, and you're not as physically fit as you apparently believe you are. Not that the physical fitness part is in any way relevant to your fat content, but it would show you how you tend to delude yourself with some things.

&gt; You're like the doctor in the insane asylum that says to a sane man wrongfully put in to the nut house ""well, you wouldn't be here if you weren't crazy!!""

Ha, another caricature. This one was actually funny for me, since I'm a psychiatry resident. Of course it's absolutely and completely ridiculous, but given your understanding of medicine in general I can see how you may actually believe that.

&gt; I already provided two photos, you've provided zero evidence that BMI is an accurate means to indicate one's obesity.

Oh right, about your photos, I forgot to mention them earlier... They show you're by no means absolutely ripped, and while you don't have a belt-buckle-covering overreaching gut, you are pretty hefty, IMO. You confirmed that by giving your waist size, so it doesn't have to be subjective anymore. Sorry about the harsh truth. There are no muscles inside your abdomen to account for that. And about me ""providing evidence""... LOL. BMI is **already** the scientific standard for making fat estimation in populations. I don't need to provide evidence (doesn't mean I couldn't, it's just that responding to these already take ridiculous amounts of time), I'm not the one going against mainstream science here. From the very beginning I've stated EXACTLY where the inaccuracies in BMI can lie, and yet (even after I've corrected you twice) you remain hellbent on trying to put words in my mouth about it. Stop that shit, stop making me waste time. And about the evidence, the burden of proof is on YOU, buddy. And blog posts don't exactly constitute ""evidence"".

&gt; Name a single logical fallacy I've stated. Go on.

You mean besides the ones I've already mentioned here? There's the strawman I mentioned in that last paragraph about you needing to paint the picture that I proclaim the BMI infallible for you to try and knock that down, for one. There are plenty more (even aside from the ones I mentioned in this very comment), but I don't feel like going back and looking for them. You do use them, and that is that.

&gt; BTW, You've seriously got issues dude.

Is this another attempt at an ad-hominem, or are you genuinely concerned? Please do tell where my issues lie. AFAIK, all I've been doing here is debate your ridiculous statement that ""BMI is bullshit because it sez I'm fat"".

worldnews,"Just look at how quickly it went in Eastern Europe. In early 1989, East Germany still seemed stable. In the summer, Hungary opened its borders to Austria, and many vacationers took the opportunity to escape. Thousands camped in the West German embassy in Prague, and eventually got a permit to leave. In September, weekly protests began in Leipzig. There was talk about the possibility of a Chinese-style crack-down, but on November 9^th the Wall fell -- something that would have been unthinkable just a year earlier.

So, collapse took about half a year, the hot phase with a sizable opposition movement lasted only about two months. Reunification came less than a year later.

It could be that there will still be a North Korea as we know it a decade from now, but it's also possible that it will be over very, very quickly. Transition of power is always tricky, and the army is hungry.  
South Korea definitely is right about preparing for Day X, because if Germany is anything to go by, there will be a large influx of North Koreans as soon as it becomes possible -- and East Germans had plenty of food, they were *much* better off than North Koreans.  

It will also be expensive. Reunification costs in Germany have been abut €1.5 trillion so far, with ongoing costs of about €100 billion per year. The West-East German population ratio is about 4:1, In Korea it's 2:1. The GDP ratio of the two Germanys was about 6:1, in Korea it's 20:1.

EDIT:

but frankly, the link is fairly disgusting once it goes over the obviously false ethnic stereotyping: there's nothing hidden about the fact Greece would have been just let to go bankrupt were there no systemic risks for the European banking system; that's the point of the 'no bailout' clause after all. This changes nothing in the fact that Greece does owe that money to those private sector banks, and has no particular excuse for defaulting on it, except perhaps that there's no scenario anymore where it could pay for all of it (In which case it should pay for as much as possible still)

The point ECB is (perhaps; the source is OpenEurope after all, and it can always draw more from other banks of ESCB) stretching its financial capabilities if Greece would default is particularly disgusting, since ECB is in that situation in the first place because it has been buying Greek debt while nobody wanted it to precisely make its bonds cheaper!

politics,"I left the US in 2002 and never looked back. In the last 9 years I've visited twice. Over the years I slowly began to realize the benefits of living in a European capital (I'm in Prague, Czech Republic) as opposed to the US. My healthcare costs around 300 dollars a year for full coverage. A year long pass for all Public Transportation cost about the same. I haven't owned a car (or had a desire for one since I got here). My wife has got three years of paid Maternity Leave after having our child which allows her to stay home with our girl, and then at 3 there are pre schools (free) which can take your child during the day. The state schools here are free (paying 600$ a year in fees doesn't count) from pre school to a PHD. I won't get into the whole GM debate but I can say that I've heard Americans saying hundreds of times ""Oh, this is what a strawberry tastes like, is it organic?"". I can take a train to any other European capital as the Schengen agreement has allowed borderless travel throughout all EU countries. After years of paperwork I finally got Permanent Residence here, and while I can't vote in elections, the state benefits awarded to me are equal to other citizens. 

Now, I'm not saying there's not problems. Of course there is. The pizza tastes like shit, the pop culture is horrendous, I had to learn an extremely complicated foreign language, and there's the occasional Brit who will be stereotypically anti-american (in my experience). But even the most cynical American can find themselves defending the US after emigrating to a foreign country. The US does kick ass in a lot of ways in terms of innovation in the arts, music, science (yes MIT is a good school) and entertainment. But what leaves a lot of Europeans scratching their heads is simply why if you pay taxes do you receive basically nothing back. It isn't socialism to want a healthcare system that works, it isn't fascism to want students and teachers held to higher standards, and it isn't inconceivable that you should get at least 30 days vacation every year. This is simply how much of the world works. While the EU has now surpassed the US as the largest economy in the world (even though the EU isn't a country...yet), we still think that since the US is number 2, you might as well get something back from your government for being the most powerful country on the planet.

I've just completed a wander through parts of Europe using both. If I could have found a way that was practical to do the whole thing by train I would have.

Trains usually take a little longer - but not always - are much more comfortable and are much less stress when it comes to station locations versus airports, security checking, time spent in terminals, etc.

My trip was:
Stansted to London on Stansted Express (1hr).

London (St Pancras) to Paris (Gare du Nord) on Eurostar (2:20)

Paris to Zermatt in one day using:

(Gare de Lyon) to Lausanne on TGV (4hrs)

Lausanne to Visp on local (1hr)

Visp to Zermatt on local (40 minutes) 

Zermatt to Chur on Glacier Express (7hrs)

Chur to Tirano on Bernina Express (4hrs)

Tirano to Milan same day (2hrs)

Milan to Venice (2hrs)

Venice to Zagreb (7hrs)

Mostar to Sarajevo (4hrs)

While in Europe I flew from Zagreb to Dubrovnik, Sarajevo to St Petersburg via Budapest and Moscow to London. 

The Rail and Air experiences are not the same; the travel experience itself can be enjoyable watching the landscape slide past your windows for a few hours rather than looking down from 30,000 feet. When assessing the time don't forget to add the time and cost of getting to out-of-town airports and getting through security. For example, compare the locations of St Pancras and Heathrow, or Gare du Nord and Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Just an opinion.

unitedkingdom,"There's a big difference between skilled and unskilled work though. I'm an Australian academic, and there are few people in the UK who do what I do. But it's increasingly difficult for me to get a visa because of the fact that these wild generalisations are thrown about which causes the government to go all Madagascar on immigration. What does that mean for me? I'm struggling each time I have to renew my Tier 2 visa (which I pay a princely sum of £550 just to attempt to apply for, and no refunds if they ""run out"" of the quota) when I'm going to be doing a job that very few people can do. What's worse is that the point system is getting harder and harder to beat, so that unless you're coming with packets of money or, hilariously, an MBA (which is shockingly worth more points than a PhD), and add to that the quota system - you have a very difficult time getting in. So it's not the non-EU migrants that you need to worry about, and in fact the government is shooting itself in the foot because it's keeping out lots of highly skilled people that would actually stimulate the economy and could improve employment rates. 

This article is very confused because it switches back and forth between youth unemployment (largely unskilled labour) and skilled labour. The welfare system for Brits here makes it so that it's actually better to be on benefits in many situations than it is to work an unskilled labour job. So who works those jobs? Those who have to to stay in the country (because they don't qualify for benefits). i.e. migrants. 

The government needs to get the welfare system straight, rethink the EU free movement to work stuff and make it a real level playing field (by bringing back the hoops like for non-EU migrants), and stop paying lip-service to uninformed citizens (who stir up the hue and cry about job-taking) by actually cutting out the high skilled people they need to have in the country. But yeah, I don't really see the point of the EU either. 

Just frustrates me when I see people yelling ""omg they're taking our jobs"" and then the government acts on that, but because of EU stupid laws the only group they can act on is the one group that actually probably helps the economy, i.e. the high skilled migrants, i.e. me :P 

ETA: this doesn't mean that all EU migrants suck though, I didn't mean to imply that. There are definitely some very skilled and excellent EU workers.

If you want to talk about Islam, you have to admit that the Bible and torah are the same in terms of violence. You should check up to see what the Torah says about treating gentiles. You will be surprised to learn that it also is not compatible with ""western secular morality"".

Muslims, they are normal people like you and me. Some are great people to be around, others are not. You can't generalize, not even with Egyptians. ""Sharia"" doesn't always equate to stoning women and honor killings. Most Muslim countries practice sharia law and forbid those two  practices.

To say ""there is no such thing as moderate Islam"" the way you and Geert do is to cast a blanket shadow of suspicion on all Muslims. How does that work out?

Hmm..

So, let's see.. Western companies _start_ out looking for slave labour, then get disappointed by getting what they paid for and proceed to look for..  slave labour + 15% or something? :P

Of course, they'll still want to pay the minimum possible amount that still produces decent results.


&gt; Work cheap once or twice then, if you're good enough / suitable / personable enough, they'll let you name a better price for better work.

They? The same customers, or someone else who sees your glorious ""CV"" there?

worldnews,"A few weeks back there was a Anti Chavez thread that led to me into looking into a few basics on how Venezuela has done under his leadership. Here's what I found.

Look at the chart on Venezuelan economic indicators
[GDP per capita, Inflation, Unemployment, oil production](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Venezuela_Economic_Indicators.png)  and [here.](http://www.latin-focus.com/latinfocus/countries/venezuela/veneisum.htm)

Sources being the world bank,CIA fact book,and the International Energy Agency and Latin focus.

For GDP per captia they are doing well, inflation is falling, unemployment falling all the while oil production falling, altho' it is on the way up. (2005 figures only so I dont know how it looks now ) the 2008 figures are good on current account holdings, GDP spiked in 2007 but fell in 2008.


[More info from The Center for Economic and Policy Research](http://www.cepr.net/index.php/about-us/)  

They have this to say. [""In conclusion, there is no ambiguity as to the decline in poverty in Venezuela over the last seven years""](http://www.rethinkvenezuela.com/downloads/ceprpov.htm)

So I conclude that the poor have done better under Chavez than the previous admins. Maybe Chavez is going to turn into a awful communist dictator, I don't know, but he seems to be doing well for most of the people.
  
Here's the [UN Human development index report of 2009.](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/) look where Venezuela ranks compared to other Latin American countries and the trend line. Never in any direction but improving all that time....

Take a look at the pre-Chavez Statistics, Venezuela was one of the most appalling oligarchy existent. Would anyone really want to return to that?  


Reddit [user digit0 gives a pocket history of Venezuela here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gxjx5/venezuelan_president_hugo_chavez_raises_minimum/c1r2rby)

Chavaz hasn't ruined a Venezuela. It was a well raped state before Chavez.

Condensed history of Venezuelan Politics.

Venezuela has been raped and pillaged of its resources ever since the Spanish colonized it. This practice continued even after Bolivar and the battle of independence, along with local corruption left an incredibly resource rich country crippled and poor.

Things really did not improve much after the discovery of oil, yes there was more money but again was kept within the current ruling oligarchy (Juan Vicente Gomez).

It was not until mid 1940 that an National education campaign was started, yet most of the country remained illiterate for long after.

An influx of European immigrants was then allowed, with the hopes of increasing both education and population. This did not work as most of those immigrants soon parted after creating their fortunes.

No real infrastructure was ever really fully developed after Perez Jimenez (ended 1957), establishing of a full democracy (1958) simply created a progressively bloated government where corruption was rife. This can be attested by the hundreds of abandoned projects that litter the country as the money needed to finished them was stolen before their completion.

National manufacturing has either been non existent or considered of poor quality, making the whole country reliant on all sorts of imports.

Venezuela's true downfall began with the arrival of Carlos Andres Perez , beginning with a huge bureaucratic expansion he then started over spending like never seen before. Quite a few people see this as the golden times, yet the reality is that he institutionalized a system which glorified theft and corruption (The reason I became an ex pat).

After he nationalized oil and iron production and acquiring huge foreign loans (most which mysteriously disappeared), Venezuela entered a spending frenzy in a downward spiral which continued through all presidents and lead us the current Hugo Chaves.

There is an incredibly accurate parody by the band Desorden Publico that describes the collective thought in a nutshell.

They can do this because they are somewhat self sufficient - a massive fishing industry and almost unlimited geo-thermal power means they can and will survive this crises  (Europe is building a massive power grid from Iceland's systems that will pump water UPHILL in Norway with Iceland power, that in turn will be released as required).

Greece on the other hand is a sovereign state within a common currency zone.  They have no other choices here, except to default, lose ALL their savings and restart with an individual currency.

What happened there was that they tried to solve it by printing more money and creating artificial inflation (with the motivation, lower exchange-rate, higher export). They went in Hyper-inflation and the country went bankrupt. One Dollar was worth 1.340.000.000 Deutsch Mark. They launched a new currency with a set rate for the old currency. A lot of people lost their savings and lost wealth, leading up to the Hitler's rise of power...

This scenario in Greece is impossible. Why? Because Greece has the Euro. They can not print money to try and solve it. The only thing they can do is hope for EU support, which sucks, since it comes at a price. If countries stop paying Greece, then the country will most likely be kicked out of the EMU or get's out itself, to solve the problem with the old equation(: Lower exchangerate-higher export - postive cashflow). Nothing of such sort has been done ever, so economists can not say with certainty what would happen.  
What also could be a stimulant is when the government announces a new currency is that investors will buy foreign currency to keep the value of their savings/income. You'll get a mini-financial crisis-all over again....

Absolutely - but what are the chances they'll ever move back left? I don't know if you'd agree, but I reckon the SNP victory in May wasn't just down to the collapse of the LibDem and Labour vote, but also due to the fact that the SNP styled themselves as a variant of a European social democratic party. The Scottish electorate (and I'd wager most of England north of Birmingham) is well to the left of Labour on most issues, and instead of reflecting this, Labour have tried pulling to the right to capture some nonsense middle ground and thinking they could take their core vote with them. Ed Milliband not backing the strikes yesterday and insetad calling for restraint (!?) would be an example of this.

worldnews,"I dunno about 30-40 years, putting such numbers is basically just guesswork.

But look at it another way:

You say 1 out of every 4 dollars is produced in the US. That means 3 out of 4 dollars aren't. Changes in that ""rest of the world"" thing are weighted 3x for every 1 of ours. That's a lot of money that could go to industrialization, commerce, research and development, etc.

In reality, that ""rest of the world"" is really just the EU plus a small number of other countries - Japan, China, India, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few more.

As he mentioned, last year 92 countries had growth rates above 4%. China and India were at 10%+, Brazil at 7.5%, South Korea at 6.1%. Even first world countries like Germany, Japan and Canada had higher growth rates than the US, which was number 117. And yet the US produced a 2.8% growth rate, which is pretty darn respectable for a mature economy.

So it's not like we're doing very poorly, it's just that many countries are doing a hell of a lot better. This is understandable, since they have a lot of room to grow; many started off with 3rd world status and many are still there.

But the net result is that the US share of all those things you mentioned, such as the 1 out of ever 4 dollars we produce, or the amount of military that cash can buy, all go down *as a fraction of the total world output*. And this can happen pretty damn fast.

More worrying to me than dollar amounts and number of military bases are things that I think are better predictors of future performance, such as:

1. Number of research papers we produce per year. This is **far** from keeping pace with the growth in the rest of the world.

2. The performance of American kids in math and science and basic reading comprehension skills, in which we placed 29th out of 31 of the top industrialized countries in the world.

3. Deteriorating infrastructure - roads and bridges which are not being built at a pace in keeping with population growth, which are not being kept in repair. Telecommunications in which we lag far behind many European and Asian countries.

Stuff like that has serious consequences if you're making predictions about the future, because it's your growth pipeline, it's what will fuel tomorrow's growth.

Again, nobody is saying the US has lost already, just that the current trend is a decline rather than maintaining the status quo or advancing. Yes, we ""control space"" as you said, but people looking at NASA today which just retired the shuttle, visited the moon 40 years ago and never went back since, continues to cut back for lack of funds, can't help but think that this is exactly what ""decline"" looks like. We had the whole market in space launches once along with the USSR. Today, commercial satellite launches are more likely to be through ESA or the Japanese, or the Indians.

I don't think this trend will go away, because really our massive dominance over the rest of the world was something of a fluke of history that gave us a huge lead over everyone else. Europe was the only competition, and it was crushed after WW2. Asia was coming out of the feudal/dark ages.

The top 200 in your realm (US, Europe, Korea etc) are in Grandmaster, the top 2% are in master, then it sorts you based on skill all the way down.

When you begin playing online, it has 5 placement games, if you are terrible, you might lose all 5, and it might not be pretty. Once you have played them, it ""guesses"" how good you are and sorts you into which league it thinks you deserve, after that, it should only take about 10 games before you are in some SERIOUSLY well matched battles.

On a serious note, if you aren't going to play online, I wouldn't recommend buying it. For only the campaign, its kind of expensive, but for online, its some of the best value for money you could ask for.

&gt;From your other posts, it appears that you aren't a big fan of the EU.

It was something I was actually really hoping would work out, but it has been pretty much a joke so far.  I thought it was a great idea that would be very, very difficult to pull off successfully.

&gt;...including not discriminating against people from different countries.

Those rules are based on nationality.  Iceland didn't use the nationality of foreign citizens, per se, to make their decision.  They used the locality of the branches.  It's an important distinction.  Weaselly?  Sure.  It's still an important distinction.

&gt;Yes that is what I really want!

Well, that makes you just as bad if not worse than the bankers, doesn't it?

&gt;It doesn't seem reasonable to you that the country that let it's banks grow so big, reaped the tax benefits when the going was good, actively sought out UK investors, and assured them their money was guaranteed, should be the one to pay? 

The people themselves who really had nothing to do with it?  No, I don't.  Just like the American taxpayers shouldn't be footing the bill for the bullshit that our banks and governments did to us.  In both cases the people were soundly fleeced and shouldn't be held to task for it.

&gt;Who should pay for it?

No one.  I understand being beyond pissed off with individual losses, but it's really not the first time this has happened.  This should, beyond all else, show you how fragile and unhealthy the E.U. is.  You should never place your assets in the bank of a foreign government and expect to be treated as one of its citizens when things go south.  It boggles the mind that people would think that this is even remotely reasonable.

&gt;Does it suck to be an Icelandic taxpayer?

Honestly, I think it's both a great and terrible thing to be a taxpayer anywhere.  It's good to contribute to the well being of your fellow man, but it's terrible that none of us can control what the governments of our countries do.  We shouldn't be held accountable for their shenanigans.  Not in Iceland, the U.K., Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, or the U.S.

worldnews,"&gt;I'd heard that a poll showed a majority of the french believed it was a set up, back at the beginning at least.

Many French people did. [Here's a more current article on French opinion.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/world/europe/02france.html)

But to be fair, if a popular politician about to run for office from *any* country were to be charged like this, whether the case had merit or not (which no one could know for sure right away) I suspect the majority of that politician's supporters might also think (or assume) it was a setup.

Basically every possible scenario left is shitty:

1. He's guilty, but the accuser's behavior will make the case impossible to prosecute.

2. He's not guilty--the accuser was looking for a payout--but his reputation has been irreparable damaged.

3. There was a setup intended to keep him from running for office, and it succeeded.

It seems doubtful (according to the NYT article I liked above) that even if he's innocent that he'll recover from this. 

&gt;*Not all French people interviewed on Friday were prepared to accept that the Mr. Strauss-Kahn could easily his regain his stature in politics.*

&gt;*“People are not going to forgive him. At a political level, he is dead,” said Agnès Bergé, 44, who works for a law firm in Neuilly. “It would be terrible for France if he came and if we give him some credit again.” But Sophie Leseur, 50, an artist, said the saga could turn Mr. Strauss-Kahn into a “martyr.”*
&gt;
&gt;*“His reputation is tarnished forever,” said Marie Chuinard, 25, a legal adviser. “I think he can come back to French political life, but internationally he is burned.”*

gaming,"Everything else has been covered, Day9's dailies, Teamliquid.net (for various strategies etc) and all that other good stuff so all I'll say is if you end up in bronze/silver when starting out it wouldn't be a bad idea to learn how to defend against early rushes/all ins. They're pretty common in those leagues and while you won't come up against them every single match it's still a good idea to know how to deal with them if you scout them in time.

A common example of a rush is something like a cannon rush which is used by Protoss. Basically they go to your base and build some cannons either at the entrance or even just inside your base. Terran have a similar strategy but they use bunkers and marines (your basic infantry unit). The main idea of this is to contain your opponent and either starve them over a small period of time to the point where they have no resources and can't build or keep them occupied long enough for you to mass a decent sized army to just go in and wipe them out.

Anyway you'll get a lot more detail from the Day9 vids and teamliquid.net so make good use of them. One more thing, watching the Koreans play is a great idea (watch how they deal with the early aggression) and is often very entertaining but Koreans generally favour an extremely aggressive style of play whereas in US and EU brackets most matches are a bit more passive and have a bit more focus on macromanagement (building your economy/new structures/researching upgrades for units). As a result Korean matches are generally shorter.

AskReddit,"&gt;I wasn't saying those countries aren't free. But they are countries that use the state as a tool to heavily provide services and infrastructure. They all have strong social safety nets, laws that serve to help balance power between employer and employee, and vast government funded education systems

Because they are successful due to the prosperity freedom creates the government is *able* to create all its fancy programs and regulations. You try doing that in a poor country and it doesn't work. Prosperity comes first, then the leeching comes second.

&gt; I thought libertarians loved austerity measures and the shrinking welfare state?

The news pretends the government is cutting down. Obviously anybody paying attention can see that they're not and it's just a big show. Countries in Europe including the UK are getting ever larger regulatory burdens, we are losing freedoms not gaining them, debt is souring and politicians are becoming more and more removed from the people they claim to represent (EU for example).

Sometimes they are referred to as ""South Asian"" (as opposed to ""East Asian""). Some Indians have self-adopted the term [desi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi). 

""Oriental"" is problematic for many reasons. First, the root of the word, *[orient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient)*, refers to a place east relative to Europe.

worldnews,"The economy of the United States is the world's largest national economy. Its nominal GDP was estimated to be nearly $14.7 trillion in 2010,[1] approximately a quarter of nominal global GDP.[14][15] Its GDP at purchasing power parity was also the largest in the world, approximately a fifth of global GDP at purchasing power parity.[14] The U.S. economy also maintains a very high level of output per capita. In 2009, it was estimated to have a per capita GDP (PPP) of $46,381, the 6th highest in the world. The U.S is the largest trading nation in the world. Its three largest trading partners as of 2010 are Canada, China and Mexico.

Historically, the U.S. economy has maintained a stable overall GDP growth rate, a low unemployment rate, and high levels of research and capital investment funded by both national and, because of decreasing saving rates, increasingly by foreign investors. It has been the world's largest national economy since the 1870s[16][17] and remains the world's largest manufacturer, representing 19% of the world's manufacturing output. In 2009, consumer spending, coupled with government health care spending constituted 70% of the American economy.[18] About 30% of the entire world's millionaire population reside in the United States (in 2009).[19] Furthermore, 34% of the world's billionaires are American (in 2011).[20][21] The US is also home to the world's largest stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange. It also boasts the world's largest gold reserves and the world's largest gold depository, the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The United States is also home to 139 of the world's 500 largest companies, which is almost twice that of any other country.[22] A large contributor to the country's success has also been a very strong and stable currency. The US dollar holds about 60% of world reserves, as compared to its top competitor, the euro, which controls about 24%.

Since the 1960s, the United States economy absorbed savings from the rest of the world. The phenomenon is subject to discussion among economists. The US is by far the most heavily invested-into country in the world, with foreign investments made in the US measuring almost $2.4 trillion, which is more than twice that of any other country.[23] The US is also by far the largest investor in the world, with US investments in foreign countries totaling over $3.3 trillion, which is almost twice that of any other country.[24] Like other developed countries, the United States faces retiring baby boomers who have already begun withdrawing money from Social Security; however, the American population is young and growing when compared to Europe or Japan. The United States public debt is in excess of $13 trillion and continues to grow at a rate of about $5.48 billion each day by direct calculation between January 31, 2010 and August 31, 2010.[25][26] Total public and private debt was $50.2 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2010, or 3.5 times GDP.[27] Domestic financial assets totaled $131 trillion and domestic financial liabilities totaled $106 trillion.[28] Due in part to the amount of both public and private investment, the economy of the United States is regarded as a type of mixed economy.

The American labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and in 2009 ranked 16th in terms of net migration rate. The United States is ranked fourth, down from first in 2008-2009 due to the economic crisis, in the Global Competitiveness Report.[29] The country is one of the world's largest and most influential financial markets, home to major stock and commodities exchanges like NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX, CME, and PHLX.

gaming,"I do love Paradox games and have almost everything, however I would stay away from Pride of Nations currently.  It was released not even a month ago, and Paradox titles tend to be buggy upon release.

The reason I suggest HOI2 over 3 is because HOI2 is simply their masterpiece.  In addition, HOI3 has a few expansions that really should have been updates.  You pretty much have to buy everything for HOI3 to get the full play value from it.

There are a few difference between HOI &amp; the Europa Universalis series.  HOI takes place from 1936-1950+ depending on if you have expansions or what.  You have to control everything, from the economy to your production, and research.  No, this isn't like most games where you research one thing at a time.  Pick Germany and you can have like 10 concurrent things you are researching.  There is a huge amount of strategy in the research, what units/building you produce, and your fighting strategy.  Europa Universalis takes place from I think about 1300AD and with the latest expansions can go until about 1900AD I believe.  The cool thing about EU is that there are historical events intertwined within each country that affect events.  EU is much more comparable with Medieval: Total War however it goes much more in depth with the diplomacy &amp; economy.  
Either way, both games are very in depth, and may take a while to learn.  EU is a bit more laid back I think then HOI.  In HOI you have to nitpick your every maneuver and be on top of all your research &amp; economy constantly.

reddit.com,"Suicide is not illegal. Google search it if you have to. Or just read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation). 

In regards to the gateway drug theory, I can't definitively prove this one either way. There have been numerous studies which show both cannabis as a gateway drug and the gateway drug theory as false (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory#Studies_not_in_favor_of_the_gateway_theory). The best way I can disprove this one is from my personal experience and observations. 

For years I've been involved in the drug culture and that all began in 7th grade after the first time I got drunk. The experience of an altered mind-state opened my eyes to a whole new dimension of reality. If our perceptions change so readily how concrete are my beliefs if I can truly only base them on what I have experienced? But, I digress. It was the allure of this altered state of mind which lead me to pursue other drugs. It wasn't some spiraling downfall which eventually lead to rehab however. I went from alcohol, to weed many years later, and eventually psychedelics and pharmaceuticals a few years after that. My choices to do a drug were widely dependent on what I knew about that drugs effects. I didn't smoke weed and suddenly realize that other drugs must be awesome and that I should do harder and harder one's. I'd never try cocaine or heroin; I've seen both on numerous occasions and it is as easy now as it would have been in elementary school to just say no. The idea behind the gateway theory is that using drugs opens up a door where all other drugs are hiding. If I could summarize the effect from my experience, it is more ""I am a person who enjoys drugs, weed has opened my mind up to using them"". It is something I have complete control over. I research and test all new drugs at low doses and have set boundaries for myself which I do not intend to cross. If this theory is true then the effect should follow from any drug use. Just because I use tylenol doesn't  mean I'll use morphine recreationally. How many kids receive drugs daily from prescriptions or during trips to the hospital/doctor's office? If this theory truly had any merit then these kids would all be running around trying every drug they can, and this is frankly not the case. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't make it any more or less of a drug, and the effect of the gateway theory isn't compounded just because weed is illegal. If anything, legalization would eliminate the allure that illegal drugs have (the risk of getting caught and thrill of doing something illegal) and we would see a decrease in drug use. Studies to back this up are limited but if you look at European countries such as the Netherlands where marijuana has been decriminalized there is drastically fewer young drug users than in America.

worldnews,"&gt; Very good. You admit your bigotry.

Absolutely not. Assholes are not a protected class in no self-respecting human society. 

&gt; Now if you were paying attention to what you were typing you’d notice that you are in fact proving my point.

No, it’s just that bullshit is so entrenched in general human culture, it crops-up in the unlikeliest places.

&gt; Na, it is a culture. Go speak to any cultural anthropologist and have them talk to you about Jewish Culture.

It’s all based around the religion; remove the religion and what’s left? Culture is very much shaped around geography. Jews have lived all over the place. Other than some common cores, there has to be a lot of differing stuff; russian jews who had to deal with a harsher winter than North Africa’s certainly have a different culture than morrocan jews. And guess what? They’re sufficiently different to have a big hatred between the two…

&gt;Who is we? You’re aware that Catholicism is a cornerstone of Latin American society, in Africa, Asia and (of course) Europe as well. 

Not at all. France dumped it’s scatholicism (please; it’s an utter piece of shit) 200 years ago. We did 50 years ago, and without those chains, the french culture has soared since.

&gt; Or do you only mean profoundly douchey atheist individuals like yourself, who are only as ignorant and offensive as their religious fundamentalist counterparts. You think you’re their antithesis but you’re just out to cram your own bullshit down peoples throats.

Aaaaahhhhh! Now he claims that atheism is bullshit; therefore you’re religious. A religious guy who doesn’t follow his religion (can’t blame you; bacon is so good — and you have to like it since you’re on Reddit), a guy who picks and choose what he does… Rabbi Rosenblumenthalovitcheinstein must be really jittery when he sees you on the street; he probably even changes sidewalk and peers more intently in his portable edition of the torah!!!

&gt; I’m really sad the public school system failed you. Maybe if you went to a madrassa you would have the capacity to differentiate between religious and ethnic groups.

My dear friend, I went to the same school that Charles André-Marie DeGaulle went to. You know, the guy who said that jews were “an elite people, sure of themselves and dominating”…

&gt; The atheism has nothing to do with (it really doesn’t). It’s all in the assholiness. That’s for you.

Why should I be all honey to people who act douchily?

&gt; But yea, I don’t believe you. That boat kind of sailed once you started throwing around the word kike.

So why do you bother with me, then? You think you gonna convert me and make me stop worrying and love the jews, mr Strangelove???

&gt; Actually many, many people take that word seriously. Not just Jews. 

Yes, those who drank your kool-aid…

&gt; You on the other hand, are a coward so you can’t own up to your bigotry, even though you entirely fail in concealing it.

Yeah, whatever.

&gt; Oy! Hahahahaha. You bigots sure know how to tickle me.

Koochie, koochie, koochie. Here’s some more.

&gt; By the way, I think God would allow Albert Einstein into Heaven even if he wolfed down 3 pork-chops at the gate.

Well, I’m sure that John-Paul II is right there, even though he had far more than 3 pork chops throughout his life…

&gt; Hmmm, no. I believe the motion went forward with 33 votes yes, 13 votes against and 10 abstentions. O, I think you might find it interesting that among the states who supported the resolution were Australia, Sweden, Holland, France, as well as the US and Britain of course…you know…those forward looking countries who threw off the chains of cliché and abandoned religion (You said Catholicism but since you mixed up Islam and Judaism once already I’ll use a broader term).

Well, they surely didn’t want to be stuck with all those jewish refugees from Germany…

&gt; A Jew-Hater. Don’t worry though, today we have Israel and PM Harper loves us. YAY!!!

It’s normal: he’s a shitstain fundamentalist who thinks that you guys will trigger armageddon and that will rapture him into heaven. Or something nonsensical like that.

And there is the fact that jews have a lot of money, and money matters a lot in elections, so he’s not beyond licking some jewish arse. In any case, he’s poised to bring chaos to the country, a bit like your Nethanyau (sp?) does, which is the modus operandi of right wingnuts.

&gt; How enlightening. So thousands of severely traumatized people, who were often times individuals with no family left, should have upped and taken back homes and property that were confiscated and given to others. 

So, that gave the “severely traumatized” jews a blank cheque to severely traumatize palestinians?

&gt; Yea, rambling about war-devastated Europe scrounging up fragments of a destroyed life should have been the plan. Btw, Have you ever heard of the Kielce Pogrom, a massacre of Jews that happened right after WWII. Have a look see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_pogrom Nothing to fear, aye? Also, you might be interested to know that this would have been so impossible that a joint American and British committee was commissioned to investigate this. Their conclusion was that the vast majority of displaced Jews, 100,000, should have been transferred to Palestine. They were experts. You’re a cunt.

Experts? They just followed the typical antisemite (that was back then when that word had it’s true meaning) policies of their respective governments. It takes a real expert to follow the rules…

&gt; Silly Jews. You can’t be religious. You can’t be atheist. See this is why you’re a true Jew-Hater. For you there is no good Jews. Just the one that forgets his identity and hangs his head down.

Religion is bad; that’s what brought about the shoah. Their religion told the jews to be assholes, and their religion told  everyone else to hate jews. Without religion, none of this would have happenned.

&gt; Because then people, me included, won’t laugh at you because you don’t know what you’re babbeling about.

Who cares what a zionist laughs at?

&gt; Actually, Israel is a state based on a parliamentary democracy system as well as 11 Basic Laws, not one of which mentions religion or God whatsoever.

Unwritten laws are the most powerful.

&gt; No, no, no, what will someday be a Palestinian state is to the East of Israel. There’s a bit of it just south-west too.

Yeah, when they learn to bow and kiss their zionist masters’ arse???

&gt; Neither do I. In fact Jewish Teachings promote that our people be many and fruitful, that we be as many as the stars in the night and the grains of sand upon the shore. That pretty much means a lot of fucking. Something tells me that you wouldn’t like that. Just keep masturbating there, champ.

With regards to the 'laws of Europe' I still think you're generalizing and lumping a lot of different countries together.

The last statue is the only one I would regard as important in this discussion as it basically covers 'hate speech' based on different categories (race, creed and sexuality I think). Apparently it's applied in a really weird way so you can state whatever opinions you like ('I think all X are vampires who eat their children'), but if you remove the 'I think' it can become illegal. This statute has been discussed though and people have talked about how/whether it is too great an infringement on free speech (I don't know if the discussions led anywhere, but my point is that limiting free speech was not done lightly, and certainly not cherished.).

The writing systems are all shared across these languages that differ *so much that scholars divide them by language family*-- Old Mon script[Burmese,Mon], Old Khmer[Khmer, Thai], and Latin[Viet]. It cannot be made more clear that writing systems are arbitrary layers on top of natural language.

Specifically East Asia, Kinbensha pretty much hit it spot on. A lot of people think CJK are related due to their supposed ""asianness"" (that is social conditioning. I challenge a lot of people to listen to Korean with your eyes closed and try to imagine a not-Korean speaking it. It's not hard) and the whole Sinosphere with writing Hanzi-Kanji-Hanja, but even a quarter's worth of study will prove otherwise--for a very basic example, C is SVO, J and K are SOV but differ enormously in phonology.

Israel,"First let me give you a perspective on who I am so you can judge my words better. I am an American Israelite, I am married to an Egyptian Muslim. I once converted to Islam because I believed that Islam was an extension of Judaism, part of the original religion but with corrections. Due to an increase in skeptical, critical, and logical thinking I now have no religion and do not believe in god, although I still study Judaism because it is a central point to Israelite culture.

Here's my take on the Israel situation.

Before year 0: ISraelites are primitive and culture is developing, wars and invasions cause all sorts of upheavals, the temple is a central point to Israelite culture and due to destruction it causes new waves of Israelite culture and ideology. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 0-77: Increase in Israelite need for autonomy from roman rule ultimately leads to Israelite destruction. The aristocrat city Israelites are expeled from Israel. The farmers stay to work in the fields. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 77-600: Christianized domination causes the Israelites still living in the land to christianize, some keep the old traditions, some turn christian. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 700-1900: Arabized Islamization of the land. The arab invaders over the centuries instill an arabized Islamic ideology, similar to what we see across the entire middle east today. It is basically that if you are arabized and islamized you are a first class citizen and if you are not arabized and islamized you are second class. Compare to Egypt for example, many call themselves Arabs, yet thy are actually not arabs, they are Egyptian, this is due exclusively to the Arab/Islamic conquests.

1900'ish: Zionism begins, all the descendants of the Israelites kicked out over the last 2000 years want to have a home because they have been slaughtered in Europe and elsewhere for centuries, raped, oppressed, religiously persecuted, etc

1939-1945: 6 million Israelites murdered, finally breaks the remaining scattered Israelites into a big push for a homeland to protect themselves. The christianized, arabized Israelites still living in Israel don't care about 6 million murders, they are completely indoctrinated to oppress anyone not an arabized Islamized ideology. Autonomous ISraelites that are Jewish or not identified with arabs are a no no culturally (compare with the atrocities accepted from within arabized Islamized communities like the [Hama Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_massacre) where syrians slaughtered more palestinians in a few days than Israel has killed in 63 years, 20,000-40,000)

Modern day: It still comes down to arabized Islamized ideology set in place centuries ago. Israel cannot exist because we aren't arabized nor Islamized. The land of Israel was not Arabized until Islamic conquerers invaded, they established this ideology in the land and it continues to persist today.",3,t3_idp2x,t5_2qhvo,3,t1_c230udf,t3_idp2x,,True,False,1427304350,False,0,,c230udf,[deleted],0,,0,1309531247

Now, the manufacture and marketing of, say, toilet paper is something completely different... and perhaps it first happened in China... I really can't be bothered to look up such a detail.  But the ""invention"" of it is really not accurate.  I did look at umbrella in Wikipedia, it seems every major civilization had it and came about it independently.  Perhaps when you say umbrella, you mean the modern style collapsable umbrella... but if that's the case, China wasn't the first according to written records.

Europeans did colonized China.  I think it's fair to say Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were colonized.  In addition, a few major ports (including Shanghai and Guangzhou) were essentially European territories.  The Bund in Shanghai looks like Paris or Vienna for a reason.  Across the river is Pudong which looks like NY or Chicago... because almost all of the buildings there were designed by non-Chinese and follow western standards.  

I thought the Japanese colonization of China killed more than 16 million, but Mao Tse Tung wins the grand prize as human who is responsible for killing more humans than anyone else... beating out Hitler and Stalin... no easy task.
China and India are certainly poised to become major economic engines.  But, the problem for China is its one party rule.  The environmental damage is off the charts.  And once the economy slows down a bit, the corruption will become a defining issue.

But the point is that our country used the English system when we broke away from England. When we were developing through the Industrial Revolution, though, we didn't need to rely on other European countries like most European countries did. So we just naturally continued business as usual and became a world power, perfectly fine with the system we had been using.

Now communication and travel are much easier and much more necessary, so as we make ""human progress"" in the sciences we use the SI (not metric) system because it is the best system to use and it's the universal scientific system of measurement.

In our daily lives, though, we still use the English system, as making the change wouldn't be practical or easy for a majority of our 300 million citizens. Furthermore, when it comes to baking, driving, and the weather, the English system (as silly as its origins may be) is much more relatable to the human norm. One cup is simpler to add to a mixture than 227 grams. 20 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius corresponds to a range of 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. This range is able to be about twice as accurate and would make it about twice as vague to the average person to try to adopt the metric system.

Some excerpts:

&gt;By 1618, Mexico's initial population of about 20 million had plummeted to about 1.6 million.

--

&gt;Fortunately for Pizarro and unfortunately for the Incas, smallpox had arrived overland around 1526, killing much of the Inca population, including both the emperor Huayna Capac and his designated successor.

--

&gt;When we in the United States think of the most populous New World societies existing in 1492, only those of the Aztecs and the Incas tend to come to our minds. We forget that North America also supported populous Indian societies in the most logical place, the Mississippi Valley, which contains some of our best farmland today. In that case, however, conquistadors contributed nothing directly to the societies' destruction; Eurasian germs, spreading in advance, did everything. When Hernando de Soto became the first European conquistador to march through the southeastern United States, in 1540, he came across Indian town sites abandoned two years earlier because the inhabitants had died in epidemics

--

&gt;De Soto was still able to see some of the densely populated Indian towns lining the lower Mississippi. After the end of his expedition, it was a long time before Europeans again reached the Mississippi Valley, but Eurasian microbes were now established in North America and kept spreading. By the time of the next appearance of Europeans on the lower Mississippi, that of French settlers in the late 1600s, almost all of those big Indian towns had vanished.

--

&gt;For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the century or two following Columbus's arrival is estimated to have been as large as 95 percent

--

&gt;For example, in 1837 the Mandan Indian tribe, with one of the most elaborate cultures in our Great Plains, contracted smallpox from a steamboat traveling up the Missouri River from St. Louis. The population of one Mandan village plummeted from 2,000 to fewer than 40 within a few weeks.",3,t1_c2300ju,t5_2qqjc,3,t1_c230y2g,t3_idty4,,True,False,1427304398,False,0,,c230y2g,remmycool,0,,0,1309532300

Foreign powers set up foreign districts walled off from chinese sections. Their primary purpose was trade in their favour, china was huge, and it's coffers wealthy. They wanted to flood the country with cheap opium, and hold the imperial regime up for ransom, syphoning the gold and silver out of the country. They did not and could not hope to control it since the imperial regime itself couldn't control it. Hong Kong was ceded as a time limited concession, and given back as agreed in 1997. Taiwan was occupied by japan much later. The bund is a small section of shanghai, and pudong features distinct and unique chinese skyscraper architecture that takes into account traditional chinese harmony in construction and positioning of floors/windows. Macao was a tiny chunck also given up as a time limited concession, and returned by portugal as promised.

And the areas you cite composed single digit population percentage of china at the time. Much of the country was not urban at the time. Hong kong city for example didn't exist, the british built hong kong with chinese labour and population for china's benefit, ironically. 98% of the territory population is han chinese.

So we have an economic boom, unpredented in history, with rising wages and productivity for over 20 years, all thanks to government investment and socialized education; not quite the free market's doing.

edit: for example, 1958 World cup final between Brazil's  4-2-4 (developed in Brazil [Hungarian note here]) and Sweden's 2-3-5 (One of Europe's prevailing formations) was won by Brazil by 3 goals (5-2).

IWantOut,"Basically, they do that a couple times, get disappointed, say fuck it, then pay like a human salary and realize that you get what you pay for if you're not retarded about it. I've scored a lot of jobs like this, it's great, because even if you do a mediocre job, they are enamored at the fact it works and is not a heaping pile of shit.

They being the same customer and people the customer knows. You also want to build up a reputation on some freelance sites and they'll contact you. I don't even search anymore, I just wait for people to contact me. I got ripped off my first couple of jobs, but the main thing you should look for is: perfect English in their posts, if it isn't perfect, they're probably scammers (unless it's obviously like a European's English, those tend to be okay); relatively clear details about the project, don't do it if it isn't crystal clear what they want; avoid things that advertise ""long-term"" up front, they're just looking for people to add to their database and may or may not ever get back to you, and probably won't have a job for you for like 3-6 months; avoid start-ups with big projects, they'll probably go under by the time they should pay you (learned this the hard way); do not do anything that looks too business-y / too buzzword-y besides maybe basic web design, chances are it's some retarded business person who read about ""the next big thing"" but has no idea how computers work. As for keywords, just sift through pretty much everything, then google the companies or people if you can. If you can't, contact them and see what they say and see what they're like and ask about their company. For company websites, look for how it's written and what it contains. Look for business affiliates and look for anything that can show their credibility. If you think it looks fishy, it is. It's not worth your time to work hard and gamble on shitty jobs. Sign up for linkedin and such. Great for finding people who contact you. If you can find them, you can probably check out their profile and see what others say about them. The more professional they seem, the better the chance you have of getting paid. You also need to be pretty entrepreneurial about it, take some risks, if you think you have like a 75-80% chance of getting paid, do it. If you don't, you'll never find anything for the most part.

Also, be careful of people asking for very specific samples that seem like too much or would be easily used by their company with minor modifications (for instance, ""give us an example of how you'd implement a flexible, simple database for perl using this syntax""), it may be a quick job, but they're claiming to have a bigger job to get people to do small parts for free. It's really underhanded but happens sometimes. A lot of the stuff is kind of scammy, but if you play it safe, you'll be fine. Don't let getting ripped off dishearten you either. Start out with things you can do in like 4-16 hours and if the companies are decent, they should contact you later with better stuff.

A lot of companies are also trying to sift through the shit that goes to those sites, there're scammers on both sides. You might also find companies who want you to work for them or might put you on a retainer to do work, but that takes a good bit of work and luck.

HTML5 shit is great because you just take their HTML4 site and make it HTML5 compliant. Make pretty CSS style sheets and such. It's pretty easy and pays relatively well. It'll usually be small businesses who don't know what HTML5 is but they know they want it. They just want you to make their crappy frontpage site work decently in modern browsers. You can also add in HTML5 video crap and such if you want to really awe them. Stuff with some buzzword crap is okay and is usually pretty easy, but avoid things where every other word is a buzzword (i.e. ""Looking to implement a web 2.0 cloud-based service centered around HTML5 using a .NET framework"", too many buzzwords and it makes no sense as to what they're actually trying to do).

The biggest thing to remember about these sites is that they are not an end-all, you just want to get your name out and people will suggest you to their friends and such. Do some slave work and you might find yourself with a really nice, easy job. After you complete a job, follow up with the person. If they seem nice enough, ask if they have any friends who need similar services and such. It works way better than you'd think, especially if you wow them. Also, ask if they'll be a reference for you. Every single good tech job I've ever had has come from knowing someone or from having impressed someone else with my work. These sites are just tools to meet those people and get out there.",1,t1_c22zpvs,t5_2r5hw,1,t1_c2313e3,t3_icem8,,True,False,1427304467,False,0,,c2313e3,[deleted],0,,0,1309533740

ukpolitics,"&gt;Teachers still have jobs others don't. The guy in the call centre or Tesco can be fired at anytime.

Teachers can be fired... Teachers are required for the functioning of society and their numbers depend on demand and government policy (on the back of public demand..).  People pay taxes so that kids can go to school, both to ensure their children (if they have them) are educated and to ensure that there are people to work in the country, innovate and do all the other shit the country needs...

&gt;Anyways in the three months off they can always go stack shelves and se what the real non-unionised world is like - where you get ahead through initiative and hard work. Not union activities.

Yeah, they could, and everyone could work a part time job over the weekends.. What's your point? Are you seriously suggesting that Teachers are overpaid for the work that they do? That people who are highly educated and trained should be paid shitty wages because you don't like them in some way? I mean come on, we could pay everyone minimum wage, or less! It would be great for business, everyone could simply invest in private companies and their choices there could dictate their real income!

&gt;The fundamental problem is the unions, all teachers have to settle for a standard pay scale. 

No, the solution is the unions. Why shouldn't teachers work together to ensure that they are paid a fair wage, why should they not use the little power that they have, like anyone else can, to ensure that they get a fair deal? It's not like the shelf stacker at tesco's or the team leader at nat west can't join a union and do the same thing.  You seem to want to punish people for doing the sensible thing.

More to the point, Teachers don't have to join a union, many don't, they have a choice of union to join...  Unions are the solution, not the problem.  Why people insist that everyone should get fucked by their employers whenever possible is a real mystery to me.

&gt;The best ones cannot demand a higher than average salary and the poor ones are eligible for salaries than they should have ever got.

philosophy,"Meritocracy assumes a few things (at least)…. 1. It is possible for individuals or institutions to be objective and unbiased, 2. Equality of opportunity is possible, and 3. Free will exists.

So, I really think it's difficult to say that 'meritocracy' is unbiased... 
Largely because how 'merit' is defined—almost always subjectively by the social majority. In order to even approach an unbiased ‘merit’, there would have to be an objective way to measure the values by which we all are judged. For example, Europeans decided that a suit and tie looks better than loin cloths, and that girls should wear dresses. Can this be proven objectively correct? Likely not. Thus, this leads to a world where a better qualified man in a prom dress or baggy ripped jeans would likely fair poorly against a (Eurocentric-perspective) well-dressed man who is less qualified. Thus, in order to actually achieve meritocracy, there must be objectively chosen values, and such values must be able to be achieved equally by everyone. 

This is not the world in which we live. For example, Michael Phelps is said to have a perfect swimming body—long arms, large lungs—whereas I do not. Moreover, he was born into a financial situation where he could devote hours of time to a non-essential task. That option simply doesn’t exist for many who are poor and must work to support their families at a very young age. 

So, in a world where the social majority can subjectively decide what constitutes ‘merit’, and that such ‘merit’ is not equally attainable for all, and lastly that all are not born into the same familial circumstances—the remaining ‘moral’ and ‘decisional’ free will (allowing us to make decisions upon which we can be 'rightly judged') with which we are left seems insignificant. Meritocracy as it currently exists falls far from actual unbiasness or equality. Of course, that doesn’t mean we should stop trying to get there.

politics,"&gt;Your small-mindedness really just reinforces what I was saying. 

What is small minded about what I said?  By claiming that the current events in MN are some sort of sign of impending doom that you can easily escape, you either are ignoring what is happening all over Europe, in Japan, and other debt laden countries (which is virtually the entire developed world), or you aren't bright enough to understand what is happening outside of the immediate confines of your miserable world.

&gt;You don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about, 

Really?  

Do you know what is going on in other nations?

Do you have some great value to offer to your future society that we are all ignoring here in America?

&gt;but man you sure are trying hard to attack me. 

It's not hard.

&gt;But that's one of the many reasons I'm leaving - too many children who throw tantrums when someone says something they don't like.

So you can't tolerate dissenting opinions.  I guess you will like it better in a location where speech is restricted.

&gt;Could it be for daring to do what you wish you could? This sure sounds like jealousy to me.

I am very successful right where I am, and quite happy.  I travel outside of the U.S. regularly, so I don't have this warped Utopian view of Denmark, Norway, Germany, or whatever European welfare state is currently the most popular on here.  They're good places to live, but they have their own sets of issues and shortcomings.  I can also tell you that you aren't going to be welcomed to any of them.

&gt;The fact is, there are plenty of places in this world with vastly more opportunities for intelligent people to get ahead in the world. If you don't know about them, it's because you've never bothered to even look. And after all, it's MUCH easier to lie to yourself and tell yourself things are just as bad everywhere. Right?

No, there are plenty of places where people who wish to skate by and do as little work as they can get away with can receive generous social benefits at the expense of the productive members of society (for now, since you clearly don't watch the news).  

However, they are effectively closed to foreigners who don't have something exceptional to offer (and that's the group you fall into).

Again, I've traveled extensively outside of North America.  I've seen what you're longing for, and it's nothing special.

Also, things aren't bad for many people here, including me.

&gt;Well, they're not. But you are more than welcome to go down with this particular ship, Mr Fox, if that will help convince you those grapes really are sour.

The boat will be riding a little higher in the water as soon as you step off and stop weighing it down.

&gt;As of next year, I'm going to have a really hard time giving a damn what happens to the lot of you. You deserve this country, and you deserve what's to come if you sit around doing nothing but tearing down the folks around you who have a clue.

I'd be willing to bet you're still sitting where you are, wallowing in your misery, because the same shortcomings that are holding you back now will either prevent you from making a real effort to move or prevent you from moving to a supposedly better location, because other nations don't want to carry you along any more than we do in the US.

Christianity,"I think it's important for me to first distinguish what I mean by myth, because people have different definitions. When I say ""Myth,"" I don't mean a nice story that is really old and includes supernatural wankery.  I mean an archetypal story that's useful as a lens for seeing our world and ourselves within that world. As such, the Genesis ""myth"" acts as a starting point for our collective narratives.

Moreover, I am an evolutionist and a Christian. There is nothing in evolution that somehow pre-empts the Bible, thus somehow disproving it. Given our history, the existence and resurrection of Jesus is actually one of the most well-established events we have. So the assertion that the story of Christ too is a myth is, quite frankly, nonsense. 

(But you don't have to take my word for it: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjOSNj97_gk

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP15Pc2Lljc)

&gt;Evolution does not produce things that are perfect. It produces things that are good enough to last long enough to get the next generation started. 

Evolution doesn't have a mind. It's just a law. Evolution doesn't care if the next generation survives or not because there is no mind behind evolution to be able to care. It's just a law that describes a set of deterministic properties, and that's it.

&gt;Christ real has not brought and cannot bring this hoped for perfection, because such a thing doesn't exist and never has. However, as myth Christ can and has brought about a relatively few nicer people, saints.

Well, right off the bat, the biggest movements I can point to are the abolitionist movements in Europe and America, and movements started by the likes of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was explicitly moved by the image of this ""kingdom of God"" I am describing here. The effects of King's movement reverberated around the world, and inspired people like Ghandi. And that's exactly how I've proposed the Kingdom works. 

The Kingdom of God is real and powerful; it upsets the natural order of things and makes it so ""the last will be first and the first will be last."" Even such a concept as the dignity of a human being did not exist until Christendom started to flourish. Indeed, you cannot find a naturalistic root for human dignity anywhere in the cosmos apart from God.

&gt; Other myths can also be shown to produce some saints as well so there is nothing special about the Christ myth.

Except that Christ's ministry is historically proven. His impact was unforgettable. And his legacy carries forward to today.

&gt;It seems that most people need some future thing to shoot for in order to not wallow in despair in the moment. It doesn't matter for that purpose where the kingdom of heaven is thought to be located or what it consists of. What does matter is that people must not let themselves know they are pretending about it. Whatever the pill is people must not know that it is merely made of sugar, or it won't work at all.

I disagree fundamentally. People need hope in order to live. They need hope and inspiration every day. Christ's message is one of hope because it *is* hope. Atheism, by contrast, offers bleak, meaningless nothingness. Not only is it a deception and a delusion, but it's incredibly damaging to the individual person and society at large.",1,t1_c230lsj,t5_2qh6c,1,t1_c231m9v,t3_id8sj,Eastern Orthodox,True,False,1427304703,False,0,orthodox,c231m9v,rabidmonkey1,0,,0,1309538498

You exhibit the typical big man complex regarding the world, unaware of the massive linguistic and cultural variety within seemingly homogenous countries that are more varied than entire continents. 

English actually ranks 3rd after mandarin and spanish as a language with most native speakers (as a first language from birth and formative years and with which schooling is conducted). 

But regardless, was france colonised by britain, just because every frenchmen can speak english as well? Was sweden colonised by england, because every swede speaks english? Go back to the 18th century, the lingua franca was indeed...french. 

I can tell you that the lingua franca in the coming century will be chinglish.

And look over to japan, westernized, but look at how unique it is. Japan is nothing like the US or Western Europe. It's own cultural traditions have fused with foreign influences. Walk the streets of tokyo, and tell me with a straight face that this is any european or north american city...likewise in chinas big coastal cities. There is a fusion of not only western with chinese, but within china, there are many different cultures meeting at the crossroads of every city.

 Western culture is entire based on ancient greek political constructs and ancient roman legal system, who in turn got their shit from the near east. 

Far eastern societies will take western culture and mould it into their own cultures forming something new. Likewise every major western city has a chinatown. It's a trait of western multiculturalism and a major eastern chinese influence. Western culture will fuse with eastern cultures not just in the east but also in the west as east asias share of world gdp grows and it's expatriate population grows.

We share a human culture, originated in many places, fused multiple times with multiple other societies and birthed new constructs.  sometimes one will influence the other (medieavl china giving the world the four great inventions) and vice versa (industrial revolution originating in england and spreading all over the worlds).

MensRights,"**Quick Facts** about **[Strauss-Kahn Return](http://www.businessinsider.com/dsk-returns-superman-2011-7)**

Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of raping a hotel maid in NYC last month.

This maid has now been proved a pathological liar, who repeatedly lied to investigators, she even called her incarcerated boyfriend telling him she wants to profit from this, the conversation was obviously recorded by prison personnel.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn  was the head of the International Monetary Fund and before this feminist witch hunt he was headed to be the next President of France.

Many people in France are now dissatisfied with the current President Nicolas Sarkozy, because France is in a recession like other European countries and because Sarkozy got them in an unnecessary war in Libya that will drag for years.

Given the former Machiavellian tactics used by Sarkozy many Frenchmen will think this was all a setup by Sarkozy to undermine his major opponent Dominique Strauss-Kahn and prevent him from running for the French Presidency next year.

Europe is way more tolerant of sexual scandals than America, virility in an old man is seen a plus not a minus, think about Berlusconi.

TL;DR **Dominique Strauss-Kahn is the latest victim of false rape accusations in the Feminist Infected Western World if he is elected the next President of France he will certainly get is vendetta against this insane Feminist Religion and the Feminist States of America.**

Europe lagged behind in a far greater multitude of more practical things for centuries until the industrial revolution. 

Theres a theory as to why China didn't industrialize first despite being at essentially 17th century practical technology level 600 years prior. And it has to do with production efficiency. There was so much labour, and manual techniques were so well established, that mechanization could not take hold because it simply wasn't as cheap and efficient from the outset as existing methods. It was a catch twenty two. Sure, we can build a steam powered cotton mill, but why, if it consumes more resources and is costlier to maintain than 50 workers? If it costs more, and is less efficient to boot, does it make economic sense? No. So the process never starts.

Britain had a small population and needed to maximize output per head leading to ever more efficient machine parts. China never even considered the possibility because manpower was so readily available. It seems the vast food production and thus demographic advantage can become a disadvantage in ways one least expects at certain stages of societal development.

But of course today the world is a globalized place, technology darts from continent to continent as quickly as I post this. I wonder what the advantages and disadvantages are today?

Sometimes, what makes economic sense, is not the way forward. Sometimes you gotta do the counter-intuitive.

This is one of the reasons that Austria never really got involved in colonization and global imperialism (unless you count the ridiculous Mexican Adventure when Napoleon III put Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the throne of the Second Mexican Empire). 

This same realization, however, did not, as you allude to, spread to Budapest. Moreover, Austria-Hungary had more problems than simply the large Slavic population. The Czech population was very well educated and controlled significant portions of the Empire's heavy industry (Skoda Works, Witkowitz Mines and Iron Works, etc.); there was a significant Polish population which was also as equally well developed as the Czechs (though smaller and without as much influence). Farther East, there were also Ukrainians/Ruthenes, Romanians, as well as deep seated divisions among the Balkan Slavs (think of what happened to Yugoslavia). Trialism would certainly have prolonged the life of the Empire (assuming WWI does not happen), but in the end, I think, much of it was doomed to collapse.

Liberal,"This is the result of the core irreconcilable difference between liberals and libertarians, property (or profits) vs people. 

While the difference between liberals and libertarians is what gets most attention in policy debates, the difference between moderates and extremists on either side is just as vital, but often overlooked, at great risk to all citizens who have to live with the policy outcomes. Moderate libertarians have property/money as their top priority and people as their second highest priority (and vice versa for liberals). But going to the far edges of the spectrum, extreme libertarians have property/money as their sole priority, while people could die or rot as far as they're concerned; on the other side, the left counterparts who place people as their sole priority while property/money could vanish or rot as far as they're concerned, *those are communists*, essentially absent in US political discussion. 

So it shouldn't be a surprise that libertarians are giddy at the numbers on the balance sheet moving, despite the harm to public employees.  Though if anyone believes that surplus will actually be allowed to exist or that the savings will actually go to benefit the students instead of straight to the pockets of highly paid administrators (who likely donated to Walker), I have a Nigerian Prince to introduce to you.

About the state pensions, while I worked at a public college in my state, I didn't contribute to Social Security in those years; that job had a percentage of my income go to the state pension. So it's not like a state pension is a luxury perk, it is the sole safety net for people who work an entire career in the public sector. 

As for solving problems from where we're at now, from a liberal POV, increasing the Social Security payout to a livable income and moving state employees nationwide onto it would solve the various state pension problems. Same goes for healthcare, moving all state employees to an as-yet-nonexistent national healthcare program (""Medicare for all"") would free up the states (*and* private employers) from that obligation. And the budget deficit should be covered by a tax increase on those most able to pay (it would be less than one would think, considering the amount of waste in the high cost of private healthcare now), with minor service/benefit cuts elsewhere so all sides share in solving the problem. In short, to adjust our tax and benefit systems to more closely what has worked fine in the countries with higher quality of life than the US (Western Europe, Scandinavia). 

But this is an irreconcilable difference; we'd like to live in a US that resembles modern Western Europe or Scandinavia, and libertarians would like to live in a US that resembles 19th century America. There's no getting around that, all we can do is win and make it so.

But you are wrong to say that ""additional loans were offered without necessary austerity measures"". At the opposite :
&gt;The conditions of the bailout, decided on by the E.U. and IMF, require Greece to freeze government salaries, eliminate bonuses (amounting to two months' pay) and lift the retirement age to 60 for government workers. The aid package also requires Greece to raise its value-added tax to 23% from 21% and also increase some excise taxes, but there will be other large (as yet unspecified) cuts in government spending, too.

lgbt,"Well, I agree with most of that, actually. I don't think it's advisable for gay people to vote for Republicans. I advised earlier that if you're a gay conservative to only vote for Republican candidates when their views on gay rights issues are no different from their Democratic opponents (you see this in congressional and Senate races more often), but to otherwise abstain from voting.

That said, I really do think the Republicans are beginning to moderate themselves on gay issues. It's true all of these things are matters of faith for the leading figures in the party, but they don't talk about these issues in speeches as much or in television ads to the same degree as they did in 2004, which was probably the worst year I remember for homophobic rhetoric. It was much more blatant. Now Rick Santorum, a marginal candidate, is the only one making social conservative issues central to his campaign. Indeed, the front-runner, Mitt Romney, said he was opposed to gay rights during the last debate, but then questioned John King, the CNN anchor and host, and asked him why he asked such a question when the country needed to be focused on more important things like the economy. Many of the candidates' websites have been scrubbed of these issues as well.

We're also seeing more Republicans in state houses and senates (like in New York) breaking with their party on gay marriage, and seeing more endorse civil unions. We've also seen GOProud, a gay conservative group, featured prominently at the last CPAC, even receiving the endorsement of red meat ideologues like Ann Coulter. And this is much to the distaste of the party's far right.

I can imagine in 10 years the Republicans to become a party associated with gay men -- you know, more than they already are ;-). It might take longer. But we've seen a similar phenomenon in Europe where as gays became increasingly visible (and therefore a market to be exploited by politicians), conservative parties began appealing to them, and in some countries now carry a majority of gay votes. As it is, gay men tend to have more money than straight people generally (though I've heard this might be a myth), and so are more likely to distrust socialist economic policies.",1,t1_c230qnw,t5_2qhh7,1,t1_c23221w,t3_ie0mn,,True,False,1427304909,True,0,,c23221w,[deleted],0,,0,1309542251

worldnews,"&gt; I guess then Chinese ships couldn't sail very far, since they feared falling off the edge, correct? rolleyes

Well, Chinese explorers did stick to the shore and known trade routes, so no need to be facetious. I am not making this up, the introduction of the spherical Earth model to China is well documented.

&gt; Theres a theory as to why China didn't industrialize first ... If it costs more, and is less efficient to boot, does it make economic sense? No. So the process never starts. 

There is a similar theory for why the Roman Empire didn't employ pneumatic steam technology and water wheel power, which were known at the time, en masse. Economics definitely plays a role, but I think the bigger factor is science. Science makes tinkering much more efficient, productive, and cheaper.

By the 1500s Europe already had the best science and math in the world. Remember, Britain's industrial revolution came almost 150 years after people like Newton who provided the framework on which to efficiently understand, design and improve new inventions and ideas. For all the countries that industrialized after Western Europe, the tradition of math/science being fundamental to invention/design was already well established, so it's easy to take it for granted. But, there is no way to go from electricity generation to antennas to radios to radar in so little time without the work of Maxwell. It might a pre-scientific society 1000 years of pure tinkering to do the same.

I agree with you that the world is better connected now and ideas rarely stay put. An idea developed in England can be refined and tested in China and built in India.

From CBS News.

OK, so

* if you're the victim of a crime
* if you happen to contact / know a criminal
* if you call that criminal and talk to them about the crime
* if you express hope that you will personally benefit from a conviction

Then you're a liar? Many, many people who are the victims of crime know criminals (it's actually likely, since exposure to crime leads them to socialize with criminals, leading them to exposure to being a victim). In this case, she was a maid, a group of people who are regularly sexually victimized in different ways. In fact, we have even manifested a 'maid'-genre fetish that most every European and North American would recognize. Maids are seen as subservient objects to the hotel guest and are treated as such by fetishists.

Further, **most Americans** when hearing the news of whatever prosecution either refer to or see moneysigns. Your son fell out of a window and broke all his bones? College paid. You tripped on a wire in the hotel? Nice, you can retire. You were assaulted by a cop? Score.

soccer,"Admittedly, I don't know much about Leander Schaerlaeckens. But the article sounds like yet another from somebody that hasnt really followed US soccer carefully for the last 20 years. If he did, he'd know that lesser-known international coaches have had success with our team and perpetuating the sport in America.  

Of course Im referring to Bora Milutinovic.  The 1994 US team he coached in the World Cup was probably the least talented/prepared unit out of the more recent US teams that have made it to the round of 16.  The 94 team did not have to qualify for the cup as the host nation and made it to the round of 16, beating the tournament dark horse (Columbia) in the process. In addition there was no MLS in USA to develop players. So no pro league, no qualifying rounds, and no big-name international star coach and yet, that was the US team I was most proud of and the team that made me fall in love with our side and the game itself.  In fact, Hiddink has been one of my favorite managers because he reminds me of Milutinovic a little bit. In 8 years, the serbian coach took 3 non-powerhouse nations to the round of 16 in the World Cup (Costa Rica 1990, USA 1994, and Nigeria in 1998).  He had charisma and a smile and seemed to be having a great time with his teams anytime he was on the television.

We don't need to keep somebody with bad tactics just because we can't throw lots of money to a big name European coach (which we really could if we're able to jet players to family weddings during tournaments).  That is an American attitude that will continue to be toxic in our development of a football nation. The article hints that big name coaches usually pick smaller teams when they feel there is untapped or undervalued potential within the system.  Maybe the US should be looking for the same in a manger.

politics,"One is a misrepresentation (the ultrawealthy in America enjoy one of the lowest tax rates in developed world, roughly 29% compared to 40-50% across most of Europe). The only reason the ultrawealthy pay so much of the taxes in America is because they control a majority share of _all of the money and wealth_. Remember, the highest quintile controlled 48.2% of all the income in the US with the top 5% controlling 20.7%. [Source](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/inequality/index.html).

These numbers are at 50 year peaks, as that source goes back to 1947 and this is the rich the richest have ever been in that time.

The fourth quintile is essentially unchanged since 1947, and the first second and third quintiles have dropped roughly equivalent to the amount the richest quintile has grown.

I mean, that's data-driven proof that the rich have gotten richer while the bottom three quintiles have slowly been made poorer to pay the difference. People can bitch and moan all day long about tax burdens, but the top quintile, who controls industry and commerce, have so rigged the system that even with such _extremely progressive_ taxation, the balance is _still shifting_ towards money being sequestered at the top.

No one is saying the rich don't deserve to be rich, we only want the lines between classes to be preserved. We only want the super rich in our society to return to only being rather rich, so the poor can stop being _really fucking poor_.

Zerg is a strong race for sure, but it requires immense game understanding to not get very very frustrated when faced with different timing pushes and cheeses.

I would highly suggest you wait untill you are atleast diamond with terran before switching to zerg.

If you insist of going zerg and want to get good at it i can give a little advice:

ZvT: You'll want to learn to use muta ling baneling 
Tips: Get baneling speed when lair finishes first, Be active with mutas, Never attackmove with banelings, dont engage marines with mutas

ZvP: Alot of choices here, but i would recommend Roach infestor corrupter 
Tips: Get burrow asap, watch mrbitters videos about 4gate, retreat from forcefields whenever possible, get neural for infestors, try some multi pronged stuff

ZvZ You will want to use speedlings early, i recommend a 14 gas 14 pool 21 expand, experiement with roach/banelings out of that. Into a midgame of roach infestor
Tips: Never stop making lings until you know exactly what your opponent is doing, Scout for spire with overseer every game, harass with burrowed infestors is great

As a European, I can vouch for it being fast and convenient.  
  
Its obviously cheaper to maintain than the 60 personal car equivalent.  
  
Public transport is more fuel efficient than the 60 personal car equivalent.  
  
European urban environments aren't constructed explicitly to limit the every day man.  
  
High density housing Is space efficient, cost efficient and makes everything in a city a lot closer(ergo. requiring a city dweller to travel Less)  
  
Urban planners have low cost and high practicality in mind. Not some anti-statist agenda.  
  
No ones hiding behind the attractive qualities of public transportation and urban development.  The plain and simple truth is. Like water, sewage or waste disposal, public transportation is a vital service to those that live in the city. If they where dependent on themselves rather than the state. No one would ever get anywhere in the resulting traffic jams.
  
If anything, Suburban living limits the liberties of people the more than anything.  
It creates massive geographical distances and requires the everyday man to own their own car(a 4-20k investment).As well as facilitating a major dependence on car companies and foreign oil.  
  
Free will(in the non-metaphysical sense of the phrase) is completely destroyed in suburbia. Here you have entire populations growing up in Identical houses, living out carbon copies of each other's lives and experiences. Facilitated only by a sea of meaningless trivialities/distractions.(The internet, cable television, xboxes, golf, sports). Leaving the population off guard, and Ripe for business exploitation.  
  
Spreading any new Idea or social dissent is an impossible task in the suburb because of its geographically saturated state. 
  The internet isn't effective enough to do so.Its subjected to occasional censure and is restrictive to a users personal tastes/search queries. Not the unveiling of new Ideas.

The real question is whether universal health insurance would eliminate or at least reduce those pressures. The answer to that question is disappointing: it won't reduce them.

While in some areas of life insurance is a good thing and a helpful tool, in other areas of life it can be a problem. And marry that problem to an irrational need to be insured that compels everyone to desperately seek insurance... and that problem grows exponentially larger.

With health insurance, we have a certain situation that is most easily described by analogy. Let's say you, the reader, wants to purchase something. Maybe a little car, something tiny and silly looking and even cheap. But rather than buy it directly, you have a rich uncle that pays the bill. You're making the choice, but he's writing the check. What happens here? It's not very intuitive... you'd expect it would work just like if you were buying it yourself. And maybe it would, if you're one in one million of car buyers who have rich relatives paying for it for them.

But if everyone has rich uncles (except for those few desperately trying to find rich uncles to adopt them), what then?

Well, just maybe, you'll buy the silly little car with extra options. Why not? You don't pay directly. The uncle steps up and writes the check. The dealership makes a sale. As we iterate through this millions of times over the decades, intriguing things happen. People with rich uncles gravitate towards more expensive purchases. And car dealerships raise the prices... even if they can sell them more cheaply, the person who sells too cheaply looks like he's selling lemons and is punished by losing customers. Some people object to this analogy, claiming that they can't raise prices too quickly... that rich uncles will only tolerate so much, and when they get to the desk to pay the bill and hear the price, they'll tear up their check and storm out. But this isn't so either. You see, if you want to raise prices beyond their tolerance, you can simply figure out how many (roughly) will do this, and how many will just wince and pay. If only half will refuse, then you can more than double the rates, and those half refuse... the other half more than makes up for this.

It leaves us with a situation where the sellers are punished if they lowball others, encouraging conformity, but where raising prices drastically doesn't necessarily lead to lost sales (especially considering how the spoiled nephews gravitate towards high prices).

Now, it may be true that the rich uncles demand their nephews pay rent or something. But this matters little. Will rich uncles negotiate prices maybe? Not really... they've got more important things to do than waste the next 2 weeks haggling. And they can always tell that spoiled nephew he needs to pay more in rent if they feel like it.

The dealerships themselves end up hiring more people, just to deal with rich uncles... so they think that it's really justified. And this sort of thing backs up throughout the supply chain too, from car manufacturer to parts manufacturer to factory worker, etc... until everyone believes everything from raw ore to shiny new car really should cost this much.

In just a few decades time, the price tags on these cars balloon enormously even accounting for inflation. And everyone thinks their part of the price is justified. And yet if people had simply paid for it themselves, the price would have remained reasonable.

This is insurance. 

Of course, this is the private insurance system we have currently. Somehow, we're told, universal healthcare would fix it, right?

But what are you changing? The car dealership? No. The manufacturer? The supply chain? The factory workers? If you aren't changing them, how do you expect cost to go down? Sure, the car dealership can lose a few rich uncle specialists... and maybe give you a $5 discount next time. That's about it.

What happens next? The new rich uncle (government) just decides ""I can't keep buying all these damn cars, there's only so much money""... and maybe he decides that from now on he'll choose who gets cars and who doesn't. It's the only way to control costs. You'll be paying rent to the rich new uncle, of course. But maybe you're not the one that gets a car ration this year. 

So the next objection is ""But the government rich uncle system works in Europe and Japan!""... yes, it sort of works. But only because people in those places take the train or walk. None seem to buy cars near as often, and when they do, they get those little tiny ones that look like golf carts just so they can fit through narrow city streets. And it's only working now, in any event... who knows what the coming decades will bring, as demographic changes alter the economic landscape.

It is, for example, very difficult to find anyone who shares the same physical traits as the Ancient Greeks. Another example are Chinese records of Northern tribes whose mode of fighting were no match for cross-bows and arrows, though they excelled immensely in hand-to-hand and close-range to medium-range combat through swords/spears. Both the Ancient Greeks and those Northern tribes no longer have their ideal version of their culture in existence as both were wiped out by more dominant forms of warfare. In terms of strategic influence of the 'race' idea, I can only gather that it is due to the intense and rapid diaspora of Europeans to all corners of the world.

*200-years-ago-white-people* caused their problems, not *present-day-white-people.* Nobody is accountable for any person's action, bar their own. Certainly not the actions of people who died 150 years ago.  
**3.a)** Furthermore, *present-day-white-people* do almost nothing but bend over backwards for Aboriginals. Throwing money at them, building houses and schools for them, throwing money at them, the ""acknowledging the traditional owners of the land"" bullshit, throwing money at them, etc.  
But what happens is they bite the hand that feeds, as I said in my OP. Trashing the properties, spending the cash on booze and petrol and cigarettes, continuing to abuse each other, etc.  
Nothing changes, so the politicians decide that they just need to keep throwing money at the problem, because that can totally fix any problem.

----

**4)** Thoughtcrime bestows responsibility? Uhm... sure...   
(and why, exactly, is that so?)

My perpetuation is a drop in the ocean. Most of (non-Aboriginal) Australia dislikes them. That is why we have the global reputation of being a racist country, *because we are racist*. That is why we are even having this conversation to begin with, because we were discussing that very reputation.

And finally I'm interested in the Gunpowder Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, Mughals and Ming/Qing Dynasty China. I also have an interest in Europe early exploration and about Colonization in the late 19th century.

I'm just concerned that people are too concerned about:

Egyptology

WW2 (and also WW1 in some cases)

The unfortunate side-effect is that when you grab a few beers on the the way home from work, they are most likely room-temperature, or at best, slightly chilled.

IAmA,"After my experiences through the red tape, bureaucracy, and overall immigration system, no, I do not hate them. 
It is incredibly expensive, as well as discriminatory (europeans get granted more visas, faster; people under the poverty line can't request residency for family members without a sponsor), and overall really really difficult to come into this country. With my family we have paid over 35,000 US$ in fees and lawyers and we have nothing substantial to show for it other than non-immigrant visas (I have residency after I had to get married, I no longer qualified for visa extensions through my father since I turned 21) which only last for 3 years and give you very very little benefits and rights.
Keep in mind my father has a master's degree in structural engineering from the best university in our country, we were middle to upper class when we left, with assets and property, and still it has been really really hard.

I understand that after NAFTA and the free trade agreements of the 90s, along with a ton of other factors (dictatorships, wars, etc...), things got very hard in Latin America. I know they did in my country, this is the reason we had to leave. 
I also know a lot of people didn't have the qualifications my family did (degrees and educations, property in chile, moderate english proficiency) and I know they either had gotten rejected or just flat out didn't apply for visas because they knew they would never get them. 

I've met civil engineers who were doing dry walling, people with mba's working at the farmers market, all kinds of professionals in their respective countries cleaning the grime and doing the dirty work here because they couldn't get in the legal way, so they just hopped the border or crossed the river. I knew a guy who crossed 6 times, got caught 5, mostly because he ran back to the road in fear he would die of dehydration. This guy had 2 degrees from his college in a small town in mexico.

I don't blame them, or hate them. Living in Latin America can be very very difficult. If you think outsourcing is bad here, imagine how terrible it is down there. There are no jobs, things are dangerous in some parts, and the future for a lot of people looks very bleak.

However, paper work is mandated that the insurance is never mentioned.  You see, in this lovely country of ours that 'doesn't have a healthcare problem' Cancer of any type is a Death Sentance. What disgusts me, is that even the treatable varieties are like this. Why you ask? Because here is the scenario:

you come down with treatable cancer (expensive, but treatable) and your insurance carrier forces the company to drop you. You get fired. You're now on the 'black list' no one will insure you. Because you can't get insurance, you also can't be employed anymore for anything more than minimum wage. You or your loved one dies. End of story. Europe doesn't have this problem. Canada doesn't have this problem. It's fucking disgusting. If you can't afford cancer treatment on your savings account, you or your loved one is fucked here.

Chimay is a good classic belgian line. They will be sweet and high in alcohol. They are delicious, but make sure you enjoy more mainstream beers first so that you can appreciate them. The price will be high. If you try one, go for the **Chimay Grande Reserve (blue)**.

Sapporo is a Japanese beer. Nothing worth trying here.

Guinness is the classic stout from Ireland. Their main ""draught"" offering is really only fun at a pub. However, if you can get ahold of their **Guinness Foreign Extra Stout** *(yellow bottle, different from extra stout)* it is pretty damn good. 

Sierra Nevada is one of my favorite beginning breweries. Their **Sierra Nevada Pale Ale** is an amazing baseline - I'd suggest this be the first beer you try. If you want to go a little up in the hops scale, move to the **Sierra Nevada Torpedo**. 

Harp is owned by guinness - it's not wirth trying. 

Hoegaarden makes a wheat beer. If you want to try the style, this is decent, but overall I am pretty sure you won't like it. 

Heineken has a really inflated reputation due to being imported, but it tastes like piss. Avoid it. This is the beer people order when they don't know beer but want to be ostentatious.

Rogue makes some fun beers. Their **Rogue Mocha Porter** is pretty decent, widely available, and a unique experience.

Stone is king. They are currently rated the #1 US brewery on **Beer Advocate**, the go-to beer rating website (with **Ratebeer** also being really popular, especially in Europe). Their beers in general are big hop monsters. You may not like them initially, but if a beer nut sees them in their fridge it will gain you respect. I'd suggest that you try out their **Stone IPA** at some point. Maybe not too soon, but once you start to enjoy slightly more bitter beers this will be amazing. 

Magic Hat is a mediocre little craft brewery from vermont. I've never had a memorable beer from them, but their **sampler packs** can be a fun experience to try a couple different styles of beer side-by-side.

There are two ways to deal with that kind of historic anger: you harm the society or you harm yourself. I don't think there's a drive to harm Western society in the majority of the Native Americans today, either from learned helplessness or from fear that it would do little good. So they self-harm, they escape from the situation through internal violence and violence toward the self, like alcoholism.

They lived nothing like us, they had an undisturbed history and way of living for millions of years, and then they were decimated in the most heartless and vicious way.

""In a few years, the majority of all the produce for sale in the United States will be from genetically modified crops, thanks to the cozy relationship between Monsanto Corporation and the United States government."" (How can one take this as anything else but that GM food is somehow inferior to non-GM food?)

Worse still, due to the vast quantities of high-fructose corn syrup Americans consume, fully one-third of children born in the United States today will be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at some point in their lives.  (Ok, killing might be extreme on this one, saying that it is generically bad would have been more honest, but diabetes isn't known for extending someones life span).

""Of course, it’s not just the food that’s killing you, it’s the drugs."" (Should have flipped this with the corn syrup one, he does directly rant that drugs are killing us).

As to ""free speech"", libel tourism was getting so bad in the EU that the US had to address it with a new law last year.  It is my opinion that being being sued for speaking one's opinion or even verifiable truth truth is perversion of justice.

* Die Bahn has [weekend tickets](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/DEU/en/prices/germany/happy_weekend_ticket.shtml) that are a damn cheap way to get around the country.

If you go to Frankfurt am Main hop on an S-Bahn to Rodelheim, find In der Au. It's more music club than sqaut but they do People's Kitchens and a big festival every year.

&gt; this would not have occurred had there **not have been forced legal mandates by the Israeli Civil Authority to impose special legal privilege to the terrorists**. Despite complaints by local residents that the assailants were photographing security check-points and weakness in the perimeter fence

first you are demonising the whole palestinian population by calling them terrorists. second, you are blaming the 'liberal' laws for giving some respite to the palestinians instead of blaming the real culprit: illegal settlements, continuous encroachment and state sanctioned discrimination against another people: the palestinians.

I find your position jarring to an extreme. Something almost victorian. A time when erudite men of letters would call savages any non-Europeans and treat them like chattel.

that's a false choice. The EU, the UN and the US have been repeatedly calling for Israel to respect the 1967 borders and compensate land taken from palestinians who have been expelled after the war.

reddit.com,"I do agree that the question is wrong, but not quite because they are almost the same.

Can I make an analogy? I don't eat meat. I haven't for about five years. When I first started not eating meat, this was just something that I did. It was behavior. Now, I *am* a vegetarian. I have integrated this behavior into my identity. This helps me make very quick and forceful decisions about my diet, but it's also kind of constraining in that I won't, for example, eat delicious, delicious meat even in situations where that consumption wouldn't produce any ethical repercussions.

I don't think that behavior and identity are almost the same, but I think that we can easily turn behavior into identity, and as you point out identity will shape behavior. And it's really hard to tell which aspect is more fundamental.

But certainly, there is some behavior that we all tend towards without associating it with an identity. I sail, but I don't consider that a fundamental aspect of my identity. If I never again had an urge to sail, and consequently never again sailed, I wouldn't say that I had somehow changed. So, this is how I mean to show that we can have unique and persistent behavior without an associated identity.

If I were to be romantically attracted to a guy, and I were to indulge that attraction, I think that I would feel some internal and external pressure to mold my identity around that behavior. But, I'd much rather live in a world where I would feel completely free to choose as my next romantic partner anyone of any gender, irrespective of my previous romantic history.

While you might be right on the government law, I DID read Danish comments on the recent hullabaloo on the MP, and many were quite over-the-top and even paranoid, many of them very angry over the result of the court case.  So yes, I do think that Europeans AT LEAST are more likely to tend to being like  what I described, especially in comparison to Americans.  

Yes, the American approach is correct. Hate speech is just insulting some subset of people, instead of a particular individual, for particular reasons.  Insulting Scientologists would be considered hate speech.  Hell, insulting racists can be considered hate speech (where's the line between religion and ideology and philosophy, and why does ""religion"" get a special place in these laws above ideology and philosophy)? 

I see very little difference in insulting black people for their skin color and insulting ugly people for their physical unattractiveness.  There's certainly eugenicists types that believe ugly people should not breed.  I've met them.  Of course, no laws are made for ugly people... all hate speech laws are hypocritical and under deep analysis are highly political and silly.

Not to mention what is considered an insult is itself subjective.  ""Christians are irrational!"" is a true statement to many atheists and a grave insult to many Christians.  Better lock up them bigoted atheists for attacking a group of people for their cognitions, that's DISCRIMINATORY!

Notice that wasnt at this soccer match, but at a baseball game with no real international stakes on the line.  In europe, the same denial of accountability happens when black players get bananas and peanuts thrown at them by nationalist audiences or endure monkey chants when they touch the ball. Imagine how uncalled for black fans feel the ordeal is, but FIFA does very little to change the atmosphere other than putting patches and banners on the field as reminders to be polite.

Fans can be shitty everywhere, from every country and for all sports.  That is not a fault of Mexico or their Federation.  It IS a problem that the US should accept more blame for if they are in charge of organizing the venues for the match.  Admittedly, I have no idea how these fixtures are established and not really interested in finding out to point the ultimate finger of blame.  All I know is that CONCACAF should care about their tournament enough to keep it as civil as a match can be.  And the host nation (whoever it is) is responsible for keeping illegal activity in a stadium to minimum and having adequate security enforcement measures.


I agree that piss being dumped on anyone is uncalled for.  Same with bottles thrown.  But at Livestrong Park, the bottles are all plastic and they are directed to the field not other individuals in the stands (Doesnt make it better I realize but, not as sensational as violenece directed towards fans). Someone may be angry, but not going to sustain a substantial injury from an emtpty plastic bottle.

Also, you can bet im not going to an usher if somebody dumped piss on me.  Im going for their throat and i dont care if they are male, female young, old or even if they are cheering for the same team as me.  I guess if they were too young id go smash the face of the oldest person they are at the stadium with who should be monitoring their behavior better.

Tim Howard was pissed at the end of the game because the ceremony was in spanish, not because his goalkeeping made me want to vomit for the first time since he put on the national uniform. Fans are pissed at rude mexican fans rather than being pissed at the people in charge of organizing and monitoring the event.  As much as I hate that shitty things happened to innocent people in the stands (and i truly am upset that people would target innocent fans) I also realize that this has been happening for a while.  Don't blame the few assholes for being what they are, blame the administration for not having the reasonable foresight to plan for things like this to occur.

Economics,"&gt;Definitions of hyperinflation very, but

Sure, even the low end of that is still far higher than the US has ever seen and that anyone really expects to see in the future. Hyperinflation typically happens in post-war scenarios (e.g. Germany in the 20s or parts of eastern Europe after WWII).

&gt;but then why the hell are Keynesians trying to solve the problem of debt with more debt?

The question is where is the debt? The debt that caused the explosion of the housing market was in the private sector. If the private sector needs to deleverage, then someone (aka the public sector) should pick up the slack to ensure that the economy doesn't go into a deep depression. Within this, there are controversies about what the public sector should do. For example, I don't really like supports for the housing market. I think that market should be allowed to clear. However, we could spur additional growth in other sectors. For example, US infrastructure is crumbling. So I'm for spending public money on rebuilding infrastructure. And new infrastructure is also good. I'm a huge fan of the government deploying fiber to the home. I'm less of a fan of high speed rail, although it might make sense in certain parts of the country. I'm also a big fan of more research funding. We could put a lot of people with high tech skills to work by increasing NASA's funding, for example. We could also put more money into the National Science Foundation, which will help drive future growth by inventing new technologies.

The fact is that with historically low interest rates, the public sector can borrow a lot more if it needs to. The current threat of default is only political and related to a stupid and probably unconstitutional (see 14th amendment, section 4) debt limit law.

&gt;Why did a prominent Keynesian call for a housing bubble?

Here is his response to those claims: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/and-i-was-on-the-grassy-knoll-too/

All the controversies of yesterday were between men who agreed, at least, upon the existence and importance of this Divine Order. This belief formed a basis of unity for Christians of every kind; and it linked Christendom with Judaism and Islam, and with the Platonist and Aristotelian philosophies, as well as with the pagan world of the Gentiles in Asia, Africa and America. To be sure, there were to be found a handful of disbelievers here and there - especially among highly civilized peoples: while there were a larger number of ""worldlings"" whose lives were conducted with small regard for anything but mundane motives and expediency. But one of the features of the modern world which seems to be new in the history of mankind is the systematic attempt which has been, and still is being made to expel or exclude the ""spiritual idea"" and its implications from the whole body of a civilization; an attempt which has, actually, achieved a very substantial degree of success.

Not only is full and clear belief in God more frequently absent from human lives than ever before, but the whole background of thought in which that belief is found is now very commonly rejected. It has become a basic assumption in our Western world that the temporal and material order is the only one of which we need to take practical account in our way of life, whether as individuals or as communities.

This assumption, it must be emphasized, is not peculiar to avowedly atheistic systems of thought like Communism: it underlies all the principal ""ideologies"" which have been contending for world power during the present 20th century: Fascism, Communism, Socialism and Democratic Liberalism as understood by many of its adherents. True, the ""materialism"" of these movements conceals an undercurrent of idealism whose origin is spiritual - and which gives them their driving force: but this force tends to grow weaker as the ""perfume of the empty jar"" of the rejected religious tradition gradually fades away, and the implications of a purely ""space-and-time"" view of man as a planetary social animal are realized in thought, and made the basis of action.

About the ultimate results of this process I shall have some reflections to make shortly: meanwhile I must re-emphasize the rampant fact of materialism of which any man of vivid and realistic supernatural faith must be aware in the world surrounding him - both in ""new lands"" like Australia and the United States, and in the older Western communities of Europe. Its outlook and values are reflected in our political and social life, in our press, radio, television, literature and cultural institutions, and in the day-to-day life of millions of our fellow-men. Just as the Western culture of the Middle Ages was Christian and Catholic, so the culture of our modern era is ""secularist,"" treating religious truth, in effect, as non-existent.

The Two Worlds

The life of Faith, of course, continues to survive in the midst of this secularist civilization. We have - as Rosalind Murray has well said - ""Two separate mental worlds, each self-contained"" which exist side by side, intersecting and overlapping, though no more fusing than oil and water. Those who belong to one or the other are, in general, externally indistinguishable. They live side by side: they work together in office or bench or field: sometimes they are members of one family, or even sharers of one marriage-bed. Yet, spiritually, they remain poles apart: and it is becoming harder than ever to establish spiritual contact between one side and the other.

The Christian warriors and ""Paynim"" Moslems of the crusading era were far nearer akin to one another than many who dwell in constant and apparently intimate association in our own world.

We have said that the man of real faith cannot fail to be aware of this secret division between belief and non-belief. It is, however, largely ignored or treated as unimportant by public opinion and the organs through which that opinion is formed and expressed. Moreover, the attitude of ""those who profess and call themselves Christians"" reveals too often the unconscious infection of their thought by the prevailing tone of the world. They are, it seems, reconciled to this anomalous situation as though it were normal: and they, too, are accustomed to talk, act and think about everyday affairs as though the differences of basic attitude to life were of no particular account. It is taken for granted that political views, nationality, social class, intellect, taste, differences of technical knowledge and skill are important in classifying human beings: but classification according to ""religious opinion"" is regarded as giving undue importance to a purely private matter which has - or ought to have - no social significance. In the case of teachers, for instance, it is commonly assumed that ""religious tests"" are not only objectionable, but unnecessary - the official Catholic view to the contrary is regarded as reactionary bigotry. To the secular world it does not matter whether these people believe in God or not, so long as they can do their job without making life uncomfortable by insisting on their personal views about its meaning and purpose.

The Secularist Mind and Religious Persecution

Indeed, the typical secular-minded ""Modern Man"" has become so profoundly alienated from religion that it is incomprehensible to him that anyone can truly regard the order of things with which believers are concerned as real and of ultimate importance. When the fact of religious persecution or conflict is presented to him in the modern world, his first reaction is one of sheer disbelief. The stories are ""propaganda,"" invented to discredit the movements accused of intolerance. When the mass of evidence presented makes it impossible for him to hold this opinion any longer, he tries to interpret the conflict in terms of secularist ""realism."" The Christian is a victim because he is suspected of Fascism, or ""reactionary associations""; the militant ""anti-God"" atheism of the U.S.S.R. and Red Peking is a party-gesture which he deplores but explains away, treating it as without fundamental human or social significance, and therefore unfit for more than passing attention.


Tolerance and Intolerance

The secular assumption of the unimportance and unreality of religion is behind all the current smooth language about ""agreeing to differ,"" ""living and letting live"" and the rest of it. In effect, the believer is told that no one will interfere with his religion if he will conform in his actions and words to the secular convention that God is of no account. But if he ventures to challenge openly the current local standards of secularism, he is soon made to feel that he is a ""peculiar"" person, and that his sort of views are repugnant to the ruling influences of his world. For example, while Catholic beliefs about the Virgin Birth, Purgatory, the Assumption, Holy Images and so forth, are widely regarded with good-natured indifference, tinged with romantic sympathy or ""scientific"" contempt, it is different with the rulings of the Church about such things as divorce, ""mixed"" marriages, contraception, sterilization, abortion, difficult cases in childbirth, or euthanasia, in which the law of God is asserted dogmatically in fields which ""modern thought"" regards as governed solely by social expediency. Here, the reactions to Catholic views are frequently violent: and it is made clear that the intrusion of God as a Reality into the sphere of public policy and social life is regarded as intolerable. For the rest, the secularist ""standard pattern"" has been imposed on the free public education systems of this country and others, which is based on the implicit assumption of the unimportance of religion in the sphere of culture and general knowledge: and those who will not conform to this principle of secularist orthodoxy are obliged to pay a part of the expense for the secular school system based on it, as well as bearing the whole burden of their own ""dissident"" Christian educational structures (so sadly the position of Catholic schools in the Australia of the 1950s).

There are, in fact, no terms of reconciliation between the worlds of those who believe that Theism is an ""opinion"" of no account socially, and those who believe that ""the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him for ever,"" and that He is the Supreme Reality upon which all mundane things depend. This is already realized by the more radical secularists on the one side and the Catholic Church on the other: and as our civilized world moves on from one crisis to the next, the terms of man's choice will become clearer, and the irrepressible conflict may be expected to grow more bitter in one social sphere after another.

No, actually, that refutes your point.  Iceland specifically stated it would not honour it's guarantee.

&gt; Those rules are based on nationality. Iceland didn't use the nationality of foreign citizens, per se, to make their decision. They used the locality of the branches. It's an important distinction. Weaselly? Sure. It's still an important distinction.

Well, either you foot the bill, or  someone else does.  If you don't pay for your debts, ultimately someone else has to.  Better citizens face up to the responsibilites of their own governments rather than allow others to pick up the pieces.

IAmA,"Completely understandable, and let me give you my 2 cents on this.

My main gripe, from my experiences over the years, is with free trade agreements and NAFTA. Those are the biggest factors in illegal immigration that people often forget or don't know.
Most companies in Latin America are US or European owned, as this has been the traditional model since the colonial days for us. Through the 80s and 90s, American and European CEOs moved companies from North and South America to Asia to take advantage of the cheaper labor costs. This produced two things. 1) Most labor jobs for unskilled or nonprofessional workers (those who didn't attend a 4-6 year university) left with the factories, and most of what was left was construction, making an already finite job market even smaller (such as is the case with contracting). My personal story is the town my mother grew up in Chile. There were a dozen factories in that town, producing the bulk of textiles of the country for decades. Once free trade was lobbied for and  passed, fast forward a couple of years and all but two of the factories had closed. The town was rampant with crime and poverty, all because some multinational corporations wanted to make even more of a profit by bringing in cheap goods to our country, rather than us making the stuff ourselves. Not one person benefited from this, except for the politicians who lobbied for it.
2) People in poorer countries fled to richer countries in search of unskilled work. In Chile, we have a huge influx of Peruvians and Bolivians coming in. Brazil has immigration problems as well. The US is obviously the biggest example. Ironically, goods and money now have NO restrictions when going through borders, but people do. 

Now, here is what concerns me about the language and nature of the immigration debate: people blame immigrants first, and their reasons for coming never, ever get a fair voice in the debate. Every single immigrant I've met would much rather be in their home country if they were able to make a living there. I think American and WTO politicians, lobbyists and executives deserve most of the blame for the current immigration situation, yet they get none. They are the ones who created the climate that makes emigration desperately necessary for the people of Latin America, but the finger is always pointed at the immigrants themselves. 
I always wonder what could had been if the post colonial and modern era of our countries had been different, if free trade as the unregulated, gigantic mess that we know had never existed. How much better would this continent be as a whole? If mexican, brazilian, chilean companies were owned by mexicans, brazilian, and chileans instead of multinational corporations, and if outsourcing was something that we had never heard of, how much better would the quality of life be in those countries, and in THIS country for that matter?",7,t1_c233ewt,t5_2qzb6,7,t1_c233oef,t3_iefax,,True,False,1427305673,False,0,,c233oef,fesxvx,0,,0,1309557551

AskReddit,"I do sometimes to stretch gas mileage. Drag increases exponentially, so going even 60-&gt;70 is a pretty massive increase supposing you're not drafting someone. If I don't need to arrive somewhere 60 miles away for an hour and a half and there isn't too much traffic having to pass (i.e. so much that they wouldn't all fit in the left lane without bottlenecking) I'll happily go 60. Also accelerating incrementally at whatever RPM the engine is most efficient at rather then flooring and anticipating slowing down by releasing the accelerator (breaks are a last resort).

Now I generally accelerate or move out of sheer politeness if people need to get by or people seem confused when I don't keep 60 mph all the way up to the sign saying ""30"" and then nail the break (hyperbole, but really, I like my breaks and I like my gas - I don't want to use extra gas to turn break pads into dust and heat while most people seem perfectly comfy with that). Not everyone does that.

In a Prius less break is less of an issue because it recovers the momentum and can reuse it, but slow acceleration and keeping the speed is even more efficient because if you can keep the gas engine from having to fire up, you're just gliding on zero gas and a slight drain on the batteries for the extras until you are forced to do something radical.

This sentence contradicts itself. Before the era of DNA testing it would have been impossible to verify claims to inheritance by random ""illegitimate"" children coming out of the woodwork. They wouldn't have allowed such a thing even in European or other Asian civilizations (in fact Europe, the non-Anglo part of it, had similar laws back in the day and still does even in contemporary times) towards Islam here.

If you're going to be guaranteeing children a part of inheritance, which is a legal affair, then you have to do it in this manner (tantamount to leaving a legally admissible official paper trail for the child's birth). There was no other way.

I have a 2000 Saab 9-3 and am the second owner (the dealer said the previous owner was a woman who looked to be in her early 50s and was trading in for a Jeep Wrangler). I've put on a little over 20k miles (now at 77,xxx) in 4 years of owning it. I change it with synthetic oil religiously and recently just stopped using 89+octane gas because I can't keep affording it.


I've had the passenger side window come off the track twice now with the rear passenger completely falling down, it's taped up now. The AC is leaking and requires refrigerant refills every two-three months (not bad but Texas is really hot right now). The battery has pooped on me about 5 (FIVE!) times now. I've had the alternator checked out twice with different mechanics, but each said it looks fine. Small issues, but expensive to fix because a Saab is an European car base.


On the other hand my brother has a Ford Ranger (2007 4-cylinder model) and my Father a Ford utility van (2003) and use to own a Chevy Silverado (1988). The Fords have had no other issues other than the van needing the brake system totally reworked (Dad drives like a jackass in that utility van), and I am by no means a Ford fanatic, their full-size trucks suck. The Chevy, he parked it under a tree at a friend of his ranch for about 5 years without starting it. After he got his divorce settled, he picked it up and it fired right up with no issues and drove it home. And those Japanese cars are reliable, if I didn't need a truck as a next car I'd probably get one of those. My mom has owned 3 Honda's, an old ass red Accord (I was too young to remember the year), a CR-V (2003), and another Accord (2006). I'm sure the red Accord had issues sooner or later, but I can guarantee the CR-V and newer Accord never had an issue...other than her backing into a 40 foot pool in a parking lot.

starcraft,"I think as a community, we should encourage more tournament organisers to release their own maps into the map pool. So far, the only real tournament organisers to have done this were Gretech (a.k.a. GOMTV) and iCCup.

Blizzard have proven time and time again that appealing to the lowest common denominator in unnecessary ways is just going to fuck up your game even more. Look at World of Warcraft when they introduced Arena, turned Battlegrounds obsolete except as Honor farms where you grind points at a drip rate in order to obtain gear that lets you fight in smaller groups in a featureless (i.e. Nagrand Arena) or buggy as crap (Ring of Valor) arena and then forced everybody to get high ratings in order to obtain gear, thus reintroducing this culture of elitism and rating/gear snobbery amongst the game's already terrible community.

I think Blizzard are fast turning into the next Sonic Team in the way that modders are already beginning to produce assets for StarCraft II better than Blizzard themselves can (just look at other melee maps like the GOMTV ones, the iCCup ones, the MOTM ones etc.)

And when I say ""fast turning into the next Sonic Team"", I mean look at how far the Sonic the Hedgehog series has gone down the shitter! There are actually fanmade games that exceed the crap the Sonic series has unleashed upon the world in recent years.

Also, Sonic Team have introduced unnecessary and usually shitty gimmicks into their games i.e. the Werehog in Sonic Unleashed, Silver the Hedgehog, vehicles and weapons from Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic 06', that have often made the game much less enjoyable to play. Blizzard are beginning to do the same by introducing ""macro"", ""rush"" and ""normal"" maps. And judging by how the maps are, I can probably describe each style like so.

""Macro"" is where no starting position favours the other, the rush distance is respectable and there are an abundance of expansions to take.

""Rush"" is where the starting positions are close together or the map has destructible rocks all over the fucking place, or both.

""Normal"" depends on spawn positions. It can either be far away, signalling a standard macro game or close-by-land where scouting becomes near impossible (because of close rush distances and the paths of the two spawn locations not crossing a Xel'Naga Watchtower) and your only viable option is to rush like a motherfucker.

In fact, this makes me hope that external ladders made in protest like NTBL are launched without Blizzard implementing a Warden-like system to prevent their usage and that they succeed.

Travel is one way to do this, and now is a good time because once you start formal work you may not be able to get away for a long stretch for many years. A (reasonably frugal) trip to Europe sounds good. Can your sister pay her share? I wouldn't worry if you have to subsidize her to a small degree -- investing in family relationships is also sensible!

For donating, I would look at some local recipients,  as you can get quite a lot of fun out of giving small sums/items to your old scout troop, school etc. For a bigger donation, I would look at making a ""not too worried if I don't get it back"" loan to one of the well-run microbank schemes -- but you need to be a bit careful selecting them.

&gt;Stereotypical Germans love warm beer

Or maybe german beer is good enough that it doesn't have to be chilled into oblivion to taste good ;)

&gt;German ""smarties"" candy is totally different then American ""smarties""

Really? What can be done different about chocolate with color around? ;)

&gt;Germany don't give a single fuck.

This. Nobody is going to close anybody's Kirmesbude due to copyright complaints...

&gt;Any tips on how to be frugal in Germany?

Hm, yeah, a few. I'm a student after all ;)

Internet: Get it from Unitymedia (cable) or 1und1 (DSL) or Vodafone (DSL) or whatever, just not Telekom. Too expensive. I'd always prefer the former as long as the house has cable access. 16MBit/s for 20€, 32MBit/s including phone and digital TV 30€. Never get UMTS (always bandwidth caps) and check out the cheapest DSL plans for bandwidth caps in the fine print. Cable is preferable whereever available. Check for contract lenghts, 24 months are not uncommon!

Mobile phone (or Handy, as we say): Do you call people a lot? If not, get a used or new phone from eBay and buy a prepaid card e.g. from simply (simplytel.de). 0.08€/minute and per sms and no monthly fee, plus you can set your credit to be recharged automatically to e.g. 20€. In Germany you don't pay for calls you receive, so don't worry about that. Quality of network coverage in descending order: Vodafone, T-Mobile (both near perfect), O2, ePlus. Many prepaid cards use the latter, stay away from them if you plan to be anywhere else than the city.

Energy: Wherever you move, the local electrical company will never be the cheapest. Compare on verivox.de, stay away from prepaid offers and dubious bonuses (you can deselect them in the search). You can usually still save, I e.g. pay 0.21€/kWh instead of 0.24€ and I can leave the contract any time. When buying appliances, check their energy usage. A freezer e.g. should at least carry the ""A+"" label. [Check this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_energy_label) for more info. Ditch bulbs, get CFLs. Eliminate standby-use. Always remember, this isn't the states, energy costs about 3 times more than what you're used to.

Heat: Is fucking expensive here. If your appartment has traditional radiators, get electronic programmable thermostats and set them to turn off during the day. 

Shopping: Aldi and LIDL are your friends. Sure, LIDL treat their personnel like shit, but did you care about that at WALMART? See. McDonalds and Burger King are fairly expensive here, if you want cheap grease on the go, get a Pommes Currywurst. Never buy electronics in a store, always check out geizhals.at (set to ""Germany"" using the flag) and buy online. Anything ordered online can be sent back within 14 days and you always get two years warranty. Learn to appreciate Döner while on the go. Sometimes stores offer bread from yesterday for half the price. I've never found anything wrong with that.

Car: How much are you going to drive? Diesel is cheaper here and available everywhere, taxes are higher though. A small diesel powered german car is a nice way to get around. Unless you'll only drive 20km a day, get a gasoline car then. I have no idea how much you want to spend, so tell me and I can recommend you a car. Rest assured that all your experiences from the states don't work in that sector. Suggestion: Audi A2 TDI 75hp. Doesn't rust, cheap VW/Audi parts available, uses 5l/100km, awesome community available.

Bike: Get a good one. Not from the homestore, go to a bike dealer. It's fairly flat where you live. Use that.

being sick: Go to the doc. That shit is free (well, depending on your insurance the first visit per quarter costs 10EUR), so do it. If you have private insurance, you can go anywhere. If you have ""gesetzliche"" insurance, your personal doc sends you to the specialist he deems fit for you.

That's what comes to mind for now - feel free to ask whatever else you want to know :)

There are 200-400 billion stars in the galaxy. That's a lot of room for expansion. Even if you wanted to argue that interstellar travel is (and will always be) impossible/impractical, that still leaves us with the entire solar system, and the raw resources to maintain a population in the hundreds of billions, if allocated efficiently. 


Likewise, the exponentially increasing population is due primarily to the requirements and deficiencies of our present civilization (ie. a need for children to help with labor/care for us when we are old and a lack of understanding about birth control)


Look at the world's most developed nations, already in Europe many nations have a (unfortunate) negative population growth. Improved contraceptives, education, and a lack of a need (rather than desire) for children would further reduce this rate.

languagelearning,"A few notes:

* 3.) ""quiser"" is just ""querer"" conjugated in the future subjunctive, which Spanish is losing.  It's used in daily speech, but you'll survive without it.

* 4.) ""eu sou"" is actually the verb ""ser"", but Niubai's comment explains this already

* 8.) ""cara"" means guy, man is actually ""homem"".

* 9.) t's and d's change sounds before the ""ee"" sound.  Unless they have some kind of accent over them, final e's are pronounced as ""ee"" and final o's are ""oo"".  And the s thing you can ignore because that's just the Rio de Janeiro accent, it's not something that everyone does.  Also, r's at the start of a word and all rr's are pronounced as ""h"", so you get ""rato"" (meaning rat) said as ""ha-too"" and ""errado"" (meaning wrong) as ""eh-ha-doo""  Otherwise, roll your r's like in Spanish.

Finally, and this is the tricky part for English and Spanish speakers, vowels with a tilde or before n or m are nasalized, meaning that you pronounce them kinda like you're humming.  That's something that's hard to explain in person, but almost impossible in writing, so you'll need to hear that for yourself.  Examples are ""não"" (meaning no) or ""um"" (meaning one).

English heavily influenced by Chinese... not really a language.  So I guess you are saying English will continue to be the most important language.

&gt;And look over to japan

I've been living in Japan for more than 15 years now (I've also lived in South Korea).  Japan today is very much like Western Europe.  There's a social safety net, a Western style constitution, western business practices, and its companies compete (successfully) for Western markets.  I live very comfortably here precisely because it feels Western.  I also enjoy the things that make Japan Japan... Tanabata is coming up (July 7) and the festival is a great summertime treat.  Japan has had 150 years of intense Westernization (not to mention the centuries of slight Westernization).  There are no Samurai chopping off peoples heads today.  In fact, a Japanese from 1850 wouldn't even be able to effectively communicate with someone today because the language has changed so much.  In addition, similar to as you mentioned, many things around today perceived as Western are from Japan.

We can agree to disagree about the colonization of China.  You consider anything short of India to not be colonization.  I simply believe colonization is the act of establishing colonies.  Independently ruled with heavy influence from a parent country.  The size of land and population is not really a determining factor, although it would be important in its success.

TwoXChromosomes,"Clubbing in Swansea, Wales, was awesome and horrifying at the same time. A hilarious parade of freak shows, and yet I was among them. Popped collars like you wouldn't believe. Vagina curtains like you've never seen. Outrageous accents, 80's music, and more. It was trashy and glorious. 

I went with my friends, who were on the same MA course as me. Drinks were always super cheap in Swansea, so people get fucking wasted. Fast. This can either be hilarious or scary. I saw instances of both, though I personally never felt threatened because they always have loads of police guys around on weekends. 

Oh man, halloween was one of the most amazing experiences there. So much trash. So much shiny. So much tastlessness. So much fun. It was as if the gates of hell had literally been opened and they all decided to go clubbing in Swansea, where every other place tries to pretend they're classy, but ultimately, it's Idols where everyone goes, because let's be real: this isn't London. This is Swansea. So get that third vodka and coke for 2 quid, because dammit, they're playing that Rihanna song again and omg LET'S DANCE!

They had this now defunct gay club called Hush close to the train station. Omg it was epic. A basic cover charge got you free drinks the whole night. So you can imagine the crowds it pulled... in fact there were hardly any gay people at all. It felt like a club from the post-soviet area of eastern europe. 

I confess, it can get old though. And I absolutely hate hang overs so I would always be careful with my drink, which made me then have to babysit my friends who'd get so plastered by the end of the evening. If anything, having friends who don't know their limits is the worst thing about it.

socialism,"Dave, you're still not dealing with the any of the principled questions - everything is short-term, tactical realpolitik in your posts. 

What if the majority of the working class does hold residual illusions in the Democrats? Does that mean that socialists should refrain from exposing the real character of the Democrats, and promote illusions in them, a la the ISO?

Frankly, this is the rationale of political cowardice that pervades the pseudo-left. If that position had been accepted at various points in history, the socialist movement would not exist today. After all, Marx carried out his work as a poor, and largely unknown emigre, with a limited following for most of his life. 

Lenin and Trotsky and the other internationalists were amongst the most isolated people in all of Europe in 1914, when they stood against the capitulation of social-democracy to the ""patriotic war"". Within four years, Lenin and Trotsky were leading a revolutionary government...Should they have capitulated to the war propaganda in 1914? After all, the majority of working people supported the war.

One could come up with a whole number of examples. Trotsky's fight against the Stalinist bureaucracy and his defence of the perspective of world socialist revolution, the opposition of the Trotskyist movement to the 2nd world war, under conditions where every other political tendency supported it etc.  What about today...What if a world war breaks out, between the US and China...There would be enormous confusion, and its highly probable that large numbers of people would initially support it. According to your political perspective, socialists should go along with the war drive - how principled and far-sighted it is to subordinate your politics to whatever you think appears to be popular at a given moment...

The task of socialists is to politically clarify the working class - to dispel illusions in every nationalist tendency of the ruling elite. This is not going to result in immediate popularity - but it points the only way forward for the working class. 

This answers your question about whether the SEP provides an alternative...Yes, it is the only party fighting to build a mass socialist movement of the working class against the Democrats, the Republicans and independent of the thoroughly corporatised unions, as part of an international movement. Above, you seemed to suggest that there was absolutely no alternative to the ISO's perspective of complete integration into the union bureaucracy, and slavish support for the Democrats...If you think that, they frankly, you're no socialist...

The SEP alternative has been tested in practice - it has organised an independent movement of working people in Detroit against the policy of utility shutoffs being carried out by DTE, with the support of Bing. The ISO would never do something like that - after all, it would involve a break with the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy. Moreover, the fact that these policies are being carried out in Detroit by a black mayor, a black, Democratic bureaucracy etc. completely refutes the perspective of identity politics which the ISO promotes... 

The SEP intervened in Wisconsin calling for a political general strike, the removal of Walker, and a break with the Democrats. When the SEP called for this perspective, the ISO yelled out ""no, no""...Pretty revealing? And herein lies the refutation of your dismissal of the conflict between the SEP and the ISO as ""some bizarre blood feud"". In practice, the perspective of the ISO means defence of the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy when the working class is coming into conflict with these forces...The differences between the ISO and the SEP hinge on all of the fundamental questions facing the working class. eg. Should developing struggles be subordinate to the Democrats, or should workers make a political break? Internationalism vs nationalism? etc.

You're claim that the Democrats are a lesser-evil is absurd. Obama carried out the surge in Afghanistan, has made assassination a semi-official government policy, and has launched an illegal war against Libya. Domestically, he supports the handing of billions to the banks, and paying it back through massive spending cuts...

The international developments don't rate a mention. Like the ISO, your gaze is limited to events within the US. Again, not one of your posts has addressed the question of internationalism. Have you read any Marx, Lenin or Trotsky? For all of them, internationalism was the decisive question...It is more relevant today than ever, under conditions of an integrated global economy and politics. Look at the upheavals in the middle-east. They developed across national boundaries. Every national tendency has objectively created a barrier to the unification of the working class across the middle east. The ISO co-thinkers, the Revolutionary Socialists in Egypt, aren't calling for a united struggle of the working class for socialism. They're calling for a popular front including El-Baradei, and the Muslim Brotherhood.

As for talk of sectarianism...Have you read any Trotsky?

travel,"Wander through my blog and you may get some ideas. Just a few basic tips.


1. Travel light. Luggage can get very heavy when you have to carry it all any sort of distance by foot. Don't end up looking like a large backpack with a small, very weary person attached.


2. Don't over-plan, but do plan the critical bits. Things like visa requirements (my lot in Oz can be very strict, especially if you intend to work here, countries like Russia and India can be a pain or expensive or take a long time for visas - so check in advance), the first hotel/hostel on arrival off a plane or train, how much cash you will need for basics in each different new currency etc.


3. Do the research on local mores (what to wear in mosques, what may cause offence in public etc) and laws (don't litter in Singapore, don't kiss in Dubai and so on) when festivals occur (don't wear good clothes on Holi in India) and things like public transport systems and their fares, sites to see, things to do, places to go. 


4. It sounds like you want flexibility. I've used One World rtw tickets twice and their Global Explorer ticket once. On other trips I've used discount fares found on the web from various airlines, most recently AirAsia to get from Oz to Europe via India return for under $1000. The major rtw tickets all require travel within twelve months; that may limit you. You may be better off looking for the discount tickets within a month or two of needing them, using sites like www.kayak.com and skyscanner.net or www.travelzoo.com to find the best deals. I use those to find them, then go to the source to book.


That's enough to start with, this is getting too long :)

As a society gets more advanced and it is up to unique individuals to do specific jobs (in order to accomplish things not possible by a poorly organized group) time management becomes a necessity.

When you have NOTHING to accomplish (and this could be in any society where employment is low, poverty high, etc. - race is a non-issue in terms of it being a factor), WHEN you do something is mostly pointless. As long as it gets done some time, you're good. Why? Because it's not like you have anything else that needs to be done.

So if you look at any advanced society where the output of an economy/organization/etc. is expected to be a lot, you're going to have to enforce proper scheduling.

I guarantee you that in China, South Korea and Japan where Whites are the minority, you'll see almost everyone be very concerned with being on time. If you jump over to Africa, poor Asian countries and even poor European countries, I'd bet you'd see the opposite.

But the issue isn't as simple as you make it to be, the Israelis aren't the mindless monsters you portray them to be, they didn't just land in Palestine and promptly start stealing land. Some bought their property and other Jews that already lived in Palestine (Palestine was around 1/3 - 2/3 Arab - Jew before the European exodus to the land using Jerusalem as an example) simply expanded in more places *legally*. Not all of it was stealing though of course stealing happened, of course *settlers* happened, but it's not just that. Some of it was legit and the state of Israel should not be blamed on the Jewish Palestinians and the European Jews but also the British Mandate for Palestine and other agreements which were lead by appalling officials who were clearly biased both [Balfour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917#Conflicts_and_broken_treaty_commitments_.28contradictory_assurances.29) and [Faisal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann_Agreement#Background) both.

australia,"1.  Most European immigrants in the 50s and 60s certainly did come with families.  Some didn't.  Many Vietnamese immigrants in the 70s and 80s were alone and traumatised by war.  These people usually did not ""assimilate quite quickly"".  Australia was a foreign country to them, Australians were largely ambivalent or openly hostile to their presence and, in the case of post-war European immigration, government benefits were almost non-existent.  Ethnic Australians are not ""classically Australian"", and Australia benefits from this.  Hard work on their parts kept their cultures alive in a foreign land.  More, their cultures *became essential parts* of the Australian meta-culture we have now.  Their persistence changed Australia for the better.

2.  Aboriginal Australia is made up of around 700,000 individuals, spread thinly over Australia and representing dozens of distinct cultures.  It is possible the density of involved people is too low to maintain these cultures as vital and living.  One of the worst results of the white guilt machine is expecting black Australians to live Aboriginal lives - it's an appalling and destructive type of racism.  People are not museums.  A baby born today has no moral obligation to carry the weight of its forebears on its shoulders.  I have no tie to any ancient European culture, so why should someone be expected to carry on a dying culture just because of the colour of their skin?  This whole debate is perpetuated by racists on both sides, and sane people can't get a word in edgeways.

3.  An Aboriginal baby born today has no grievances to get over.  A white baby born of sixth generation Australians has no guilt to suffer.  An immigrant arriving on our shores has nothing to feel guilty about.  Shit happens.  Wars destroy lives and whole cultures, but the people and cultures that survive manage to go on.  Talk to Cambodians about Pol Pot.  To Jews about the Third Reich.  Go back far enough, talk to anyone from anywhere, and you'll get grievances that people somehow just manage to put aside so that life can be lived.

&gt;rational approach based on mutual respect and civility

Which is what is entirely lacking from the racists who want to maintain black Australia as a museum of past wrongs.  A black child born today should have the opportunity to be a citizen of the world, should be able to learn and appreciate how 3000+ years of civilisation has transformed the world into what it is today, to be able to maintain their culture as a component of their lives, just like any ethnic minority does, rather than being forced to be the living embodiment of a slowly dying culture.

Paleo,"A few points:

* Its hard to know how much meat was eaten in relation to plant, because evidence of plant intake typically leaves little trace.
* As you pointed out diets were likely not uniform within the paleolithic.
* You may be interested in the practices of modern hunter-gatherers, as a sort of peek into what paleolithic diets may have been like. [here](http://flare8.net/health/doku.php/healthy_societies_diets#modern_hunter-gatherers) and [here](http://flare8.net/health/doku.php/healthy_societies_diets#lean_meat) (as well as a few other sections on that page) are a few resources on that.

The observed increase in brain size through time in the Homo line requires consumption of animal products. Tools from the paleolithic were clearly used for hunting and butchering of animals 1). Isotope values of humans from 13,000 years ago show the main source of protein as animal based, most likely herbivore flesh. A study of 25,000 year old humans indicated high animal protein diets, including aquatic foods. Mesolithic humans indicate a majority of protein from freshwater fish, supported by archaeological evidence of fishing equipment and large numbers of fish bones. Late mesolithic European isotope studies show significant use of marine foods, with some regions having marine fish as the main protein source 2). “easily available foods of high nutritional value, such as large herd animals and migratory fish” were concluded as the primary focus of upper paleolithic diets here 3). Large herbivores seem to have been regularly hunted by humans 4). 

Neanderthals (close relatives of humans) were definitely “top level carnivores”, consistently hunting large herbivores 8) 9). Little evidence of small game such as birds or fish 10). 

sources @ [here](http://flare8.net/health/doku.php/healthy_societies_diets#paleolithic)

Note: Genetic evidence suggests humans underwent dietary selection pressures for starchy foods. 5) 6). Human salivary amylase protein (responsible for starch digestion) levels are 6 to 8 times higher in humans than in chimpanzees 7). this suggests to me that a non-all meat diet must have been a factor for humanity at some point in time.",3,t3_idvrt,t5_2qzzs,3,t1_c234xs6,t3_idvrt,,True,False,1427306267,False,0,,c234xs6,flare8,0,,0,1309573438

This law went into effect in the 80's, so nobody knows what will happen when the first homes lose their property rights, but we'll see how the government handles it in a few years.

Saying China is Communist is like saying Europe is Communist. China touts the beliefs and principles of Communism, but outside of the typical despotism found in most ""Communist"" countries there is little to actually make it Communist. I dare say there never has been a truly Communist country, since a Communist country would be one without a leading party. Average Chinese people know as much about the principles their country is founded on as the average American is familiar with the ideals of America's formation.

socialism,"[part1]

&gt; Does that mean that socialists should refrain from exposing the real character of

the Democrats, and promote illusions in them, a la the ISO?

I didn't say that they should.

&gt; Frankly, this is the rationale of political cowardice that pervades the pseudo-left. If that position had been accepted at various points in history, the socialist movement would not exist today. After all, Marx carried out his work as a poor, and largely unknown emigre, with a limited following for most of his life.

From Marx's Communist Manifesto:

&gt; In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?

&gt; The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.

&gt; They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.

&gt; They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

&gt; The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only:

&gt; 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality.

&gt; 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

- [Chapter 2](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm)

&gt; The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats(1) against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.

&gt; In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.

&gt; In Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.

&gt; In Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.

&gt; But they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.

- [Chapter 4](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm)

That seems to pretty clearly show that Marx was straightforward that there's no problem with working tactically with other progressive forces, while being completely open, honest, and straightforward about the differences with those other forces and prepared to struggle against them as soon as the opportunity to do so is available.

&gt; Lenin and Trotsky and the other internationalists were amongst the most isolated people in all of Europe in 1914, when they stood against the capitulation of social-democracy to the ""patriotic war"". Within four years, Lenin and Trotsky were leading a revolutionary government...Should they have capitulated to the war propaganda in 1914? After all, the majority of working people supported the war.

How you got that from anything I said, I don't know.

socialism,"[part 4]

&gt; The task of socialists is to politically clarify the working class - to dispel illusions in every nationalist tendency of the ruling elite. This is not going to result in immediate popularity - but it points the only way forward for the working class.

I absolutely agree. But then while we're on that subject: why, then has the WSWS whitewashed or made excuses for reactionary nationalist regimes like Iran, Syria, and Libya? Why has it vilified opposition movements in those countries, and slandered them as middle-class, bourgeois or puppets of imperialism? That's the same position of Stalinists and Maoists - to claim that some struggle against ""imperialism"" supersedes struggles for democracy or even socialism, and that nationalist regimes, even overtly right-wing nationalist regimes, somehow deserve to be defended as guarantors of national independence against imperialism.

To be fair, in Libya, the WSWS initially was [supportive of the popular revolt](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/feb2011/pers-f23.shtml):

&gt; The desperate attempt by the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to drown the uprising of the Libyan masses in blood constitutes yet another brutal and tragic proof of the bankruptcy of Arab nationalism. It has once again laid bare the inability of any section of the Arab bourgeoisie to realize the aspirations of the masses of the region for genuine liberation from imperialist domination and capitalist oppression.

&gt; Gaddafi’s evolution over his four-decade-long rule of Libya saw his transformation from the leader of an anti-colonial movement with mass popular support into a butcher of his own people. This did not develop overnight.

... [before deciding to diminish criticism of Gadhafi or support for the revolt as soon as the NATO intervention began](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/jul2011/pers-j01.shtml):

&gt; During this period, Gaddafi was signing major oil deals with US and European corporations. Then, for reasons that have never been clearly explained but are clearly bound up with the geostrategic interests of the European powers and the US, a decision was made to topple the Gaddafi regime and install a government that was even more beholden to the interests of imperialism. Maybe they think Gaddafi is the ""lesser evil.""

&gt; After first attempting to remove the government through support for the ""rebels"" in the east and west, the US and NATO are now adopting a more direct method.

Before you completely misrepresent my position, *there's every good reason to oppose the NATO attacks on Libya*, but *this should not lead to some sort of whitewashing of the Libyan nationalist regime* and attempts to depict what the *SEP itself* initially recognized as a mass revolt to merely an imperialist conspiracy.

&gt; This answers your question about whether the SEP provides an alternative...Yes, it is the only party fighting to build a mass socialist movement of the working class against the Democrats, the Republicans and independent of the thoroughly corporatised unions, as part of an international movement. Above, you seemed to suggest that there was absolutely no alternative to the ISO's perspective of complete integration into the union bureaucracy, and slavish support for the Democrats...If you think that, they frankly, you're no socialist...

I didn't at all say there's no alternative. I said that it's incumbent upon you to demonstrate an actual alternative by actually doing it, and showing that alternative strategies can be successful in the real world.

&gt; The SEP alternative has been tested in practice - it has organised an independent movement of working people in Detroit against the policy of utility shutoffs being carried out by DTE, with the support of Bing. The ISO would never do something like that - after all, it would involve a break with the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy. Moreover, the fact that these policies are being carried out in Detroit by a black mayor, a black, Democratic bureaucracy etc. completely refutes the perspective of identity politics which the ISO promotes...

&gt; The SEP intervened in Wisconsin calling for a political general strike, the removal of Walker, and a break with the Democrats. When the SEP called for this perspective, the ISO yelled out ""no, no""...Pretty revealing? And herein lies the refutation of your dismissal of the conflict between the SEP and the ISO as ""some bizarre blood feud"". In practice, the perspective of the ISO means defence of the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy when the working class is coming into conflict with these forces...The differences between the ISO and the SEP hinge on all of the fundamental questions facing the working class. eg. Should developing struggles be subordinate to the Democrats, or should workers make a political break? Internationalism vs nationalism? etc.

The problem is that the effectiveness of a strategy is based on whether it actually works, whether it actually produces results. I agree that the ISO's strategy is a failure. I'm just adding that the SEP's strategy is also a failure. If the SEP's strategy is effective - then why didn't it succeed in actually bringing about a general strike and the removal of Walker? Why didn't it succeed in winning the workers in Wisconsin over to this position? If the SEP has, for so long, repeatedly been ineffective at actually gaining mass support among workers workers and successfully organizing them in a successful struggle, doesn't that say something about their strategy? Even the utility shutoff thing - while it's commendable to take up that issue, it's also one that doesn't involve actually organizing workers in the workplace, engaging in strike actions, etc.

&gt; You're claim that the Democrats are a lesser-evil is absurd. Obama carried out the surge in Afghanistan, has made assassination a semi-official government policy, and has launched an illegal war against Libya. Domestically, he supports the handing of billions to the banks, and paying it back through massive spending cuts...

As I stated a million times already, I am not claiming that the actual objective policies of the Democrats are generally in any way significantly different than the Republicans. What I did say was:

&gt; To the extent people are disillusioned with the Democrats, and who isn't, **they either regard them as a lesser evil, or go over to the Republicans and their far-right-wing ideology.** Unless you offer some substitute for defending the immediate material interests of the working class, you're just pissing in the wind.

I was not endorsing the view of the Democrats as a lesser-evil. I was describing the observation that many people in general, including much of the working-class, still regard the Democrats as a lesser-evil. I don't know how many times I have to restate this before you people will learn basic reading comprehension.

This is a really difficult idea if there is still going to be a minimum salary.  Right now the minimum salary is anywhere from ~$500k to $1.1 mil.  If you're paying a guy 25 mil, you're leaving 20 mil for everyone else, and just filling out your roster with minimum wage guys (average $700k) puts you at $12.3 mil left (and rookies are going to have higher salaries).  I mean, you're not getting teams with multiple good players at that point.  OKC can't keep Durant, Serge, Westbrook and Harden in that scenario, Chicago's not getting Noah, Rose and Boozer on the same team.  The Lakers...would not have won a single title in the Kobe era (Shaq would have been worth 30 mil _himself_ in a league like that).

In that scenarios, the difference between teams that are winning titles and everyone else really boils down to luck of the draft and how many rookie contracts you can get around that one guy.  You couldn't build a team at all.

funny,"Technology is not inherently good or evil. It's being used to produce a lot of waste, but we're barely starting to get a grip of it (at least the more advanced stuff). Our dependence on oil is a huge shame, but a few countries in Northern Europe are now running on over 50% renewable energy (Iceland at 100%). Technology is increasingly efficient, meaning that more powerful computers use as much energy as older computers, except they can do a lot more calculations for the same amount of energy. Nanotechnology and genetic engineering will make some things possible we haven't even dreamed about.

Technology is not a Frankenstein monster that is growing out of control; it's simply an extension of humanity, and as technology develops, it will gain the same humanity that we cherish so much. After all, we make technology, so we can decide what forms it take. It's very much part of us, and seeing it as totally disconnected from us is misleading, in my opinion. Anything that's 'new' is automatically feared by a lot of people, only because it's new. When people start to understand a new technology, they warm up to it and get used to it. People were once against motorized cars, the Waltz, and chess. Seriously.

I understand why some people are pessimistic about technology (or like you said, potentially in denial); it's really easy to dream up of a ton of worst-case scenarios for how technology will kill us all (The Matrix, Terminator, LHC-made black holes, etc.). However, most of those scenarios are most probably not going to happen, and you can just as easily dream up best-case scenarios were everyone lives for as long as they want, illness is history, poverty doesn't exist, everyone is united and cooperate to achieve great things, etc. Realistically, it'll probably be somewhere in the middle.

Look at it this way: on average, over long periods of time, poverty has been decreasing, life expectancy has been increasing, illnesses are easier to fight as time goes by, the amount of information is always increasing and becoming more accessible to first, second and third world citizens... no matter how you slice it, things are getting better and there's no reason for it to stop. You can be scared that it might stop getting better, but whether your fear is founded or not is another story altogether.

The maximum capacity for the earth is about 10 billion people, with current technology, assuming we can get rid of inequality, which I strongly believe we can (if we try). Energy will be cheap as hell in the future, when solar panels can be printed at home, backed up by clean, safe nuclear power, wind power, geothermal power, etc. With the right technology, in the long run, humanity will be able to spread to other planets.

The only real obstacle to all of this is global warming, but I think human ingenuity will be able to overcome whatever problems nature throws at us without too many casualties. Overpopulation is a big problem too, but we'll eventually wise up and control population growth when it becomes an 'in your face' problem. And as for terrorist acts or nuclear disasters, yes there are a few violent groups in the world and a few terrorist states left, but free unbiased information will make it very difficult for people to be oppressed, and less poverty means less reason to suicide bomb people. Never forget that there's a huge culture of fear in some countries, and people are trained to be scared about life. Don't listen to that bullshit, it's propaganda to keep people under control, the same way religion used hell to shut people up.

It's not even a matter of being optimistic or pessimistic. You just look at historical trends, where we are and how far we've come, and you extrapolate to the next 10, 20 or 50 years... life expectancy increases, poverty decreases, technology increases exponentially, energy becomes cheaper and cleaner, etc.

And lastly, and this one is a little 'out there' so feel free to disregard the argument, but there's no such thing as free will. What that means is that the idea of separate human beings acting separately is misleading. We're part of the same fabric, acting upon the same needs and desires, ultimately towards the same goal and as cells eventually unite to form life, we're bound to unite to form something else. It's almost inevitable. There's a lot of in-fighting right now, but if we gain focus as a specie, we can do a lot of really neat stuff.

I used to look at world events and be completely discouraged (and depressed), with no faith in humanity at all. But there are undeniable trends pointing towards great achievements, and the absence of free will is a good thing, since it means there can't be inherently evil people that would purposely want to derail humanity. There are assholes here and there, but they do it for personal gain, it's human nature, nothing we can't handle.

AskReddit,"I cringed when I read ""advanced culture"" - saying so denotes that one culture is somehow better than the other and I take Jared Diamond's view in ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" that no culture is inherently better or more advanced, rather cultural creativity is just expressed differently.  

Race (skin color) has nothing to do with how a culture will act.  It just so happens that whites/Europeans due to numerous factors (read Diamond's book) had an upperhand in promoting their cultural values – this is what we call The West.  The emergence of the Enlightenment in a ""white"" Europe gave rise to the importance of the 'individual' (and I’m condensing a lot of history here) and this resulted in what I believe is a culture that has to always be ‘on the clock’ – “my individual freedom is hindered by your always being late”.  

This is in sharp contrast to how most of the world lives (which just so happen to be mostly people of color) which is communally.    You always think of yourself in the context of your family – to be an individual is second.  This type of cultural value (the family and yourself as one single unit) I think breeds a way of life where time is not so much of the essence.  You take stock of th finer things in life: laughter, communion, and just being in the moment – time isn’t of the essence because you measure your life differently.  

Just travel and see how the different cultures of the world operate – I guarantee you, the historically “white” influenced countries (United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, etc.) will feel more rushed and individualistic and most other countries will have a culture that is much more relaxed and people generally aren’t staring at their watches.

Christianity,"I'm not going to be comprehensive in my reply so I apologise in advance.

&gt; I must ask first, what is your educational background? Do you have a university degree in Philosophy? Advanced degree? I need to know this for a discussion to proceed in a rational manner (on my side).

I have a Bachelor in Theology and I'm currently studying an MA in modern history, my thesis is on Sir Francis Galton and late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century psychiatry, bio-physiology, genetics, biostatistics, eugenics, Darwinism(s) and theories on racial, moral and national degeneration in Britain. 

&gt; Again, it is not ""all about you."" While you, or I, don't want to touch them with a 10-foot pole, it is not about that. It is about whether they touch you with a 10-foot pole. And that is not even accurate. They want to beat everyone over the head with a 10-foot pole, metaphorically and literally.

I'll grant that they're idiots who meddle in things they most certainly shouldn't be meddling in. But my point is exactly this. ""it's not all about me"" and ""it's not all about you"". For millennia religious fundamentalism has not existed, religious fanaticism has not existed, and religious pluralism has been shown to be a functional socio-political reality. To suggest that contemporary fundamentalists are an issue is one thing, but to limit all possible discussions on religion to this particular post-modern phenomenon is quite another. Religion functions alongside modernism and alongside the scientific revolution in many places in the world, in Continental Europe, for example, religion is not understood of as antagonistic to science at all, nor is it in Australia-New Zealand. When I talk to my Japanese partner about religious pluralism and religious exclusivism she tells me that in her culture there is no concept of any religion being ""wrong"", religions are quite simply not given this sort of category. This is the experience of very many people all around the world and these experiences are being discounted purely because New Atheism is a Western phenomenon which defines itself almost entirely contra the fundamentalist religious right. 

&gt; Fine. Theothanatology. Great. Got it. So what? How does this effect the starving in Africa. Just simply explain that to me. Other than you want an intellectual/academic discussion, because as you've implied multiple times in this post, it's ""all about you."" You want you, and damn the starving (hyperbole).

That's all well and good, fuck knowledge, fuck everything, let's just feed the hungry and clothe the naked. So why pursue theoretical physics, biology, any sort of studies at all when there's always going to be someone in your direct line of sight begging on the street corner? Contemporary theologies, following Levinas (in the Continental tradition) are significantly centred on the ""face of the Other"", and understand God as incarnate in this ""Other"" in the infinite responsibility people experience when confronted with suffering. I know that atheists like yourself dismiss theologically motivated acts of love purely because of the theological motivation, it is still something that's very deep in our tradition and something which we believe centrally. This is incarnate in the revolutionary politics of liberation theology in Latin America.

&gt; Amost the entirety of theology specifically states creation of the universe, at a minimum. This brings a god into the realm of naturalistic phenomenon.

Ugh, no. Christian theology is centred on Christ. It states that in Christ God is most revealed, and specifically, in Christ's crucifixion, the crucifixion of a social outcast, a revolutionary, an anti-hero, God is incarnate. There have been very intricate theologies developed from this which make due of the revolutionary nature of Christianity, Moltmann and Pannenberg come to mind, as does Bonhoeffer. The Catholic tradition is no less confronted by this, Marion and Caputo come to mind here. 

I'd further point out that if your care is so fixated almost singularly on the state of the impoverished and suffering, the ethical principle should far outweigh the motivational principle behind it. Shouldn't it? Just because you disagree with liberation theology, or with the principle of love in the wider Christian traditions, in favour of purely helping the suffering for their own merits, you're discouraging Christians from believing in their governing principles doesn't make sense. It is almost as hypocritical as Christians who *only* help people out of duty for their religion rather than out of duty for the immediacy of those suffering. :-P",1,t1_c235jol,t5_2qh6c,1,t1_c235q36,t3_id95k,Roman Catholic,True,False,1427306643,False,0,roca,c235q36,allanpopa,0,,0,1309583298

australia,"&gt; The point of the carbon tax is to reduce emissions.

The end goal is to reduce emissions and this is accomplished by restructuring the economy from high carbon dependence to a low carbon emission economy.

&gt; companies will simply outsource the work to countries where carbon taxes aren't applied.

Outsourcing isn't magic, there are costs and limitations associated with doing it (we wont be importing electricity/bread/milk from Asia, etc). There are also ways to mitigate this (tariffs, etc). Interestingly enough Qantas is already getting slugged when flying into Europe because Australia does not have a price on carbon.

&gt; Secondly, the revenue created the tax is 'suppose' to be used in off setting the emissions.

Not necessarily. This is true in an emissions trading scheme, which the carbon tax will evolve into. For the carbon tax it is likely that consumers will get the bulk of the money in their pockets through tax breaks. (Although Labor hasn't confined this, it is likely to be the case) This way if you bought product A before and after the introduction of the carbon tax, you would be slightly worse off. On the other hand, a lower carbon option may exist and you would end up being better off.

* Rosen's structural language (for classical music)

atheism,"Many of his points are misguided. So let's get that out of the way. But you asked a specific question, so I'll answer that specific question.

**r/atheism is a non-representative sample of atheists.** r/atheism is populated by people who feel strongly on the matter, and who have given the matter a greater-than-usual amount of consideration. Most of the people in the world who could be classified as non-theistic fall into one of two categories: those who are largely apathetic, or who have not been exposed to much religion (we'll call these ""European atheists""), and those who have actively rejected a religion, in a reactive way, rather than in a proactive knowledge-seeking way (we'll call these ""American atheists"").

For the latter type (“American atheists”), discourse with them will often reveal that they don’t believe in a specific god more strongly than they don’t believe in any gods. You may find an *active* rejection of the god of the Bible, say, but more of a *passive* disbelief in all other gods. This speaks to their lack of scientific and philosophical curiosity and energy, and to the experiences they had with a specific religious upbringing or culture.

And I’m fine with that. It takes all types. Not everyone is energized by abstract metaphysical and philosophical questions, and that a person without those interests would still settle on a non-theistic position is about as good an outcome as we can hope for. I might wish for a world where the vast majority actively rejects non-scientific and superstitious beliefs, but I’ll absolutely settle for a world where the vast majority eschews them either by default, or rejects one particular superstition actively, and is apathetic about the rest of them.",3,t3_iek9u,t5_2qh2p,3,t1_c23650d,t3_iek9u,,True,False,1427306840,False,0,,c23650d,markjaquith,0,,0,1309589263

AskReddit,"Jews were the first 'upper/middle class'. After that whole stint with Moses in Egypt, they grew into having the most literate demographic in the middle east/europe. Because of this, they controlled a lot of the industry we take for granted today. Bills, books, banking, even just teaching others literacy. This placed them in a superior light to everyone else, and even in feudal europe, where peasants and knights and lords and kings ruled, Jews were able to move and earn money more freely than anyone else. They never really had the responsibility for an area or township, but they controlled it nonetheless through lending and contracts.

When you're a lower class, a peasant that works a farm for a knight who gives what you make to a lord to keep the king from coming down and taking all of what you have, it is very easy to be jealous/wary of a person that is treated like the lord of the land, or has more wealth than him, yet answers to no one.

If you're in the upper class, the kings and lords and knights, and have no choice but to let someone conduct what business they want in your area, it is very demeaning since you're supposed to be the one in charge.

tl;dr: Jews were the first 'hero class' that separated themselves from everyone out there. If an englishman moved to france, eventually he would become french. If a turk moved to egypt, eventually he'd be an egyptian.

Actually in countries that have free speech and free conscious laws your right to be as much of an asshole is very well protected. I mean look at you, you’re at the top of the asshole game and nobody has come to arrest you. 

&gt;No, it’s just that bullshit is so entrenched in general human culture, it crops-up in the unlikeliest places.

Yes, how unlikely that a significant element of Western Culture be examined to places of learning. Silly. 

&gt;It’s all based around the religion; remove the religion and what’s left? Culture is very much shaped around geography. Jews have lived all over the place. 

Yes, Jews were/are a largely diasporic people. As are people like the Armenians. And like the Armenians and Armenian orthodox Christianity, Jews are a nation with religion as a fundamental core. Are you denying that the Armenians are a nation, or that they have a culture. Capiche?  

&gt;Other than some common cores, there has to be a lot of differing stuff

Yes common cores, that’s what makes a people. Good job.

&gt;russian jews who had to deal with a harsher winter than North Africa’s certainly have a different culture than morrocan jews. 

Yes, blame it on the weather. Clever boy. 

&gt;And guess what? They’re sufficiently different to have a big hatred between the two…

Says some kid on the internet that openly displays and professes his ignorance about the Jewish people. Actually, marriage between Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews is huge in Israel. A lot of mocha colored babies. 

&gt;Not at all. France dumped it’s scatholicism (please; it’s an utter piece of shit) 200 years ago. We did 50 years ago, and without those chains, the french culture has soared since.

Yes, France is one country. Have a look at countries to the south; Spain, Italy, Greece. Europe is a big place, you know? But again, you aren’t being clear. Who is we? 

&gt;Aaaaahhhhh! Now he claims that atheism is bullshit; therefore you’re religious. A religious guy who doesn’t follow his religion (can’t blame you; bacon is so good — and you have to like it since you’re on Reddit), a guy who picks and choose what he does… Rabbi Rosenblumenthalovitcheinstein must be really jittery when he sees you on the street; he probably even changes sidewalk and peers more intently in his portable edition of the torah!!!

Did I actually say atheism is bullshit? Nope. Being an atheist is fine. Having doubts that there is anything supernatural is entirely natural. But what isn’t ok is attacking people because they have different beliefs than you do. That’s what you do. That’s why you’re a bigot. 

I’m by no means religious, I don’t know that there is a god. But the fact that you jump to that conclusion because I call you a douchey atheist is hilarious. I just honor my roots. That’s what people who value tradition do. I hope that being a douchey atheist isn’t a tradition in your family, but if it is then you must be doing your ancestors proud. 

&gt;My dear friend, I went to the same school that Charles André-Marie DeGaulle went to. 

Oooo, now whose being all snobby, monsieur elitist? 

&gt;You know, the guy who said that jews were “an elite people, sure of themselves and dominating”…

Ahhh, oui…France…the country that enslaved half a continent and then raped its people’s land for its natural resources. Not elitist, self-serving or domineering at all. All without the help of religion. What a good example you set…

&gt;So why do you bother with me, then? You think you gonna convert me and make me stop worrying and love the jews, mr Strangelove???

I bother with you because you should no that you’re wrong, that what you say is stupid and in case someone reads this thread I want them to see how full of shit you are. I don’t want or care to “convert” you. What is there to convert?

&gt;Yes, those who drank your kool-aid…

Son, if what they’re drinking is kool-aid then what you’re sipping on PCP.

&gt;Yeah, whatever.

So you agree. Splendid. 

&gt;Well, I’m sure that John-Paul II is right there, even though he had far more than 3 pork chops throughout his life…

You can probably go there too, if you tone down the douchiness. 

&gt;Well, they surely didn’t want to be stuck with all those jewish refugees from Germany…

Yep, which is why most of them came to Israel. Yay!!!

&gt;And there is the fact that jews have a lot of money, and money matters a lot in elections, so he’s not beyond licking some jewish arse. 

Yes, yes. The Joo haz teh money…

&gt;In any case, he’s poised to bring chaos to the country, a bit like your Nethanyau (sp?) does, which is the modus operandi of right wingnuts.

Chaos, in Canada? LOL.

&gt;So, that gave the “severely traumatized” jews a blank cheque to severely traumatize palestinians?

Nice strawman. You know you’re wrong.

&gt;Experts? They just followed the typical antisemite (that was back then when that word had it’s true meaning) policies of their respective governments. It takes a real expert to follow the rules…

Or they realized, because they’re smarter than you, that Germany, Poland etc. etc. weren’t places for Jews to continue living. I’ll stick with their opinion.

&gt;Religion is bad; that’s what brought about the shoah. Their religion told the jews to be assholes, and their religion told everyone else to hate jews. Without religion, none of this would have happenned.

Wow, that Super De Gaulle Athiest Hogwartz school really did fail you. Religion, not the Racial Darwanism of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, brought about the Death of 6 million Jews? 

Are you seriously not aware that the type of anti-Semitism the Nazis espoused was genetic, not theological? Guess not. Hitler didn’t hate Jews because they believed what was written in  the Torah or because he thought they were responsible for the death of Jesus. He was an extreme Eugenicist and saw genetics as what makes people inferior or superior. Or, as you might call it, asshole or atheist.

By the way, religion doesn’t tell people to be assholes. If that’s the case you must be the fucking Pope of assholes. 

&gt;Who cares what a zionist laughs at?

Apparently, people like yourself who are happy to be ignorant and stupid. 

&gt;Unwritten laws are the most powerful

Do you purposefully miss the point all the time?

&gt;Yeah, when they learn to bow and kiss their zionist masters’ arse???

When they care more about building their future than fighting Israel. Don’t get me wrong though, Israel needs to do its part to make peace happen.

&gt;And that’s much better than bringing to the world litters upon litters of babies that will indocrtinated in the goddammed fucking religion of the (self-)chosen people.

I agree, and I'm very vigilant against pervs and gawkers at the beaches I frequent.  I have escorted many individuals off the beach who were acting inappropriately.  This is why dedicated beaches and resorts are so great, as they offer protection among a like minded group.  That said, sexual objectification will always exist.  Women no longer hide their ankles from photographs, and I think that the top freedom movement will have to take the same approach.  They must be courageous and exercise their topfree rights until the body part is so common place it's no longer an issue; they must demand respect.

politics,"The public housing you refer to were attempts at 'slum clearance' insisted upon by private builders so that the land could be taken and newer more expensive real estate could be developed. It was the rich who lobbied government to warehouse the poor like animals, that is the Rand reality. 

You didn't mention rent controlled housing. A very successful program which has allowed countless numbers of middle-class families to rent and live in areas that would otherwise be priced out of their reach.

The space program was designed as a military program to compete with the Russians. Safety was not as big a concern as winning the space race. The actual number of US astronauts killed is about 4%, which is much, much lower than the number of fatalities seen in the early days of aviation.

The federal agency, and regulations you speak of are controlled by the lobbyists from large pharmaceutical companies. The regulations and testing are designed to cost so much that small companies with new treatments are hampered from bringing those new drugs and treatments to the market to compete with Big Pharma. Again, just the way Ayn Rand would like to see it done.

The US highway system was built, largely, with the backing of the automakers to make car travel more accessible than public transportation. Europe has many more regulations on road building and thus have a more effective public transportation system.

The 'deregulation' of the phone system hasn't happened yet. I think what you are referring to is the break up of the Bell System, under federal anti-trust laws. The resulting telephone companies have conspired, through lobbying government, to keep the wireless and mobile phone spectrum reserved and exclusive.

AskReddit,"Long story and she's probably reading this comment. I tried to leave a non-romantic relationship with crazy (just crashing on her couch and travelling around Europe, but somehow that became deep love and talk of marriage for her over the course of like two months) and she decided to lock the door and draw a knife on me. I said that she couldn't kill someone with a paring knife and she did the next best thing, stealing my passport and money before locking me in a bedroom for a week. 

I waited until the novelty of being a ""hostage"" wore off, then waited for her to get blackout drunk one evening, broke the handle off the door, grabbed my nice things, and ran out with a vague idea of where the train station was. The train station ended up being 10km or so away and I trekked much of that on foot, finding myself in a spot that you don't want to be if you have red hair and blue eyes because to the gypsies that makes you a vampire demon called a [strigoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigoi). That's where 1 comes in. 

2 came in because I wanted the quickest route to a friend in Germany and that train was leaving before I could buy a ticket, so I hopped on. Got to a border city, hopped another train, the transportation police caught me, solicited a bribe, I told them that I was robbed by gypsies and had no money, and they held me to the tracks until I had money. That money was in the form of a camera which I sold to another passenger, saving my life there.

Ended up getting to Germany and staying with a friend for a night, and in the morning we woke up to banging on the door. I opened it to find Crazy wearing my shirt with the knife in her hand moaning like a wounded deer, said to my friend that this was Crazy (having told her the full story earlier that evening to her amusement), and asked Crazy what she wanted. She took off the shirt, threw it and the knife on the ground, and ran off. Now she downvotes most of the things I post and stalks me from website to website.

Libertarian,"&gt;so more spending in things that aren't as important takes away from keeping schools up equally meaning it causes the problems you are talking about

Absolutely.  Cut the crap.  Slash defense, cut farm subsidies, cut ethanol bullshit.  But, the rest is where we diverge.

&gt;The government can NOT discriminate or give special privilege to ANYONE based in the color of their skin, it's unconstitutional, and no matter what you think it's immoral

This section is the reason I downvoted you (and I say this with due respect): you're kind of talking out of your ass here.  First, the constitutionality of affirmative action has already been taken up to the SCOTUS (*Gratz v. Bollinger* and *Grutter v. Bollinger*).  You can argue that the SCOTUS got it wrong, but the burden is on you to argue why.  I'd suggest first reading those cases in particular, then throw back to *United States v. Carolene Products* for the origin of levels of scrutiny.  It's a complicated issue, but the short version is that it isn't unconstitutional so long as it meets certain requirements.  I'd also suggest reading *Romer v. Evans*.

On the moral side, it's a question of personal conviction.  I find it immoral and beyond contemptible to say ""we don't give a fuck you were born in worse conditions, and that your competitors have been able to succeed largely because of their circumstances.""  For me, to allow extrinsic properties to influence who succeeds or fails is the height of immoral, and insofar as affirmative action exists in order to level the playing field, it is moral.

&gt;If you cared about these kind of issues you'd be a libertarian and focus on the real underline issues

I do care about these issues.  And, in fact, I would be a libertarian if I had any belief that we had a system wherein people can succeed or fail on their own abilities.  But, I'll make you a deal: help me eliminate the ability to leave estates, and help me completely equalize the education system, and I will jump on your bandwagon.  Until then, libertarianism doesn't appeal to me.

&gt;localizing things to make them more efficient and cost less, you'd want less in the federal government because you'd finally realize them taking control of these things will ultimately ruin society.

Ignoring economies of scale, and that different places would have varying levels of fucked-up-ness in their education system (*c.f* states trying to ban the teaching of education).  How do you look at some kid born in backwater Texas ""well, we would force your teachers to teach you the same things you'd learn in Colorado, but you can suck a dick because you made a bad choice about where to be born""?

Also, if you're going to throw down ""you'd realize [the federal government] taking control will ruin society"", please recognize that your own implicit assumptions and ideology form your beliefs.

As I've said before, any argument that relies on ""this is clear to anyone"" should be mistrusted.  If it is that clear, where is the evidence?

woodworking,"The 4 main woods at my local Home Depot, and what I think of them:

**hard maple** - Pretty in a boring kind of way. It's very usefully predictable, so if you're making something and run out of wood, go back to the store and get another board, and it'll match fine. No real smell. Small heartwood (darker central wood) which you usually don't find visible in pieces from a store, though once in awhile I see one and snag it, like [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3807806496/). I like the weird stuff. I sort through it at the store to find the stuff with a figure that'll pop a bit when finished. It can have a kind of holographic look, known as [chatoyance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatoyancy) in the woodworking world. Some finishes will completely kill that effect, like certain oils, while others, like shellac will bring it out in a big way.

**birch** - I have an exceedingly hard time telling this apart from maple very often. I've held pieces of each in my hand and looked them over, and while you can point to differences, you'll end up with 2 more pieces that are different in the opposite way. The best way I've found is smell. Scratch it a bit, or hit it with a saw or plane, and it smells like popsicle sticks, which are made of birch. I find birch to be more brittle and prone to little bits of tearout on the face than the hard maple I've used. I don't tend to reach for birch, though I find some [pretty, figured planks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3179616786/) at the store from time to time, and must buy them.

**red oak**  - This is a true standard in furniture making here in the US, and as such, I've come to find it very boring. It does exactly what you expect (once you know it), and the end product is great. *Boooring* :) It has [huge, visible grain](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3807007853/). The little dark dashes running vertically up the whole board there are [medullary rays](http://www.kareliaparketti.com/karelia-us/pages/hardwood_floor_info/information_on_wood_and_hardwood_floors/medullary_ray_of_oak/), which are like thin, tall veins that run from the center of the tree radially out to just below the bark. If you flat saw - i.e. cut perpendicularly through the rays, and along the ring contours, you see cross sections of the rays. In oak they're huge, but in maple and other woods they're very tiny, or even invisible, or nearly so. If you quarter saw, wherein you're cutting mostly radially from the outside of the tree toward the center, you end up 'filleting' the rays, which in oak really exposes them at their largest dimension, as seen [here](http://nelsonwoodworks.biz/pb/wp_26e0a1ef/images/img11336485ab2f2dc06b.jpg) and [here](http://nelsonwoodworks.biz/pb/wp_26e0a1ef/images/img32417485ac7f9498a1.jpg). From a different angle, they'll reflect differently and appear darker than the wood. They shimmer a bit if the light source moves in relation to them. This wood has a sharp smell, akin to ammonia, but not. I find if I plane it, it stings my eyes like I've been cutting onions. Oh, and compared to many other woods I've used, it's hard as hell. I had been turning green wood on my larger wood lathe for awhile, and switched to [a square 3/4"" thick red oak piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noRNbCjH1Z8), and it was like my tools forgot how to cut wood. Quite a remarkable difference. The coolest piece of red oak I've found so far was a 1x3 with black streaking in it. I used it to make [a lazy susan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157623466176555/with/4419431250/).

**poplar** - I don't mean *real* poplar (*Populus spp.*). I mean the tulip poplar (*Liriodendron tulipifera*) you get from a home center. No real smell. Very even, consistent wood. Hardness somewhere between pine and maple. Almost impossible to get a splinter from. Prone to mineral streaking, as seen in [these pieces](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3222537386/), which I quite like. It can be [quite pronounced](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3610789222/) ([backside](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3610794174/in/photostream/)) in purple, green, tan, and black. I search for those. I used that panel in [some shop cabinet doors](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3627341567/). The frames are a long 1x3 or 1x4 of maple I had to pick up, because it had brown, wormlike tracks running all through it. I still don't know what they are. They appear to be a natural occurrence in the tree, and not fungus or bugs. I still want to go back and relieve the hard lines in those doors a bit. There a tad too spartan for me.

I'll stop there, or I'll end up typing a small book :) I've worked with several other prepared woods, including alder, Mangaris™ (red balau), walnut, pine, cedar, and white oak, and through finding fallen or felled trees all over LA, in a great number of logs of green wood, including modesto ash, paperbark, ficus, weeping bottlebrush, several kinds of eucalyptus, european olive, chinese elm, sweet gum, hollywood juniper, and jacaranda.

I also have a bit of a wood samples collection started with [this 30pc set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157614063265111/with/3292894384/), which was a preselected assortment, and in the last pic there, you can see an additional box I ordered of particular samples I wanted. I'm planning to get all the samples from Woodworker's Source, but in batches of about 10. Having them on hand is like an artist or designer having color or material swatches on hand.

It's great to be able to see the grain, chatoyance, ray fleck, etc., and feel things like how soft, dry, oily, or dense the woods actually feel in real life. Online pics just don't do some of them justice, and you miss out on things like the end grain usually. There were wood pairings I had been considering as good contrasts or compliments of one another that in real life looked bad together, or would clearly be a bad matchup (i.e. a really soft, light wood and a really hard, dense wood that would be a nightmare to turn on the lathe as alternating pieces in a segmented bowl).

For awhile I've been hunting for 4 woods that would give me a nice set from dark to light, but whereas I can simply go for, say, wenge or some kind of ebony for really dark wood, and holly for the lightest wood (it's practically white), they don't at all fit the list of needs for most things. Say I'm making an end grain cutting board. Woods like red oak and wenge are right out, because they have enormous pores in their end grains, which are bacteria traps. Too, they're much too hard, and so are many others, but many woods are too soft as well. You need a board that doesn't hurt knives, and which knives won't quickly destroy. The Board Smith recommends [](http://www.theboardsmith.com/purchase.htm) woods with a [Janka Hardness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test) of 850 to 1600. A great number of woods fall outside of that. I've often heard bad things about exotics (i.e. African and South American jungle hardwoods), because some have somewhat nasty chemistry and oils going on in them. Some exotics that grow in more sandy soils will draw silica particles up all through the wood, and these woods will dull your knives, and the tools you used to make the board. A good example is [this Mangaris™ cutting board](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157624283696223/). It's really just too hard for general use in a kitchen. Many other factors come into play as well in my wish for 4 distinct colors of wood - affordability, availability, non-endangered/protected status, and strong consistency of color from board to board and tree to tree all being pretty high in the list.

Two woods that work fantastically well as cutting boards and anything else you can think of, and have a strong contrast are maple and walnut. They're the classic chess board woods. I made my mother [this maple and walnut heart cutting board](http://lumberjocks.com/projects/25275). She said it was too nice to use, and I said it was probably for the best, because the maple was a softer maple. I made her a simpler [walnut and maple striped cutting board](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157625818387949/), which she reluctantly has been using.

&gt;Hydro is pretty much already tapped out as most suitable dams have already been built.

yes, but mostly a specific kind of Hydro is of interest in the context of energy storage, and most current hydro is not done in that manner:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity

there are ofc other technologies w such purpose.

there's also the issue of transmitting power over large distances to better average out the combined wind+solar variability, possibly a better integrated european grid would be important here, and technologies like HVDC:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVDC

So I don't think an approach largely based on renewables is not possible, just would require significant changes in the way electricity is generated and transmitted, while nuclear fits perfectly to current approach for baseline power.",1,t1_c232yej,t5_2qh4j,1,t1_c236mhj,t3_ie3y9,,True,False,1427307062,False,0,,c236mhj,[deleted],0,,0,1309599414

The game is not set in a fantasy universe though, but in Europe and the Middle East in the years between the Battle of Hastings (1066) and the fall of Constantinople (1453).

You can basically take charge of any noble family at any start date, from Counts to Royalty, arrange marriages, alliances, honor your Lords calls to arms, expand your realm through diplomacy or war, raise your kids, manage your court, create off-shots of your family that the AI controls (think Karstarks), assassinate some pretenders, spread the will of the Lord to heathens, well, you get the idea, the usual feudal day for the Nobles.

Come to think of it, the first one is kind of dated, so just wait for the second one. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Every time I see an episode of GoT or read a bit, or check forums I get the urge and play that game. Then again, I am Paradox Entertainment fanboy, so...

From our point of view, there's a similar development in SPD/CDU/CSU convergence towards the same voter niche as in US Rep/Dems, only shifted to the left. The US does not have any left party, that niche is occupied by the New Left. The Greens are conservative in two domains: first, they want to conserve the ecosystem -- the fraction of high-technology technoprogressives is negligible, secondly, there have been a growing disconnect between the party base and the top (so-called leadership) which will eventually split the party. The top has no issues to form coalitions with either the reds (SPD, but not the New Left) or the blacks (CDU/CSU). Remember that the Greens have been around for over 30 years. They have shed all traces of radicalism and have become established, and trend further towards conservative values.

The SPD meanwhile is shrinking fast, losing the conservatives to the blacks, and the lefties to the New Left, and of course to the massive non-voter block. The neoliberals (FDP) also look quite finished, at least for the moment.

There are whole European countries who have a huge percentage of actually religious people.

Additionally we also have huge problems with religions like Islam in countries like Germany.

In some areas of Germany you have huge Muslim populations who are extremely radical in their beliefs, who aren't interested in debate. Usually the same populations are also lacking in education and have a huge interest in propagating their culture. Tell them god doesn't exist and you will get punched in the face for insulting Allah.

This is the case even in the big cities.

Maybe *you personally* don't see any religious people because you are in contact with only the native people or the educated ones or the elite of your country. Go into the areas of your cities where more than 50% of space is occupied by arabic people and try to have a rational religious debate. 

I also have the feeling that believers in Europe are by far more agressive in their behaviour. In all American rage comics  I see people at least trying to have a debate or at least trying to justify their beliefs. Here in Germany you will get yelled at for hating Islam and called a Nazi for supposedly  trying to eradicate a religious subgroup and then 5 Muslims with broken German will beat you up if you suggest that their God is improbable. ""Was wills du? Glaubst nicht an Gott? Bist wohl dumm, halt mal deine Fresse, ich kill dich gleich, vallah.""

*Edit*: I'll explain my reasoning in some more detail.

There are conflicting rights here. The right to freedom of association (even for large corporations) is the one that you raised. there is also the right to freedom from discrimination on arbitrary criteria  - e.g. that a bar should not stop someone coming in if their skin is the wrong colour.

Now the USA generally sees freedom of association as more important; and Europe generally sees freedom from discrimination as more important. Your values are *not* universal. This case is in Europe, as the phrase ""file a complaint with the E.U. Commission"" makes clear. So your statement that they can do business with whoever they want is basically false in Europe. 

In the case of a bar, you could always find another bar that does like your kind, but when Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal are all shutting you out (and transparently obviously with no real reason other than the US government leaned on them) then you are seriously disadvantaged.

No one sequence alone can predict ancestral origin. However, by looking collectively at hundreds and analyzing the frequency of the various markers, Frudakis says he could predict genetic ancestry with 99 percent accuracy.""

You didnt spout off a bunch of ""your terrible"" or ""you sicken me"" you simply showed a difference of opinion on a subject in an intelligent way.  Congrats :-D

basically, well played you got me to turn off troll mode.

As to the discussion about the feelings of loss as it pertains to degree this is an argument that is such a pain in the ass to deal with because no matter how you slice it humans revel in the pain of others.  Take World War 2, arguably the last ""popular war"" that America has had, there were over 5.5 millions German soldiers killed in the fighting and what did the victorious countries do when their soldiers returned home?  They were celebrated and congratulated for killing the enemy.  They funny thing is after the war for the most part many European countries were in ruin and devastation and millions of people were dead with their families mourning their loss and all we could do is say ""Oh yea!!! We Win!!"" 

Unless it in someway effects you directly with the loss of someone for the most part those ""Tragedies"" are out of sight out of mind within a week of them occurring.  Why?  Because human beings just don't care about anyone or anything that they do not deem as theirs or ""one of their own."" 

I tend to get a little long winded (sorry) so i will rap this up, in conclusion I make off color joke and usually as terrible as my little mind can think of just to upset as many people as I can because every once in a while an interesting discussion will occur just like you said.

Also scholar do not mention the lot of slaves in these societies, nor do they paint a realistic picture of the life of Dhimmis or women in these societies. Compared to today's notions of Human Rights and democracy, those society would be viewed the same way as we view Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Somalia, etc. The expectations we have today towards our fellow human beings and government are so much higher, that the mention of a Caliphate as some sort of Islamic ideal, doesn't sound less scary than the idea of Iran being a ideal islamic society.

racism,"OK, where do I start:
On #1, you state that they were slaves ""regardless of their treatment"". AFRICAN  women, children and MEN were raped, the men in front of the others to send a message. Pregnant AFRICAN women were hung upside down and had there stomachs split open so their babies would spill out, as a message to the others. AFRICAN men had the arms tied to opposite facing horses and were literally ripped apart. I'm not sure where you heard that the ""founding felons"" treated Africans well, but somebody's selling you a dream. There is nothing in world history to compare to the horrors of African enslavement by europeans. It takes a special kind of ignorance to think otherwise.

#6 I won't bother with. If your naive enough to believe that, a few words from me won't help you.

As for #7, with all due respect to yellowmix's comment, Black people do not benefit from slavery. When you are stripped of your heritage, your values are changed. Black people now value principles laid down by europeans, not true African values. So, the fact that some Black people are financially better off than others, they are all morally bankrupt, a product of european domination. No amount of money can change that condition.

#8 - I don't remember saying they were the same. I will say this; ALL european groups discriminate against Black people. That is a fact. As a Black man, I don't have time to pick out the good from the bad. Two snakes look the same, one's poisonous. Do I administer each a DNA test? As a european, you are defending you self and/or your people, so am I.

Frugal,"How to travel cheap in Europe: get a Eurail pass that gives you unlimited train use. Public transportation can take you anywhere in Western Europe, if you're willing to walk a mile or two.

Carry all your stuff in a backpack, and stay in youth hostels (super cheap, and you can't do it above age 25). There are also cheap ""gasthauses"" in Germany. 

Back in the 80s I spent $1200 for six weeks of travel. It'll be more than that now, between inflation and a weaker dollar, plus I was living in Germany so I didn't need a plane ticket. Unless things have changed, southern countries are much cheaper than northern ones...in Portugal I spent seven bucks a day, staying with a Portuguese family. (People gathered at the train station with signs, asking tourists to stay with them. Great experience. They showed me around town, and lived within walking distance of the beach.)

I have no idea what prices are like now, although I did go to London about eight years ago and it was quite a bit more expensive than the U.S. But if you design the trip for economy, you should be able to get by for a fairly small portion of the total, especially if your sister's paying her own way.

Fuck you.  I'm not ""facing the responsibilities"" of some shit that ""my"" government does that in no way represents what I believe or the way I live my life.  *You* may find that to be acceptable, but I don't.  It's in no way ""better"" for the citizens to let their governments run roughshod over people and then just hand up their money to bail that government out like good little slaves.  What is ""better"" about that?

&gt;If American Taxpayers have been fleeced, then the people who need to sort that out are the american taxpayers.

Except that we can't afford to buy our government the way corporations and bankers can.  Our government is fucked and the only possible way to return it to the people is through armed conflict, which the people will never win.

&gt;Icelanders have been fleeced, then Icelanders should do something about it.

It would appear that they are - you just don't like it.

&gt;Well great, but they are delaying their country's recovery...

Letting things return to normal on their own is better than any quick fix.  They will have a more stable economy afterwards.  Quick fixes cause more problems down the road.  Anyone older than the age of 21 should know this by now.

IWantOut,"Funding is a big deal in Europe. One of the reasons I'm looking to Germany for my phd is because the UK will almost never fund US students (eg overseas, non-EU) for their phd. 

The process is a lot quicker and more regimented. In the US, a typical phd program will roll the masters into it and be usually 8 years, since no one ever, ever finishes in the 6 that's predicted. However, you're not really kicked in the rear to get in gear and get your stuff done and get out. In the UK, for example, the phd for physics is 3 years and they basically kick you out after it. 

The tradeoff is that you're not doing slave labor the whole time. In the US, you'll be teaching classes, doing labs, grading homeworks, etc. The phd students in my department don't come anywhere close to doing that. So the funding is about the same and you're doing your own research instead of your advisor's and putting yours on the back burner for later. However, it is shorter and some places may be looking for [x] number of lab experience years before you apply.

Usually, in Europe, you can get a phd then apply and get a post-doc and after a few years have the same level of experience as someone who came from a US grad school slave labor camp. I would imagine that, after spending something like 5-6 years in a foreign country, you may be eligible to apply for citizenship. Depends on the country, though.

(Of the ones that are impossible in the States, you'll have to be sure to visit Germany and do them there.)  Are there German nursery rhymes, or lullabies, or whatever, which you don't know?  Is she doing anything to help you learn them?  Can you find some at Amazon.de, or can her mother send you some?  Also:

Thought 3: a friend of mine is married to a woman from Europe.  They very carefully saved and arranged to spend an entire school year living in her home country, not far from her extended family in an apartment.  He took a year off work, they rented out their large US house as a way to supplement savings, and he got a work visa there.  The kids went to that country's schools for a year, they traveled on school holidays to places she loved to visit when she was growing up, and so on.  They got one of those European RailPass things, and visited Paris, London, Rome, and other such places.

Who are you? A bunch of people who have invented themselves a god that “chose” them over others.

&gt; Did I actually say atheism is bullshit? Nope. Being an atheist is fine. Having doubts that there is anything supernatural is entirely natural. But what isn’t ok is attacking people because they have different beliefs than you do. That’s what you do. That’s why you’re a bigot.

It’s perfectly okay to have different beliefs. Not when they make you behave like an asshole.

&gt; I’m by no means religious, I don’t know that there is a god. But the fact that you jump to that conclusion because I call you a douchey atheist is hilarious. I just honor my roots. 

Roots that makes one act douchy are not honourable.

If you had any shred of honour, you would move out of zionist-occupied Palestine and be a good citizen of wherever you choose to live, a citizen who is not a douchebag asshole. Bonus points for denouncing the zionist occupation of Palestine.

&gt; That’s what people who value tradition do. I hope that being a douchey atheist isn’t a tradition in your family, but if it is then you must be doing your ancestors proud.

My ancestors were following the socially-mandated scatholicism. But in retrospect, hearing what my grandfather said about the priests, I’m pretty sure he’d be proud of me if he was still alive.

France is the beacon of liberty, monsieur. It did not enslave half the continent (the nazis did, however, France included); it merely protected it’s new liberty-based régime against the attacks of the monarchic régimes (who enslaved their countries) who wanted to turn the clock of History back.

Bullshit. More of the shoah card to justify their actions.

&gt; Wow, that Super De Gaulle Athiest Hogwartz school really did fail you. Religion, not the Racial Darwanism of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, brought about the Death of 6 million Jews?

I’m talking about the antisemitism that was rampant, even before the nazis, you putz.

&gt; Are you seriously not aware that the type of anti-Semitism the Nazis espoused was genetic, not theological? Guess not. 

Germany has a very long tradition of bitter antisemitism (I’m using the original meaning of the word here); those thousands of years of antisemitism was rooted in religion. Making it genetic was just a stupid attempt to make it appear “scientific”. Eugenics was fashionable a century ago; heck, even H.G. Wells supported eugenics!!!!

&gt; Hitler didn’t hate Jews because they believed what was written in the Torah or because he thought they were responsible for the death of Jesus. He was an extreme Eugenicist and saw genetics as what makes people inferior or superior. Or, as you might call it, asshole or atheist.

Hitler was just pumping on popular sentiment to get power. Do you really think for a second he would have succeeded if Germany was not profoundly antisemite (original meaning)??? It’s not hitler alone, but most of germany that did it or consented to it.

It only took the unprecedented beating from the Allies to beat the shit of that stupid antisemitism (original meaning) from the germans.

&gt; By the way, religion doesn’t tell people to be assholes. 

Sure it does. It’s the primary cause of assholiness.

&gt; If that’s the case you must be the fucking Pope of assholes.

Look who’s talking: a zionist!!!! Zionists are not the pope of assholes, but the archangels — if not the god!!!

&gt; When they care more about building their future than fighting Israel. Don’t get me wrong though, Israel needs to do its part to make peace happen.

Yes, vanish completely and go back where you came from. But I gather that’s a bit much to ask them douches…

engineering,"Rant on! (said in my johny storm voice)

Good work's different from work. They throw ""engineer"" on basically anything these days. In most European countries being an ""Engineer"" is a very respected career and not easy to do. Not like in America with ""sales engineers"" and ""application engineers"" and ""sink drain cover engineers""... no offense to anyone with these jobs. It's just that in a lot of companies the job ""Engineer"" really means ""Someone with an engineering degree that knows what a volt is"".

 I could never break into real design work. So I've spent the last few years writing test software (but you're designing it!! no it's mind numbing and boring) for a decent company with a shitty supervisor and almost-as-bad manager. With defense budget cuts and general company downsizing it's virtually impossible to make a lateral move into a ""real"" engineering department.

And even then, it's not like you're sitting in a lab experimenting and coming up with cool things. You're not even actually designing something most of the time. Just bored to tears of the paperwork and CDRs and PDRs and other pointless meetings where people argue about complete nonsense. The deadlines set by idiot ""project engineers"" that arbitrarily assign deadlines based on the PDI and SPI and shit that Microsoft Project calculated for them.

Engineering growing up was putting robots together and figuring out how to get rid of the buzz in my amplifier or filter out noise or design systems for an autonomous car in my college projects. Engineering in the real world is, 95% of the time, paperwork and meetings and shit work and jobs that have 0 to do with designing anything of note.

Don't get me wrong. If you only care to get a job paying $60k+ then yea, getting an EE degree is a good idea. If you think you'll be designing the next big thing... well hope you have a lot of free time to do that in your garage lab. Office engineering jobs isn't what I thought it would be.  

But I'm stuck here because I'm getting a free masters degree. Yea can't complain about that. But just means I have to endure a job I don't like for a few more years... And then hopefully find something where I'm somewhat more appreciated and respected. 

A lot of my problems have to do with my company and more specifically the bad managers (this is a common symptom in many offices).

IAmA,"Rich as fuck? Well. It depends. We have this petroleum fund, which means that ALL the profits from our oil industry goes into a fund. Each year, the government in charge can only use a maximum of 4% of the previous year's profits.

That fund is currently at $600 USD billions at the moment, and increases each year because we put more money into, and we invest some of the money in the stock markets around the world.

However, that money is put away for our ""next generation"". We will soon have a ""wave"" of old people coming, and we need that money to pay them their pension.

Also, we could spend parts of that fund to reimburse our banks during the recent financial crisis so that the ""normal"" economy (ie. households, industry etc.) wasn't hurt.

The Norwegian and German economies are quite similar, though. Our biggest advantage, at least at the moment, is that we are not part of the European Union. :)

When it comes to electricity, we have quite a lot of it, but we are a part of a European (or Scandinavian, I'm not 100% sure) ""electricity market"" where we have to sell our electricity based on market prices, which I'm personally against.

This means that when it's cold in Norway, it can be warm in Germany, and Germany will then be able to buy electricity at fixed/cheaper prices, and the prices in Norway goes up.

However, the biggest cities in Norway also draws heat from the underground sewer systems, and the heating in my apartment (built in 2007/08) is based on that (the stoves, lights etc. still relies on good old fashioned electricity, though).

nba,"The NFL does it that way, and it works reasonably well, but there are two reasons:  

*  The highest paid NFL player in 2010 was Payton Manning, who made around 15.8 mil in his contract (with all the incentives, according to Forbes).  The last NFL salary cap was $128 million.  So the top level players are earning at most 11% of the cap.  In the NBA, the highest paid player is Kobe, earning $25 mil, which would be 55% of the cap.  If guys like Kobe and Durant and LeBron continue to make in the $15-25 million range then you can't build a team, its that simple.  The thing is, guys like Kobe, Durant and LeBron _earn_ for the league and their teams, something in the neighborhood of $80-90 million a season (even if they aren't winning titles), so you're not going to get in a situation where their salaries go down in an open market.  Teams are going to be composed of individual stars with a bunch of scrubs and rookies, or its going to be teams with a bunch of middling players.  Think the Kobe-Smush-Kwame Lakers (only without Odom, because he would be worth too much for another team).
All of the teams we've _enjoyed_ watching over the past decade would be impossible:  Nash-Marion-Amare, no way.  Kobe-Gasol-Bynum (not possible).  Ray-Pierce-KG (not possible).  What would likely happen is all these pretty good role players (think Noah, Odom, Marc Gasol, etc.) will go to europe and earn twice what they could get here.  Team success would depend on being lucky (in drafting one of the really dominant players of the era and having other rookie contracts around him while he was young) or on being such a great place to live that you can convince guys to sign for way less money than they are worth.  

*  In the NBA, team success is much, _much_ more dependent on a single player.  There have been _maybe_ 5 really dominant players since Michael Jordan retired:  Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, LeBron and Wade.  In a league where you can't afford to put multiple stars on a single team, the teams that got lucky and drafted those guys would simply win every title.  I mean, _right now_ the only way other teams are able to beat those guys are through assembling arsenals of top-tier talent (the Celtics), overpaying role-players (the Mavericks) or being able to put 8 or 9 _good_ players on the same roster (the Pistons).  A salary cap in the NBA wouldn't bring any more parity, because the reasons we don't have parity in the NBA have _**nothing to do with the salary**_.  The Heat are in a smaller market than the Timberwolves, have never paid the luxury tax, and yet sit in the most enviable position in the league.  The Knicks have constantly paid luxury tax, sit in the biggest market, but because they've never been able to draft a player like Kobe or Shaq or Duncan or Dwight, they've never been able to get to the next level.  Even teams that manage their rosters intelligently (the Trailblazers, the Rockets) can't make the leap without getting lucky in the draft. 

TLDR;  A 45 mil salary cap would do nothing for parity and drive good players to other leagues. ",2,t1_c23635s,t5_2qo4s,2,t1_c237gnb,t3_iece0,Mavs,True,False,1427307456,False,0,Mavs2,c237gnb,RationalUser,0,,0,1309619719

Instead, the motivation for the establishment of a Jewish state had to do with his belief that Jews would never be accepted by the predominantly non-Jewish European countries that hosted them. Two formative experiences led him to this conclusion: the first was his participation in a German nationalist movement, where he experienced antisemitism, and the second was the Dreyfus affair, which happened when he was in Paris.

Very few Jews agreed with his position and Zionism remained a fringe movement until after the Holocaust, when the European Jewry came to agree with Herzl's assessment that not feeling particularly Jewish yourself does not protect bigots from discriminating against you for your anscestry.

In fact, much of the *opposition* to Zionism in the 19th century came from religious Jews, who, in keeping with orthodox Jewish tradition, maintained that Jews should not return to the holy land before the coming of the Messiah, who had not yet arrived. There are some very religious Jews that still hold this position.

Particularly by 19th century standards, the ""Father of Zionism"" wasn't much of a Jew: he spoke neither Hebrew nor Yiddish, he did not receive an official Bar Mitzvah, and his motivations for the creation of a Jewish state were explicitly secular.

The choice of Palestine as a Jewish homeland was somewhat arbitrary and mainly for cultural continuity -- in his seminal work, *der Judenstaat*, in which he outlines his plans for a Jewish state, he explicitly names Argentina as a possible candidate. The benefits of Palestine had mainly to do with its proximity to Europe and its importance in Jewish history. Herzl also saw an economic angle: the Ottoman Empire was in debt and he believed he might be able to convince the Ottoman Sultan to allow the Jews to create a homeland in Palestine in exchange for them taking on the Ottoman Empire's foreign debt. To this end he actually met with members of the Ottoman court, including the Sultan, to pitch this plan. It was rejected.

What Israel does today is not in any way defensible but stop claiming that Zionism is about religion. It's not. Not today, and not ever.

I really can't stand people who don't bother to do a little reading.

soccer,"Wait so they have to be conceived at the club grounds to be a youth product? Is that the measurement we're going by? By the way Messi was 13 when no other club, either in Argentina or in Europe, would take him -- except for Barcelona. Pique's grandfather used to be a board member in Barcelona; he's as much of a youth product as you can get. You need to check your ""facts"" better mate. Anyway, signing youth players is not ""stealing"" in any sense of the word. I don't think what Wegner did with Cesc was stealing and nor do I think Barca signing promising youth is stealing. I don't think you know what stealing actually means and are letting your dislike for Barcelona colour your judgement. Every single one of these players spent considerable time in Barca's youth teams, learning to play Barca's way, before moving to the first team. They were not bought as stars, but they were spotted by scouts and trained up. But hey you have a problem if Barca buys star players or grooms them anyway so I guess it makes no difference.

Spain has a fixed set of laws regarding youth recruitment and all clubs follow it -- why single out Barcelona? Because lots of kids want to go there? *Oh noes, what an evil institution.* And again, all clubs try and sell shirts. Seems a bit silly to single Barcelona out or hold them to some higher standard. 

And I say Cesc clearly wants to move because he said so last year, and this year has said he'd give his % of the transfer fee to Arsenal if it helps makes things go smoothly. If you don't think Cesc wants to go then you're in some special level of denial.

I understand that traits that appear grossly maladaptive can be beneficial to survival in some environments. It's true, for example, that sickle cell trait is profoundly advantageous in regions with endemic malaria. But these isolated cases of increased fitness are not sufficient to justify widespread phenotypic variability in the global population. 

I gave examples of some other genetic diseases to help articulate this point. Take cystic fibrosis. This is surprisingly common AR disease, with as many as 1 in 25 European Caucasians carrying 1 allele. Homozygosity yields expected life span of ~30 years (with modern medical intervention), and 97% infertility in affected males. In no way can this disease be considered advantageous, or under any positive selective pressure. And yet it persists in the population despite the fact that it is strongly disadvantageous.

Economics,"&gt;Unlike Ireland and Luxembourg, neither of those two appear to have a very large deviation from the trend even when Ireland and Luxembourg are included for regression analysis. Additionally Denmark and Sweden together have a population twice as high as Ireland and Luxembourg.

I agree that they're closer to the trend, and combined have larger populations, than Ireland and Luxembourg, but what applies to Ireland and Luxembourg does apply to these two to some degree (deviation from average correlation and population), so only removing the cases that make the correlation stronger will skew the data to support a particular theory.

&gt;I don't see how the other data sets are really that much larger than the one used in the first graph. Sure, they have more individual points, but that's just the result of a higher sampling rate of (mostly) the same data. The same objections apply.

Libertarian,"&gt;They still routinely reverse engineer, routinely violate international patents, routinely violate each others patents.

They do it less routinely now though. Their court system has gotten much better at prosecuting IP infringements. The problem is still detection, which means that enforcement will be more likely directed at inventions that can only exploited by large scale enterprises.

Right. The obviously can't compete in those markets if people are allowed to steal their inventions. That would undercut the whole REASON why they invented those things in the first place.

Your fact 1 is irrelevant. You can be whatever you wish to call yourself, it should make no difference when arguing about facts.

Your fact 2 is just your projection about situation during the war. It is not the truth. There were tens of thousands of war refugees in Rijeka, and you tell me that you could be in Istra and not know about the war? Please... Let me explain: 

Area of Istra is 2.820 km^2 , area of Croatia is 56.542 km^2 . Istra is just 5% of area of Croatia, placed far away from conflict area. During 1992 Republic of Serbian Krajina occupied 13.913 km^2 of Croatia. That is 25% of Croatian area. Quarter of Croatia was under occupation. Beside Dubrovnik, Zadar and Sibenik were shelled, and don't forget massacre in [Skabrnja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0kabrnja_massacre).

On the other side of Croatia you have other major cities like Slavonski brod, Vinkovci and Osijek that 'saw action'. I dont even have to tell you about Vukovar. Now THAT is war torn city. It was first European city ENTIRELY destroyed since World War II.

WTF,"While I understand the argument you are trying to make, it has some holes in it.  First, if you look at the current top reply, there is no direct place you can donate to the KKK, so it basically makes this whole thread meaningless.  But, lets play that it does allow you too.  Visa/MC have every right in their own discretion to pick and choose which business they want to deal with.  It happens all the time actually with credit card companies and which is why you see only some restaurants take certain cards.  While I'm not saying it looks great for Visa/MC if they were hypothetically allowing you to donate to the KKK and not Wikileaks, one could see the argument as to why Wikileaks is much more of a ""questionable image threat"" than the KKK.  Maybe some will disagree with me and I'm not saying its right, but this is probably where they are coming from.

Second, the comparison to the cop scenario is completely different.  Visa/MC are private sectors, Police are the government(basically) and are public servants.  Credit card companies can pick and choose who they want to help/do business with, cops cannot.  Also, the scenario you stated, which may happen is probably only an extremely small percentage of the time and those cops would be in a world of shit if it ever got reported.

Economics,"&gt;I agree that they're closer to the trend, and combined have larger populations, than Ireland and Luxembourg, but what applies to Ireland and Luxembourg does apply to these two to some degree (deviation from average correlation and population), so only removing the cases that make the correlation stronger will skew the data to support a particular theory.

If you don't think that outliers should be removed, you should at least consider that the data points need weighting based on population or GDP. It doesn't make sense for two countries with a combined population of less than 10 million to throw a large majority of the other countries on the plot below the trend line. The population of the countries below the trend have a combined population that is *an order of magnitude* higher than the combined population of the countries above the trend.

&gt;I thought more data points each representing a country means the data set is larger.

It does, technically, but more sampling out of the same data only helps to reduce random sampling errors.  This isn't the same as increasing the probability of causation; it only helps to better prove correlation.

As to the extra data provided by expanding to the OECD as a whole vs just the EU-15, that only makes other factors even more important.

Yes, however many other times people have made the same conclusions just based on their observations when it is entirely possible that studying the matter in a controlled study would have a different conclusion.

For example during the colonial period many Europeans concluded as they came into contact with other civilizations that the lack of technological advancement by natives was a self evident sign of their mental inferiority.

soccer,"There is very little in this world that has enough power to captivate individuals on opposite sides of the globe that have virtually nothing in common — aside from the broadcast stream they are watching these days and the unison in which they are holding their collective breath.

The World Cup is not about poverty, racism, religion, terror or the financial crisis. It is also not about soccer.

While not taking an eye off these pressing world issues that have each individually made its mark on international soccer, the World Cup allows us to focus on the things that make us human; like passion, pride, camaraderie and other-worldly 40-yard strikes deep into stoppage time.

For better or worse, we momentarily take our minds off the fact that the South African fullback is wearing a pair of $200 Nikes and striking the latest $150 Adidas match ball that, by itself, could have paid for the basic care of hundreds of sick South African children (where it is estimated that 90 percent of the world's HIV-infected children reside). We can instead focus on the fact that some child in a religiously torn province is watching his hero elude a world-class German defender to pass to his goal-bound statesman of a different race and religion — and dream to be different.

Let us think about the fact that we can gather 32 teams, who speak dozens of different languages from different sides of the globe in one location and have them play by the same rules. Granted, the basic rules of soccer are simple, but is there much else that that the human race can collectively agree upon whole-heartedly?

As Americans, we are accustomed to seeing soccer played every Saturday morning on designated soccer fields by droves of 9-year-olds dressed in flamboyant jerseys, seemingly designed as much to designate one team from another as so parents won't loose track of them on their way back to the minivan.

You would think that in a such a populous country with a modern infrastructure, we Americans could put together a world-class national soccer team. And perhaps herein lies the reason Americans have taken so long to warm up to the rest of the world's game: you can't win by commercializing it.

I ask you to look no further than the nation of Brazil. Their children are learning the game often without adequate footwear, spherical soccer balls and without lines on their sans-green soccer fields! These inadequacies, if you want to call them that, have resulted in the most World Cup wins of any nation in history. These ""problems"" have transcended the way the Brazilians play the game and in turn, affected the tactics and training methods of every multi-million dollar club in Europe and beyond.

Yet, at last summer's World Cup dress rehearsal, dubbed the Confederations Cup, when the United States ($14.6 trillion GDP) were leading the national team of Brazil ($1.6 Trillion GDP) 2-0 at halftime, I did not feel the least bit sorry for the impoverished Brazilians.

If the U.S. could hang on, it would mark the first world final appearance in the program's history with an exclamation point that could not be ignored. And when that one-named captain from Brazil put his side ahead 3-2 in the closing moments of the match, I was gutted — alongside thousands of other fans that had ventured to Gillette Stadium early to watch the U.S. national team on the Jumbotron before the New England Revolution kicked off its own game later that afternoon.

Naive pundits and sportscasters often suggest that Americans just don't care about soccer. But in the run up to this year's cup, I purchased a replica U.S. away jersey, which I proudly wear on my way between classes or to and from work. Daily, and without exception, I have received comments ranging from ""Nice shirt"" to more enthusiastic anti-English sentiments in the run-up to last weekeend's 1-1 U.S.-England draw.

This does not surprise me. Instead, what has startled me is the broad range of people in which these comments are coming from. There are soccer fans here, and many more than you would imagine.

While we will likely be in the group of 31 failed bids to bring the cup back from South Africa in the weeks ahead, we will be in extraordinary company. But, as suggested earlier, the World Cup is not about soccer. And, by extension, the United States's appearance in South Africa is not only about winning.

For one month, every four years, the world gets a fleeting glimpse of the only utopian paradise that is manifested by both the good and bad elements of human nature.

Watches,"I'd wager it's a combination of bad lubrication and a hairspring that's not flat and centered. Bad lubrication because just about all the watches I see that come off ebay from East Europe and Asia seem to have been ""serviced"" by someone who slathers oil on until it runs then adjusts the regulator until it almost keeps proper time laying flat on a table. The hairspring is basically the heart of the watch, and unless it's perfectly flat and centered around the balance it's going to run differently in different positions. It's hideously easy to mess it up if you don't know what you're doing (honestly it's still easy to mess it up even if you do know what you're doing, the things are very fragile). A competent watchmaker should be able to flatten and center it up, but hairspring work can be very tedious and take quite a while.

It says the movement is ""analogous ROLEX Cal. 5513,"" what that means is the movement is a Russian copy of a Rolex movement, so it's relatively crude. Honestly I don't like working on these Russian movements because of that. They seem to keep time alright when they do go together and are adjusted properly, but I've been unable to get them to run as well as even a basic Swiss made movement. Sure I could spend the extra time adjusting static and dynamic poise, smoothing and burnishing pivots where needed, and adjusting other small variables in the train for better performance but the labor costs going that route that quickly exceed the value of the watch.

todayilearned,"Holy shit. That is so, so awful and wrong on every level. That's offensive.

1) Detroit is not ""the"" entitlement city. Compared to virtually any european cities, and most American ones, we're lacking a *great* deal of infrastructure, both private and public. As other people have said, Detroit itself lacks grocery stores, while the suburbs have plenty.

2)  This started during the 60s, because of the Civil Rights Movement and the race riots and white flight. Only three governors since the 60s have been Dems, for a total of 18 years in office. That's between 2011 and 1961. For those of you who are paying attention, that means that **32** of the past 50 years have been under a republican governor. That's a good old 64%. The one who was governor during the race riots, this supposed ""radical leftist,"" was George Romney, Mitt Romney's father. It was a clusterfuck of epic proportions with blame literally on everyone's shoulders. Police abused people, black or white, rioters torched business, black or white owned. Rioters shot at firefighters trying to put out fires, and police beat people *after* they had been booked.

3) Detroit has no universal healthcare. I don't know where you got that from.

4) Detroit spends $11,000 per student? That's a fucking lie. Detroit spends about [7-8 thousand dollars](http://www.detnews.com/article/20080723/SPECIAL01/80723001/1459/special03/Michigan-2009-per-pupil-funding-by-district?appSession=517303526963927) per student, which is less than the $9,000 average. $11,000+ is for Oakland county, which includes Royal Oak, Troy, Bloomfield Hills, Rochester Hills, and Farmington Hills. [Source.](http://www.freep.com/article/20090818/NEWS06/90722083/Database-Per-pupil-funding-1995-2009)

Aside from Oakland county *not* being Detroit, in the slightest, it's unfair to compare the two for one very simple reason: The median income for those Oakland County cities I mentioned is close to $100,000, usually about $80k, with $40-$50k average for the smaller cities. Detroit has a median of $30-$33k. 

You're being dishonest to call those areas with $12k per student spending ""Detroit,"" saying it's a sign of the failing liberal policies, without mentioning that the areas that they *do* spend that much in are extremely nice cities about ten miles outside of Detroit with infinitely superior schools. Showing a picture of an abandoned building in Hamtramck and using numbers from Bloomfield Hills is lying.

5) The Teachers Unions are not refusing the City's demands to hire more, and lower the student:teacher ratio. That's a flat out lie, again. They've been cutting back on schools, closing them down, increasing the student:teacher ratio **against** the will of the unions. The teachers union went on strike because of that, by the way.

6) The person in the video dismisses the idea that the auto manufacturers may be to blame, by strawmanning the argument as ""not enough green cars."" What happened is that for much of the 50s and 60s, maybe even the 70s, the big three didn't innovate. They marketed. They released the same guts with a different body, called it the ""deluxe"" model, and sold it to people. Cars, rather than being transport, became status symbols and were marketed as such. You pay more for the same thing because of what it represents: Your wealth and status. 

The problem is, when other countries built up their infrastructure again (because, you know, we kind of destroyed it all in WW2), they started making cars that they *needed*, not cars that they *wanted.* When the Oil Embargo in the 70s came, it became *very apparent* that buying cars as status symbols was stupid and most people couldn't afford it. They needed cars that were practical, first. Cars that were a good investment. That is what foreign car companies had been doing all that time, so they were just *better* at it than us. The fact that they get better MPG is a small part of it, but it became more and more important as the big three shifted to SUVs (which have the highest profit margins) because any time there was an oil scare, it would mean that their sales would drop. 

Do American companies have *more* hybrids than foreign ones? Very likely, because they're still following the branding and upgrade model of old. Having *a lot* of different models isn't a good thing if they all do the same thing, because you need more factories to build those models. It's better to have one *really good* model, than a bunch of shitty ones, because not only are your cars less likely to be bought but they cost more to be made. Yes, another failure of management.

As for the $74 an hour? That's a flat out lie, again. It's been proven time and time again that Toyota pays their workers wages comparable to the big three. The difference is that Japan has national health care, while in the US, companies have to provide it. This is a huge cost for the companies to shoulder. Of course, he won't admit that because it goes against his ""Liberals ruined Detroit!"" narrative.

Also, the big three *agreed* to pay the health care. It's not like the UAW snuck it up on them. Again, a failure of management.

7) Urban Farming: Last I heard, the evil liberal city government was going to start offering abandoned plots at a fraction of the price to nearby neighbors. So, if you have a home and the nearby plots are abandoned, you can buy them for something like $100 instead of a couple thousand.

**In Closing:** I think that video is insulting, because it distorts the truth of what happened and is happening in Detroit and tries to use the people, the hardship, and the reputation as a political tool. He doesn't give a shit about Detroit, or even what happened to it, he just wants his ideas reaffirmed so he feels good about himself.

buildapc,"The pc looks good, the 6870's scale insanely well in crossfire and easily outperform a 580gtx in 90%+ of games

For the PSU 600w is more than enough (I would go with 650w-700w if you are doing a heavy oc; don't listen to all these people telling you to overspend on your psu for no reason, I run dual 6850's on a 550 and even under furmark+prime95 i only get around 400w from the wall with a heavily oc'ed 2500k; 6870 use around 25w more each at load so 600 is plently and gives you the overhead needed for great efficiency) However, I have no idea as to the brand of the PSU you selected and I would go with a corsair, antec, seasonic, enermax, or XFX 600w+PSU

Here is a link to one of the best hardware forums out there supporting my PSU recommendations and train of thought, also it links to some other recommended PSU's

http://www.overclock.net/power-supplies/1045231-phaedrus-quickndirty-psu-calculator.html

I personally suggest a Antec neo eco 620w, seasonic 620w, or a corsair cx600w (cheapest in the US, also worst of the 3 i suggest but still is a good PSU)

Also I have no idea about the cost of cases in Italy, but I would try to get something like a lian li k58k60/k62 or a cooler master haf 912/922 because from the pictures/specs they have much better wire management compared to the case you selected

ALso, I would get a samsung f3 1tb as it's the best performing hdd on the market in it's segment and one of the cheapest as well (again not sure on prices in Italy, but I would get the cheapest between samsung f3 or wd black 1tb)  You could look for a cheaper drive (maybe a 2tb green) if you decide to go with a 64gb or higher ssd and just run your os/favorite games off of the ssd and use the hard drive primarily as storage and for lesser used programs.

The CPU should be a i5-2500k unless you are doing heavy video/photo editting, and I would get a different CPU cooler since the one you selected seems to be not that great

I would suggests the cheapest of the following: Cooler Master hyper 212+, Corsair a50, or Xigmatek gaia

With the money saved from the change in CPU you could go with 560 ti sli or 6950 crossfire.  The 6950 is a bit stronger and also abit more expensive; esp. after accounting for a non-reference cooler which I highly recommend when going crossfire (I would recommend a 650w psu for these with a 700w+ for heavy overclocking; which means changing the volts on the GPU's, I've already accounted for the power needs of a vastly oc'ed cpu, ex. 5.0 ghz @ 1.4v)

Or you can invest in a SSD(not sure about EU prices, but I would aim for a crucial m4 for speed or intel 320 for reliability)

Economics,"&gt;Dear Professor Barro:

&gt;I’m compelled to write after following your writings for many years, in response to your recent article (PDF) in the Wall Street Journal, your interview with Conor Clark on the Atlantic web site, and your published email interchange with Clive Crook on his Atlantic blog.

&gt;In 2000 you demonstrated that in OECD and Rich countries, government consumption levels have no significant correlation to long-term growth rates. (PDF)

&gt;In their 2003 meta-analysis (PDF), Nijkamp and Poot demonstrated (with multiple references to your works) that in aggregate, dozens of your colleagues who have actually studied this issue support those results–in spades.

&gt;In prosperous, developed countries, smaller government does not yield faster growth. As you and your colleagues have demonstrated, that belief is a myth. (The U.S. has been taxing about 28% of GDP for decades–local, state, and federal combined. Europe has been taxing 40%. But growth rates have been the same.)

&gt;But you have constantly promulgated that myth–and you continue to do so–in your scholarly and popular writings, and public pronouncements. This is especially concerning because your statements receive widespread attention and credence regarding taxation and spending policies in the U.S.–which is a decidedly rich country.

&gt;Facts on the ground:

&gt;In your 2000 paper you broke out growth rates for a panel of Rich countries, of OECD countries, and of Poor countries (PDF: table 1.1, page 35). Results:

&gt;Correlations: Government consumption versus growth in real GDP per capita
Rich-countries: -.014 (.042)
OECD-countries: .015 (.040)
Poor countries: -.167 (.030)
All countries: -.157 (.022)

&gt;For prosperous countries the results are one positive (more government consumption, faster growth), one negative, neither even vaguely significant.

Canada has a great many things to celebrate and I see no reason why I should stop celebrating. My problems are all first world problems. 

If the aboriginals in Canada want to have first world problems too, then they ought to get on the minimal steps to achieving them. Ie. education, sanitation, health, and economics. You can't hunt/gather in a world of 6 billion and rising. 

One good way to start would be having a system of governance that lends itself to negotiating with the crown in an effective manner. 

From what I hear, the tribal/chief system is rampant with corruption and abuse. Maybe when your people rise up and demand democracy, you will be able to get an effective level of diplomacy regarding the rights to self determination on the same level of the provinces of Canada.

Some already have self-determination rights, and are doing just fine with them. If your group doesn't then maybe study to learn how they did it, and what the pro's and con's are. I have no respect for a litany of complaints that ignores modern reality.

Libertarian,"&gt; A statist is a man who believes that some men have the right to force, coerce, enslave, rob, and murder others. To be put into practice, this belief has to be implemented by the political doctrine that the government—the state—has the right to initiate the use of physical force against its citizens. How often force is to be used, against whom, to what extent, for what purpose and for whose benefit, are irrelevant questions. The basic principle and the ultimate results of all statist doctrines are the same: dictatorship and destruction. The rest is only a matter of time.

This is a nice summary of the European treatment of Native Americans, which Rand seems to have endorsed.

&gt; Statism is a system of institutionalized violence and perpetual civil war. It leaves men no choice but to fight to seize political power—to rob or be robbed, to kill or be killed.

Python,"After you're familiar with PyQT or PySide you don't need a GUI builder. Qt has excellent layouts, it does almost always what you expect. Basically it's always the same:


1) You have some parent widget, e.g. a dialog derived from QDialog.

2) Then you create an empty layout, e.g. a QGridLayout.

3) You add your widgets to the layout, e.g. QLineEdit, QPushButtons

4) You add your layout to the parent widget.

5) You can nest different layouts, add spacers and stretches ...


Once you've done this a couple of times you won't miss a gui builder. Regardless of what I said, Qt Designer is quite sophisticated.

Libertarian,"So what? That's irrelevant because the U.S. was an extension of the British state and therefore privy to the Statute of Monopolies and such.

If you're actually talking about countries without IP laws, as you said you were, it'd be reasonable to assume you wouldn't object to an analysis of a third-world country like those in sub-Saharan Africa. They don't have any copyright or patent laws and they don't produce many innovative goods. So, by your argument, that nation doesn't produce anything that's innovative because of the lack of IP laws. I argue that that's not the case.

A lack of IP laws may, for example, be indicative of a general lack of protection of property rights. If you can't own a house or a mule or anything of value without it being taken from you by force, how are you going to produce anything at all?

Furthermore, those countries aren't as developed as the United States or most of Europe for a reason. They either lack the resources to structure their economy based on comparative advantage or their economy is structured in such a way as to not necessitate IP law, such as a labor-intensive economy.

My point is that you can't definitively make the connection between a country's lack of innovative economic activity and its lack of IP laws and say that the latter is the cause of the former. There are other factors at play.

I've never been a picky eater, and I eat almost everything, but the food served at European McDonalds is so vile and disgusting that I just can't force myself to eat it. I can understand that eating at McDonalds is *convenient* for some people when they're in a hurry, but it boggles my mind that some people actually *like* it. It's not just the food; the packaging and the interior also contribute to make the whole experience as miserable as an eating experience can possibly be.

piano,"**Bio from her Website.**

Described by critics as a ""bona fide angel playing"" and an ""electrifying pianist"", the Ukrainian-born Valentina Lisitsa has been receiving rave reviews ever since here debut in Avery Fisher Hall for Mostly Mozart Festival.

With her multi-faceted playing described as ""dazzling"", Valentina is at ease in a vast repertoire ranging from Bach and Mozart to Shostakovich and Bernstein. Her orchestral repertory alone includes more than forty different concerti performed so far. She admits to have a special affinity to music of Rachmaninoff and Beethoven. She performed all Rachmaninoff’s concerti and next year will perform ""The 5th"" with the Rotterdam Philharmonic. She is embarking on an ambitious project of recording all of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas - often a lifelong task which was achieved by a very select few artists.

With her highly individual and fearless approach to every work she performs, she has been greeted by enthusiastic audiences throughout the world - her recital debut in Vienna's Musikverein Golden Hall (2008) received multiple standing ovations from Viennese listeners, known to be toughest to please.

Born in Kiev, Ms. Lisitsa began playing the piano at the age of three and performed her first solo recital at age four. After her studies - first in Lysenko School of Music and then in Kiev Conservatory -Valentina moved to US and eventually became a citizen of that country. She has been performing in the world's most prestigious concert venues. In the season of 2008-09 she has more than 80 performances with more adding up every week. Among her recent collaborations were tours with Sao Paolo Symphony, the New Zealand Philharmonic, Warsaw Philharmonic and Prague Chamber Orchestra. An avid chamber music player, Valentina has performed with Lynn Harrell, Jimmy Lin, Roberto Diaz, Ida Haendel to name a few. But her most important musical partnership has been with the superb violinist Hilary Hahn. They toured together in 2007 with an extensive tours planned for 2009 in Europe, North and South America, and Japan.

Valentina has recorded 8 CDs (Audiofon label) and 3 independently released DVDs including best-selling set of Chopin's 24 Etudes which held coveted #1 spot on Amazon music video list. Her new highly anticipated CD is scheduled for a release later this season. Valentina's preferred piano brand is Bosendorfer, in particular the flagship Imperial model. She finds this piano's inimitable sound a perfect match for her artistry and technique.

Valentina's current home is in rural North Carolina where she finds refuge from her hectic travel schedule. Valentina jokingly calls herself a ""redneck pianist"" because unlike many of her peers she makes her home base not in a major city but in North Carolina's beautiful countryside. She shares her home with a jolly menagerie of four concert grands, two cats, a three-year old son, and her partner in life and piano duo (in married and musical life) Alexei Kuznetsoff. On rare occasions, when she has some free time home, she enjoys organic gardening, restoring her old historic mansion and cooking Italian. Most of her ""free"" time however is devoted to practicing and learning new pieces. Music is truly her biggest passion.",2,t1_c238iea,t5_2qnw8,2,t1_c238ijz,t3_if54x,,True,False,1427308033,True,0,,c238ijz,[deleted],0,,0,1309632809

*  On a television talk-show in 2007, Tristane Banon recalled the details of her ordeal, saying, “He wanted to grab my hand while answering my questions, and then my arm. We ended up fighting, since I said clearly, ‘No, no.’ We fought on the floor, I kicked him, he undid my bra, he tried to remove my jeans.” (this is the one that I was aware of.)

Our anthropological sources, who were mainly missionaries or 'proper' 19th century men, were not so keen on recording sexual practices, and if they did, they often did it with an exotic message in mind (to show how 'uncivilised' or different other peoples were).

I read that in the Middle Ages in Europe, sex would have been openly practiced in the house, so in front of one's own children, as there was often only one bedroom. Also, in inns sex would have been public, again because of the single sleeping quarter available. Couple this with the double function of many inns as brothels, and you get almost roman orgy-like things going on in those places.

Therefore it is not surprising that criminals will have, in general, an easy time obtaining one of those. I fully understand that regular citizens are freightend by that thought and get a firearm themselfes. It is a vicious cycle if you ask me.

AskReddit,"As someone who moved to Houston from another country too, here is what I have learned:

1. There are no seasons here. One day the sky will be barfing water, the next it's 100°F. However, it doesn't really ever get cold here (Northerners laugh at us for freezing when it's about 30 degrees)

2. Get ready to start using the American measuring system. It still confuses me. Makes no sense.

3. Hurricanes aren't that scary. But I live more inland; those closer to the coast probably have it worse. 

4. Religion can be a pretty big deal here. I've never met any *hugely* religious person, but if you say something contradicting someone's beliefs, some won't hesitate to argue with you.

5. Houston is actually pretty diverse. Sure, there's a lot of Mexicans, but there's also Salvadorans, Indians, Vietnamese, Guatemalans, Cambodians, West Indians, Filipinos... you get the idea. Although I have never met anyone European. 

6. This goes with the above- because the majority of the people here are Hispanic, learning Spanish is recommended.

7. There's a very strong Republican vs. Democrat divide here. As with religion, if you don't agree with someone's political views, they will immediately start to verbally attack you. I have lost a few friendships because of this.

That's all I have to offer as advice. I'm still a young'n.

climateskeptics,"&gt;How are taxes part of a peaceful society? How is income parity a driver vs. an outcome of a peaceful society?

This might be one of those cases where one might, justifiably, say that correlation does not equal causation but overall countries with high income disparity are the ones with the most social problems. It's common sense that a handful of people exploiting millions will create unrest. If you would consider the US a proper high income disparity nation is also in the eye of the beholder, mainly because regardless of the few super rich there are still plenty of people considered middle-class. I personally think that a nation where 44 million out of 300 million are on food stamps has something seriously messed up with their system. (edit: This is actually a bit wrong here on my part because in most European countries government aid is given as money and not food stamps. Effectively for the very poor it achieves the same as money but many Europeans still associate food stamps with WW2 scarcity and as such they are viewed very negatively. I suppose the only problem I have with them is that it creates a sub-currency in which only the socially lower classes trade in.)

It's a complicated issue with the US and I'm not going to scream the typical Nordic social-liberal dogma as there is no obvious solution to the inflamed US federal budget situation. I just feel that if a reasonable approach is taken with social-security, it wouldn't just be about feeding bums with federal money. I'm trying to point out that not all taxes are evil and some of it might very well be buying the rich people the freedom and safety to spend the remainder of their well earned money as they see fit. 

Obviously a nation where everyone is equally poor and miserable is not a happy place either. Cliche'd as it may be, there can and should be a balance between financial reward and looking after the failures.

&gt;Who are you to say that USians aren't happy? (last one was j/k)

This depends on your viewpoint but Americans in general have long working hours, very little vacation and are in general stressed out about their life. I feel that the whole issue is a bit fuzzy and whether one believes research and ""research"" on the topic is completely up to the individual person.

AskReddit,"Put in simple terms, here's the argument, without the normal rhetoric.

Rich people (*6) have money, which is capital.  They buy or open factories/companies/etc which employ people.  When you lower the taxation rate, you are essentially giving them more money in which they would open more companies, leading to more employment.

You will hear three basic false arguments against this;

1) They just invest in funds/etc.  This is irrelevant because all money must 'work' in order to earn a return (however, see #4 below as well).  Funds invest in capital markets one way or another.

2) Taxes don't actually increase the money because it only affects income.  Although true in a sense, this omits that money declines in value over time due to inflation.  This requires real assets to keep up with, and real assets need to work.

3) This has been 'proven' to be false (or true).  It hasn't, and the reason for it is because it differs depending on social structure, trade barriers and existing tax rates.  There is a big difference between 100% taxes and 99% taxes, but a very small difference between 0% and 1%.  Hence, some european and scandinavian countries did better with lower corporate tax rates but very high personal rates, or just marginal decreases.

Ok, so there's the argument in a nutshell.  It's not really false, but it's not the whole picture.  Here's a few details and examples of where it goes wrong;

4) You can get a return on capital simply by lending money to someone else.  So, a rich person doesn't need to put his capital to work in a way that increases employment.  Replace rich person with a corporation, or a series of them.  Take universities and students as an example. They could give you student loans, charging you interest, and essentially simply churn the profits that way.  Or, take an extreme example that happens socially - you could buy up a significant amount of land and rent it out.  The key point here is that these goods have effects similar to indentured servitude, but are a lot less obvious.  This particular argument is a lot more complicated than the examples above.

5) Investments are often public.  The argument for tax breaks fails here because you do not need a concentration of money, and without that, there is a basic economic equilibrium that occurs.  Concentration of money causes more and more distortions in that equilibrium.  Consider:  You have some money and go to invest it in a company because you want to make money.  The return is too low (ie: taxes or whatever), so instead you go out and spend it.  By spending it, you are helping someone else get a return.  By consuming, you are paying the taxes for the company anyway, and you'll invest once the return rises to the point you are happy with.  So taxes are a bit of a red herring to the real argument, but by framing it as a taxation issue, people attempt to direct it away from the actual allocation of capital.

6) Taxes on rich *people* will only result in them consuming more of their money, not less.  If money is not being worked with or used for consumption, it more or less ceases to exist.  A natural result of that is for the federal reserve to print more money, increasing the pressure to do something with the money.  Hence, taxation is more or less a non-issue for rich people.  

7) The fairness card is often played.  Here's the basic answer for it.  A person pays taxes for the infrastructure and social support for their money.  Without that, money and private rights would have no meaning.  For example, top 1% owns ~35% of the wealth in the US and pays for ~35% of the income taxes. It's actually pretty similar all the way down.  (Data available from IRS and Google, easily).


The arguments for it are simple, but the actual issues are a lot more complicated.  This gives a lot more power to the pro arguments.  Data really tends not to support tax cuts as well, but both sides have reams of bought economists arguing one way or another.  A lot of anecdotal evidence (chart R vs D in terms of debt, unemployment, etc.  D's perform significantly better) supporting higher taxes and infrastructure spending, rather than tax cuts and other supply side policies.",1,t3_if4iz,t5_2qh1i,1,t1_c23943a,t3_if4iz,,True,False,1427308333,False,0,,c23943a,Spectralshift,0,,0,1309640298

According to Wikipedia:
""Strauss-Kahn made comments that could be perceived as critical of global financial actors, in an interview for a documentary about the Late-2000s financial crisis, Inside Job (2010). He said he had attended a dinner organised by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in which several CEOs of 'the biggest banks in the U.S' had admitted they (or perhaps bankers in general) were 'too greedy' and bore part of the responsibility for the crisis. They said the government "" 'should regulate more, because we are too greedy, we can't avoid it.' "" Strauss-Kahn said he warned the officials of a number of departments of the U.S. government of an impending crisis. He also said: ""At the end of the day, the poorest – as always – pay the most.""

Referring to his diplomatic efforts to secure IMF aid for Europe following the 2010 sovereign debt crisis, economist Simon Johnson described Strauss-Kahn as ""Metternich with a blackberry"". In May 2011, referring to the IMF's change of heart in favour of progressive rather than neoliberal values, Joseph Stiglitz wrote that Strauss-Kahn had proved himself to be a ""sagacious leader"" of the institution.

It is really challenging but if you can get into that stealthy snake mentality and really play the way the game was intended by sneaking around and playing it slowly and not getting in confrontations then it is awesome.   

I don't recommend European Extreme because it takes away your rations but Extreme gives you the quintessential MGS3 experience.  No radar, less ammo, AI is smarter and tougher.

Well, your test results are back.  Your debating levels seem pretty low, but your condescension scores are through the roof!

 &gt; It's a distinction that the EFTA did not and does not accept.

&gt;So? Does that make them right? No, no it doesn't.

Aah, I see: European law is now judged by a random American bloke on the internet, is it?  Must have missed the memo.

You can think it's a bad call all you like - it makes not one lick of difference.  The opinion that matters in this instance is that of the EFTA's, not yours.  The IMF cares about what 

&gt;Fuck you. I'm not ""facing the responsibilities"" of some shit that ""my"" government does that in no way represents what I believe or the way I live my life. You may find that to be acceptable, but I don't. It's in no way ""better"" for the citizens to let their governments run roughshod over people and then just hand up their money to bail that government out like good little slaves. What is ""better"" about that?

Well fuck you right back - right in the ear!  So you aren't going to face the responsibilities of what your government does?  The government of the people, by the people, for the people? Well guess what - you just sit there with your fingers in your ears while your government makes bad decisions on your behalf, and **you will still have to face up to those responsibilities.**  You don't like the consequences of your government's decisions?  Change your government, don't try to foist their bad decisions onto some poor other fucker.  You have the ability to do something about it, so quit bitching and do it.

&gt;Maybe you'll think twice about putting your money in a bank from now on, sucker.

So what are you, a Luddite?  You keep all your money in a sock hidden under your mattress?  You pay for the internet connection you are using how, exactly - in cash?  Or are you using a barter system of some kind?

&gt;Except that we can't afford to buy our government the way corporations and bankers can. Our government is fucked and the only possible way to return it to the people is through armed conflict, which the people will never win.

That must be the famous American fighting spirit I've heard so much about!  I'll say it again; if there is a problem with the US system, it's for the US people to sort out.  Don't be a pussy; stand up for your convictions.

&gt;I see this as a plus, not a minus. Fuck debt slavery and everything about it. If you can't live on your cash income then you can't live.

I see your degree in economics is coming in really useful in this little debate/flame war.  Do you know what your country's debt is?  Are you volunteering for financial euthanasia?  Iceland's debt rating being downgraded is a big fucking deal for them.  Go read.

&gt;Someone else will step up and do business with them - I'm sure they're well aware of this.

They have interest rates through the roof, severely dodgy economic growth, and their biggest cash driver is fishing.  Their biggest market is the EU and EEA countries.

TLDR; you actually don't have a clue what you are talking about.  What you have is an ideology you are wedded to, and a situation that doesn't fit that ideology.  When you try to twist reality to fit your idealogy, you end up sounding silly.

I don't have anything specific to say because my course was UK-based, but the reason I'm interested in planning is the [perhaps naive] notion that you're helping people socially. Planning well can increase standards of living, which can have a multiplier effect; if you're happy, you might work harder, take more interest in your health, encourage others to improve their sol, etc. I'm really interested in improving social housing and I don't know what that's like outside of the UK and a basic knowledge of Europe, but high-quality social housing can have an amazing effect on people living on/below the breadline.

investing,"Woops. To read the full article, you need to be a member! 

Here is a quarter of it...

In this first article for the Aim Shares Forum, I will reflect upon everything that has happened to the UK market, along with all the other economic factors that may be affecting us on a day to day basis. There are several factors that have at the moment been overlooked by most PI’s. Here is a break down:

 
 
•	Our economy remains in a poor shape
 
•	We need to retain our triple A rating
 
•	The base rate would need to increase
 
•	The Sterling continues to shed value against the euro
 
•	All of the quick-fix and stop-gap measures are unsuccessful

 
 
The inflation rate is at 5% pa and this seems to be considerably higher on staple requirements. Ideally, the BoE and economists would want to raise the base rate to 3%. Being a political hot potato at the moment, the dithering continues and no decisions are being made. These actions are affecting the UK market along with several other reasons, resulting in AIM falling from 890 on the 1st of June to 834 on the 28th June 2011.

 
By analysing the FTSE100 over the last month, there has been a down trend as it decreased from 5989 to 5674 on the 23rd of June. For the last week there has been a sharp increase to the main index pulling from a variety of factors, but predominantly because of the European Union having bought time in the resolution of Greece’s economy. Another main factor that has affected the UK markets is the strength of the Euro. All governments have a budget deficit and during 2010 into 2011 the percentage debt of GDP for the UK has increased where Greece has had the largest debt. Greece has been lent too much money and this has resulted in the interest rates increasing drastically and borrowing becoming harder to acquire. Greece’s total Debt is 340 Billion Euros and after evenly distributing this amongst the population of Greece, it is more than the average income per year.
 

The fear that Greece may leave the Euro can result in other countries following closely behind, and this shows dark days ahead for the UK markets, especially with AIM as such small cap companies will feel the squeeze relative to their net earnings.
 

On the brighter side, there are IPOs lined up for listing on AIM. Two known companies are holding back, uncertain of the reception they will receive. Both of these companies have full order books and are selling their innovative products to developed and emerging markets. Their balance sheets are sound and they need private investment capital to expand globally. This shows that there are companies that are ready to come into the public eye but hesitant in such an economic climate.

Yeah.

The US joined the war against Germany in early 1942, first fighting across Afrika, depriving Germany of badly needed oil resources.  As the Allies landed in Italy, further German troops were diverted from the Eastern front to delay the Allies and maintain a friendly government as their southern neighbor.  The threat of an allied invasion of France, though it took about a year to set up, also diverted major resources in the production of Fortress Europe.

All of this is ignoring the vast quantities of supplies that the US sent to the Soviets via convoys through Murmansk and Archangel, notably the munitions and food that the Soviets were desperately lacking.

It was a collective effort.

politics,"&gt;But on the topic I brought up, I was trying to say that Latinos make up a huge part of the population and the newer, whiter arrivals to this land have an irrational bigotry against them. 

See, that's just it. The Latinos that you're talking about are the newer arrivals. The southwest was very white for a long time. After the US began to see a better economy than Latin America, Latinos began to immigrate to the states, some of which used to belong to Mexico. Essentially, there was a brief period in which the country of Mexico owned the land which is now the southwest United States, and you've made it quite clear that you believe that *modern* Mexicans ancestrally have a legitimate reason to be in the southwest because of their ancestry. That's really the only part of your post I was addressing. 

Realistically, the demographics of the southwest went like this: Native American--- Mexican--- European--- Latino and European. ~~~~In the interim, no one of another nationality has any more claim to live in a nation not of their own than those who preceded them in their home countries have to live in said country.~~~~

EDIT That sentence was stupid. What I'm trying to say is that people *now* can't claim that they reserve the right to live in a place because their country used to ""own"" the land. 

 So when you say ""What they always fail to realize is that Colorado used to be a part of Mexico,"" it really doesn't matter. Because before Colorado was part of Mexico for a short period, it was part of several Indian nations for thousands of years. It is no longer a Native American nation, nor is it Mexico. It is Colorado, a state in the union.

If you really want to talk about bigotry, that's fine, and I'm sure that we'll agree on just about everything.

Currently many nations use unmanned vehicles in warfare, and some are already testing out fully autonomous ones too (like a plane that can fly by itself). A good date for robotic warfare coming to age would probably be something like 2020 - 2025.

Depending on how wide you define a resource war, some people would argue that the current fighting in the middle east, and new areas like Libya are actually being fought for resources. I don't know right now whether it'll make sense for nations to fight over resources with a military rather than through economics (at least developed/developing countries like US, China, India, Europe and others).

worldnews,"&gt; Interesting. Where I live there is free speech. I guess that means that you’re country is full of assholes. Indeed, there are assholes without religion.

Well, what do you know? 

Oh boy is the irony killing me… We don’t have free speech at the instigation of — drum roll — jewish pressure groups.

Yes! Jewish pressure groups have decided that we cannot have free speech, and have managed to have that enshrined in law!!!

And please have a look at the very [preamble of our charter of rights](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/page-1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I); you’ll have a good chuckle.

Jews make short shrift of other people’s rights. Lemme tell you why I particularly hate hassidim jews: in 1985, some hassidim living in their ghetto could not bear seeing people sunbathing in a park. So they had the city pass a bylaw prohibiting bathing suits. For wearing a bathing suit, I could have gone 3 months in jail. Luckily, the bylaw was struck down by courts months later; only the federal government can, though the criminal code, tell how people to dress.

Those fucking hassidim fuckers simply wanted to shove down their goddammed fucking retarded religious values down my throats.

But wait! That’s not all! Just google for “[hassidim outremont ymca frosted windows](http://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hassidim+outremont+ymca+frosted+windows)” to see jews earning their douchebags reputation.

&gt; Well, people who are far smarter than you or I do not find it to be bullshit.

Well, If they cannot see the bullshit, they cannot be smart…

&gt; Wow, so the place you live has no freedom of speech laws and hate is rampant. Yet you claim to be flourishing…right….good luck with that. LOL.

Yes, where we live, the hassidim hate others enough to force them, and they remove our freedom of speech.

&gt; By your own logic you should drop your “beliefs” and find something new to preoccupy yourself with. I heard knitting is fun.

Hmmmm… No.

&gt; I’m feeling pretty comfortable in Israel.

I wonder what the palestinians who were deported would think of that statement. Let’s see how you skirt that question…

&gt; Let me know how life in a shit place with no free speech laws, rampant hatred and shitstain people like yourself is working out…

Yes, no free speech and hatred, thanks to the jews.

&gt; Poo? I’ve been holding my nose the entire time we’ve been chatting, chief. You’ve managed to infect your rhetoric with the shitty living situation of wherever you come from.

Shitty because jews don’t give a shit about the rights of others, and are happy to force other people do what THEY want…

&gt; France is the beacon of liberty, monsieur.

I think the ethnic and religious minorities there might beg to differ. But, hey you don’t care. They’re just assholes

There are no ethnic and religious minorities in France. Only french citizens. Oh, there can be douchebaggery, but that’s the bourgeois’ prerogative, mostly.

&gt; Really? So the French conquest of nearly all of West Africa, from Algeria, to the Ivory Coast, Niger and part of Sudan was one big misunderstanding. Yea, those empires are tricky aren’t they. O, and this is after France cast off the chains of religion.

Oh, sorry, I thought you meant the napoleonic conquest of Europe.

Yes, African colonization is a pretty big shit stain on France’s record. But that colonial empire was merely the fact of the bourgeoisie playing copycat to try to emulate the british.

France never needed it’s empire; witness, right after world war II, both France and Britain lost their empires. Without it’s lifeline, Britain became completely destitute and ruined, whereas France saw three solid decades of unprecedented economic growth. France’s empire actually hobbled it’s economic development, but the bourgeois were too short-sighted (no surprise there) to notice…

&gt; LOL. You have no moral high-ground. You call people kikes and then expect to have a moral high-ground. Bigot, LOL. Like I said, I have no desire to “covert” you, as you put it. Land stolen from others? LOL.

Yes, land stolen from others. You cannot refute that.

&gt; Dude, no Zionist I have ever met has made more assumptions, blankets statements and historical mistakes then you have in these past posts. You are truly gifted…at a complete and utter sack of shit.

Takes one to know one, eh?

&gt; &gt; Well, for the record, here, we have decided to count on immigration instead of making babies to increase our population. How’s that for non-douchebaggyness???

&gt; Not very good. Considering that your country doesn’t have free speech and is full of hatred, bringing in immigrants is a strategic mistake. 

Aaaah, the racist jew is talking here! Striving for racial purity, eh?

&gt; There will be a larger economic, linguistic, and cultural gap now. I mean….how do you not realize this. Bad douchebag.

askamerica,"The answer has to do with a lot of different things, but I'll limit myself to two.

First comes America's natural wealth. The nation is amazingly vast compared to European nations, for example. In this vastness we find a multitude of resources from minerals to fertile farmland. These resources, coupled with America's sizable population and the industrial techniques we adopted in the 19th century allowed it to outpace European nations (the world's previous superpowers) in production and growth.

Second comes our isolation. For America's entire existence it has been isolated by the Atlantic Ocean from developments--and more importantly conflicts--in Europe. After World War One, the major industrial nations--France, Britain, Germany, etc.-- were all broken by four years of war at or close to home. America was nowhere near as damaged as any of those powers. Again after World War Two we see the same phenomenon; the European powers, the only at the time that could compete with the United States for dominance, were ravaged by war, while the United States was relatively untouched, and even strengthened by the mass mobilization of resources to crush Fascist Germany and Italy and Imperial Japan.

Charlemagne The Great for example fought wars to free Europe, particularly Spain, from the 'Blacks'. Rome itself at one time was also invaded by 'Blacks'. Even when Ghenghis Khan's 'Hordes' invaded into Persian/Muslim territory, the Europeans attempted an alliance with the Khans to fight against the 'Blacks'. Early US newspapers from the 19th century (20th century?) described 'Blacks' who ran Harems of 'White' women from the lower Caucasian areas conquered by 'Blacks' near the Middle-East. The term 'Black' is a generic term applied to anyone from South of the Equator in ancient times when access to education was very lacking. Racism itself is an exploitation of the lack of education in order to commit to political goals. In the US, racism was used to protect jobs from the Chinese and to establish a political heirarchy enforced through military force against anyone not of European descent. This led to Chinese workers being lynched by both 'Blacks' and 'Whites' in the 19th and 20th century after their work was completed. Ever notice that even though the Chinese have been in the US since the 1800s, they are just barely politically recognized?

http://www.whale.to/b/mullins41.html#Rockefeller_Support_for_the_Bolsheviks

&gt; Many Americans are puzzled by the relentless devotion of the Rockefeller Foundation to financing Communist organizations in many parts of the world.  This dedication to Communism can be traced back to a crucial moment in the Bolsheviks’ march to power.  In 1917, Mackenzie King had established a lifelong relationship with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. whom he met in June, 1914.  They had been born in the same year, 1874, and seemed to agree on everything.  Soon, King was working closely with Frederick T. Gates and Ivy Lee to further the Rockefeller “philantropies”, which seemed to view Communism as the ideal vehicle to bring about world brotherhood. 

&gt; King wrote to this friend Violet Markham, “John D. Rockefeller Jr., the truest follower of Christ, has one purpose – to serve his fellow man.”  King resolved that his one purpose was to serve Rockefeller; he testified for him at the trial investigating the Colorado Iron and Fuel Co. massacre before the Walsh Committee (the Rockefellers later tried to have Walsh framed and expelled from the Senate, but failed due to the obstinancy of Burton J. Wheeler;  J.Edgar Hoover played a crucial role in setting up the frame).

&gt; The Rockefellers helped Mackenzie King obtain government contracts for the Canadian Army during World War I, which set King up for later blackmail (the “Panama” hold over the vassals).  King sold hundreds of tons of rotten meat to be sent to the Canadian Army in Europe;  boots of “leather”, which were mostly pasteboard and which disintegrated immediately in the watersoaked trenches;  rifles that jammed when they were fired;  and collar type life preservers (previously condemned) which broke the soldiers’ necks when they jumped into the water.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Rockefeller family is sometimes called the first family of the Soviet Union.  When Nelson Rockefeller was nominated for vice president in 1967, Pravda indignantly denounced his critics, saying that charges against Rockefeller were designed only to discredit him, and that the accusations came from ultra right wing organizations.  Senator Frank Church, attending the 1971 Dartmouth Conference at Kiev, was amazed to find that “David Rockefeller was treated like we would treat royalty in this country.  The Russian people appear to evince an adoration of Rockefeller that is puzzling.”  When David Rockefeller’s plane lands in Russia, crowds line up to greet him at the airport, and line the streets of Moscow as his limousine passes, hailing him with cries of RAHK FAWLER.  George Gilder remarked that no one knows how to revere, blandish and exalt a Rockefeller half as well as the Marxists.


The Rockefellers are waist-deep in the scum in this country.  Rockefeller was also involved in brokering arms deals between the U.S. and Russia (that's left out of the textbooks too).

&gt; Although Jacob Schiff’s personal agent, George Kennan, had regularly toured Russia during the latter part of the nineteenth century, bringing in money and arms for the Communist revolutionaries (his grandson said that Schiff had spent $20 million to bring about the Bolshevik Revolution) more concerted aid was called for to support an entire regime.  Kennan also aided Schiff in financing the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905;  the Japanese decorated Kennan with the Gold War Medal and the Order of the Sacred Treasure. 

&gt; In 1915, the American International Corporation was formed in New York.  Its principal goal was the coordination of aid, particularly financial assistance, to the Bolsheviks which had previously been provided by Schiff and other bankers on an informal basis.  The new firm was funded by J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, and the National City Bank.  Chairman of the Board was Frank Vanderlip, former president of National City, and member of the Jekyll Island group which wrote the Federal Reserve Act in 1910;  

As usual, the same names come up.  The Federal Reserve cartel.  The Rothschilds.

&gt; The Leninists quickly exhausted the funds advanced by the Germans when they reached Russia, and once again the Bolshevik bid for absolute power seemed in doubt.  To whom should Lenin turn but his powerful friend in the White House ?  Wilson promptly sent Elihu Root, Kuhn Loeb lawyer and former Secretary of State, to Russia with $20 million from his Special War Fund, to be given to the Bolsheviks.  This was revealed in Congressional Hearings on Russian Bonds, HJ 8714.U5, which shows the financial statement of Woodrow Wilson’s expenditure of the $100 million voted him by Congress as a Special War Fund.  The statement, showing the expenditure of $20 million in Russia by Root’s Special War Mission to Russia, is also recorded in the Congressional Record, Sept. 2, 1919, as given by Wilson’s secretary, Joseph Tumulty.

Of course, the Kuhn Loeb group is one of the principle owners of the Federal Reserve:

I mean, if you want to be perfectly honest, a fully democratic Middle East is *not* in our best interest. What's best for *us* is that they do what *we* want, which many times, as you know, is not necessarily the best thing for them.

&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if many people in the State Department employed this very justification

you would be a fool not to think so.

as for whether or not it's worth it, I guess that depends on your perspective. When Germany inadvertently started WWII, the general idea (for as much as there was one) was to rid Europe of communism, rid Europe of its Jewish population, and make Germany the strongest industrial and military power on the continent. Germany of course was soundly beaten militarily, at the cost of tens of millions of lives. But here we are almost 70 years later, and the Soviet Union has collapsed, due in large part to the cold-war mentality (a by-product of the war) that bankrupted them. Germany is the strongest industrial power in Europe. And the Jewish population is, tragically as it turns out, nothing like what it was before 1933.

Was the war worth it? Certainly the National Socialist ideology is an abomination, but did *Germany* really lose? Are they better off? In 1946 the answer would have been ""not at all."" Now...hard to say.

At first, I thought this would be about sexual taboo again, like the top thread of today. But there may be more at hand here.

I did not see the video (do not have a youtube account), but I did some research, and it seems to be enscenated. By the natives, not by the cameraman. It seems like this tribe has lived along a river used for trade, but they have managed to turn the attention from anthropologists to their benefit. They made a deal with the local missionary post/clinic, that they should act as is expected from them. In return, they receive western goods and medicine. This has been going on for at least the '50's. Source is an article that's on google, but not publicly available. A discussion on the video is available [here](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4840/is-the-tribe-meets-white-man-for-the-first-time-video-fake).

Even though I think the missionaries instructed them to wear their skirts, I have seen similar skirts worn by Amazonian people, even when not in direct contact with western people. I can think of some reasons for covering the genitals independent of western sexual taboos;

Firstly, humans developed upright gait, exposing the genital area much more then with largely quadrupedal animals. What do you do when you meet a physically imposing adversary? Kick 'em in the balls. So for men, covering the genitals makes more sense.
For women, this might also signal protectiveness and unavailability. 
Thirdly, it just sits a lot more comfortable too, I suppose.

So that's for tropical climates. Most 'indigenous' people I know of just walked around in Adam's costume most of the time, apart from decorations, paint or tattoos. You can assume most clothing in these parts to have social meaning first, and practical purpose second.

For other climates, things are different. Eurasia has had a very long historical and cultural trajectory of regulated norms, so I am mostly interested in the period before Christianity in Europe or the Empire in China.

I know that in the Bronze Age, males are often depicted on rock-art with prominent phalluses, suggesting clothing was not worn in that area, at least not by those men. The Egtved Bronze Age female burial, one of the first in Europe with clothing, has a reed see-through skirt and a pot-shaped bronze disk, hung at the hip or lower abdomen. This also indicated, for me, a very early focus on the genital area.",5,t3_ifbbt,t5_2qm4e,5,t1_c23a9ij,t3_ifbbt,,True,False,1427308847,False,0,,c23a9ij,procastarchaeologist,0,,0,1309655043

Like I said, anti-monopoly laws inherently increase inefficiency in a private market, because it makes companies have to operate at sizes other than the size determined by market equilibrium, the combination of economies and diseconomies of scale, which is by definition the most efficient way for a company to run.  The laws increases inefficiency and even corruption (since the power can be wielded to selectively eliminate competitors to a company that bribes politicians with the power to initiate antitrust hearings).

racism,"&gt;OK, where do I start: On #1, you state that they were slaves ""regardless of their treatment"". AFRICAN women, children and MEN were raped, the men in front of the others to send a message. Pregnant AFRICAN women were hung upside down and had there stomachs split open so their babies would spill out, as a message to the others. AFRICAN men had the arms tied to opposite facing horses and were literally ripped apart. I'm not sure where you heard that the ""founding felons"" treated Africans well, but somebody's selling you a dream. There is nothing in world history to compare to the horrors of African enslavement by europeans. It takes a special kind of ignorance to think otherwise.

I believe you have missed the point of my comment on #1. My point was that the slaves being ""fully incorporated into the tribe"" does not excuse the fact that they are still slaves. I have heard people say that Thomas Jefferson treated his slaves well, which is some bullshit told to paint Jefferson in a more positive light. A slaveholder is a slaveholder, no matter how well they treat their slaves.

&gt;6 I won't bother with. If your naive enough to believe that, a few words from me won't help you.

Not all white people are rich executives. There are plenty of poor-as-shit white people barely scraping by between paychecks. Just because someone is white *does not mean* that they are living well.

&gt;As for #7, with all due respect to yellowmix's comment, Black people do not benefit from slavery. When you are stripped of your heritage, your values are changed. Black people now value principles laid down by europeans, not true African values. So, the fact that some Black people are financially better off than others, they are all morally bankrupt, a product of european domination. No amount of money can change that condition.

Black people in America do benefit from slavery as citizens. As you said, this country was built on the backs of slaves. The prosperity this country gained eventually allowed this country to develop public services and infrastructure. Black people drive on public roads, get books from public libraries, and drink from a public water supply. So you see, in some capacity black people do benefit from slavery, although I agree these benefits are overshadowed by the oppression they face in our racist society.

&gt;8 - I don't remember saying they were the same. I will say this; ALL european groups discriminate against Black people. That is a fact. As a Black man, I don't have time to pick out the good from the bad. Two snakes look the same, one's poisonous. Do I administer each a DNA test? As a european, you are defending you self and/or your people, so am I.

All European groups have contributed to discrimination against black people, but not all individuals in those groups have. Not all of them are racists, so why do you generalize? Also, what makes you think I'm European?

&gt;9 - Pardon me, but FUCK all non-African slaves!!

Why? How can you justify that point of view? Personally, I found your #9 to be very offensive.

&gt;15 - You're right, this does speak for itself. I just hope you speak and understand english.

You're marginalizing the discrimination suffered by the disabled, fat people, and homosexuals. I agree that racism is a larger issue, but that does not mean other forms of discrimination are any more acceptable. Furthermore, the fact that racism is a worse form of discrimination does not mean there are not relevant similarities between racism and those other types of discrimination.Why do you believe homosexuality is a chosen lifestyle? Did you choose your sexual orientation?

Unlikely.  Europe is divided but hasn't really suffered from invasions in a long time.  The last invasions were actually by the US to fight in WWI and WWII, but I don't think that the US could have held the territory and the US was invited in.  The last real invasion was by the Ottoman Empire, a pseudo-European state.  Before that... I guess the Mongols bit at the fringe, and before that the early Muslims grabbed Spain.

A divided US would probably be a pretty stable place.  There might be a few wars, either between locals or domestic but I don't see a full-scale invasion scenario as being likely at all.

nba,"&gt;You don't hear about Taco Bell employees forming a union to get a percentage of revenue. They get a salary or hourly wage whether the company does well or not. I don't see what makes the nba so special.

I mean, if you don't see what makes the NBA different than Taco Bell, I'm not sure where to begin.  However, we could start with the fact that individuals who can play basketball in the NBA have a rare and unusual skill-set that creates value (in entertainment dollars).  Is that not obvious?  I mean, it is very unusual for a Taco Bell employee to have skills that uniquely position _he or she_ to generate the majority of the profit for the Taco Bell chain.  Most Taco Bell players have extremely replaceable skills.  Whereas, NBA players (just 350-ish of them) generate ALL the revenue associated with the NBA, and it just wouldn't make as much money without those players.  I'm not sure it would make _any_ money (Is ESPN going to pay for NBA games if the players are guys from the local rec center?).  

&gt;This is my biggest beef with the lockout. I dont care if the owners are making or losing money. They own it and they set the rules. If you dont like the rules, go find another league.

I mean, the owners _could_ set the rules and just let the players deal with it.  There's no reason not to (except the players could strike).  What's happening right now is the owners are locking the players out and preventing them from fulfilling their contracts.  Essentially what's happening right now is exactly what you're suggesting.  The NBA, right now, is saying that its better to shut down than to continue under the system proposed by the players.  I'm skeptical, but I don't think the players have a plan to deal with this lockout except to wait.  Most of these guys don't want to go to Europe or China, and no domestic league is in a position to rise up and challenge the NBA. The ""go find another league"" sentiment is very likely to get the NBA sued for anti-trust violations (and I've really got no clue how that would end; one recent decision seemed to suggest franchises are going to be treated like legitimately separate businesses, which would seem to fall right into line with an anti-trust argument).",1,t1_c23226u,t5_2qo4s,1,t1_c23alzs,t3_iea2u,Mavs,True,False,1427309010,False,0,Mavs2,c23alzs,RationalUser,0,,0,1309659530

gaming,"IIRC, there is no real technical reason why an ISP needs to have a cap. The bandwidth on any copper wire is about how much can be transmitted over at a single moment in time. If a customer is requesting ""too large"" of a share of the bandwidth, limiting the speed is the obvious counter. Limiting monthly load would only answer this problem indirectly by assuming the customer wants to consumer his internets at a smooth rate, and then would personally lower his average requirements. 

Modern speed limitations are not so much from the copper, as it is the switches between ISP's local loops and longer haul infrastructure. The switches were made in the 1990s, haven't been upgraded since, and at scale I don't believe would be expensive for any telco of any size.
The whole idea of a ""bandwidth cap"", isn't even an accurate saying in the first place, since bandwidth is technically measuring the speed, not the end monthly load. I'm aware you could mess around with the units, but bandwidth measures bites/time, not bites!

If one examines any clogged commercial network, my understanding is that most failures are at switches between local loops and long haul infrastructure. If there was more competition in this field, those firms maintaining these switches would have an incentive to upgrade them. The costs are not insane, and completely reasonable at most, if not all, levels of infrastructure. I understand if certain goods can't have large nominal amounts of different providers, such as roads or police services, but then without regulation a textbook monopoly occurs, and the monopoly has no incentive to improve. 

Perhaps I have made a mistake in my understanding (please tell me if I did), but data caps look like a ludicrous price increase, being advertised as a technical solution, to a non-existent problem. This wouldn't usually occur if there were more competition, although I understand why redundant infrastructure may be inefficient. As a metaphor, a region doesn't need, and perhaps would be worse off, if it had two competing road systems or police services. In cases where one cannot increase the nominal amount of competition, regulation (I know it's a dirty word) could at least be considered.

I look at any region I've lived in the U.S, and there is usually one, maybe 2 ISPs. I've seen 3, but only once in a test market. Major U.S. cities, with huge population densities and a low infrastructure cost per user, has only 2 options?! It gets even worse if one examines different levels and price ranges of internet services. That's not choice, not a free market, and its inefficient for society. If one looks at the U.K, they had this EXACT same situation a few years ago, and the smallest amount of regulation leaves most of the country with dozens of different ISPs at many service levels and price ranges. 

There was an [engadget post on this the UK regulation posted a few days ago](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/why-is-european-broadband-faster-and-cheaper-blame-the-governme/). I agree with the accuracy of the first portion of the video examining the UK's regulation, although I can't speak with absolute certainty for the rest of it. I also wish the video was more neutral in its presentation of facts, since I can smell the political slant from this side of the pond. North America has a very similar system of a few firms owning most of the infrastructure, firms that do not allow competition to be carried on their infrastructure on a significant enough scale. I'm on a personal note completely supportive of private property and the right of private firms to do what they want, but this particular piece of private property was built with public money in many parts, and with exclusive operating rights (especially in the wireless spectrum). 

Please let me know if I have stated anything inaccurately, or made a poor assumption, or anyone wants clarification.

/end rant.

tldr: The telco's may be ~~""misleading""~~ lying to consumers, because not enough competition exists in the ISP market, and a clear monopoly has formed. The problem isn't network load, its a market failure to provide competition. Very simple regulation IMHO can create a free market solution.
