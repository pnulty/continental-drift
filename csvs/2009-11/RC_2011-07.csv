answers,"I would, of course, defer to those that have a better understanding of the industry than I... but from an environmental standpoint I would advise against this as a career.

Gas prices will continue to be a volatile aspect of the viability of this profession, not to mention the expense of maintaining the highway system in a country with very low population density.

Gas prices as you probably know are heavily subsidized by the government, which leads the cost of gas in the US to be about half of what it costs in Europe. A recent study has determined that the true cost of gas (if you factor in all of the externalities of pollution) is $15 per gallon. I'm willing to guess that the trucking industry will shut down well before the price reaches that high.

The deficit being what it is, both at the federal level and the state level will inevitably result in the number of viable interstate roads shrinking rather than growing over the next 30 years.

And lastly, trucking isn't very efficient, particularly compared to rail transport. Which means that while trucking won't likely die as an industry, it's likely that trucking will be used more and more for short haul rather than long haul freight forwarding.

If the population density were higher for most of the US (like it is on the east coast) then trucking would have a more secure future, but it isn't and many geographers/environmentalists/city planners will tell you cross-country trucking may not be around for the duration of your anticipated career.

islam,"&gt;Do you think they were wronged though?

I just said that. I think that the Palestinians have been horribly treated. 50 million refugees by 1950. All of them were helped to build new lives, all except the Palestinians. The rest of the Arabs betrayed them in 1948 by invading Palestine and they betrayed them for the next 60 years by refusing to treat them fairly. 

&gt;Yes the British, the ones who promised to create a land for the Jews,

Other than a wartime propaganda document what the the British *do* to set up the Jewish state? Nothing. Very soon after that document they lined up with the Arabs against the Jews. At best the British tried to play both sides against each other so the British could hold their colony.

&gt;If it was right of the Zionists to resist European Rule, then surely it was the right of the Palestinians to resist European Rule, be it by Brits or Jews.

Did the Jews have the right to resist dhimmi laws? And you seem to have slipped from talking about the Arab right to oppress the Jews to the Arab right to fight the British. I'll remind you again: the British set up the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan and armed, trained, and led its army.

&gt;I'm not sure how Jordan is relevant at all,

How is the country that is 70% Palestinian not relevant? How is one of the other countries targeted by the PLO not relevant?
&gt;If Israel has the right to be recognised as the Jewish state despite it's makeup, then how can it object to Jordan making that same request?

Israel has not objected to that. The *PLO* objected. Are you actually unaware of Black September? In 1970 the Palestinians were still claiming Jordan (home to most of the Palestinians) as Palestine. They [tried to take over Jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan) (like they tried, and might finally have succeeded in taking over Lebanon). Some 3-5,000 Palestinians were killed and the PLO gave up even claiming Jordan. Israel has been far easier on the Palestinians than have their fellow Arabs.

&gt;There most certainly where Palestinians living in the region for generations. 

There were people living there, yes. They did not consider themselves Palestinian and lots and lots of people immigrated to the area in the 20th century. 

&gt;If you mean there wasn't a country called Palestine, 

There has never been a country called Palestine. But my point is more central that that: there has never until the mid-20th century been a people who called themselves Palestinian. They had no distinct poetry style or art style. In 1900 and in 1948 there was major political argument in the Arab world over who should control the Area. The Syrians called it Southern Syria. The Jordanians called it the West Bank and saw it as part of Jordan. The Egyptians saw it as part of Egypt. And so the attacks in 1948 were in part set up so those countries could enforce their claims.

&gt;There where Serbians before Serbia for example.

I wonder if you bother to think about this stuff at all. There was a [Kingdom of Serbia in 1100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_in_the_Middle_Ages). There have been Serbians longer than there have been Muslims. Serbia pre-dates Yugoslavia, what that what you meant?

&gt;Who took a chance on war. Be precise.

Every single Arab nation and the Palestinian Arabs who decided to leave, who refused to return to Israel, and who refused Israeli citizenship. Not their children and grandchildren, the word rarely treats the grandchildren of refugees as refugees.

&gt;If you want to say the Palestinians are paying the price for participating in the Holocaust,

I don't and I didn't. This is your strawman.

&gt;The reason I bring Palin and Beck up, is not for guilt by association, but because they talk Israel all day long.

No, it is guilt by association. Neither Palin nor Beck is an influential figure in American politics nor in the decisions by American Muslim groups. You bring them up to try to connect Israel to disliked American figures. Would you like me to do that, it is far easier for me.

&gt;Right so since 9/11 middle east policy has become less important, and no one ever says Israel is the front line in the War on Terror, is that truthy enough for you?

Yeah, it is about as truthy as I expect from you. Israel is a factor in the Middle East. But your original claim was that Israel was a major factor in American elections. Keep changing your claim, maybe you will find one that is not horrible inaccurate.

&gt;If you really think the Congo is more important than the spat in Israel, please tell American Jewish groups to stop making Israel a central issue.

They are protecting Israel. I wonder why you need to attack Israel. 

&gt;Have I?

Yep, over and over.

&gt;I have told you many times, America has more leverage in Israel Palestine than in Sudan. 

So? Maybe 5,000 people have died in the conflict in the last 10 years. Compare that to the Congo or Darfur or Southern Sudan and tell me why you want the U.S. to turn against Israel.

&gt;It helped create this mess,

Still wrong. Do you know any history at all?

The only clear one is social cost, which has yet to be remedied, while thousands more problems are created on the side.

AskReddit,"Except your ignoring the massive dependence that China has on western demand and FDI/ FPI flows to maintain growth in the private sector (which is the most important for overall productivity and GDP growth). There is also the issue that many Chinese banks have holdings offshore in very risky assets that may be dragged down from the collateral damage of a meltdown in Europe. They have their own problems right now with SinoForest showing that even companies that seemed to have good corporate governance may default on their loans. Thers also a possible housing bubble that the government has claimed to have successfully stopped by all the RRR and interest rate hikes recently.

Finally there is the issue of how Chinese banks classify non-performing loans. Last I checked their classification system is much more lax than western standards (may have changed by now- as the data i got was from 2008-2009). With that old system, even if they have an apparent 1-2% loans underperforming today, it may be as high as 4-5%. This is before the housing problem, and corporate governance issues which would wipe out a lot more wealth.

Ofcourse no one wants to even talk about the Asset Management Companies that took on all the bad loans that the banks used to have (so many infact that in McKinsey Consulting estimated the bad loans ratio to be as high as 20-30% in 2005). An estimated 30% recovery was stated in 2006.

edit: Forgot to add the local government debt crises that seems to have peaked recently- alone it isn't a threat but with europe collapse, followed by world emand collapse, followed by housing bubble in china, followed by corporate collapse in china... well you think about it.

I mean hell, he is willing to go to Kazakhstan, and Jordan (which I believe is probably more dangerous than the other places I mentions).

Your idea makes for a pretty boring trip. Also, you can't normally pass through Saudi Arabia unless you can give them a good reason why you can't fly. 

Jordan would be a whole lot interesting, and in fact is extremely safe. It makes much of Europe look like a slaughterhouse by contrast.

That works, the problem is more the other way around: Lebanon and Syria and a few others won't let you in with an Israeli stamp, so it's best to ask them not to stamp your passport.

grilled cheese $2: are you just adding cheese? the add-ons are endless. i recommend turkey bacon (bacon's cheap less satisfying cousin)

travel,"Just a small comment on trains versus planes. 

I've just completed a wander through parts of Europe using both. If I could have found a way that was practical to do the whole thing by train I would have.

Trains usually take a little longer - but not always - are much more comfortable and are much less stress when it comes to station locations versus airports, security checking, time spent in terminals, etc.

My trip was:
Stansted to London on Stansted Express (1hr).

London (St Pancras) to Paris (Gare du Nord) on Eurostar (2:20)

Paris to Zermatt in one day using:

(Gare de Lyon) to Lausanne on TGV (4hrs)

Lausanne to Visp on local (1hr)

Visp to Zermatt on local (40 minutes) 

Zermatt to Chur on Glacier Express (7hrs)

Chur to Tirano on Bernina Express (4hrs)

Tirano to Milan same day (2hrs)

Milan to Venice (2hrs)

Venice to Zagreb (7hrs)

Mostar to Sarajevo (4hrs)

While in Europe I flew from Zagreb to Dubrovnik, Sarajevo to St Petersburg via Budapest and Moscow to London. 

The Rail and Air experiences are not the same; the travel experience itself can be enjoyable watching the landscape slide past your windows for a few hours rather than looking down from 30,000 feet. When assessing the time don't forget to add the time and cost of getting to out-of-town airports and getting through security. For example, compare the locations of St Pancras and Heathrow, or Gare du Nord and Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Just an opinion.

Islam is the religious text. Muslims are its ""followers"", who are a diverse group of people who interpret and practice the religion in a wide variety of ways.

Muslims, they are normal people like you and me. Some are great people to be around, others are not. You can't generalize, not even with Egyptians. ""Sharia"" doesn't always equate to stoning women and honor killings. Most Muslim countries practice sharia law and forbid those two  practices.

Hmm..

So, let's see.. Western companies _start_ out looking for slave labour, then get disappointed by getting what they paid for and proceed to look for..  slave labour + 15% or something? :P

Scotland,"&gt; Their party constantly creeping to the right of the social-democratic spectrum is against the grain in Scotland. (and much of the rest of the UK)

Absolutely - but what are the chances they'll ever move back left? I don't know if you'd agree, but I reckon the SNP victory in May wasn't just down to the collapse of the LibDem and Labour vote, but also due to the fact that the SNP styled themselves as a variant of a European social democratic party. The Scottish electorate (and I'd wager most of England north of Birmingham) is well to the left of Labour on most issues, and instead of reflecting this, Labour have tried pulling to the right to capture some nonsense middle ground and thinking they could take their core vote with them. Ed Milliband not backing the strikes yesterday and insetad calling for restraint (!?) would be an example of this. 

I voted SNP and not Labour in the Scottish elections for the first time in my life because although I have no faith the SNP will fully embrace social democracy, I do think they have most to lose for any deviations from this.

worldnews,"I dunno about 30-40 years, putting such numbers is basically just guesswork.

But look at it another way:

You say 1 out of every 4 dollars is produced in the US. That means 3 out of 4 dollars aren't. Changes in that ""rest of the world"" thing are weighted 3x for every 1 of ours. That's a lot of money that could go to industrialization, commerce, research and development, etc.

In reality, that ""rest of the world"" is really just the EU plus a small number of other countries - Japan, China, India, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few more.

As he mentioned, last year 92 countries had growth rates above 4%. China and India were at 10%+, Brazil at 7.5%, South Korea at 6.1%. Even first world countries like Germany, Japan and Canada had higher growth rates than the US, which was number 117. And yet the US produced a 2.8% growth rate, which is pretty darn respectable for a mature economy.

So it's not like we're doing very poorly, it's just that many countries are doing a hell of a lot better. This is understandable, since they have a lot of room to grow; many started off with 3rd world status and many are still there.

But the net result is that the US share of all those things you mentioned, such as the 1 out of ever 4 dollars we produce, or the amount of military that cash can buy, all go down *as a fraction of the total world output*. And this can happen pretty damn fast.

More worrying to me than dollar amounts and number of military bases are things that I think are better predictors of future performance, such as:

1. Number of research papers we produce per year. This is **far** from keeping pace with the growth in the rest of the world.

2. The performance of American kids in math and science and basic reading comprehension skills, in which we placed 29th out of 31 of the top industrialized countries in the world.

3. Deteriorating infrastructure - roads and bridges which are not being built at a pace in keeping with population growth, which are not being kept in repair. Telecommunications in which we lag far behind many European and Asian countries.

Stuff like that has serious consequences if you're making predictions about the future, because it's your growth pipeline, it's what will fuel tomorrow's growth.

Again, nobody is saying the US has lost already, just that the current trend is a decline rather than maintaining the status quo or advancing. Yes, we ""control space"" as you said, but people looking at NASA today which just retired the shuttle, visited the moon 40 years ago and never went back since, continues to cut back for lack of funds, can't help but think that this is exactly what ""decline"" looks like. We had the whole market in space launches once along with the USSR. Today, commercial satellite launches are more likely to be through ESA or the Japanese, or the Indians.

I don't think this trend will go away, because really our massive dominance over the rest of the world was something of a fluke of history that gave us a huge lead over everyone else. Europe was the only competition, and it was crushed after WW2. Asia was coming out of the feudal/dark ages.

worldnews,"&gt;I'd heard that a poll showed a majority of the french believed it was a set up, back at the beginning at least.

Many French people did. [Here's a more current article on French opinion.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/world/europe/02france.html)

But to be fair, if a popular politician about to run for office from *any* country were to be charged like this, whether the case had merit or not (which no one could know for sure right away) I suspect the majority of that politician's supporters might also think (or assume) it was a setup.

Basically every possible scenario left is shitty:

1. He's guilty, but the accuser's behavior will make the case impossible to prosecute.

2. He's not guilty--the accuser was looking for a payout--but his reputation has been irreparable damaged.

3. There was a setup intended to keep him from running for office, and it succeeded.

It seems doubtful (according to the NYT article I liked above) that even if he's innocent that he'll recover from this.

The news pretends the government is cutting down. Obviously anybody paying attention can see that they're not and it's just a big show.

reddit.com,"Suicide is not illegal. Google search it if you have to. Or just read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation). 

In regards to the gateway drug theory, I can't definitively prove this one either way. There have been numerous studies which show both cannabis as a gateway drug and the gateway drug theory as false (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory#Studies_not_in_favor_of_the_gateway_theory). The best way I can disprove this one is from my personal experience and observations. 

For years I've been involved in the drug culture and that all began in 7th grade after the first time I got drunk. The experience of an altered mind-state opened my eyes to a whole new dimension of reality. If our perceptions change so readily how concrete are my beliefs if I can truly only base them on what I have experienced? But, I digress. It was the allure of this altered state of mind which lead me to pursue other drugs. It wasn't some spiraling downfall which eventually lead to rehab however. I went from alcohol, to weed many years later, and eventually psychedelics and pharmaceuticals a few years after that. My choices to do a drug were widely dependent on what I knew about that drugs effects. I didn't smoke weed and suddenly realize that other drugs must be awesome and that I should do harder and harder one's. I'd never try cocaine or heroin; I've seen both on numerous occasions and it is as easy now as it would have been in elementary school to just say no. The idea behind the gateway theory is that using drugs opens up a door where all other drugs are hiding. If I could summarize the effect from my experience, it is more ""I am a person who enjoys drugs, weed has opened my mind up to using them"". It is something I have complete control over. I research and test all new drugs at low doses and have set boundaries for myself which I do not intend to cross. If this theory is true then the effect should follow from any drug use. Just because I use tylenol doesn't  mean I'll use morphine recreationally. How many kids receive drugs daily from prescriptions or during trips to the hospital/doctor's office? If this theory truly had any merit then these kids would all be running around trying every drug they can, and this is frankly not the case. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't make it any more or less of a drug, and the effect of the gateway theory isn't compounded just because weed is illegal. If anything, legalization would eliminate the allure that illegal drugs have (the risk of getting caught and thrill of doing something illegal) and we would see a decrease in drug use. Studies to back this up are limited but if you look at European countries such as the Netherlands where marijuana has been decriminalized there is drastically fewer young drug users than in America.

And guess what? They’re sufficiently different to have a big hatred between the two…

&gt;Who is we? You’re aware that Catholicism is a cornerstone of Latin American society, in Africa, Asia and (of course) Europe as well. 

Not at all. France dumped it’s scatholicism (please; it’s an utter piece of shit) 200 years ago. We did 50 years ago, and without those chains, the french culture has soared since.

&gt; Or do you only mean profoundly douchey atheist individuals like yourself, who are only as ignorant and offensive as their religious fundamentalist counterparts. You think you’re their antithesis but you’re just out to cram your own bullshit down peoples throats.

Aaaaahhhhh! Now he claims that atheism is bullshit; therefore you’re religious. A religious guy who doesn’t follow his religion (can’t blame you; bacon is so good — and you have to like it since you’re on Reddit), a guy who picks and choose what he does… Rabbi Rosenblumenthalovitcheinstein must be really jittery when he sees you on the street; he probably even changes sidewalk and peers more intently in his portable edition of the torah!!!

&gt; I’m really sad the public school system failed you. Maybe if you went to a madrassa you would have the capacity to differentiate between religious and ethnic groups.

My dear friend, I went to the same school that Charles André-Marie DeGaulle went to. You know, the guy who said that jews were “an elite people, sure of themselves and dominating”…

&gt; The atheism has nothing to do with (it really doesn’t). It’s all in the assholiness. That’s for you.

Why should I be all honey to people who act douchily?

&gt; But yea, I don’t believe you. That boat kind of sailed once you started throwing around the word kike.

So why do you bother with me, then? You think you gonna convert me and make me stop worrying and love the jews, mr Strangelove???

&gt; Actually many, many people take that word seriously. Not just Jews. 

Yes, those who drank your kool-aid…

&gt; You on the other hand, are a coward so you can’t own up to your bigotry, even though you entirely fail in concealing it.

Yeah, whatever.

&gt; Oy! Hahahahaha. You bigots sure know how to tickle me.

Koochie, koochie, koochie. Here’s some more.

&gt; By the way, I think God would allow Albert Einstein into Heaven even if he wolfed down 3 pork-chops at the gate.

Well, I’m sure that John-Paul II is right there, even though he had far more than 3 pork chops throughout his life…

&gt; Hmmm, no. I believe the motion went forward with 33 votes yes, 13 votes against and 10 abstentions. O, I think you might find it interesting that among the states who supported the resolution were Australia, Sweden, Holland, France, as well as the US and Britain of course…you know…those forward looking countries who threw off the chains of cliché and abandoned religion (You said Catholicism but since you mixed up Islam and Judaism once already I’ll use a broader term).

Well, they surely didn’t want to be stuck with all those jewish refugees from Germany…

&gt; A Jew-Hater. Don’t worry though, today we have Israel and PM Harper loves us. YAY!!!

It’s normal: he’s a shitstain fundamentalist who thinks that you guys will trigger armageddon and that will rapture him into heaven. Or something nonsensical like that.

And there is the fact that jews have a lot of money, and money matters a lot in elections, so he’s not beyond licking some jewish arse. In any case, he’s poised to bring chaos to the country, a bit like your Nethanyau (sp?) does, which is the modus operandi of right wingnuts.

&gt; How enlightening. So thousands of severely traumatized people, who were often times individuals with no family left, should have upped and taken back homes and property that were confiscated and given to others. 

So, that gave the “severely traumatized” jews a blank cheque to severely traumatize palestinians?

&gt; Yea, rambling about war-devastated Europe scrounging up fragments of a destroyed life should have been the plan. Btw, Have you ever heard of the Kielce Pogrom, a massacre of Jews that happened right after WWII. Have a look see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_pogrom Nothing to fear, aye? Also, you might be interested to know that this would have been so impossible that a joint American and British committee was commissioned to investigate this. Their conclusion was that the vast majority of displaced Jews, 100,000, should have been transferred to Palestine. They were experts. You’re a cunt.

Experts? They just followed the typical antisemite (that was back then when that word had it’s true meaning) policies of their respective governments. It takes a real expert to follow the rules…

&gt; Silly Jews. You can’t be religious. You can’t be atheist. See this is why you’re a true Jew-Hater. For you there is no good Jews. Just the one that forgets his identity and hangs his head down.

Religion is bad; that’s what brought about the shoah. Their religion told the jews to be assholes, and their religion told  everyone else to hate jews. Without religion, none of this would have happenned.

&gt; Because then people, me included, won’t laugh at you because you don’t know what you’re babbeling about.

Who cares what a zionist laughs at?

&gt; Actually, Israel is a state based on a parliamentary democracy system as well as 11 Basic Laws, not one of which mentions religion or God whatsoever.

Unwritten laws are the most powerful.

&gt; No, no, no, what will someday be a Palestinian state is to the East of Israel. There’s a bit of it just south-west too.

Yeah, when they learn to bow and kiss their zionist masters’ arse???

&gt; Neither do I. In fact Jewish Teachings promote that our people be many and fruitful, that we be as many as the stars in the night and the grains of sand upon the shore. That pretty much means a lot of fucking. Something tells me that you wouldn’t like that. Just keep masturbating there, champ.

Israel,"First let me give you a perspective on who I am so you can judge my words better. I am an American Israelite, I am married to an Egyptian Muslim. I once converted to Islam because I believed that Islam was an extension of Judaism, part of the original religion but with corrections. Due to an increase in skeptical, critical, and logical thinking I now have no religion and do not believe in god, although I still study Judaism because it is a central point to Israelite culture.

Here's my take on the Israel situation.

Before year 0: ISraelites are primitive and culture is developing, wars and invasions cause all sorts of upheavals, the temple is a central point to Israelite culture and due to destruction it causes new waves of Israelite culture and ideology. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 0-77: Increase in Israelite need for autonomy from roman rule ultimately leads to Israelite destruction. The aristocrat city Israelites are expeled from Israel. The farmers stay to work in the fields. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 77-600: Christianized domination causes the Israelites still living in the land to christianize, some keep the old traditions, some turn christian. Languages spoken are mainly Hebrew and Aramaic.

Year 700-1900: Arabized Islamization of the land. The arab invaders over the centuries instill an arabized Islamic ideology, similar to what we see across the entire middle east today. It is basically that if you are arabized and islamized you are a first class citizen and if you are not arabized and islamized you are second class. Compare to Egypt for example, many call themselves Arabs, yet thy are actually not arabs, they are Egyptian, this is due exclusively to the Arab/Islamic conquests.

1900'ish: Zionism begins, all the descendants of the Israelites kicked out over the last 2000 years want to have a home because they have been slaughtered in Europe and elsewhere for centuries, raped, oppressed, religiously persecuted, etc

1939-1945: 6 million Israelites murdered, finally breaks the remaining scattered Israelites into a big push for a homeland to protect themselves. The christianized, arabized Israelites still living in Israel don't care about 6 million murders, they are completely indoctrinated to oppress anyone not an arabized Islamized ideology. Autonomous ISraelites that are Jewish or not identified with arabs are a no no culturally (compare with the atrocities accepted from within arabized Islamized communities like the [Hama Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_massacre) where syrians slaughtered more palestinians in a few days than Israel has killed in 63 years, 20,000-40,000)

Modern day: It still comes down to arabized Islamized ideology set in place centuries ago. Israel cannot exist because we aren't arabized nor Islamized. The land of Israel was not Arabized until Islamic conquerers invaded, they established this ideology in the land and it continues to persist today.",3,t3_idp2x,3,t5_2qhvo,True,,t3_idp2x,t1_c230udf,False,1427304350,False,0,[deleted],,c230udf,0,,1309531247,0

worldnews,"&gt;Europeans did colonized China. I think it's fair to say Hong Kong, &gt;Macao, and Taiwan were colonized. In addition, a few major ports &gt;(including Shanghai and Guangzhou) were essentially European &gt;territories. The Bund in Shanghai looks like Paris or Vienna for a &gt;reason. Across the river is Pudong which looks like NY or Chicago... &gt;because almost all of the buildings there were designed by &gt;non-Chinese and follow western standards.

Foreign powers set up foreign districts walled off from chinese sections. Their primary purpose was trade in their favour, china was huge, and it's coffers wealthy. They wanted to flood the country with cheap opium, and hold the imperial regime up for ransom, syphoning the gold and silver out of the country. They did not and could not hope to control it since the imperial regime itself couldn't control it. Hong Kong was ceded as a time limited concession, and given back as agreed in 1997. Taiwan was occupied by japan much later. The bund is a small section of shanghai, and pudong features distinct and unique chinese skyscraper architecture that takes into account traditional chinese harmony in construction and positioning of floors/windows. Macao was a tiny chunck also given up as a time limited concession, and returned by portugal as promised.

And the areas you cite composed single digit population percentage of china at the time. Much of the country was not urban at the time. Hong kong city for example didn't exist, the british built hong kong with chinese labour and population for china's benefit, ironically. 98% of the territory population is han chinese.

Mao's cultural revolution did more damage to chinese culture than 2 centuries of european imperialism. That damage is still being repaired.

politics,"&gt;Umm I'm not quite sure how you figure your links discredit free market economics as the reason humanity is as advanced as it is today.

Because our middle class today exists entirely because the US government subsidized education heavily and lent money to Europe for reconstruction, that was then paid back to the US in the form of manufacturing, the infrastructure and industry for which was largely built by the US government for the war effort. 

So we have an economic boom, unpredented in history, with rising wages and productivity for over 20 years, all thanks to government investment and socialized education; not quite the free market's doing. There was also a much heavier regulatory framework over banking and finance for that whole period than we have today. If anything, the market was less free then than it is now by a long shot.

Then we have China in the 70's until the present producing our cheap goods with their labor. Our lifestyle today wouldn't be at all advanced or comfortable if it weren't for a global wealth disparity.

They being the same customer and people the customer knows. You also want to build up a reputation on some freelance sites and they'll contact you. I don't even search anymore, I just wait for people to contact me. I got ripped off my first couple of jobs, but the main thing you should look for is: perfect English in their posts, if it isn't perfect, they're probably scammers (unless it's obviously like a European's English, those tend to be okay); relatively clear details about the project, don't do it if it isn't crystal clear what they want; avoid things that advertise ""long-term"" up front, they're just looking for people to add to their database and may or may not ever get back to you, and probably won't have a job for you for like 3-6 months; avoid start-ups with big projects, they'll probably go under by the time they should pay you (learned this the hard way); do not do anything that looks too business-y / too buzzword-y besides maybe basic web design, chances are it's some retarded business person who read about ""the next big thing"" but has no idea how computers work. As for keywords, just sift through pretty much everything, then google the companies or people if you can. If you can't, contact them and see what they say and see what they're like and ask about their company. For company websites, look for how it's written and what it contains. Look for business affiliates and look for anything that can show their credibility. If you think it looks fishy, it is. It's not worth your time to work hard and gamble on shitty jobs. Sign up for linkedin and such. Great for finding people who contact you. If you can find them, you can probably check out their profile and see what others say about them. The more professional they seem, the better the chance you have of getting paid. You also need to be pretty entrepreneurial about it, take some risks, if you think you have like a 75-80% chance of getting paid, do it. If you don't, you'll never find anything for the most part.

Also, be careful of people asking for very specific samples that seem like too much or would be easily used by their company with minor modifications (for instance, ""give us an example of how you'd implement a flexible, simple database for perl using this syntax""), it may be a quick job, but they're claiming to have a bigger job to get people to do small parts for free. It's really underhanded but happens sometimes. A lot of the stuff is kind of scammy, but if you play it safe, you'll be fine. Don't let getting ripped off dishearten you either. Start out with things you can do in like 4-16 hours and if the companies are decent, they should contact you later with better stuff.

A lot of companies are also trying to sift through the shit that goes to those sites, there're scammers on both sides. You might also find companies who want you to work for them or might put you on a retainer to do work, but that takes a good bit of work and luck.

HTML5 shit is great because you just take their HTML4 site and make it HTML5 compliant. Make pretty CSS style sheets and such. It's pretty easy and pays relatively well. It'll usually be small businesses who don't know what HTML5 is but they know they want it. They just want you to make their crappy frontpage site work decently in modern browsers. You can also add in HTML5 video crap and such if you want to really awe them. Stuff with some buzzword crap is okay and is usually pretty easy, but avoid things where every other word is a buzzword (i.e. ""Looking to implement a web 2.0 cloud-based service centered around HTML5 using a .NET framework"", too many buzzwords and it makes no sense as to what they're actually trying to do).

The biggest thing to remember about these sites is that they are not an end-all, you just want to get your name out and people will suggest you to their friends and such. Do some slave work and you might find yourself with a really nice, easy job. After you complete a job, follow up with the person. If they seem nice enough, ask if they have any friends who need similar services and such. It works way better than you'd think, especially if you wow them. Also, ask if they'll be a reference for you. Every single good tech job I've ever had has come from knowing someone or from having impressed someone else with my work.

&gt;Anyways in the three months off they can always go stack shelves and se what the real non-unionised world is like - where you get ahead through initiative and hard work. Not union activities.

Yeah, they could, and everyone could work a part time job over the weekends.. What's your point? Are you seriously suggesting that Teachers are overpaid for the work that they do? That people who are highly educated and trained should be paid shitty wages because you don't like them in some way? I mean come on, we could pay everyone minimum wage, or less! It would be great for business, everyone could simply invest in private companies and their choices there could dictate their real income!

&gt;The fundamental problem is the unions, all teachers have to settle for a standard pay scale. 

No, the solution is the unions. Why shouldn't teachers work together to ensure that they are paid a fair wage, why should they not use the little power that they have, like anyone else can, to ensure that they get a fair deal? It's not like the shelf stacker at tesco's or the team leader at nat west can't join a union and do the same thing.  You seem to want to punish people for doing the sensible thing.

More to the point, Teachers don't have to join a union, many don't, they have a choice of union to join...  Unions are the solution, not the problem.  Why people insist that everyone should get fucked by their employers whenever possible is a real mystery to me.

&gt;The best ones cannot demand a higher than average salary and the poor ones are eligible for salaries than they should have ever got.

The best ones can demand higher wages, they can move within the EU, they can work for a private school, they can do a number of things if they are good and their wages are in demand.  As to the poor ones they won't get promoted or pay rises...  I know lots of people in the private sector who are over paid for what they bring, both through luck, nepotism, inertia and various other things...  

Teachers do a stupidly important job, they don't get the recognition they deserve, they don't get the respect they deserve and for some reason, they, along with other public service workers are getting flak from people who can't be asked to pay into their pensions (teachers do..), can't be bothered to do a job with the attributes they want (or can't get one) but don't mind when the banks and large corporates fuck everyone else over..",1,t1_c22zk4p,1,t5_2qhcv,True,,t3_id372,t1_c2318g3,False,1427304528,False,0,ajehals,,c2318g3,0,,1309535039,0

philosophy,"Meritocracy assumes a few things (at least)…. 1. It is possible for individuals or institutions to be objective and unbiased, 2. Equality of opportunity is possible, and 3. Free will exists.

So, I really think it's difficult to say that 'meritocracy' is unbiased... 
Largely because how 'merit' is defined—almost always subjectively by the social majority. In order to even approach an unbiased ‘merit’, there would have to be an objective way to measure the values by which we all are judged. For example, Europeans decided that a suit and tie looks better than loin cloths, and that girls should wear dresses. Can this be proven objectively correct? Likely not. Thus, this leads to a world where a better qualified man in a prom dress or baggy ripped jeans would likely fair poorly against a (Eurocentric-perspective) well-dressed man who is less qualified. Thus, in order to actually achieve meritocracy, there must be objectively chosen values, and such values must be able to be achieved equally by everyone. 

This is not the world in which we live. For example, Michael Phelps is said to have a perfect swimming body—long arms, large lungs—whereas I do not. Moreover, he was born into a financial situation where he could devote hours of time to a non-essential task. That option simply doesn’t exist for many who are poor and must work to support their families at a very young age. 

So, in a world where the social majority can subjectively decide what constitutes ‘merit’, and that such ‘merit’ is not equally attainable for all, and lastly that all are not born into the same familial circumstances—the remaining ‘moral’ and ‘decisional’ free will (allowing us to make decisions upon which we can be 'rightly judged') with which we are left seems insignificant. Meritocracy as it currently exists falls far from actual unbiasness or equality. Of course, that doesn’t mean we should stop trying to get there.

history,"I think that your comparison to the development of Great Britain is apt; there was a growing realization in Vienna (from what I have read) that a centralized government would not be able to govern such a disparate swath of people. This is one of the reasons that Austria never really got involved in colonization and global imperialism (unless you count the ridiculous Mexican Adventure when Napoleon III put Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the throne of the Second Mexican Empire). 

This same realization, however, did not, as you allude to, spread to Budapest. Moreover, Austria-Hungary had more problems than simply the large Slavic population. The Czech population was very well educated and controlled significant portions of the Empire's heavy industry (Skoda Works, Witkowitz Mines and Iron Works, etc.); there was a significant Polish population which was also as equally well developed as the Czechs (though smaller and without as much influence). Farther East, there were also Ukrainians/Ruthenes, Romanians, as well as deep seated divisions among the Balkan Slavs (think of what happened to Yugoslavia). Trialism would certainly have prolonged the life of the Empire (assuming WWI does not happen), but in the end, I think, much of it was doomed to collapse. In my opinion, the only viable long run government would have had to resemble the European Union, something which it took two world wars and the Cold War to truly bring about.

Well, Chinese explorers did stick to the shore and known trade routes, so no need to be facetious. I am not making this up, the introduction of the spherical Earth model to China is well documented.

&gt; Theres a theory as to why China didn't industrialize first ... If it costs more, and is less efficient to boot, does it make economic sense? No. So the process never starts. 

There is a similar theory for why the Roman Empire didn't employ pneumatic steam technology and water wheel power, which were known at the time, en masse. Economics definitely plays a role, but I think the bigger factor is science. Science makes tinkering much more efficient, productive, and cheaper.

By the 1500s Europe already had the best science and math in the world. Remember, Britain's industrial revolution came almost 150 years after people like Newton who provided the framework on which to efficiently understand, design and improve new inventions and ideas. For all the countries that industrialized after Western Europe, the tradition of math/science being fundamental to invention/design was already well established, so it's easy to take it for granted. But, there is no way to go from electricity generation to antennas to radios to radar in so little time without the work of Maxwell. It might a pre-scientific society 1000 years of pure tinkering to do the same.

Tips: Get baneling speed when lair finishes first, Be active with mutas, Never attackmove with banelings, dont engage marines with mutas

ZvP: Alot of choices here, but i would recommend Roach infestor corrupter 
Tips: Get burrow asap, watch mrbitters videos about 4gate, retreat from forcefields whenever possible, get neural for infestors, try some multi pronged stuff

ZvZ You will want to use speedlings early, i recommend a 14 gas 14 pool 21 expand, experiement with roach/banelings out of that. Into a midgame of roach infestor
Tips: Never stop making lings until you know exactly what your opponent is doing, Scout for spire with overseer every game, harass with burrowed infestors is great

P.S. Don't do it

beer,"Samuel Smith has some good, tame beers that I think you would enjoy. Try the **Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout**.

Chimay is a good classic belgian line. They will be sweet and high in alcohol. They are delicious, but make sure you enjoy more mainstream beers first so that you can appreciate them. The price will be high. If you try one, go for the **Chimay Grande Reserve (blue)**.

Sapporo is a Japanese beer. Nothing worth trying here.

Guinness is the classic stout from Ireland. Their main ""draught"" offering is really only fun at a pub. However, if you can get ahold of their **Guinness Foreign Extra Stout** *(yellow bottle, different from extra stout)* it is pretty damn good. 

Sierra Nevada is one of my favorite beginning breweries. Their **Sierra Nevada Pale Ale** is an amazing baseline - I'd suggest this be the first beer you try. If you want to go a little up in the hops scale, move to the **Sierra Nevada Torpedo**. 

Harp is owned by guinness - it's not wirth trying. 

Hoegaarden makes a wheat beer. If you want to try the style, this is decent, but overall I am pretty sure you won't like it. 

Heineken has a really inflated reputation due to being imported, but it tastes like piss. Avoid it. This is the beer people order when they don't know beer but want to be ostentatious.

Rogue makes some fun beers. Their **Rogue Mocha Porter** is pretty decent, widely available, and a unique experience.

Stone is king. They are currently rated the #1 US brewery on **Beer Advocate**, the go-to beer rating website (with **Ratebeer** also being really popular, especially in Europe). Their beers in general are big hop monsters. You may not like them initially, but if a beer nut sees them in their fridge it will gain you respect. I'd suggest that you try out their **Stone IPA** at some point. Maybe not too soon, but once you start to enjoy slightly more bitter beers this will be amazing. 

Magic Hat is a mediocre little craft brewery from vermont. I've never had a memorable beer from them, but their **sampler packs** can be a fun experience to try a couple different styles of beer side-by-side.

While you might be right on the government law, I DID read Danish comments on the recent hullabaloo on the MP, and many were quite over-the-top and even paranoid, many of them very angry over the result of the court case.  So yes, I do think that Europeans AT LEAST are more likely to tend to being like  what I described, especially in comparison to Americans.  

Yes, the American approach is correct. Hate speech is just insulting some subset of people, instead of a particular individual, for particular reasons.  Insulting Scientologists would be considered hate speech.  Hell, insulting racists can be considered hate speech (where's the line between religion and ideology and philosophy, and why does ""religion"" get a special place in these laws above ideology and philosophy)? 

I see very little difference in insulting black people for their skin color and insulting ugly people for their physical unattractiveness.  There's certainly eugenicists types that believe ugly people should not breed.  I've met them.  Of course, no laws are made for ugly people... all hate speech laws are hypocritical and under deep analysis are highly political and silly.

Not to mention what is considered an insult is itself subjective.  ""Christians are irrational!"" is a true statement to many atheists and a grave insult to many Christians.  Better lock up them bigoted atheists for attacking a group of people for their cognitions, that's DISCRIMINATORY!

It's only a matter of time before Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy are in the same boat. It's because countries that weren't as fiscally and monetarily responsible as the northern and central EU economies could get cheap loans and subsidize so many different industries pretty much overnight (as opposed to slowly over time).

Personally, I don't think any of this will kill the EU. It may cause the Euro to be dropped by most countries, but I think the whole talk about a 'two-tier' system will become a reality. There'll realistically be 4 categories, however: Those in the EU and the Euro, those in the EU, those in a 10-year probationary period to join the EU (5 years is too short...10 is a better metric of a country's long term economic and political stability), and then countries that may be considered at a later date (once they meet a certain metric). 

As a Greek living in the US, it pains me to see my family suffer so much. But in reality, in 5 years they'll be doing a little better and we Americans over here will be the ones with the REAL problems...

I think Blizzard are fast turning into the next Sonic Team in the way that modders are already beginning to produce assets for StarCraft II better than Blizzard themselves can (just look at other melee maps like the GOMTV ones, the iCCup ones, the MOTM ones etc.)

And when I say ""fast turning into the next Sonic Team"", I mean look at how far the Sonic the Hedgehog series has gone down the shitter! There are actually fanmade games that exceed the crap the Sonic series has unleashed upon the world in recent years.

Also, Sonic Team have introduced unnecessary and usually shitty gimmicks into their games i.e. the Werehog in Sonic Unleashed, Silver the Hedgehog, vehicles and weapons from Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic 06', that have often made the game much less enjoyable to play. Blizzard are beginning to do the same by introducing ""macro"", ""rush"" and ""normal"" maps. And judging by how the maps are, I can probably describe each style like so.

""Macro"" is where no starting position favours the other, the rush distance is respectable and there are an abundance of expansions to take.

""Rush"" is where the starting positions are close together or the map has destructible rocks all over the fucking place, or both.

""Normal"" depends on spawn positions. It can either be far away, signalling a standard macro game or close-by-land where scouting becomes near impossible (because of close rush distances and the paths of the two spawn locations not crossing a Xel'Naga Watchtower) and your only viable option is to rush like a motherfucker.

In fact, this makes me hope that external ladders made in protest like NTBL are launched without Blizzard implementing a Warden-like system to prevent their usage and that they succeed. Hell, I'd fucking use NTBL instantly if it weren't for the fact that it was currently NA only and I lived technically in Europe.",0,t3_iecl1,0,t5_2qpp6,True,Jin Air Green Wings,t3_iecl1,t1_c23432n,False,1427305865,True,0,Clbull,JinAir,c23432n,0,,1309562359,0

&gt;Stereotypical Germans love warm beer

Or maybe german beer is good enough that it doesn't have to be chilled into oblivion to taste good ;)

&gt;German ""smarties"" candy is totally different then American ""smarties""

Really? What can be done different about chocolate with color around? ;)

&gt;Germany don't give a single fuck.

This. Nobody is going to close anybody's Kirmesbude due to copyright complaints...

&gt;Any tips on how to be frugal in Germany?

Hm, yeah, a few. I'm a student after all ;)

Internet: Get it from Unitymedia (cable) or 1und1 (DSL) or Vodafone (DSL) or whatever, just not Telekom. Too expensive. I'd always prefer the former as long as the house has cable access. 16MBit/s for 20€, 32MBit/s including phone and digital TV 30€. Never get UMTS (always bandwidth caps) and check out the cheapest DSL plans for bandwidth caps in the fine print. Cable is preferable whereever available. Check for contract lenghts, 24 months are not uncommon!

Mobile phone (or Handy, as we say): Do you call people a lot? If not, get a used or new phone from eBay and buy a prepaid card e.g. from simply (simplytel.de). 0.08€/minute and per sms and no monthly fee, plus you can set your credit to be recharged automatically to e.g. 20€. In Germany you don't pay for calls you receive, so don't worry about that. Quality of network coverage in descending order: Vodafone, T-Mobile (both near perfect), O2, ePlus. Many prepaid cards use the latter, stay away from them if you plan to be anywhere else than the city.

Energy: Wherever you move, the local electrical company will never be the cheapest. Compare on verivox.de, stay away from prepaid offers and dubious bonuses (you can deselect them in the search). You can usually still save, I e.g. pay 0.21€/kWh instead of 0.24€ and I can leave the contract any time. When buying appliances, check their energy usage. A freezer e.g. should at least carry the ""A+"" label. [Check this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_energy_label) for more info. Ditch bulbs, get CFLs. Eliminate standby-use. Always remember, this isn't the states, energy costs about 3 times more than what you're used to.

Heat: Is fucking expensive here. If your appartment has traditional radiators, get electronic programmable thermostats and set them to turn off during the day. 

Shopping: Aldi and LIDL are your friends. Sure, LIDL treat their personnel like shit, but did you care about that at WALMART? See. McDonalds and Burger King are fairly expensive here, if you want cheap grease on the go, get a Pommes Currywurst. Never buy electronics in a store, always check out geizhals.at (set to ""Germany"" using the flag) and buy online. Anything ordered online can be sent back within 14 days and you always get two years warranty. Learn to appreciate Döner while on the go. Sometimes stores offer bread from yesterday for half the price. I've never found anything wrong with that.

Car: How much are you going to drive? Diesel is cheaper here and available everywhere, taxes are higher though. A small diesel powered german car is a nice way to get around. Unless you'll only drive 20km a day, get a gasoline car then. I have no idea how much you want to spend, so tell me and I can recommend you a car. Rest assured that all your experiences from the states don't work in that sector. Suggestion: Audi A2 TDI 75hp. Doesn't rust, cheap VW/Audi parts available, uses 5l/100km, awesome community available.

Bike: Get a good one. Not from the homestore, go to a bike dealer. It's fairly flat where you live. Use that.

being sick: Go to the doc. That shit is free (well, depending on your insurance the first visit per quarter costs 10EUR), so do it. If you have private insurance, you can go anywhere. If you have ""gesetzliche"" insurance, your personal doc sends you to the specialist he deems fit for you.

That's what comes to mind for now - feel free to ask whatever else you want to know :)

Anarcho_Capitalism,"&gt;the sole purpose of the govt is to somehow take away or erode what more goods we may have consumed in future and have us consume in present.

That's just not true.  Why have environmental laws, building codes, banking regulation, etc if the goal is to live in the now?  Some sectors of government that are poorly managed in some countries may have this effect, but it's not government's sole purpose, is it?

&gt;Almost all the indicators you suggested are a side effect of higher capital accumulation. 

Yes, but not always completely capitalist economies.  In mixed economies.  In fact, some of the most strictly regulated, highest taxed, most socialist countries in Europe have the highest rankings in indicators like these.

AskReddit,"I think we're getting away from the argument at hand, but:

There are 200-400 billion stars in the galaxy. That's a lot of room for expansion. Even if you wanted to argue that interstellar travel is (and will always be) impossible/impractical, that still leaves us with the entire solar system, and the raw resources to maintain a population in the hundreds of billions, if allocated efficiently. 


Likewise, the exponentially increasing population is due primarily to the requirements and deficiencies of our present civilization (ie. a need for children to help with labor/care for us when we are old and a lack of understanding about birth control)


Look at the world's most developed nations, already in Europe many nations have a (unfortunate) negative population growth. Improved contraceptives, education, and a lack of a need (rather than desire) for children would further reduce this rate.

languagelearning,"A few notes:

* 3.) ""quiser"" is just ""querer"" conjugated in the future subjunctive, which Spanish is losing.  It's used in daily speech, but you'll survive without it.

* 4.) ""eu sou"" is actually the verb ""ser"", but Niubai's comment explains this already

* 8.) ""cara"" means guy, man is actually ""homem"".

* 9.) t's and d's change sounds before the ""ee"" sound.  Unless they have some kind of accent over them, final e's are pronounced as ""ee"" and final o's are ""oo"".  And the s thing you can ignore because that's just the Rio de Janeiro accent, it's not something that everyone does.  Also, r's at the start of a word and all rr's are pronounced as ""h"", so you get ""rato"" (meaning rat) said as ""ha-too"" and ""errado"" (meaning wrong) as ""eh-ha-doo""  Otherwise, roll your r's like in Spanish.

Finally, and this is the tricky part for English and Spanish speakers, vowels with a tilde or before n or m are nasalized, meaning that you pronounce them kinda like you're humming.  That's something that's hard to explain in person, but almost impossible in writing, so you'll need to hear that for yourself.  Examples are ""não"" (meaning no) or ""um"" (meaning one).

TwoXChromosomes,"Clubbing in Swansea, Wales, was awesome and horrifying at the same time. A hilarious parade of freak shows, and yet I was among them. Popped collars like you wouldn't believe. Vagina curtains like you've never seen. Outrageous accents, 80's music, and more. It was trashy and glorious. 

I went with my friends, who were on the same MA course as me. Drinks were always super cheap in Swansea, so people get fucking wasted. Fast. This can either be hilarious or scary. I saw instances of both, though I personally never felt threatened because they always have loads of police guys around on weekends. 

Oh man, halloween was one of the most amazing experiences there. So much trash. So much shiny. So much tastlessness. So much fun. It was as if the gates of hell had literally been opened and they all decided to go clubbing in Swansea, where every other place tries to pretend they're classy, but ultimately, it's Idols where everyone goes, because let's be real: this isn't London. This is Swansea. So get that third vodka and coke for 2 quid, because dammit, they're playing that Rihanna song again and omg LET'S DANCE!

They had this now defunct gay club called Hush close to the train station. Omg it was epic. A basic cover charge got you free drinks the whole night. So you can imagine the crowds it pulled... in fact there were hardly any gay people at all. It felt like a club from the post-soviet area of eastern europe. 

I confess, it can get old though. And I absolutely hate hang overs so I would always be careful with my drink, which made me then have to babysit my friends who'd get so plastered by the end of the evening. If anything, having friends who don't know their limits is the worst thing about it.

travel,"Wander through my blog and you may get some ideas. Just a few basic tips.


1. Travel light. Luggage can get very heavy when you have to carry it all any sort of distance by foot. Don't end up looking like a large backpack with a small, very weary person attached.


2. Don't over-plan, but do plan the critical bits. Things like visa requirements (my lot in Oz can be very strict, especially if you intend to work here, countries like Russia and India can be a pain or expensive or take a long time for visas - so check in advance), the first hotel/hostel on arrival off a plane or train, how much cash you will need for basics in each different new currency etc.


3. Do the research on local mores (what to wear in mosques, what may cause offence in public etc) and laws (don't litter in Singapore, don't kiss in Dubai and so on) when festivals occur (don't wear good clothes on Holi in India) and things like public transport systems and their fares, sites to see, things to do, places to go. 


4. It sounds like you want flexibility. I've used One World rtw tickets twice and their Global Explorer ticket once. On other trips I've used discount fares found on the web from various airlines, most recently AirAsia to get from Oz to Europe via India return for under $1000. The major rtw tickets all require travel within twelve months; that may limit you. You may be better off looking for the discount tickets within a month or two of needing them, using sites like www.kayak.com and skyscanner.net or www.travelzoo.com to find the best deals. I use those to find them, then go to the source to book.


That's enough to start with, this is getting too long :)

socialism,"[part 4]

&gt; The task of socialists is to politically clarify the working class - to dispel illusions in every nationalist tendency of the ruling elite. This is not going to result in immediate popularity - but it points the only way forward for the working class.

I absolutely agree. But then while we're on that subject: why, then has the WSWS whitewashed or made excuses for reactionary nationalist regimes like Iran, Syria, and Libya? Why has it vilified opposition movements in those countries, and slandered them as middle-class, bourgeois or puppets of imperialism? That's the same position of Stalinists and Maoists - to claim that some struggle against ""imperialism"" supersedes struggles for democracy or even socialism, and that nationalist regimes, even overtly right-wing nationalist regimes, somehow deserve to be defended as guarantors of national independence against imperialism.

To be fair, in Libya, the WSWS initially was [supportive of the popular revolt](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/feb2011/pers-f23.shtml):

&gt; The desperate attempt by the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to drown the uprising of the Libyan masses in blood constitutes yet another brutal and tragic proof of the bankruptcy of Arab nationalism. It has once again laid bare the inability of any section of the Arab bourgeoisie to realize the aspirations of the masses of the region for genuine liberation from imperialist domination and capitalist oppression.

&gt; Gaddafi’s evolution over his four-decade-long rule of Libya saw his transformation from the leader of an anti-colonial movement with mass popular support into a butcher of his own people. This did not develop overnight.

... [before deciding to diminish criticism of Gadhafi or support for the revolt as soon as the NATO intervention began](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/jul2011/pers-j01.shtml):

&gt; During this period, Gaddafi was signing major oil deals with US and European corporations. Then, for reasons that have never been clearly explained but are clearly bound up with the geostrategic interests of the European powers and the US, a decision was made to topple the Gaddafi regime and install a government that was even more beholden to the interests of imperialism. Maybe they think Gaddafi is the ""lesser evil.""

&gt; After first attempting to remove the government through support for the ""rebels"" in the east and west, the US and NATO are now adopting a more direct method.

Before you completely misrepresent my position, *there's every good reason to oppose the NATO attacks on Libya*, but *this should not lead to some sort of whitewashing of the Libyan nationalist regime* and attempts to depict what the *SEP itself* initially recognized as a mass revolt to merely an imperialist conspiracy.

&gt; This answers your question about whether the SEP provides an alternative...Yes, it is the only party fighting to build a mass socialist movement of the working class against the Democrats, the Republicans and independent of the thoroughly corporatised unions, as part of an international movement. Above, you seemed to suggest that there was absolutely no alternative to the ISO's perspective of complete integration into the union bureaucracy, and slavish support for the Democrats...If you think that, they frankly, you're no socialist...

I didn't at all say there's no alternative. I said that it's incumbent upon you to demonstrate an actual alternative by actually doing it, and showing that alternative strategies can be successful in the real world.

&gt; The SEP alternative has been tested in practice - it has organised an independent movement of working people in Detroit against the policy of utility shutoffs being carried out by DTE, with the support of Bing. The ISO would never do something like that - after all, it would involve a break with the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy. Moreover, the fact that these policies are being carried out in Detroit by a black mayor, a black, Democratic bureaucracy etc. completely refutes the perspective of identity politics which the ISO promotes...

&gt; The SEP intervened in Wisconsin calling for a political general strike, the removal of Walker, and a break with the Democrats. When the SEP called for this perspective, the ISO yelled out ""no, no""...Pretty revealing? And herein lies the refutation of your dismissal of the conflict between the SEP and the ISO as ""some bizarre blood feud"". In practice, the perspective of the ISO means defence of the Democrats, and the union bureaucracy when the working class is coming into conflict with these forces...The differences between the ISO and the SEP hinge on all of the fundamental questions facing the working class. eg. Should developing struggles be subordinate to the Democrats, or should workers make a political break? Internationalism vs nationalism? etc.

The problem is that the effectiveness of a strategy is based on whether it actually works, whether it actually produces results. I agree that the ISO's strategy is a failure. I'm just adding that the SEP's strategy is also a failure. If the SEP's strategy is effective - then why didn't it succeed in actually bringing about a general strike and the removal of Walker? Why didn't it succeed in winning the workers in Wisconsin over to this position? If the SEP has, for so long, repeatedly been ineffective at actually gaining mass support among workers workers and successfully organizing them in a successful struggle, doesn't that say something about their strategy? Even the utility shutoff thing - while it's commendable to take up that issue, it's also one that doesn't involve actually organizing workers in the workplace, engaging in strike actions, etc.

&gt; You're claim that the Democrats are a lesser-evil is absurd. Obama carried out the surge in Afghanistan, has made assassination a semi-official government policy, and has launched an illegal war against Libya. Domestically, he supports the handing of billions to the banks, and paying it back through massive spending cuts...

As I stated a million times already, I am not claiming that the actual objective policies of the Democrats are generally in any way significantly different than the Republicans. What I did say was:

&gt; To the extent people are disillusioned with the Democrats, and who isn't, **they either regard them as a lesser evil, or go over to the Republicans and their far-right-wing ideology.** Unless you offer some substitute for defending the immediate material interests of the working class, you're just pissing in the wind.

I was not endorsing the view of the Democrats as a lesser-evil. I was describing the observation that many people in general, including much of the working-class, still regard the Democrats as a lesser-evil. I don't know how many times I have to restate this before you people will learn basic reading comprehension.

AskReddit,"I cringed when I read ""advanced culture"" - saying so denotes that one culture is somehow better than the other and I take Jared Diamond's view in ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" that no culture is inherently better or more advanced, rather cultural creativity is just expressed differently.  

Race (skin color) has nothing to do with how a culture will act.  It just so happens that whites/Europeans due to numerous factors (read Diamond's book) had an upperhand in promoting their cultural values – this is what we call The West.  The emergence of the Enlightenment in a ""white"" Europe gave rise to the importance of the 'individual' (and I’m condensing a lot of history here) and this resulted in what I believe is a culture that has to always be ‘on the clock’ – “my individual freedom is hindered by your always being late”.  

This is in sharp contrast to how most of the world lives (which just so happen to be mostly people of color) which is communally.    You always think of yourself in the context of your family – to be an individual is second.  This type of cultural value (the family and yourself as one single unit) I think breeds a way of life where time is not so much of the essence.  You take stock of th finer things in life: laughter, communion, and just being in the moment – time isn’t of the essence because you measure your life differently.  

Just travel and see how the different cultures of the world operate – I guarantee you, the historically “white” influenced countries (United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, etc.) will feel more rushed and individualistic and most other countries will have a culture that is much more relaxed and people generally aren’t staring at their watches.

The nurses at my pediatrician's office all suggested having a beer or a small glass of wine in the afternoon, because it really helps the mother relax, can make breastfeeding a lot easier, and can help mom get through those first weeks. I was very weary of this, but I did find the occasional beer helped my milk supply. And a nice beer after a stressful day really helped me relax.

politics,"The public housing you refer to were attempts at 'slum clearance' insisted upon by private builders so that the land could be taken and newer more expensive real estate could be developed. It was the rich who lobbied government to warehouse the poor like animals, that is the Rand reality. 

You didn't mention rent controlled housing. A very successful program which has allowed countless numbers of middle-class families to rent and live in areas that would otherwise be priced out of their reach.

The space program was designed as a military program to compete with the Russians. Safety was not as big a concern as winning the space race. The actual number of US astronauts killed is about 4%, which is much, much lower than the number of fatalities seen in the early days of aviation.

The federal agency, and regulations you speak of are controlled by the lobbyists from large pharmaceutical companies. The regulations and testing are designed to cost so much that small companies with new treatments are hampered from bringing those new drugs and treatments to the market to compete with Big Pharma. Again, just the way Ayn Rand would like to see it done.

The US highway system was built, largely, with the backing of the automakers to make car travel more accessible than public transportation. Europe has many more regulations on road building and thus have a more effective public transportation system.

The 'deregulation' of the phone system hasn't happened yet. I think what you are referring to is the break up of the Bell System, under federal anti-trust laws. The resulting telephone companies have conspired, through lobbying government, to keep the wireless and mobile phone spectrum reserved and exclusive.

So many of the problems you blame on government are actually caused by large corporations lobbying the government to serve the interests of those same large corporations.

2. Conduct a full investigation into Visa/Mastercard's actions with respect to violation of articles 101 &amp; 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

It's about abuse of dominant market position.

It's worth noting that EU competition law (and this may be unique to the EU for all I know) requires a company that dominates a market not only to not abuse that dominant position, but also to act with ""social responsibility"".

Also scholar do not mention the lot of slaves in these societies, nor do they paint a realistic picture of the life of Dhimmis or women in these societies. Compared to today's notions of Human Rights and democracy, those society would be viewed the same way as we view Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Somalia, etc. The expectations we have today towards our fellow human beings and government are so much higher, that the mention of a Caliphate as some sort of Islamic ideal, doesn't sound less scary than the idea of Iran being a ideal islamic society.

IWantOut,"Funding is a big deal in Europe. One of the reasons I'm looking to Germany for my phd is because the UK will almost never fund US students (eg overseas, non-EU) for their phd. 

The process is a lot quicker and more regimented. In the US, a typical phd program will roll the masters into it and be usually 8 years, since no one ever, ever finishes in the 6 that's predicted. However, you're not really kicked in the rear to get in gear and get your stuff done and get out. In the UK, for example, the phd for physics is 3 years and they basically kick you out after it. 

The tradeoff is that you're not doing slave labor the whole time. In the US, you'll be teaching classes, doing labs, grading homeworks, etc. The phd students in my department don't come anywhere close to doing that. So the funding is about the same and you're doing your own research instead of your advisor's and putting yours on the back burner for later. However, it is shorter and some places may be looking for [x] number of lab experience years before you apply.

Usually, in Europe, you can get a phd then apply and get a post-doc and after a few years have the same level of experience as someone who came from a US grad school slave labor camp. I would imagine that, after spending something like 5-6 years in a foreign country, you may be eligible to apply for citizenship. Depends on the country, though.

Maybe you should have ""German Day"" at home, where the two of you speak no English from sunrise to sunset, and you use a book to make up the difference as you learn.  I suggest this because of:

Thought #2: you should ask her about her growing up, and what things of her childhood does she want to ensure your child has which are unusual in the States.  (Of the ones that are impossible in the States, you'll have to be sure to visit Germany and do them there.)  Are there German nursery rhymes, or lullabies, or whatever, which you don't know?  Is she doing anything to help you learn them?  Can you find some at Amazon.de, or can her mother send you some?  Also:

Thought 3: a friend of mine is married to a woman from Europe.  They very carefully saved and arranged to spend an entire school year living in her home country, not far from her extended family in an apartment.  He took a year off work, they rented out their large US house as a way to supplement savings, and he got a work visa there.  The kids went to that country's schools for a year, they traveled on school holidays to places she loved to visit when she was growing up, and so on.  They got one of those European RailPass things, and visited Paris, London, Rome, and other such places.

You don't want to do this when the kids are really young, because they won't remember it at all.  But you should ask your wife, ""When Egbert is 12, we could try to live in Germany for a year near your family.  We'd have to plan well in advance, but I'd like our kids to have a real knowledge and appreciation of their mother's heritage and life.  I want them to know their grandparents, not just on video, and not just for a week-long visit, but for a longer time, to really *know* them.  I want our kids to see the places we lived before they were born, and the place we met.  It would be a lot of work, but I think we could do it.  What do you think?""

soccer,"Wait so they have to be conceived at the club grounds to be a youth product? Is that the measurement we're going by? By the way Messi was 13 when no other club, either in Argentina or in Europe, would take him -- except for Barcelona. Pique's grandfather used to be a board member in Barcelona; he's as much of a youth product as you can get. You need to check your ""facts"" better mate. Anyway, signing youth players is not ""stealing"" in any sense of the word. I don't think what Wegner did with Cesc was stealing and nor do I think Barca signing promising youth is stealing. I don't think you know what stealing actually means and are letting your dislike for Barcelona colour your judgement. Every single one of these players spent considerable time in Barca's youth teams, learning to play Barca's way, before moving to the first team. They were not bought as stars, but they were spotted by scouts and trained up. But hey you have a problem if Barca buys star players or grooms them anyway so I guess it makes no difference.

Spain has a fixed set of laws regarding youth recruitment and all clubs follow it -- why single out Barcelona? Because lots of kids want to go there? *Oh noes, what an evil institution.* And again, all clubs try and sell shirts. Seems a bit silly to single Barcelona out or hold them to some higher standard. 

And I say Cesc clearly wants to move because he said so last year, and this year has said he'd give his % of the transfer fee to Arsenal if it helps makes things go smoothly. If you don't think Cesc wants to go then you're in some special level of denial. However this doesn't mean Cesc will definitely go this summer -- but next summer he'll be even cheaper.",2,t1_c237b2i,2,t5_2qi58,True,Barcelona,t3_ierpm,t1_c237hvh,False,1427307472,False,0,vooglie,6,c237hvh,0,,1309620187,0

I was really fortunate to have a job working on a chartered yacht in greece for 2 weeks. The greek islands are amazing! If you go to greece i would recommend heading to hydra and ios. The views from hydra are amazing and the parties on ios are great (tons of canadians!). If you can manage to get on a boat that is going to ""kleftiko bay"" then do that without question.

Most major religions in Europe proselytized heavily as part of their belief however Judaism doesn't do this. In fact we actively try and dissuade people from converting because we see no good reason for you to do so. In Judaism you don't need to be Jewish to go to heaven and by converting you are essentially signing up for extra responsibilites for you and your future generations.

Libertarian,"Backpedal much?

They still routinely reverse engineer, routinely violate international patents, routinely violate each others patents.  They file them to have competing countries bared from duplication in counties like the USA, Germany, UK, Europe.  They are using it as a monopolistic tool that it is while pissing all over other's IP. 

With asking me to provide counties filing patents that don't observe IP you're the one asking to prove a negative.  I've provided you with a clear example of a country that doesn't enforce IP routinely and you can't admit that I've proven what you were after. Having IP &amp; enforcing IP does nothing to inspire innovation and invention.  Such progress is the net result past accomplishments; such accomplishments will continue to flourish regardless of IP being in existence or not.  Enforced or disregarded or patently violated.

askscience,"I'm sorry if my point was unclear- I'm actually abysmal at articulating what I'm trying to say. 

I understand that traits that appear grossly maladaptive can be beneficial to survival in some environments. It's true, for example, that sickle cell trait is profoundly advantageous in regions with endemic malaria. But these isolated cases of increased fitness are not sufficient to justify widespread phenotypic variability in the global population. 

I gave examples of some other genetic diseases to help articulate this point. Take cystic fibrosis. This is surprisingly common AR disease, with as many as 1 in 25 European Caucasians carrying 1 allele. Homozygosity yields expected life span of ~30 years (with modern medical intervention), and 97% infertility in affected males. In no way can this disease be considered advantageous, or under any positive selective pressure. And yet it persists in the population despite the fact that it is strongly disadvantageous. 

The great fallacy of evolutionary biology is that we are inclined to believe causative relationships simply because they make sense, rather than appreciating that evolution is predicated on something approximating controlled genetic entropy.

Get to know this girl and in addition to daytime activities add some social/drinking/dancing evenings to the mix. If there is chemistry on these nights, it may be a go.

Europeans tend to hook up in a more fluid manner, rather than the more formal American style of asking someone on a date, bringing flowers, going on your date, kiss at the end of the night.

My advice is to be awesome, don't stress about the relationship side of things, hang out with her more, and turn your daytime activities into nighttime activities.

If she tells you explicitly that she isn't interested in a physical relationship beyond friendship, no means no, but the 'dating' side of things is more nuanced in Europe.

WTF,"While I understand the argument you are trying to make, it has some holes in it.  First, if you look at the current top reply, there is no direct place you can donate to the KKK, so it basically makes this whole thread meaningless.  But, lets play that it does allow you too.  Visa/MC have every right in their own discretion to pick and choose which business they want to deal with.  It happens all the time actually with credit card companies and which is why you see only some restaurants take certain cards.  While I'm not saying it looks great for Visa/MC if they were hypothetically allowing you to donate to the KKK and not Wikileaks, one could see the argument as to why Wikileaks is much more of a ""questionable image threat"" than the KKK.  Maybe some will disagree with me and I'm not saying its right, but this is probably where they are coming from.

Second, the comparison to the cop scenario is completely different.  Visa/MC are private sectors, Police are the government(basically) and are public servants.  Credit card companies can pick and choose who they want to help/do business with, cops cannot.  Also, the scenario you stated, which may happen is probably only an extremely small percentage of the time and those cops would be in a world of shit if it ever got reported.  So much shit that it wouldn't even be worth it to them as they would potentially lose their jobs and possibly go to prison, all for a case that wouldn't stick to the guy who they ""caught"".

Libertarian,"&gt; A statist is a man who believes that some men have the right to force, coerce, enslave, rob, and murder others. To be put into practice, this belief has to be implemented by the political doctrine that the government—the state—has the right to initiate the use of physical force against its citizens. How often force is to be used, against whom, to what extent, for what purpose and for whose benefit, are irrelevant questions. The basic principle and the ultimate results of all statist doctrines are the same: dictatorship and destruction. The rest is only a matter of time.

This is a nice summary of the European treatment of Native Americans, which Rand seems to have endorsed.

&gt; Statism is a system of institutionalized violence and perpetual civil war. It leaves men no choice but to fight to seize political power—to rob or be robbed, to kill or be killed.

AskReddit,"As someone who moved to Houston from another country too, here is what I have learned:

1. There are no seasons here. One day the sky will be barfing water, the next it's 100°F. However, it doesn't really ever get cold here (Northerners laugh at us for freezing when it's about 30 degrees)

2. Get ready to start using the American measuring system. It still confuses me. Makes no sense.

3. Hurricanes aren't that scary. But I live more inland; those closer to the coast probably have it worse. 

4. Religion can be a pretty big deal here. I've never met any *hugely* religious person, but if you say something contradicting someone's beliefs, some won't hesitate to argue with you.

5. Houston is actually pretty diverse. Sure, there's a lot of Mexicans, but there's also Salvadorans, Indians, Vietnamese, Guatemalans, Cambodians, West Indians, Filipinos... you get the idea. Although I have never met anyone European. 

6. This goes with the above- because the majority of the people here are Hispanic, learning Spanish is recommended.

7. There's a very strong Republican vs. Democrat divide here. As with religion, if you don't agree with someone's political views, they will immediately start to verbally attack you. I have lost a few friendships because of this.

That's all I have to offer as advice. I'm still a young'n. 

And this isn't a tip, but rather a comment- I don't know about others, but if I met someone from England, I would force them to talk nonstop so I could hear their awesome accent.

climateskeptics,"&gt;How are taxes part of a peaceful society? How is income parity a driver vs. an outcome of a peaceful society?

This might be one of those cases where one might, justifiably, say that correlation does not equal causation but overall countries with high income disparity are the ones with the most social problems. It's common sense that a handful of people exploiting millions will create unrest. If you would consider the US a proper high income disparity nation is also in the eye of the beholder, mainly because regardless of the few super rich there are still plenty of people considered middle-class. I personally think that a nation where 44 million out of 300 million are on food stamps has something seriously messed up with their system. (edit: This is actually a bit wrong here on my part because in most European countries government aid is given as money and not food stamps. Effectively for the very poor it achieves the same as money but many Europeans still associate food stamps with WW2 scarcity and as such they are viewed very negatively. I suppose the only problem I have with them is that it creates a sub-currency in which only the socially lower classes trade in.)

It's a complicated issue with the US and I'm not going to scream the typical Nordic social-liberal dogma as there is no obvious solution to the inflamed US federal budget situation. I just feel that if a reasonable approach is taken with social-security, it wouldn't just be about feeding bums with federal money. I'm trying to point out that not all taxes are evil and some of it might very well be buying the rich people the freedom and safety to spend the remainder of their well earned money as they see fit. 

Obviously a nation where everyone is equally poor and miserable is not a happy place either. Cliche'd as it may be, there can and should be a balance between financial reward and looking after the failures.

&gt;Who are you to say that USians aren't happy? (last one was j/k)

This depends on your viewpoint but Americans in general have long working hours, very little vacation and are in general stressed out about their life. I feel that the whole issue is a bit fuzzy and whether one believes research and ""research"" on the topic is completely up to the individual person.

AskReddit,"Put in simple terms, here's the argument, without the normal rhetoric.

Rich people (*6) have money, which is capital.  They buy or open factories/companies/etc which employ people.  When you lower the taxation rate, you are essentially giving them more money in which they would open more companies, leading to more employment.

You will hear three basic false arguments against this;

1) They just invest in funds/etc.  This is irrelevant because all money must 'work' in order to earn a return (however, see #4 below as well).  Funds invest in capital markets one way or another.

2) Taxes don't actually increase the money because it only affects income.  Although true in a sense, this omits that money declines in value over time due to inflation.  This requires real assets to keep up with, and real assets need to work.

3) This has been 'proven' to be false (or true).  It hasn't, and the reason for it is because it differs depending on social structure, trade barriers and existing tax rates.  There is a big difference between 100% taxes and 99% taxes, but a very small difference between 0% and 1%.  Hence, some european and scandinavian countries did better with lower corporate tax rates but very high personal rates, or just marginal decreases.

Ok, so there's the argument in a nutshell.  It's not really false, but it's not the whole picture.  Here's a few details and examples of where it goes wrong;

4) You can get a return on capital simply by lending money to someone else.  So, a rich person doesn't need to put his capital to work in a way that increases employment.  Replace rich person with a corporation, or a series of them.  Take universities and students as an example. They could give you student loans, charging you interest, and essentially simply churn the profits that way.  Or, take an extreme example that happens socially - you could buy up a significant amount of land and rent it out.  The key point here is that these goods have effects similar to indentured servitude, but are a lot less obvious.  This particular argument is a lot more complicated than the examples above.

5) Investments are often public.  The argument for tax breaks fails here because you do not need a concentration of money, and without that, there is a basic economic equilibrium that occurs.  Concentration of money causes more and more distortions in that equilibrium.  Consider:  You have some money and go to invest it in a company because you want to make money.  The return is too low (ie: taxes or whatever), so instead you go out and spend it.  By spending it, you are helping someone else get a return.  By consuming, you are paying the taxes for the company anyway, and you'll invest once the return rises to the point you are happy with.  So taxes are a bit of a red herring to the real argument, but by framing it as a taxation issue, people attempt to direct it away from the actual allocation of capital.

6) Taxes on rich *people* will only result in them consuming more of their money, not less.  If money is not being worked with or used for consumption, it more or less ceases to exist.  A natural result of that is for the federal reserve to print more money, increasing the pressure to do something with the money.  Hence, taxation is more or less a non-issue for rich people.  

7) The fairness card is often played.  Here's the basic answer for it.  A person pays taxes for the infrastructure and social support for their money.  Without that, money and private rights would have no meaning.  For example, top 1% owns ~35% of the wealth in the US and pays for ~35% of the income taxes. It's actually pretty similar all the way down.  (Data available from IRS and Google, easily).


The arguments for it are simple, but the actual issues are a lot more complicated.  This gives a lot more power to the pro arguments.  Data really tends not to support tax cuts as well, but both sides have reams of bought economists arguing one way or another.  A lot of anecdotal evidence (chart R vs D in terms of debt, unemployment, etc.  D's perform significantly better) supporting higher taxes and infrastructure spending, rather than tax cuts and other supply side policies.",1,t3_if4iz,1,t5_2qh1i,True,,t3_if4iz,t1_c23943a,False,1427308333,False,0,Spectralshift,,c23943a,0,,1309640298,0

worldnews,"Not only he is a socialist, he tried and seemingly succeeded to spread more leftist views in the IMF. And in fact, the IMF seemed to appreciate him very much, given he led the organization back to the forefront. 

According to Wikipedia:
""Strauss-Kahn made comments that could be perceived as critical of global financial actors, in an interview for a documentary about the Late-2000s financial crisis, Inside Job (2010). He said he had attended a dinner organised by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in which several CEOs of 'the biggest banks in the U.S' had admitted they (or perhaps bankers in general) were 'too greedy' and bore part of the responsibility for the crisis. They said the government "" 'should regulate more, because we are too greedy, we can't avoid it.' "" Strauss-Kahn said he warned the officials of a number of departments of the U.S. government of an impending crisis. He also said: ""At the end of the day, the poorest – as always – pay the most.""

Referring to his diplomatic efforts to secure IMF aid for Europe following the 2010 sovereign debt crisis, economist Simon Johnson described Strauss-Kahn as ""Metternich with a blackberry"". In May 2011, referring to the IMF's change of heart in favour of progressive rather than neoliberal values, Joseph Stiglitz wrote that Strauss-Kahn had proved himself to be a ""sagacious leader"" of the institution. Following Strauss-Kahn's arrest for sexual assault in New York, economist Eswar Prasad said that should he be forced to step down, the IMF ""will find it hard to find as effective and skilful an advocate for keeping the institution central to the global monetary system"".",0,t1_c238dca,0,t5_2qh13,True,,t3_iezt6,t1_c2396bc,False,1427308353,False,0,el_muchacho,,c2396bc,0,,1309641085,0

I don't have anything specific to say because my course was UK-based, but the reason I'm interested in planning is the [perhaps naive] notion that you're helping people socially. Planning well can increase standards of living, which can have a multiplier effect; if you're happy, you might work harder, take more interest in your health, encourage others to improve their sol, etc. I'm really interested in improving social housing and I don't know what that's like outside of the UK and a basic knowledge of Europe, but high-quality social housing can have an amazing effect on people living on/below the breadline.

investing,"Woops. To read the full article, you need to be a member! 

Here is a quarter of it...

In this first article for the Aim Shares Forum, I will reflect upon everything that has happened to the UK market, along with all the other economic factors that may be affecting us on a day to day basis. There are several factors that have at the moment been overlooked by most PI’s. Here is a break down:

 
 
•	Our economy remains in a poor shape
 
•	We need to retain our triple A rating
 
•	The base rate would need to increase
 
•	The Sterling continues to shed value against the euro
 
•	All of the quick-fix and stop-gap measures are unsuccessful

 
 
The inflation rate is at 5% pa and this seems to be considerably higher on staple requirements. Ideally, the BoE and economists would want to raise the base rate to 3%. Being a political hot potato at the moment, the dithering continues and no decisions are being made. These actions are affecting the UK market along with several other reasons, resulting in AIM falling from 890 on the 1st of June to 834 on the 28th June 2011.

 
By analysing the FTSE100 over the last month, there has been a down trend as it decreased from 5989 to 5674 on the 23rd of June. For the last week there has been a sharp increase to the main index pulling from a variety of factors, but predominantly because of the European Union having bought time in the resolution of Greece’s economy. Another main factor that has affected the UK markets is the strength of the Euro. All governments have a budget deficit and during 2010 into 2011 the percentage debt of GDP for the UK has increased where Greece has had the largest debt. Greece has been lent too much money and this has resulted in the interest rates increasing drastically and borrowing becoming harder to acquire. Greece’s total Debt is 340 Billion Euros and after evenly distributing this amongst the population of Greece, it is more than the average income per year.
 

The fear that Greece may leave the Euro can result in other countries following closely behind, and this shows dark days ahead for the UK markets, especially with AIM as such small cap companies will feel the squeeze relative to their net earnings.
 

On the brighter side, there are IPOs lined up for listing on AIM. Two known companies are holding back, uncertain of the reception they will receive. Both of these companies have full order books and are selling their innovative products to developed and emerging markets. Their balance sheets are sound and they need private investment capital to expand globally. This shows that there are companies that are ready to come into the public eye but hesitant in such an economic climate.

They kept assaulting them with enough bodies that the Germans couldn't stop firing long enough to swap their barrels, so they warped and ruined the machineguns. 

Yeah.

The US joined the war against Germany in early 1942, first fighting across Afrika, depriving Germany of badly needed oil resources.  As the Allies landed in Italy, further German troops were diverted from the Eastern front to delay the Allies and maintain a friendly government as their southern neighbor.  The threat of an allied invasion of France, though it took about a year to set up, also diverted major resources in the production of Fortress Europe.

All of this is ignoring the vast quantities of supplies that the US sent to the Soviets via convoys through Murmansk and Archangel, notably the munitions and food that the Soviets were desperately lacking.

It was a collective effort.  In the US, we have downplayed the level of import of the Eastern front (75% of German forces were occupied there), but it is equally incorrect to use raw casualty figures as the primary means of determining who did what work.

http://www.whale.to/b/mullins41.html#Rockefeller_Support_for_the_Bolsheviks

&gt; Many Americans are puzzled by the relentless devotion of the Rockefeller Foundation to financing Communist organizations in many parts of the world.  This dedication to Communism can be traced back to a crucial moment in the Bolsheviks’ march to power.  In 1917, Mackenzie King had established a lifelong relationship with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. whom he met in June, 1914.  They had been born in the same year, 1874, and seemed to agree on everything.  Soon, King was working closely with Frederick T. Gates and Ivy Lee to further the Rockefeller “philantropies”, which seemed to view Communism as the ideal vehicle to bring about world brotherhood. 

&gt; King wrote to this friend Violet Markham, “John D. Rockefeller Jr., the truest follower of Christ, has one purpose – to serve his fellow man.”  King resolved that his one purpose was to serve Rockefeller; he testified for him at the trial investigating the Colorado Iron and Fuel Co. massacre before the Walsh Committee (the Rockefellers later tried to have Walsh framed and expelled from the Senate, but failed due to the obstinancy of Burton J. Wheeler;  J.Edgar Hoover played a crucial role in setting up the frame).

&gt; The Rockefellers helped Mackenzie King obtain government contracts for the Canadian Army during World War I, which set King up for later blackmail (the “Panama” hold over the vassals).  King sold hundreds of tons of rotten meat to be sent to the Canadian Army in Europe;  boots of “leather”, which were mostly pasteboard and which disintegrated immediately in the watersoaked trenches;  rifles that jammed when they were fired;  and collar type life preservers (previously condemned) which broke the soldiers’ necks when they jumped into the water.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Rockefeller family is sometimes called the first family of the Soviet Union.  When Nelson Rockefeller was nominated for vice president in 1967, Pravda indignantly denounced his critics, saying that charges against Rockefeller were designed only to discredit him, and that the accusations came from ultra right wing organizations.  Senator Frank Church, attending the 1971 Dartmouth Conference at Kiev, was amazed to find that “David Rockefeller was treated like we would treat royalty in this country.  The Russian people appear to evince an adoration of Rockefeller that is puzzling.”  When David Rockefeller’s plane lands in Russia, crowds line up to greet him at the airport, and line the streets of Moscow as his limousine passes, hailing him with cries of RAHK FAWLER.  George Gilder remarked that no one knows how to revere, blandish and exalt a Rockefeller half as well as the Marxists.


The Rockefellers are waist-deep in the scum in this country.  Rockefeller was also involved in brokering arms deals between the U.S. and Russia (that's left out of the textbooks too).

&gt; Although Jacob Schiff’s personal agent, George Kennan, had regularly toured Russia during the latter part of the nineteenth century, bringing in money and arms for the Communist revolutionaries (his grandson said that Schiff had spent $20 million to bring about the Bolshevik Revolution) more concerted aid was called for to support an entire regime.  Kennan also aided Schiff in financing the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905;  the Japanese decorated Kennan with the Gold War Medal and the Order of the Sacred Treasure. 

&gt; In 1915, the American International Corporation was formed in New York.  Its principal goal was the coordination of aid, particularly financial assistance, to the Bolsheviks which had previously been provided by Schiff and other bankers on an informal basis.  The new firm was funded by J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, and the National City Bank.  Chairman of the Board was Frank Vanderlip, former president of National City, and member of the Jekyll Island group which wrote the Federal Reserve Act in 1910;  

As usual, the same names come up.  The Federal Reserve cartel.  The Rothschilds.

&gt; The Leninists quickly exhausted the funds advanced by the Germans when they reached Russia, and once again the Bolshevik bid for absolute power seemed in doubt.  To whom should Lenin turn but his powerful friend in the White House ?  Wilson promptly sent Elihu Root, Kuhn Loeb lawyer and former Secretary of State, to Russia with $20 million from his Special War Fund, to be given to the Bolsheviks.  This was revealed in Congressional Hearings on Russian Bonds, HJ 8714.U5, which shows the financial statement of Woodrow Wilson’s expenditure of the $100 million voted him by Congress as a Special War Fund.  The statement, showing the expenditure of $20 million in Russia by Root’s Special War Mission to Russia, is also recorded in the Congressional Record, Sept. 2, 1919, as given by Wilson’s secretary, Joseph Tumulty.

Of course, the Kuhn Loeb group is one of the principle owners of the Federal Reserve:

racism,"&gt;OK, where do I start: On #1, you state that they were slaves ""regardless of their treatment"". AFRICAN women, children and MEN were raped, the men in front of the others to send a message. Pregnant AFRICAN women were hung upside down and had there stomachs split open so their babies would spill out, as a message to the others. AFRICAN men had the arms tied to opposite facing horses and were literally ripped apart. I'm not sure where you heard that the ""founding felons"" treated Africans well, but somebody's selling you a dream. There is nothing in world history to compare to the horrors of African enslavement by europeans. It takes a special kind of ignorance to think otherwise.

I believe you have missed the point of my comment on #1. My point was that the slaves being ""fully incorporated into the tribe"" does not excuse the fact that they are still slaves. I have heard people say that Thomas Jefferson treated his slaves well, which is some bullshit told to paint Jefferson in a more positive light. A slaveholder is a slaveholder, no matter how well they treat their slaves.

&gt;6 I won't bother with. If your naive enough to believe that, a few words from me won't help you.

Not all white people are rich executives. There are plenty of poor-as-shit white people barely scraping by between paychecks. Just because someone is white *does not mean* that they are living well.

&gt;As for #7, with all due respect to yellowmix's comment, Black people do not benefit from slavery. When you are stripped of your heritage, your values are changed. Black people now value principles laid down by europeans, not true African values. So, the fact that some Black people are financially better off than others, they are all morally bankrupt, a product of european domination. No amount of money can change that condition.

Black people in America do benefit from slavery as citizens. As you said, this country was built on the backs of slaves. The prosperity this country gained eventually allowed this country to develop public services and infrastructure. Black people drive on public roads, get books from public libraries, and drink from a public water supply. So you see, in some capacity black people do benefit from slavery, although I agree these benefits are overshadowed by the oppression they face in our racist society.

&gt;8 - I don't remember saying they were the same. I will say this; ALL european groups discriminate against Black people. That is a fact. As a Black man, I don't have time to pick out the good from the bad. Two snakes look the same, one's poisonous. Do I administer each a DNA test? As a european, you are defending you self and/or your people, so am I.

All European groups have contributed to discrimination against black people, but not all individuals in those groups have. Not all of them are racists, so why do you generalize? Also, what makes you think I'm European?

&gt;9 - Pardon me, but FUCK all non-African slaves!!

Why? How can you justify that point of view? Personally, I found your #9 to be very offensive.

&gt;15 - You're right, this does speak for itself. I just hope you speak and understand english.

You're marginalizing the discrimination suffered by the disabled, fat people, and homosexuals. I agree that racism is a larger issue, but that does not mean other forms of discrimination are any more acceptable. Furthermore, the fact that racism is a worse form of discrimination does not mean there are not relevant similarities between racism and those other types of discrimination.Why do you believe homosexuality is a chosen lifestyle? Did you choose your sexual orientation?

Unlikely.  Europe is divided but hasn't really suffered from invasions in a long time.  The last invasions were actually by the US to fight in WWI and WWII, but I don't think that the US could have held the territory and the US was invited in.  The last real invasion was by the Ottoman Empire, a pseudo-European state.  Before that... I guess the Mongols bit at the fringe, and before that the early Muslims grabbed Spain.

A divided US would probably be a pretty stable place.  There might be a few wars, either between locals or domestic but I don't see a full-scale invasion scenario as being likely at all.

Libertarian,"&gt;In some ways it was weak, it didn't cover biotechnology etc, 

So what? I never claimed that the US patent system is the best, or that every IP regime has to cover every possible type of invention. Just that it's a hell of a lot better than having NO IP laws.

&gt;and many of these industries came into existence before they had ip protection

I don't care about industries. I care about INVENTIONS. You said Germany had IP laws and that it cranked out a lot of useful innovations. That's all I care about. 

Of course, it's also possible to have lots of innovations funded by the government and put into the public domain. Europe and the USA both do a lot of that too. But of course governments aren't motivated by profiits. Private enterprise is. So unless you want all your research to be government funded you need to give private industry some incentive to take the risks associate with R&amp;D, which means giving them an exclusive right to use their inventions. There's no point in investing millions of dollars and decades of research into a cancer drug if your competitor can come along and steal it for free.

&gt;America was safe though, was relatively rich in that the people were well off as opposed to Europe,

Are you out of your mind? America in the 1700s was POOR compared to Europe. Yet it had patents, and so Americans produced useful inventions like Eli Whitney's cotton gin.

&gt;IP wasn't enforce and didn't exist in the times of the most rapid innovation in biotech, software operating systems, etc.

We've had IP laws since this country was founded. There was never a time when we were producing rapid innovations in biotech when we did NOT have IP laws.

And if you knew anything about IP, you'd know that operating systems are copyrighted, not patented. Since I'm not talking about copyright (which serves an entirely different purpose from patents), I have no idea why you're bringing operating systems into the discussion.

Actually yeah, they did make those predictions.  They knew exactly what would happen.  They were just hoping that they were wrong.  I first realized this when I was reading The Road to Serfdom.  Hayek kept referring to this guy, Lord Acton.  Acton have some really insightful quotes about the 20th century.  He was born in 1834 and died in 1902.  Thomas Jefferson's quotes on banking and on the negatives of urbanization were quite astute.

They all saw it coming but they could do nothing.  If you were Thomas Jefferson, what would you have done?  I think that we can assume that he believed that the Constitution was going to be written by someone so it might as well be him.  There was a lot of interest in uniting the states to be strong enough against the European powers.  (Which was entirely justified, when you consider the war of 1812).  Also the states probably would have warred with each other, which was something that the people wanted to prevent.

His parents, my grandparents, were second generation and didn't suffer any discrimination that I know of and held factory jobs that were enough to put food on the table. My dad was able to go to college on scholarship (because he got good grades) and then got his masters through ROTC and the Navy. I doubt his fellow black students in high school had the same chance as he did what with the civil rights movement only happening in the mid to late 60's. For any of those black kids, the UNCF was probably their only shot at getting a college scholarship.

The No Irish Need Apply was before and during the Civil War I think, where many Irish were conscripted into the Union army because the general populace thought of them as the garbage of Europe and wouldn't give them work. Many Irish immigrants were escaping the potato famine (1845-1852) and America seemed to be the land of opportunity. Granted, they were dirt fucking poor, but blacks were still slaves at this point. I think that could be called a significant difference.

And on a side note, you must be one of the older redditors here considering your grandparents were living in 19th century America.

Guildwars2,"Along with what MrMango said, even though 650W might overdo it a bit it's nice to have more than enough, I notice you're buying thermal paste. You don't need thermal paste if you're not putting a different cooler on the CPU. The stock cooler has thermal paste pre-applied.

Also, the motherboard you've chosen has a Micro ATX size. The case fits up to ATX. There's nothing wrong with putting Micro ATX in that case, but Micro ATX is smaller than ATX and it has less ports. You only have 1 port for a graphics card, so you can't do CrossFire to get an easy upgrade, and there's only 2 slots for RAM.

You'd have to throw away (or store in case something breaks, my preference) old parts to upgrade.

If you'd upgrade to a ATX sized it might be more expensive. For the price, that build looks good. Obviously GW2's specs aren't released yet, but it should be able to run it very nice.

apple,"There's the man I wanted to have a real conversation with :p 

Though the power of the Unix underneath the pretty Aqua GUI is only available to those that know their way around a Unix shell (and I don't...but I'm learning!), the OS itself is still powerful to the novice user. It's arguably better than Win7 for the average consumer (I won't go into the business realm, yet), who also doesn't know how to dig around the command line to get things done. 

The limited adoption angle would have had me nodding in agreement a few years ago, but it seems OS X has gained some traction in Western markets, with Singapore being a standout in the East. Apple is already the second largest company in the world and they did that with some 5% global OS market share, 26% (north american) phone market share, and some 78% (north american) tablet market share. If they can succeed so much with so little, surely they can increase their market share a bit more? 

My prediction is that by 2020, 15% of computers around the world will run on OS X and in markets like the US and western Europe where it's already big, the market share will his 25%-30%. It may seem like outlandish numbers now, but if you compare where Apple was ten years ago (on the verge of bankruptcy) and now (second largest company sitting on 72 billion liquid assets), surely you can see why I think they'll succeed. 

And that success will be what calls 'mainstream' developers to develop for the OS. There's already a lot of support for the OS in every scene except for gaming (which, admittedly, is the topic at hand). I think we'll start seeing many more games released on Mac in the coming years. And this is nothing but good news for me...I want to learn my way around a Unix shell in OS X, and then start playing around with FreeBSD. IF OS X succeeds, FreeBSD benefits. It's only a matter of time before games start being released on *nix systems...hell, HoN is already available for Linux (As are a few other games).",2,t1_c23c88y,2,t5_2qh1f,True,,t3_ifdpd,t1_c23c9d0,False,1428199425,False,0,[deleted],,c23c9d0,0,,1309681740,0

politics," &gt;That people with white skin were brought against their will to this country to serve as slaves, to be bought and sold as property, and to have their children bought and sold as property, with no rights of any kind.

Irish slaves were treated worse than black slaves (the Irish were cheaper than africans) in America while it was still a British colony. 
http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-egyptian-hercules/the-irish-slave-trade-forgotten-white-slaves/

&gt;After the institution of slavery was made illegal, white people were not generally considered lesser humans, kept segregated and apart from ""normal people"" in sub-standard living conditions where they were denied basic rights and discriminated against and legally barred from participating in a wide variety of institutions, including most institutions of higher education.

Again, unless you were Irish, or Eastern European, or Jewish. 

&gt; Whites were never forced, by law, to respect policies that required them to seek out separate bathroom facilities, drinking fountains, restaurants, or to stand on a bus if a non-white person lacked a seat.

Whites weren't, aye. But on the west coast Asians had to use separate facilities often. Blacks weren't the only racial group to face discrimination. 

&gt;, they did it as a way of trying to reverse hundreds of years of discrimination and dig African-Americans out of the shitty position they had been beaten into. It was the only way anybody could see to counter the deeply ingrained patterns of discrimination that kept too many blacks in a hopeless, endless cycle of poverty.

And we get back to fighting racism with racism. The problem is that America doesn't distinguish between decedents of slaves and recent immigrants. 
A Somali immigrant gets the same benefits that are afforded to slave descended African Americans even though the recent immigrants don't come from a history of American slavery. This is a symptom of the problem in America, we say affirmative action must be undertaken because of past wrongs, but then we'll give the benefits to people who have never been wronged which exacerbates the same problem the program was supposed to fix. 

And on this same thing, ""shitty position they've been beaten into."" What of the black people who owned slaves? Did slavery put those people into a shitty position or did it put them in a lucrative position? Or are you just equating dark skin in America with being a slave?

And let's talk about getting out of shitty positions. Look at Asian immigrants, they started off worse than blacks (especially if you compare it on a 1890s and on basis). Often they didn't even speak English and many didn't plan on staying in America. However, by a lot of hard work from the community, Asians now have equal or greater participation in laudable activities (like getting degrees in mathematical sciences and earning high wages) than whites. But let's ignore that, yeah?

&gt;And these ""affirmative action"" programs have made a difference and dramatically changed the country we live in, but any quick perusal of statistics on poverty, education, income, etc. broken down by race will show you that we still have a way to go

Citation needed. What I know is that the black community's wages have been declining in recent years and more and more young black people are ending up in prison. nothing perpetuates poverty like all sorts of young men in prison. 

&gt;Do you get it, idiot? It is ABSOLUTELY NOT the same thing to offer somebody a scholarship because they have white skin as it is to offer somebody a scholarship because they have black skin.

But the problem is that we treat many white people like they have the means or somehow less acute needs because they're white. Or conversely, we presume a black person has greater needs because they're black. Quick question, who do you think needs more help in life, a black child of a black Supreme Court Justice or a white person who bounced around the orphanage system after their parents got busted for meth?

The fact of the matter is that we could conceive of situations in which there's * underprivileged individuals * that come from * historically privileged communities * and there's ** privileged individuals** that come from ** underprivileged communities**. 
Shouldn't policies and workings reflect this? 

Personally, I think all underprivileged people should be allowed to get help, don't you?

&gt;Because America has this thing we call a ""history,"" and it isn't a history of white people being systematically discriminated against for hundreds of years.

So many groups have been discriminated against in America. Mormons? Women? Catholics? Eastern Europeans? 
And if we expand the scope of the history (why not?) every group of people has been enslaved and conquered. Jews. Celts. Gauls. Mongols. Hans. 
You often have to be very strict with your definition of discrimination to single out one group.

&gt; However, as announced this week, a space-borne European satellite that should be able to measure these small scales too, doesn't appear to be registering any quantum fuzziness.

skeptic,"I sure hope many to most of the expenses are for safety features. That's hardly an argument for nuclear energy though.

&gt; Not really. I addressed this point in another post.

Believing that you can make human behavior safe and accident free is simply naive. Again, people fuck up. There are many examples of near misses in many western countries. You wrote in a different comment, that the Fukushima plants were built in an unsafe place. Did you ever think why that was possible? Are the standards in Japan so much lower then in America or Europe? I doubt it.
It was possible to build in the unsafe location because it was cheaper to build there. Same reason old and unsafe reactors are kept running as long as possible. It's cheaper.
We had a case here in Germany, where technicians were too lazy to repair a blocked pipe. So they simply rerouted cooling water into that pipe and let the pressure build up, hoping that would clear everything. Instead the pipe burst open. In another plant, they fucked up during construction. In the whole plant, red stands for cool and blue for hot. The solution for this problem was to put reminders up everywhere, that red is cool and blue is hot, because that was cheaper then fixing things.

Incidents like these on their own aren't really dangerous of course. For that we have safety systems. But when you analyze all the near misses or catastrophes you can see, that usually, you have several of these kinds of fuck-ups coinciding, which made the accident possible.
Fukushima, the earthquake alone wasn't the problem. They actually planned for that, but they didn't plan for the Tsunami.

Or have a look at the examples here: http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/03/nuclear-watchdog-report-highlights-near-misses-us-facilities
Most of them are people being lazy or the company trying to cut costs. Of course these ""near misses"" aren't that dangerous on their own, but they become fatal, when they coincide with another problem.

Or have a look eat Three-Mile-Island: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident
Especially this part: ""Three Mile Island has been of interest to human factors engineers as an example of how groups of people react to and make decisions under stress. There is now a general consensus[by whom?] that the accident was exacerbated by human error because operators were overwhelmed with information, much of it irrelevant, misleading, or incorrect. As a result of the TMI-2 incident, nuclear reactor operator training has been improved. Before the incident, training focused on diagnosing underlying problems; afterward, it focused on reacting to an emergency by going through a standardized checklist aimed to ensure that the core is receiving enough coolant under sufficient pressure.""

This is what I am talking about. People make mistakes all the time and it is impossible to stop them from it.

&gt; Nuclear has the lowest deaths/terawatt-hour generating capacity of any form of energy, even factoring in exaggerated numbers for Chernobyl, etc.

How exactly does Solar or Wind kill people? And do you have a link to a study for this?

&gt; Gen III+ and Gen IV reactors that are currently being built or are in development have a much longer fuel cycle than early reactors. Basically, they can get 90% of the energy from the fuel instead of like 5% which results in considerably less waste to dispose of that decays faster (tens or hundreds of years vs millions).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor#Advantages_and_disadvantages
Centuries, not decades, you can leave the 10 out of there. The part about the higher risk because of the new technology is also interesting.

As for waste, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_new_nuclear_power_plants#Waste_disposal

Sure doesn't look like there is any solution at all for the problem in Amerika or the UK. And when I look at the German reports, it looks even worse.

By the way, a bit down you can find this: ""In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires plants to finish the process within 60 years of closing. Since it may cost $300 million or more to shut down and decommission a plant, the NRC requires plant owners to set aside money when the plant is still operating to pay for the future shutdown costs.[44] In June 2009, the NRC published concerns that owners were not setting aside sufficient funds.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_new_nuclear_power_plants#Decommissioning

&gt;  A person with direct knowledge of Ms. Nagy’s version of what happened and her view of the I.M.F. investigation said that the affair — which was conducted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — was consensual, but that she had felt coerced because Mr. Strauss-Kahn was so forceful and so senior to her, making it hard for her to, in effect, say no. ...  she went on to say that Mr. Strauss-Kahn was “a man with a problem that may make him ill-equipped to lead an institution where women work under his command.”

&gt; An employee who had a brief affair with IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned the organization about his behavior toward women [plural] in a letter sent three years ago, a person close to her said Tuesday. ... Nagy's letter suggests that allegations that Strauss-Kahn had a problematic relationship with women [plural] had been known for years.

&gt; Thierry Saussez, a former adviser to Sarkozy, who took part in the TV show with Banon, said: ""All this stupefaction from people is sheer hypocrisy. Everyone in Paris has known for years he had something of a problem. *Not many female journalists are prepared to interview him alone these days.*""

&gt;  Christophe Deloire and Christophe Dubois, broke a taboo in their 2006 book, Sexus Politicus, about politicians' sexual behaviour. They wrote of Strauss-Kahn's tendency to ""seduction to the point of obsession"", mentioning, but not naming, female journalists who had been irritated by his gestures towards them. They also referred to one senior civil servant who didn't take up his offer to ""come up to his office to relax"".

&gt; The Socialist party MP Aurelie Filipetti recalled a ""very heavy, very pressing"" come-on to her by Strauss-Kahn. She said that afterwards: ""*I made sure I never ended up alone with him in a closed space.*""

Christianity,"From a Biblical view, I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with premarital sex. It isn't sin, it isn't wrong, it is not something to be avoided, and it is certainly not something to feel guilty about. The reason for this is because it does not exist.

Biblically, I think that sex=marriage. When you have sex with someone, you make a kind of bond with them. You marry them. For example, in 1Corinthians 6 Paul talks about sex with a prostitute. This is the lowest commitment possible type of sex. Certainly less bonding happens in this kind of encounter than occurs when two people who love each other very much and might get married someday have sex. Yet Paul still says that in this encounter, ""the two are united into one-"" they are married. So it is impossible to ""test your sexual compatibility before marriage,"" because once you test your sexual compatibility you *are* married. And the Bible has stern words about adultery, ie: having sex with someone else at a latter date. So make sure you are ready to commit to someone for life before you ""marry"" them.

&gt;The reason I mention ""today's society"" or ""modern times"" its because we are far more open about the issue of sex than the past.

You mean we are far more open about the issue of sex than Europe and North America of several centuries past.

The reason for my suggestion was not because Europeans don't know how to run datacenters (though the biggest datacenter in the EU is in Ireland, and owned by Microsoft), but because it's for a Microsoft product, and Microsoft would normally own it.

So it's not because Europeans don't know how to do it, but rather because it's Microsoft's product and would have been 100% of their datacenter anyway, if not for this Patriot Act law. Given the law, I suggested they hand over 51% of it to a European company.

The inherent feature that matters is the deep intertwining of government and religion.

psychology,"&gt; Let me begin by accusing you of using exactly the tactics used that I have identified in one of my articles regarding “ideological terrorism”. You are flagrantly distorting my words.

If I had bad intentions, I'd just bad mouth you with the community. I'm just trying to understand your position since I apparently come from a diametrically opposite ideology: secularism.

&gt; I said “this would not have occurred had there not have been forced legal mandates by the Israeli Civil Authority to impose special legal privilege to the terrorists.” Your response is: “…you are demonising the whole palestinian population by calling them terrorists….”

I understood your ""special legal privilege"" as being aimed at the palestinians in general living nearby. Were you referring solely to the two perpetrators?

&gt; Secondly, anyone with a heart who read about the slaughter of the Fogels and the psychological fight for recovery of their 12 year old daughter would weep

but I don't see offering an ounce of compassion to the incarceration of a whole population, why should I *show selective empathy only* to the Fogels?

&gt; In reality, I am calling them terrorists for what they did; not because of any nationality? When migrant workers return to a house after killing the parents and two children, because they hear a three month old baby crying, in order to slit her throat; who cares what nationality they are?

indeed… so why punish the whole palestinian people for criminal acts by a few? Is the Israeli government ghettoising russian immigrants because of their possible connections to organised crime?

&gt; I imagine that in your circles, if a terrorist happens to be a radical Muslim, it’s more sanitary to refer to him (in this case) as “an unidentified male”, to avoid being branded a racist.

on the contrary we practice discrimination, where the newspapers will gladly identify a foreign perpetrator, especially if said person is from Africa, Asia or Eastern Europe. Yet local perps are hidden behind generic descriptions to save their honour. I know and abhor this face of racism.

&gt; Who could made such a claim, that the greatest gift given by the Jews to the world was secularism?

for me it is. I'm not writing a paper or an opinion piece in some prestigious journal. COmments are inherently personal.

&gt; Many readers, in particular “People of Faith”, would find that expression as ill-spirited. I even experience it as a subliminal genocidal threat

genocidal threat? really?

anyways. thanks for keeping the conversation going for so long. I had no doubt we weren't going to agree on anything much but at least we could have a civilised conversation about it. My comments were probing public social issues, if you find these offensive then it's your problem.

AskReddit,"Does Google+ have a chance?! After two days on Google+ I think the question should be, ""Does Facebook have a chance?""

A point I've made for several years is that the social networking medium is in fact _not_ a natural monopoly - quite the reverse, it would be natural for people as a whole to just pick up and leave.

Let's compare and contrast with email.  Right now I have 255,064 emails in my gmail - this is 255,064 reasons not to leave gmail.

But I have zero reasons not to leave Facebook.  It takes one minute to sign up for Google+ (if you have an invitation) and I don't really care if a lot of my lesser friends aren't there yet and I can browbeat my better friends to join up and really, they're the only ones I care about.

Pretty well every gmail user will sign up almost immediately - and that's most of the cool kids.  Once the cool kids are all on it, everyone will be on it, and will welcome the chance for a spring cleaning of their friends list.

I've simply accumulated a lot of Facebook friends, but there are tons I have no idea who they are.  I assume they'll re-appear when I get onto Google+ but I don't care that much.

And Facebook simply doesn't work well for me.  I'm constantly missing things I'm invited to because I get invited to too many things, many of which are too far away for me to go to.  I can't do anything important in the chats because there's no way to find them again later.

Google+ is a game-changing event - and I think the game is now Google's to lose, and I think don't think Google intend to lose this one, and when they know what they are doing, their execution is amazing.

I actually predict that the Facebook IPO is going to be a massive disaster.  

Even before Google+ came along I was predicting the IPO was going to be a serious disappointment, simply because Facebook could never hit their $100 billion capitalization based on a single product with technical deficiencies and ambivalent feelings toward them by their users, and that the $100B assumed that Facebook had an almost certain monopoly of this market indefinitely, whereas in reality the possibility of a strong challenger appearing was almost certain, and the space is not a natural monopoly.

Well, here's the challenger, and I think by January 2012 it will be clear that at the very least, Google+ will be a permanent part of the social media landscape, but more likely, that Google+ has huge momentum and Facebook growth rate has slowed, or even turned negative in the key US and European markets.

So what will Facebook do then?  Will they go out at a $10B IPO?  That seems humiliating - but do the fundamentals actually even justify a $10B IPO?  Any such valuation of Facebook would have to be taking into account the ""lottery ticket"" nature of Facebook, perceiving that there's a good chance that Facebook will ""sweep the stakes"" and capture almost the entire ""Social"" market.  

But with the permanent entrance of Google+, that effective monopoly becomes impossible - and worse, any realistic valuation of the stock would have to take into account the ""anti-lottery-ticket"" outcome, where Google+ eats Facebook's lunch completely and Facebook goes into the Great Grey with the Social Networks of yore whose names are now synonyms for failed aspirations.

I also believe that, given the extremely low quality of the ads that I personally see on Facebook, it must be that their ad revenue has been gussied up somewhat, and once they've reached a near-steady-state size, it will become apparent that their return on investment is a lot less than anticipated. 

So what's going to happen then?  Well, my best guess is that in a time-honored American tradition, we're going to see the Rush For The Exits.  I think there's even a chance that there won't be an IPO at all, but it's certain that there will be lawsuits.

I'd like to say that it was a shame, but I never liked Facebook even for a moment, and I'll be glad when it's gone.",41,t3_ifl0w,41,t5_2qh1i,True,,t3_ifl0w,t1_c23du5m,False,1427310531,False,0,TomSwirly,,c23du5m,0,,1309713414,0
worldnews,"&gt;Right, but this won't be a huge selling point, because there are already european datacenters.

The selling point is Office 365, which is what the datacenter is for. To whatever extent Office 365 is sold in the EU, there is need for the datacenter to support it. This is the reason why Microsoft is involved at all, because of the cloud storage that Office 365 relies on, otherwise MS wouldn't give a shit. They are in the software business, not the data center business.

Now the question is how to support **their** product, given that there is a conflict in laws. US laws require that they disclose data to the US government if a warrant is issued. EU laws forbid this. MS is caught in the middle of two opposing laws.

I suggested that a way out might be to give control to some EU company (to the extent of 51%), so that US laws no longer apply to the datacenter, and everyone can live with the solution.

This is in no way a criticism of EU data centers, nor a comment on the degree of their need for giant American penis.

A dose of 5 rem will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem in a lifetime of 80 years.

Also, Dresden was hardly the most destructive bombing attack in the European theater.

We actually wound up leaving piles of equipment in Europe (and in other places in the Pacific as well) just so we could leave faster (see [Jeepneys in the Philippines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney), the French used 2 1/2 ton trucks for municipal work, etc.).

worldnews,"Jesus, such a normal reaction of Reddit. ""DON'T PERSECUTE ME!"" Did I say anything about *you* spreading misinformation? 

And that article is still retarded. We have very set cable monopolies in the US, granted they are regulated by the government, but the solution the article provides seems to be going over my head. Plus the sheer size of the US definitely explains one reason for why we have slower internet. Not to mention many Americans have cable boxes at home, which changes the entire angle for cable companies to sell. 

Many TVs 'in Europe' don't have 1000 channel package deals (much less 9000 or HD channels or Sports packages, etc), which allow for a company to boost the price. If you just pay a LAN line and internet package, it isn't that expensive. Or if you just lose your LAN line, get internet and basic cable it isn't that expensive (in the US).

As for whatever this means ""The German justice system doesn't know punitive damages that are a big part of these outrageous verdicts in the US."" I don't know. 

In 2006 Germany announced you could get two years of jail for downloading illegally and in 2008 arrested around 3,500 people for illegally downloading. The legal system has been backing off though, because it is clogging itself with stupid cases. Hence they simply send out these letters informing people that they can either pay a large fee (800 euros) or go to court and pay much more to lose.

In the US, beyond these random instances of people getting charged (btw the article you linked said that was ""the first action against an individual accused of illegal file-sharing to make it to the trial stage"" and it will likely go again because the fine is so absurd) it still seems safer to illegally download. So back to my original point: it isn't that bad, just in a different regard.

And as to my perception, the article is retarded again stating ""Europeans"" and ""Europe"" using these ever illusive and idiotic terms. There is no such thing as ""European"" internet or ""Europeans"" paying less for faster internet. There is however German internet, Dutch, UK, etc. and each country has its own statistics. Considering Germany was, if I remember, around 11th and the US was the 16th, and considering their size difference, I would once again say it isn't that bad.

Libertarian,"I don't think that other ideological concepts will just place blame on buzzwords. The people representing it will. It seems the real problem lies in the fact that other economical and political systems looks at parts of the system instead of trying to see it holistically. The article is a perfect example of both. 

The author sees the problem of laissez-faire politics without proper government intervention. The strikes during the panic of 1873 that were crushed by armed troops is not an example of the free market, it's protectionism and cronyism at its finest. 

The author goes on to state how switching back to the gold standard ""favored European financiers over indebted farmers and laborers"" except he can't see how this is another government regulation and instead implies the blame is from a lack of regulation. 

He further goes on about the lack of federal unemployment wages, further ignoring the fact that money had become extremely scarce because of the Silver Act. A Federal unemployment act would have led to further strain on the already indebted taxpayers, as everyone at the time was saving as much as possible. The amount of returns would have been minimal as the unemployed receiving benefits would have also began to save as much as possible, hoping to come out of the panic for the better. 

He also mentions the lack of a central bank to control deflation. Controlling deflation could have potentially helped save some jobs in the short term but could have also kept prices artificially high, decreasing the demand for American products overseas, even further hurting trade and economic recovery. 

His arguments are based soundly in Keynesian economics,  hoping the state will fix problems created by the state without admitting who the real thieves are.

I think what you are describing here (scientist with ""simple"" partner) is actually a classic pairing -- if the scientist is a man and the partner is a woman.  It may be an untrue stereotype, but it seems common that men like scientists and executives are married to women who don't have a clue what their husbands do.  I'm not sure how this works, perhaps the men get their intellectual stimulation from their colleagues and friends, and want their partner there to keep the home-fires burning, for love and comfort rather than for intense conversation.

But I think the issue you are trying to pinpoint is different: can someone with a profound constitutive curiosity about the world be partnered with someone who is not?  *That* is a tougher issue.   For me, absolutely not.

My father is a scientist and a mathematician, but mother can barely add and still thinks apes are evolving into humans.

TwoXChromosomes,"Those ingredients are more suited to addressing blemishes and problematic skin rather than oiliness. BP is actually banned in Europe (although only in skincare products and not in prescription medications).


You don't want anything too harsh on your skin so avoid alcohol, mineral oil, lanolin, parabens and artificial fragrance and colours (because these are just filler ingredients!). I only use professional products that I buy in spas, salons and online (mostly Pevonia Botanica or Decleor as they are both very natural) and I would recommend that you look at professional brands' oily skin lines because they will have better quality ingredients, give better results and their products undergo more rigorous development and testing. They aren't always cheap so go for a cleanser and moisturiser to start, use morning and night and do so for at least 3 months to give your skin time to adjust. Things may get worse before they get better but improvements should appear within 1-4 weeks of continued use.


If you're able, book a facial at a local spa/salon- a good therapist will help you pick one best for your skin type and you'll get faster results. Ideally have one a week for 6-12 weeks but this can be unrealistically expensive; I have one a month which is often enough and really helps give my skin a push in the right direction. I used to have oily skin too but don't get a sheen anymore through a determined combo of at-home and in-spa care. 


Lastly, if you use a lot of make-up on your face this will contribute to the drying out of skin so try to use either mineral make-up like bareminerals (their Mineral Veil powder is incredible at warding off any sheen) or very light foundation tints so skin is not over-loaded. Again look out for alcohol content as this will just dry your skin out rather than correct the PH levels so it is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem.


Witch Hazel is good for blemishes but not oily skin and tea tree is far too astringent to use on its own- these will dry your skin out too much, leading to more oil production.

tourdefrance,"By the fact that they made contact, I would say that she was too close, but I'd put the blame more on the culture of the race, and the organizers, than the individual spectator. Bicycle racing in Europe has a long tradition of fan contact / interaction, and that, in combination with the logistics of the thing, has prevented the governing bodies from erecting barriers to prevent this sort of incident. Perhaps in the States, the litigious culture has forced more barriers than you see in the TdF, but I only base that on my few viewings of bicycle races in Illinois. Either way, I suspect the riders see it similar to bad ice in hockey, or a hitter friendly / batter friendly ballpark.

tea,"People might complain about the pushiness in Teavana, but the truth is that the employees aren't doing it to annoy or drive away the customers, or because they think that stalking you around the store is the best way of making sales, it's because the hours the employees receive depend on their sales.
In spite of it being called the ""Heaven of Tea"", in truth it is a ruthless, cold and cut-throat business, and I pray it never makes its way across the Atlantic to Europe.

It may be commission sales, but it's based on the idea that unless you make your hourly goals consistently then your hours WILL be cut, until you are let go. In the store I worked for it was $150/hr, and the circumstances in which myself and the new hires worked, this was a Herculanean task. The reason I was cut was because I was unable to sell that amount of merchandise. I would like to add that I was not allowed to work at the till (until I was ""fully-trained"", which never happened), so basically I was on the floor trying to convince people to purchase merchandise I wouldn't even sell to my mother, and make sure they would definitely buy that IMMEDIATELY, and try and get them to put a stick-it on it, so that it could be rung in as my sale...
Of course in the real world that doesn't happen as people don't and shouldn't have to commit to an overly-priced product without some deliberation. I'll reiterate, the pushiness is due to the wishes of management, none of the floor staff enjoy hassling..  

I decided to come to America for a few months for my summer break from college to work and get to know Massachusetts. In order to do that I needed work. I went to an interview with Teavana, and was offered a job that day. I was extremely excited about learning all there may be to learn about tea and learning more about being a sales person.

 However I found that my hours were not going to be fantastic so I took on a second job too, and thank God I did. 

I was warned by another Teavana shop that the particular one I was going to work for had a bit of drama. That girl was not joking.

From day 1 it was complete chaos. I started with two other people as well, and basically it was a senario where we alternated 1 minute between studying in the back room and the next going outside to help customers. There was no structure to the training at all. I find that asking customers do they need help initally and leave them to their business and make suggestions at the counter would be more effective, than the triangular process of get them in to the samples, bring to the cast iron and merchandise on the other side of the shop and THEN the tea counter. 

On the first day the manager said it himself that whoever of his new hires was able to sell the most merchandise, he would train with the register. Of course this is not an easy task as customers have just tea in mind, and most people don't enjoy having borosilicate glass, Bone China sets, or Tetsubin iron cast shoved down their throat. Unfortunately none of us made significant sales, as would be imagined, so our hours from day one were cut. 
On my third day, the manager was out until late, and one of the long-term assistants instructed me on the till, and I made a sale of $300, that was cast iron plus tea..of course I would never make such a sale again as the manager would never let me use the till.
Things went more downhill from there. I was feeling so worthless and fake, trying to keep up a smile and try and show people how wonderful Teavana was and spend time showing them the wares of the store, only to have my sales shut down or people say ""I'll come back, I need to think about it"", so I became more and more desperate, and probably pushy as per the orders of the manager that barked suggestions every few minutes if I looked as though I was leaving a customer in peace to browse. 
I couldn't work at the till, and realistically you can't make anywhere near $150 unless you sold the tea as well..At the end of every shift the manager would be extremely condescending, such as asking me to make a set of the cast iron and call it ugly, or have roleplays in which he told me that although the things I was saying was beautiful and detailed as per the volumious training manual, essentially I was boring and that customers are simple people with limited cognitive ability who just need short simple gimicks. 

Teavana is about fooling people.

So in the end, 4 of us were let go. My manager tried to call me on an unknown number while I was working at my second job to tell me not to come in to my shift on the very next day. I unwittingly went into my shift in Teavana, right after a shift at my other job on the same day, and he told me the news. He ""magnanimously"" offered that I could still work the shift and if I managed to make $500 in the 4 hours I was there then I could stay. Out of pride I worked the shift, and kept up my smile and upbeat form and got customers to the store, but only sold $70 in total, thanks to ice pitchers. So we had to part ways, the manager condesceningly offered that I could use my 40% discount that week only.(Like hell I would.) I thanked him and wished him the best of luck.
 Myself and two new hires and we weren't even given the chance to be fully trained until he decided to get rid of us. According to the Teavana guidelines, training is 21 days, according to my work records I worked 22 hours. Also, I still haven't been paid.

If I didn't have a second job, I would have been in lot of trouble. To be honest I'm delighted to be in the one job, which still has an intense pace, but it has a much friendlier atmosphere, and it isn't about pretence at all. It's a pity things didn't go well with Teavana, but things happen for a reason, and I pity people who work in that particular store that I was unfortunate enough to have wasted time working for.",1,t1_c1o5ta3,1,t5_2qq5e,True,,t3_gbi6g,t1_c23fwpj,False,1427311575,False,0,leonia,,c23fwpj,0,,1309736776,0

economy,"&gt;Late 70's? You mean 1770's? You realize there has been strong embrace of capitalism since the time of Adam Smith, right? You're pretty confused if you think the 1970's was when people started embracing capitalism.

Right ... there's been capitalism since the 18th century. However, thanks to the struggle of various movements (socialists, social-democrats, trade unionists, or even just middle of the road christian-democrats, social conservatives and what you in america call liberals), the initial ""wild west capitalism"" went through a civilizationary process, where increasing numbers of checks and balances were applied. 

That was a historical development that reached its apex in the 1950s and 1960s with the creation of the welfare states in Europe, and the establishment of secure pensions and medical care in the US for everyone, even those whom the capitalist flow of supply and demand did not care for.

This is, in turn, the model that free market devotees, from Thatcher and Reagan to the Tea Partiers now, have systematically been trying to destroy since the late seventies - nineteen seventies, yes. It is no coincidence that wealth inequalities, which had been stable in the previous 30 years, have soared since. 

This renewed turn towards unbridled capitalism has yielded plenty of GDP growth, to be sure ... except much of the population didn't see an extra dime, as the bottom half of the population saw its purchasing power stagnate or decline while the top few % saw its wealth skyrocket. Exactly the kind of excesses that had almost brought capitalism down before, and that had been kept in check by the likes of moderates -- Republicans, Tories and Christian-Democrats as well as Democrats, Labour and Social-Democrats -- in the couple of decades previously.",1,t1_c23czrs,1,t5_2qhpn,True,,t3_iezye,t1_c23g01a,False,1427311618,False,0,almodozo,,c23g01a,0,,1309737894,0

&gt;The oft-heard statement that male homosexuals were called faggots in reference to their being burned at the stake is an etymological urban legend. Burning was sometimes a punishment meted out to homosexuals in Christian Europe (on the suggestion of the Biblical fate of Sodom and Gomorrah), but in England, where parliament had made homosexuality a capital offense in 1533, hanging was the method prescribed. Any use of faggot in connection with public executions had long become an English historical obscurity by the time the word began to be used for ""male homosexual"" in 20th century American slang, whereas the contemptuous slang word for ""woman"" (and the other possible sources or influences listed here) was in active use. It was used in this sense in early 20c. by D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce, among others.

Fantasy,"Sure, why not, explaining helps to get my thoughts in order.

In no particular order,

Magic. Mages (haven't decided which of the many words for a magic user is best yet, so forgive me for inconsistency) use their innate spiritual/soul power to conduct their magic. They regain power gradually, much as you might rest and eat to regain your energy after a marathon. As a consequence, there is no magic that lasts without the creator's attention and presence.

Commonality of magic. The world resembles a medieval Europe trope in its history - all-uniting empire that crumbled, leaving successor states (I'm trying to give depth to the history and the successor states to make it non-trope; for one, the social and technological level of said successor states won't be much behind that of the past empire). The empire's approach to magic was a free academy for service system - come to learn, at the cost of service to the imperial magicians for some time. As the empire expanded, there were more and more mages trained, providing more and more magic services for less and less money, leading to mages forming a guild of magic to protect their trade from competition. The empire was forced to accept their terms and create an officially sanctioned guild monopoly on magic; accepting this was one of the causes of their downfall. (Yes, this is very libertarian in nature; no worries though, as political themes for the modern world are a background topic.) After the empire fell and independent political units came to reign, the guild gradually lost its official backing and associated protections from competition, leading to magic as a very middle class occupation in modern time, with interesting results - let's say servant golems for upper class homes (requiring, as you'll recall, the dedicated service of a mage), for one.

The various non-""human"" races - I take a different (from what I've read) approach to humanity and non-humanity. In theory, in my world, intelligent ""humans"" took longer to evolve and longer to acquire any sort of technology, due to magic. As such, various branches of the human race evolved to fit their different niches. 

The Mari (MAH-ree) are adapted to living around and in water, though they still require dry land to give birth and land foods for nutrients. They have five fingers, though what we'd call the pinkie has developed into a second thumb, the better to grab swimming fish with. They have webbed hands and feet to swim with; they grow only a ""mane"" of hair from the middle of their upper scalp on down to the middle of their necks; they tend to be taller and thinner than ""normal"" humans. They were responsible for much of the learning of the old empire, and have a chip on their cultural shoulder because of it. They traditionally count on the webs between their 5 fingers, leading to an octal system of numbers. They historically were more willing to travel around - it's easier to travel when you can swim pretty quickly and live in the ocean for a month or more at a time - so their language remains unified across the diverse places they live; as such, it's the lingua franca of commerce and learning, even though non-native speakers find it fiendishly difficult (it reads and sounds a little like a mix of French and Hawaiian, with grammsr features that are Algonquian in nature, lol linguistics nerdage).

We have boring humans doing boring human things. Being adapted for the most common terrain - flat or hilly land - they are the most widespread, though many country folk live in what the more urbane Mari would consider poverty. A variety of different cultures - hopefully, if I'm good enough, blending in different elements from our world so I have different and unique traits without having stereotypically Arab/Aiel/Fremen, Mongol/Rohirrim/Dothraki, etc.

Other races, not very well fleshed out as of yet, though they are involved:

The ice people (others can't pronounce their language to say their names for themselves - think African ""click"" languages) live in the very cold areas. They have body fur and a thick mane/hair that extends down to their lower back and grows long for warmth, though more cultured ones trim and color it. In contrast to ""northmen"" fantasy tropes, they are neither uncultured nor uncivilized, for reasons that will remain untold, though they do prefer to keep to themselves when possible.

Various giants live in various mountainous areas, which are both more extensive and more inhospitable than in our world. Some are primitive and virtually unknown to civilized people, while others are not uncommon sights in the great trade centers. Like the ice people, they are pretty insular in nature, and not much is known of their culture (i.e. cop-out for ""I don't know yet""). Giants climb good. They are different rather than uniform like the Mari because mountains encourage independent development while the sea provides no refuge from the wide world. 

The Unknown People of the Unknown Lands, far to the Direction - i.e. fantasy trope for ""I haven't thought of it yet because it's irrelevant to the storyline, but I should think of something soon to pique your interest"". I'm so interested in the men/Mari divide that I've neglected to consider anything more. There were Standard Fantasy Dwarves at one point, but I decided that they were both overly cliche and added nothing to my story.

Economy and development: because of the commonality of magic - which helps with everything from forging steel to automation to providing breathtaking entertainment - the level of the economy reaches that of the Renaissance, further in some areas; however, as magic is cheaper than investment in technology, but hasn't advanced in some time, there's a lot of stagnation. As far as fighting - our favorite part! - somewhat organized units (depending on nation); sword, pike, bow, crossbow, musket, and plenty of magic. Personally, I think the long intersection between the gunpowder and medieval styles of warfare - ""the age of pike and shot"" - is very interesting, and judicious magic only adds to it - though we may feel sorry for our characters, because larger battles with strong wizards on each side end up feeling like WW1 tech warfare.

Politically: I love the Herbert/Jordan/Martin system of ""houses"" with varying levels, and especially Jordan's ""Daes Dae'mar"", so I have no problem with shamelessly ripping off the ""Byzantine Politics"" fantasy trope. I'm hoping to keep quite a bit of variety around - my world has plenty of room and plenty of people to have all sorts of things going on! Systems different from House X, House Y, etc. are side attractions at the moment, though. I feel like if I could think of a unique and compelling political system to set stories in, it would be awesome, but I'm having trouble with it.

Geography: the world has one major continent, much as Earth once has Gondwanaland and Pangaea, encouraging contact between peoples. I have very detailed maps, because I love drawing maps - think unhealthy obsession level, countries the size of the UK down to creek and pond level. It's important to me as a writer to intimately know the places the action is happening in.

Well... that was unnecessarily long, lol. Any questions, feel free to ask!

politics,"&gt;First, a gold standard would have all the disadvantages of any system of rigidly fixed exchange rates--and even economists who are enthusiastic about a common European currency generally think that fixing the European currency to the dollar or yen would be going too far.

I'm not sure what this has to do with the gold standard. Getting back to a gold standard is saying $x dollars represents Y amount of gold. The purchasing power of $x (i.e. y amount of gold) is allowed to shift as the supply and demand for money and goods/services changes. I agree - would should definitely NOT fix our money to the value of foreign currency.

&gt;Second, and crucially, gold is not a stable standard when measured in terms of other goods and services.

This is true, but I'm not sure why it's a bad thing. It's much more stable than what we have right now, and if anything has become more valuable over time in relation to the goods and services people purchase.

&gt;With an ounce of gold, this example is even more dramatic.  Back in 1964, the price of an ounce of gold was fixed at $35.  Today, that same ounce of gold is worth $1210.  If you do the math, you will find that the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to gold has declined by nearly 98% since 1964.  

[The Purchasing Power Preservation Of Precious Metals](http://truthingold.blogspot.com/2010/06/purchasing-power-preservation-of.html)

&gt;On the contrary, it is a commodity whose price is constantly buffeted by shifts in supply and demand that have nothing to do with the needs of the world economy--by changes, for example, in dentistry.

Of courses prices change as supply and demand changes. That's true with the money we have right now. When the supply of money rises (such as through QE) the value of that money drops (inflation). Those who get the new money first (typically banks) benefit and those who get it last (e.g., lower income individuals, those on fixed incomes) suffer. However, right now the Fed can change the supply or demand for money on a whim if they deem it best. Under a gold standard it's the market that determines the value of money, not the government or the fed.

This [battle has been raging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) for a long time, but perhaps with the Internet as a means for large scale rapid dissemination of knowledge, the fight can be won.


Relevant bit of the wiki above (emphasis mine):
&gt;The Age of Enlightenment (or simply the Enlightenment or Age of Reason) was an elite cultural movement of intellectuals in 18th century Europe that sought to mobilize the power of reason in order to reform society and advance knowledge. It promoted intellectual interchange and opposed intolerance and abuses in Church and state. Originating about 1650-1700, it was sparked by philosophers Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), John Locke (1632–1704), and Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) and by mathematician Isaac Newton (1643–1727). Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered Enlightenment figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790-1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to Romanticism's emphasis on emotion and **a Counter-Enlightenment gained force**.

Also, more of a point of interest really, but here's what [Martin Luther](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) had to say about reason- 


""Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has: it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but--more frequently than not --struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.""
