The U.S. and its allies did the same. Do you know how close we came to mutual annihilation?

Did you read what I said?  The Soviets had double the amount of nuclear weapons as the US, overwhelmingly superior numbers in their forward deployed conventional forces and they had a history of grinding nations under their control to dust.  The best minds in the UK, France, Canada, US and the rest of the free world knew that the only way war could be avoided was to through the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.  To say otherwise is pretty arrogant because 1. it **worked** and 2. those people were contemporaries with the Soviets and understood the threat in a lot clearer way than this generation does because they saw it with their own eyes.  

&gt;I'm not advocating appeasement a la Neville Chamberlain, and I honestly don't know if, by 1939, there was an alternative to fighting Hitler, but those things didn't just suddenly occur; they were the result of decades of decisions and forces.

&gt;Here's the reference to ""we will bury you""

Yet again, you're not responding to my point, which was:

""The Wikipedia page I am looking at says different, but regardless of where the incident took place, a man with the capability of launching thousands of nuclear warheads at us, who controlled something like 50 armored divisions in Europe said, 'We will bury you' while banging his shoe on something! You know how it directly translated? It meant, 'We will bury you'.

People who don't take threats like that seriously don't live long.""

This is the link to the Wikipedia page I was looking at: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident)

&gt;My option to corrupt dictators would have been supporting the governments that the people themselves chose (e.g. Allende) and not helping corporations (e.g. United Fruit) influence and control the political and economic lives.
&gt;
&gt;That is, the U.S. didn't really care about the human rights and development in many, many countries, as long as those countries were ""on our side"" and stood with us against The Enemy. Most of South and Central America, large swathes of Africa, goons in the Middle East. There are more than enough examples.

So what you're saying is that you would have chosen my second option, which was to the ignore nations with corrupt dictators that were unwilling to reform at our request?  If we would have done that, the Soviets most assuredly would have swooped in and those nations would have come under their influence or control.  How would that have improved the lives of the people living there?

It's as simple as this:  Bad people were at risk of coming under the control of more powerful, really, really bad people.  If that would have happened, it would have made the world a less safe place.  Since the bad people weren't going to renounce their evil ways and become good if we asked them to, we had to play nice with them to make sure the really, really bad people didn't expand their sphere of influence and make the world a less safe place.

For the vast majority of things in life, if you try hard at them then you can succeed. If you try hard and fail, then the solution is to get your ass back up and try again until you are successful. I was taught to work that way and it's worked great for me for most things.

But it does not work when you're trying to win a girl over. And it's very difficult for me to get that out of my head.

Last girl I was trying to woo I did not know when to give up. Admittedly she was leading me on quite a bit with the amount of attention she showed me, and she was Socially Awkward Penguin incarnate so she hadn't really made her intentions (or lack-of) as clear as she should. But still, I should have left it alone.

She had a boyfriend who she'd met online who lived on the other side of the country (Canada, so not a small country) and who she had only met once. The fellow was still in high school and she was 22 or so at the time. The oddness of this led me to believe that I could totally seduce her away from him, since it really did not sound like this was a serious thing. 

Anyway I just kept trying at it. I never actually made a physical move because I didn't want to force her into cheating on him, I just wanted her to dump him and run away with me into the sunset. I asked her a couple times if she would do so, and she declined. She left to go off to Europe to study there for a few months and I packed her an adorable parting gift filled with a bunch of carefully crafted items (inside jokes, things I knew she'd need, etc), along with a note once more stating my intentions.

The best was that while she was away in Europe, valentines day passed. She mentioned that she was bummed that she was going to be alone over there on Valentines day, so I navigated some very confusing Dutch florist websites, did some super sleuthing to find out where she was staying and managed to send some flowers over to her place on Valentines. My grand romantic gesture did not have the desired effect.

**tl;dr:** Girl had a boyfriend, I refused to take no for an answer, bothered her for a year and sent her flowers while she was away in a foreign country. Did not go as planned.

LGBT rights is just another term for slowly allowing more and more deviant behavior, even the child abuse they supposedly prevented will be eroded by their own logic. Women's sufferage was actually opposed by a lot of women in it's time believe it or, the thought (and as we've seen since then), is that it breaks apart the family and divided households are highly dysfunctional. 

Basically, if it were up to feminists, men would be kept in cellars to be used strictly for breeding purposes, until the female geneticists (LOL, as if females make good scientists) could find a way to breed asexually. It's common for anti-feminists to say that feminism used to have a good goal, but frankly, it really hasn't.

&gt; Neither party is actually anti-war or pro-military cuts.

neither is Krugman:

&gt; If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap, look at the **large public works program** [emphasis added], **otherwise known as World War II**, that ended the Great Depression. The war didn’t just lead to full employment. It also led to rapidly rising incomes and substantial inflation, all with virtually no borrowing by the private sector. [(source)](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2009/02/krugman-is-wrong-on-wwii.html)

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

Of course what we're really interested in, in terms of standard of living, is resource usage per capita (very tightly correlated to quality of life measures). It's generally held by folks who promote economic growth (which is almost everybody who has an opinion about it) that growth is the means by which populations go from poverty to, if not abundance, at least a tolerably modest way of life. And this has been historically true. It's the rising-tide-floats-all-boats theory of economic social change; sure, the rich (in this case rich nations) get richer, but the poor find their lot improved as well.

So, here in the States we have the highest energy usage per capita, maybe twice Europe's and many times that of the poorer nations. So, if we stick to this model and wish (as they likely do) that the poorer nations might rise to at least a European standard of living, then that means an several-fold increase in their per capita energy usage. Even if the US and Europe (and probably you too, Canada) don't increase their standard of living at all--or if they do, they do it without using more energy--the global per capita energy usage has to keep climbing. A lot.

And it can't. We don't have it. More and more sources are pinning global peak conventional oil production at around 2004-6, and if it production begins to decrease, as it seems it must, it's probably impossible to bring alternative energy sources online fast enough to even make up for the loss, *much less* account for the growth needed to bring everybody up to a palatable standard of living.

Maybe some long shot like LFTR will swoop in and save the day, but I doubt it, and I certainly wouldn't bet the future on it. But even then, we *must* concern ourselves with:

* Freshwater access
* Nitrite contamination of water
* Potential decline in phosphorus availability
* Declines in a number of rare metals and rare-Earth minerals used in the manufacture of so many of those glorious things that we create economic growth by purchasing.

And finally, while I'm no deficit hawk, we have to come to grips with the fact that our economic growth, at least here in the states, has for the last several decades been driven not by the manufacture of products but by the issuance of debt. We now have national debt, consumer debt, and even student loan debt at such levels that they will simply never, ever be repaid. So as we consider the other constraints, we may very well be looking at ""peak debt"" and it's accessory, ""peak credit"", and we may be drawing close to both.

I'm (and i think the system should be) for ""college to cost less but fewer people go to college and more go to two year trade schools or associate programs."" Which (in my opinion) brings me back to what this post is about. 


People that get in debt to go to college and pay just the minimum and complaining about being screwed. (To be honest) These are not bright people. If they studied harder they could have gotten scholarships. Or they shouldn't go to college, or at least go to a cheaper college



Countries where it's cheaper/free to go to college actually have very little/or no scholarship programs by the school, government, or financial aid. (Tell me if i am wrong)



(Just my opinion) I believe the college system is set up pretty nicely. For example is you have excellent grades you could get a scholarship to Harvard. If you have almost excellent grades you can get a scholarship to a good private/state school. If you have good grades you can get a scholarship to a state school. 



If you have crappy grades... these are the people that take out loans to go to school, and lets be honest (while not all) but people that don't do well in high school tend not to do well in college.


 
Yes they are getting screwed, I just (for the most part) see it as them pretty much asking to be screwed over. Like the guy who says I owe xxx and i didnt even graduate yet! Well i just see that as, ""i know im going to get screwed but i did it anyways, and now im regretting it, yet im not doing everything in my power to help myself"" (Pay more than the minimum, live with your mom, get a second job, stop drinking, you should have studied more to get a better job) and he is calculating it at the minimum payment rate, and the same goes for (almost) everyone else on this post.



Oh and your comment about the disparity. While im not sure about Europe i can almost guarantee you that if you dont graduate from a good-great college in Japan/Korea you will have an almost impossible time finding a good/decent job.

&gt; If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap, look at the **large public works program** [emphasis added], **otherwise known as World War II**, that ended the Great Depression.

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

The main reason is NHL: I lived in Slovakia for 7 years, where they grow hockey players like you grow tomatoes. 

In one town, they played NHL games on the local-access channel and I guarantee you they weren't paying a license or keeping track of viewers. No one asked any questions like that. But lots of people watched.

Still, it would be an interesting chart even only counting legal broadcasts and industry-standard metrics.

My bet would be this order:

1) NFL (because of the legal-measurement bias, and that the US has such a large population, and that there are only four different start times each week).

2) EPL -- In Europe, favor is usually granted to the local league, and you'll have to go out of your way and/or above the basic tier to see games outside of that.

3) MLB -- but depending on how you measure it. The number of people who watch a *particular* mid-season game will be small; the number of people who watch *at least one regular season game* will be very large.

4) NHL -- This may be biased because I lived abroad where hockey is huge. But I think there are more populous, developed countries where North American hockey is a big deal than there are populous developed countries where the NBA is a big deal. 


5) NBA -- previous comment, China notwithstanding, but I do think there's a Yao Ming bubble and that it's a coastal thing.

Of course what we're really interested in, in terms of standard of living, is resource usage per capita (very tightly correlated to quality of life measures). It's generally held by folks who promote economic growth (which is almost everybody who has an opinion about it) that growth is the means by which populations go from poverty to, if not abundance, at least a tolerably modest way of life. And this has been historically true. It's the rising-tide-floats-all-boats theory of economic social change; sure, the rich (in this case rich nations) get richer, but the poor find their lot improved as well.

Absolutely. Could not agree more.

&gt; So, here in the States we have the highest energy usage per capita, maybe twice Europe's and many times that of the poorer nations. So, if we stick to this model and wish (as they likely do) that the poorer nations might rise to at least a European standard of living, then that means an several-fold increase in their per capita energy usage. Even if the US and Europe (and probably you too, Canada) don't increase their standard of living at all--or if they do, they do it without using more energy--the global per capita energy usage has to keep climbing. A lot.

Correct, usage of energy will be rising. 

&gt; And it can't. We don't have it. More and more sources are pinning global peak conventional oil production at around 2004-6, and if it production begins to decrease, as it seems it must, it's probably impossible to bring alternative energy sources online fast enough to even make up for the loss, much less account for the growth needed to bring everybody up to a palatable standard of living.

The most important thing to take into account here is how markets react to prices increases (in general meaning less supply while high demand) of raw material. I'll try to explain it using the example of copper in the 60's:

Copper was high in demand during the 60's due to increased demand of telephone usage. There was some worry that we would run out of copper before being able to wire up enough to meet the demand. The markets responded at first by searching for copper in places where it was previously too expensive, while at the same time more money was invested in finding substitutes for copper - which eventually occured (fiberoptics).
The substitute part in this story is the most important if we assume that peak oil has occured, as when prices rise enough to lower demand significantly, research for substitutes will also increase significantly.

&gt; Maybe some long shot like LFTR will swoop in and save the day, but I doubt it, and I certainly wouldn't bet the future on it. But even then, we must concern ourselves with:
Freshwater access,
Nitrite contamination of water,
Potential decline in phosphorus availability,
Declines in a number of rare metals and rare-Earth minerals used in the manufacture of so many of those glorious things that we create economic growth by purchasing.

As stated before, it's fundamentally important to understand how the markets and the price system in general tackles issues like these. To doubt human creativity (especially when there's big money to make) is simply a bad bet, considering our history.

&gt; And finally, while I'm no deficit hawk, we have to come to grips with the fact that our economic growth, at least here in the states, has for the last several decades been driven not by the manufacture of products but by the issuance of debt. We now have national debt, consumer debt, and even student loan debt at such levels that they will simply never, ever be repaid. So as we consider the other constraints, we may very well be looking at ""peak debt"" and it's accessory, ""peak credit"", and we may be drawing close to both.

This is something that I belive plagues most of the western world. It's a very valid concern, and the only result I can predict is a pretty nasty depression on the horizon (ironically, a depression/recession is actually the period of adjustment where a large number of individuals adjust their behaviour economically. Kind of like a healing process, whereas the Boom periods are those where the actual damage is done)

(To be honest) These are not bright people. If they studied harder they could have gotten scholarships. Or they shouldn't go to college, or at least go to a cheaper college

I tend to avoid analysis of individual cases. There's a lot of fuck-ups out there, but I can't really keep a person from being a fuck-up. My bigger concern is the way it effects the rest of us, which is something I feel we can impact with policy. The failure of my country to invest in higher education services is going to impact me, even though I worked hard through school, earned merit scholarships and am now completely debt-free.

Nonetheless, a student loan bubble is something all of us will pay for, in more ways than one.

&gt;Countries where it's cheaper/free to go to college actually have very little/or no scholarship programs by the school, government, or financial aid. (Tell me if i am wrong)

This is true, somewhat. The thing is that most countries (well, most developed, first-world countries) finance their schools on the backend, by essentially paying for their operating budgets. It's much like we do with K-12, or like we used to do with universities. Over the course of the past 30 years, we've paid less and less toward education, requiring us to rely more heavily on tuition to finance the costs of operations.

This is where scholarships and financial aid step in. Once college becomes more expensive, we try to reduce inequities through these ""supplemental"" programs. But again, just as with the student loan system, this is necessary mainly because we're financing schools with tuition now, instead of with general fund budgets as we did in the past (and our competitors continue to do).

&gt;While im not sure about Europe i can almost guarantee you that if you dont graduate from a good-great college in Japan/Korea you will have an almost impossible time finding a good/decent job. In fact (again im not sure about Europe) America has it very good for people that didnt graduate from College as they pay manual labor/trade workers a lot of money when you compare it to Japan/Korea.

Is this true? Both of these countries offer health benefits to all employees. Japan's unemployment rate is 4.1%, while ours is more than double that. Korea's is 3.1%, almost a third of ours. Norway's is 3.2%. I don't know that finding good jobs in the skilled trades is easier here, especially with unemployment in the construction sector near 13%.

Is it that the fewer jobs that exist are better-paying? And how are we valuing healthcare benefits here, as even minimum wage employees in Japan have full health benefits?",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w08v4

Well, I'm really not. I just wanted to clarify what really happened and to advise you to be truly confident in you answers before you make claims about things (ie if someone simply seached google for the us and canada wcg pages and took a skim at the rules and brackets, and then made the claims you did, there isn't sufficient evidence to make that claim)

I'm confused as to why you quoted back at me my statement about researching and making claims (well I'm not that confused, I'm guessing you wanted to take a shot back at mean after you assumed I was out here just to prove you wrong or something). I never even claimed that Jatt was ineligible for the USA qualifiers in my post (though I will admit I did think he should be DQd and still do, based on the rules). I just simply stated that to the best of my knowledge it seems very likely he played in the Canadian WCG qualifiers before the USA qualifiers. 

I made a long post earlier that talked in part about how foolish it is to dissect statements and rules word by word. What's needed is to integrate common sense into the interpretation of these statements. Like you stated you would need to get pretty technical if we were to argue that Jatt's representation is locked into the USA based on events from the past year. On the other hand I don't feel like any of my statements were anything technical. Going back to the common sense issue, I don't really feel it makes a whole lot of sense to lock in a person's country from year to year, to always have it apply retroactively. I can't really see WCG having qualms about a person who switches country from one yearly event to the next, so it would seem superfluous to create a rule that forced a person to lock into a certain country for over a year, when they would most likely overturn the decision the moment the player asked in the next year. Rather I'd say its more likely the context and true meaning of the rule is that one player is locked to a single country for one year, to prevent one person from gaining multiple attempts at going to WCG, which would probably be considered unfair for others and would go against the spirit of the nationality that WCG is structured upon. That's not to say you are wrong--it's not completely illogical that they would create a rule to lock in a player over several years-- but I would rule it less likely. So while you would be correct in saying technically Jatt is locked into the USA for this years tournament, by the specific wording of the rules, I would argue that in reality, he is not because it isn't a terribly sensible rule to have. Rather I'd argue they were not perfect in wording the rule but what they meant to say is fairly sensible, in that the country is locked for they year of WCG they are participating in. And of course this is assuming that last year's WCG was anything like this years.

But it wasn't. I'm not sure how much you know of last years WCG LoL tournament, but I'll assume you know nothing and go over it to be safe. Last year's LoL tournament at WCG was not actually considered an official tournament at WCG, but rather (I'm not sure what to call it specifically) a show match kind of tournament. At the time, LoL had barely just been officially released and WCG was its first real LAN tournament, and the largest tournament for LoL ever. There was essentially no competitive scene and Riot essentially organized and handled the whole tournament for LoL. There was no competitive scene and Riot actually created a list of players who would be eligible for WCG based on preseason elo. But the main point is, though the event was played at WCG, it was never an official WCG event. There were no national qualifiers, instead it was categorized by server. There were only four teams invited, one from all of NA, one from all of EU, one from China, and one from SEA. So it was neither an official WCG competition nor a WCG competition in a certain country. As you may know, CLG broke apart this year for WCG to create Canada and USA teams with TSM because they weren't allowed to compete as persons of different nationalities. As you might also know, last year CLG, who still had people of different nationalities on their team, won the LoL WCG tournament by beating SK.

The war didn’t just lead to full employment. It also led to rapidly rising incomes and substantial inflation, all with virtually no borrowing by the private sector. [(source)](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2009/02/krugman-is-wrong-on-wwii.html)

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

how long are you guys going to be dazzled by his Nobel Prize and New York Times column?  

did you guys know the Chicago/Austrian School economists actually have more Nobel Prizes than the Keynesian school economists?

i realy die a little inside every time i see a Krugman post on the front page.  i can't seem to find the right words, to express my disgust with Krugman, that won't get me mass downvoted in this subreddit.  do you people have no regard for the truth?  or the means by which it's discovered?  all the comments i write about Krugman are in fierce opposition to his person and what he has said in the past - he has acted as nothing but a mouthpiece for the U.S. government and the bankers that run it.


why do you people keep upvoting this guy?  are the votes on this site just fake, or what?  or do you really all buy into the lie that government spending is what makes a society prosper?

i don't know what else i can say.  it crushes me every time i see these threads.  nobody seems to give a fuck about my opinion, only their own opinions, and  opinions of the people they see on TV.  and i pour every extra minute of my time into figuring out what's true.  is science dead in America?

these people are turning this world into hell.  every word they say is greed-fueled lies, cloaked with the appearance of empathy and charity.  reddit, please find people to listen to that aren't piped into every home in America.

i only wanted one thing in this life, and it was for mankind to be free and survive.  is mankind going to create its own destruction?

""but my ideas haven't been tested..."" it doesn't take a test to know the outcome of something simple. if you remove an incentive, the thing that was incentivized decreases. if you remove capital, the things that were supported by capital decline. it doesn't take a test to understand that, which makes it fact because they follow from sound logical corollaries. until you point out specific things that refute those simple facts, you don't need a test to reasonably prove you are wrong.

i read every single one of your responses, and not a single one responded directly to my arguments. they just repeat the same adages over and over - ""we are slaves to the system,"" ""we must free ourselves,"" ""capital system is so evil because some people make more money that me,"" blah blah blah.

simple thought experiment to boil down all your bullshit. if you take away the capital system, how much does the economy grow? call that y. with the capital system, how much does the economy grow? call that x.
x - y = how much capital providers put into the economy. if x - y is &gt; 0, capital owners are good. if x - y is  &lt; 0, capital owners are bad. look at russia during communism when laborers got all profits and during capitalism when the capital system was reestablished: x-y &gt; 0. look at all the other eastern european countries: x-y &gt; 0. look at dozens of economists' models of a labor dominated state: x-y &gt; 0. look at China: x-y &lt; 0. wait never mind, China even under a communist regime embraces the system of capital, so once again: x-y &gt; 0.

don't act like you're such a genius that your ideas haven't been tried before. repeating the same buzzwords and pretending that you're a revolutionary that can fix the system doesn't make you right. you're not that smart, and you definitely aren't educated enough to make those claims if you can't even respond to basic economics. claiming that the current system is soo bad that it must be changed is a pathetic cop out to engaging in actual intellectual discourse. until you can step away from your ivory tower bullshit about creating a whole new system that will clearly work, your arguments are meaningless. they assume a worldview that is both impractical and ill-informed. the outcome you are imagining is just that -- imagination.

I'll leave you with a final analogy: before you can convince the whole world to start using your reinvention of the wheel, you must first prove that your reinvention is superior to everything currently learned in the field of mechanics. if you don't even understand the field of mechanics, how can you know that your reinvention of the wheel is better? my guess is that you can't. saying that we have to try to use your version of the wheel first because it might be better will not convince people to switch, especially if your version of the wheel has the risk of causing a lot of pain in the form of car accidents, etc. switching the economic system to something that has never been tried is ultimately an extremely stupid idea because of the hardship it would impose on so many people. even assuming the whole world would be willing to undergo that hardship to ""free themselves from economic slavery"" your imagination of that world makes no sense given human nature and the way modern economies work. populations will seek the more efficient system. communism in russia could only last so long when they saw how much more efficient america was. your system will last even less because it's less efficient than communist russia.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w0qxp

&gt; Neither party is actually anti-war or pro-military cuts.

neither is Krugman - here are two direct quotes of his:

&gt; If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap, look at the **large public works program** [emphasis added], **otherwise known as World War II**, that ended the Great Depression. The war didn’t just lead to full employment. It also led to rapidly rising incomes and substantial inflation, all with virtually no borrowing by the private sector. [(source)](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2009/02/krugman-is-wrong-on-wwii.html)

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

why do you people keep upvoting this guy?  are the votes on this site just fake, or what?  or do you really all buy into the lie that government spending is what makes a society prosper?

I wouldn't expect a divided super committee to have the same impact on the markets as the debt ceiling impasse, and I imagine the market has priced in some dramatic 11th hour (or sooner) solution which magically satisfies all conditions and extends deadlines.  Even if they fumble, the worst that can happen is the Super Commmittee's failure to reach an agreement would trigger automatic spending cuts over a 10 year period to defense ($500 Billion) and other Republican interests.  That's not really a market shattering problem in the near term IMO (though job losses would certainly factor in), as future debt ceiling hikes could be contingent upon more automatic spending cuts.

That said,  all markets are a confidence game.  If the Europeans can't raise money while the USA argues over spending cuts, investor confidence may simply disappear and people will pull out of riskier investments.  That's why I have a position in TLT (Treasurys) to hedge precious metals and long term stocks.  If shit gets real, it will happen fast.  Euro Banks would collapse, most bonds (corporate, muni, non-US sovereign) would tank, and panicked investors would liquidate their holdings directly into US Treasurys, Gold, and probably a few other currencies deemed ""safe"" (low debt/gdp and sitting on lots of resources).  This isn't a surprise, given the kneejerk reactions to previous ""oh shit"" moments.  

Because of the potential losses involved, this is an extremely risky time to be invested.  The last few times we've entered into panics, extreme rabbits were pulled out of reluctant hats, and the sky has yet to fall.  After all, these are the same (G-20) financial engineers who just orchestrated a 50% haircut on Greek bonds without setting off any credit default derivatives, while sending the Euro Tards prancing around the globe with a collections cup.  Time delays, failure to secure funds, and broken agreements could send everything into a tailspin.

My inlaws look down on me because I choose to drive a 10 year old car (albiet a 10-year old, fully loaded and fully functional european luxury car with 150,000+ miles, some dents &amp; dings and little rust blemishes on the exterior).  I paid $3000 cash for the car, get 32-35 mpg, and enjoy the creature comforts of Swedish Luxury.

But they deride me for driving a ""junker"" because it has more than 80,000 miles, and doesn't have a glossy paint job.   They rinse and reuse ziplock bags, buy shit they don't need (just because it's on sale and they think they're saving a few bucks), and absolutely refuse to buy a used vehicle solely on the idea of ""I don't want to buy someone elses 'trash'... if they returned it so soon, there must be something wrong with the car.""

They're currently looking for a replacement for their Excursion which is due to roll over 50,000 miles, and they want something that will tow their camper (but they don't want a pickup).

Between you and me, I am personally pretty suspicious of masturbation on the whole, full stop.  I think the universal praise it has garnered among ""experts"" in the field has almost no basis in the actual academic literature.  For several thousand years, masturbation's was tolerated but socially considered somehow bestial or subhuman -- at best, a morally neutral pale substitute to intercourse, at worst an unhealthy sign of deeper pathology.  Christianity carried this forward into its thousand-year reign in Europe, and taught consistently that masturbation was inhuman and injurious to current happiness and future salvation, thwarting ""God's design of interpersonal love"" or the natural law or whatever.  It was nevertheless widely tolerated among the laity, carrying strong condemnation but relatively light penances and lots of caveats about readmission into the state of grace.  (Indeed, the first known papal condemnation of masturbation, by St. Leo IX / St. Peter Damian in 1054's ""Ad splendidum nitentis"", spends more time talking about forgiveness for fappers than condemning the fapping in the first place!  He then goes on to condemn clerical sex abuse in terms harsh enough to send some in today's Vatican to the fainting couch.)  It's consistently portrayed as an act that thwarts true sexual love in both a physical and a spiritual sense.

Then the 18th century happens, and, inexplicably, absolutely everybody -- the rising secularists above all -- believed Marten's *Treatise of Venereal Disease* and its children, including Tissot.  Suddenly, the whole world believed masturbation caused actual *medical* problems, like blindness and madness, which had until then been old wives' tales at best.  By the end of the 19th century, truly horrific tortures, unimagined even by the darkest members of the Inquisition but in fact developed by Enlightened progressives, were widely promoted by such luminaries as Graham and Kellogg, all for the sake of reducing masturbation's evil physical effects.  It took another century for medical texts to start suggesting the obvious: that this was all bosh, that most people masturbate anyway, and they're not dead, are they?  Kinsey came along and confirmed that, yes, most people masturbate at some point in their lives.

And, that, according to every history I've read, was that.  Sexology determined that masturbation did not cause blindness, palm hair, or insanity... so therefore it must be a great idea!  But was there any actual science backing that up?  So far I've found no studies between Kinsey in 1948 and the AMA's decision to endorse masturbation in 1972 to justify that decision.  The literature of the time exhibits an ideological vendetta against the past that skews historical understanding of masturbation, demonstrates conclusively that masturbation is common and does no medical harm, then, noting that ""to demonstrate that an activity is medically benign is not equivalent to
claiming that is is beneficial,"" proceeds to engage in the wildest scantily-evidenced wishful fantasization I've seen since reading Lord Monckton's denial of global climate change.  The consensus that emerged out of that era has not since been seriously interrogated, so we have today a sexological field whose positive attitude toward masturbation has little more basis than the negative attitudes toward masturbation that were conveyed through old wives' tales and Freud's claim that masturbation caused neurasthenia -- yet which dresses its claims up as solemn fact and promotes masturbation as daily practice and therapy.  Indeed, today we have our own versions of the wives' tales, with people seriously believing that they could end up impotent or otherwise sexually crippled unless they masturbate early and often.  Much of what we have to do at NoFap is unpack those absurd ideas so that people who need help can give it to themselves.

In short, our culture still hasn't recovered from the masturbatory hysteria of the early Enlightenment.  The pendulum's just swung back the other way, to an embrace of masturbation entirely out of proportion to the available evidence.  My own experiences are inconsistent with the new consensus just as much as with the Victorian consensus.  The pre-Enlightenment consensus, on the other hand, makes a certain amount of sense to me.  It's not 100% of the way there, but it gets certain things about my sexual experiences right that nobody else has stated since.  C.S. Lewis, whatever else I think of him and his books (and who reportedly struggled with NoFap for much of his life), described how I feel about it pretty much exactly:

""I agree that the stuff about 'wastage of vital fluids' is rubbish.  For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself… After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison.""

So, personally, I suspect that masturbation is a hindrance to everyone's psychosexual well-being.  I suspect NoFap has stumbled onto something that neither religion nor academia has been capable of recognizing for the past several hundred years.  I suspect masturbation is inherently vicious, and whether the effects that show up in your life are large or small, visible or invisible, is largely a matter of luck and self-awareness.  I could be wrong.  But right now there's not a lot of science about it either way -- just an unaccountable ""consensus"" view without very much grounding in a holistic human anthropology.

And so I am a NoFapper.

I am definitely in the minority here.  I would say that *most* NoFappers would condemn only the excessive, disruptive masturbation that is ruining so many of their lives right now, and they would probably say that if you can fap ""in moderation"" (whatever that ends up meaning), more power to you.  This site takes no official position, but is generally geared toward dealing with addictions, as you say.  Fine by me.  Even if we disagree a little about the ultimate health of masturbation, the people of NoFap are one of the best groups of guys (and girls!) I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, and they have been a tremendous help to me in my own quest to stop fapping forever.

Have you ever tried it, ManOnTheMoon?  Gone 90 days with no PMO (porn/masturbation/orgasm, including non-orgasmic ""playing with yourself"")?  It might be worth a try.  Who knows?  You may learn something entirely surprising about yourself.  Or you may be the very first person to make it through the whole 90 days, go back to fapping, and report that you're happier fapping than not.  Either way, science wins.

You are certainly right that masturbation and porn are not synonyms.  It is important to make that point.  Let me make the equally important point that smoking and lung cancer are also not synonyms.

**TL;DR: Yes, I personally suspect sexual research, virtually dormant on this question since the 1970s, will eventually demonstrate that masturbation is problematic and is to be discouraged.  However, I am a minority here at NoFap speaking only for myself.**",True,1,week1,True,1,0,0,t1_c2w1cvj

A bunch of aristocrats were angry at the King for centralizing the political authority of France upon himself, instead of localizing political authority with them, like it had been long ago. So they used some of their power to get the ball rolling, and soon a bunch of city folk in Paris got in on it and it snowballed really quickly. Skip forward a few years and everyone in France is scared shitless because they're chopping off heads. They stop the people who were chopping off heads, but France was now a Republic, the King had been executed for treason, and Paris was in full command of the government of the whole nation (as a side note this is arguably when the concept of a nation-state first came to fruition). So the important thing was who controlled Paris.

Step in the militarty. Since 1792 the French had been trying to spread the Revolution, or prevent counter-Revolutionaries from destroying the nation, or whatever else they used to justify war. So just like how a Washington or an Eisenhower got elected to President in landslides, the people of France were more than willing to support the general who was such a fucking genious he had made France win in modern European wars. Seriously, this guy was the most successful general in Europe since Caesar or Charlemagne.

Anyway, he made this clear in his speech to the legislature in 1799, in what is called the coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire (the speech was on the 19th, but the politics of it is a bit complicated), when he said that the god of forture and the god of war followed him. (Brumaire was a month on the Revolutionary calendar, the 18th Brumaire Year VIII was  9 November 1799). So the constitution of the French nation was rewritten for the bazillionth time in ten years and Napoleon was declared first of three consuls in charge of pretty much everything in France. He was quick to officially end the Revolution when he came to power.

The wars continued, and his power grew and waned over the next decade and a half. In 1804 he was declared Emperor by the pope (though he famously crowned himself). This was perhaps his peak. It is definitely the moment which is most memorialized in his rise to fame and power.

Still not sure I understand.

""Influential"" president could in and of itself mean many things.

""Decent"" president could mean other things (i.e. ethical, etc).

Throw the two words together with ""influentially"" modifying the ""decent"" and it's rather difficult to know.

If you are asking who I think the most ""Libertarian"" president was (in terms of ""rolling back"" the state) then I think the answer is obvious (if surprising to most):  Warren G. Harding

Because he rolled BACK almost the entire war-time insanities of Woodrow Wilson: he commuted the sentences and released the political prisoners; dramatically shrank the bloated wartime government; cut taxes massively; prosecuted corporate war profiteers; reformed and cleaned up a messy Veterans Bureau; calmed and shorted a Bolshevist/Red Commie scare; and while England and Europe fucked over their economies, he saw us through a very deep post-war depression and allowed the market to correct so that the recovery was fast AND robust, kicking off a decade of very REAL productivity and progress decade.

Alas, his administration was forever colored and tainted by scandals of his Cabinet members (things which would be ""tame"" today), and of which he was himself apparently entirely ignorant and uninvolved with. (And worse, his wife literally ""burned up"" all of his correspondence and personal papers immediately following his death -- purportedly to protect his legacy, but ultimately it probably did the opposite, since even his papers were not available to defend him from later denigrations by historians and party attackers.)

Now there were arguably previous Presidents (Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Quincy Adams, Jackson, etc) who were arguably MORE ""Libertarian"" in the sense that the nation they governed was itself more libertarian (and had a smaller less intrusive government) -- but none of them ""rolled back"" anywhere NEAR as much as Harding managed to do (one could only WISH that he had rid us of the Federal Reserve as well... alas).",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w1la4

Sexy decor and same drinks just results in drinking the same beer with different looking walls. Run low on beer? Get bigger kegs. People will drink the same stuff if its all they are offered ever.

*EDIT* had to use letters instead of numbrs for points as Reddit has a bizarre auto numbering system that isn't always logical.

Thank you so much for considered response. Theres no need to be sorry, I didn't have a 'bad' experience with ""you"", I just, as a rule, don't patronise drinking establishments that charge an admission fee. I am sure you guys will do fine without my custom.

Let me be clear that I do, however, give the business owners credit for giving a business a go, any new business is a risky venture, and they are to be commended for being brave enough to spend a lot of money to create a new premises and take this risk.

(Incidentally, ""BA""? Forgive me but i'm not sure what that means. Bar Assistant? Bar Associate?)

With that said, let me go through your points.

A. I grant you that there is no nightclub in the city that lets one in for free. However, by the way the advertising was done, and the general inference of said advertising and website, the main strapline is ""Commonwealth, an Uncommon *bar* for Common People"". Now, maybe the terms for clubs and bars have been warped recently and I'm not aware of this, but the gist of what I got from the ads, was that it would be a bar. The term 'lounge' is meaningless to me, as an ex publican. 

If it *is* a club, then perhaps change things a little to make that clear, if, I suspect, that charging a cover is something to do with antiquated puritannical Albera licensing laws when premises are designated as clubs in the landlord's licence to be forced to charge entrance, then fair enough. However, one could easily get around any provincial meddling by charging $1 to gain entry. If, no minimum amount is set in law.

I am grateful that you have explained the timings in effect, and now I know, but perhaps a sign (maybe I missed it) in the window explaining the timings of said charges, in 'lounge service'.  Assuming a customer knows *anything* about ones business (and I'm not saying *you* do in particular) usually doesn't end well.

B. I wasn't aware the premises was low on liquid, but that isn't at issue here. I don't want to assume to teach grandma how to suck eggs here, and I have no idea how big your cellar is, but being out of stock of big sellers can be minimised.

The big macro brews are available in big sizes in the EU, and I would think, from what I've seen of cellars here, that keg sizes are similar. Having experienced several FA Cup finals in a pub in London 'The Grid Inn' Southfields (look it up, it's a cute lil corner pub on google st view) barely bigger than half of the bottom floor of the Rose And Crown, packed to capacity, probably 1000 drinkers passing through every 5 hours, I was rarely out of stock of anything.

Trading up a keg size can minimise outages. 6 imp gal, 11, 22 and 36's or similar are probably available here.

As I say however, every situation is unique, and perhaps it was just bad luck on the night.

B part 1. On to the 'usual suspects'. Whilst it's tempting to sell what people 'apparently' want, and what Joe Shcmoe wants and that the general public 'won't buy it', at what stage does this become a self fulfilling prophecy, or even become a chicken and the egg type situation?

The general public wont buy it? Why? Is it because the general public arent offered *anything else*? The general public drinks macro swill because that is *all they know*. Is it their fault? Mostly 'no'. Is that Commonwealth's fault? No. The big macro houses have massive ad campaigns, bullying other, smaller breweries off the T bar, and the liquor store shelves, with  veiled threats, co-ercion, government lobbying and buying of shelf space. (Watch the docu-film 'Beer Wars' for an illustration of how this happens).

So, yes, it's certainly safe profit to sell what everyone else is serving. But if one is to ""do something different"" as the owners apparently said (paraphrasing) here, then if by doing different, they mean having really nice walls and light chandaliers, (and I sincerely say that they are lovely) eclectic music, smart polite staff, then the job is done.


If by being different, means having drinks and beers that noone else has, being different in a way that people could say ""hey, lets go to place X, they have Y there!"" and being famous for that, then this is evidently not the case.

I may be the crazy one here, but if the only differentiator is the nice decor, great staff, and a pleasant selection of music, then, by the emphirical evidence out there, that matches *what many other places are doing*. 

Macro beer is macro beer. The only difference between someone being led blindfolded into Commonwealth, drinking bud (ick) and then being led blindfolded into 'lucky lounge' (or whatever it's called these days) and drinking bud, and not knowing what each place is called, is that they would know that one had nice horizontal walls, and the other one was kinda dark and small.

Again, I commend the owners for really going nuts on the decor, but, alas, Calgary has become akin to the McDonald's of the bar/club world. Everone serves the same thing, only the tiling and wallpaper is a bit different in each one.

C. The low ceiling question. Maybe it's a unique situation, but high ceilings are short sighted for energy efficiency, and low ceilings may be hotter, but sufficiently powerful AC would take care of dumping the copious bodyheat outside. 

D. The mellowness, per se, is not an issue for me. If a place has one person in it, doesn't matter to me, because I go in for the beer, not for whom is in it. The bone of contention is the cover for no 'apparent' reason. But, as its been made clear now, it is, apparently a club/nightclub, so a cover is traditional. 

You say that ""it's kind of a catch-22, if you don't charge cover and the place hits capacity, you're screwed out of a bunch of money that could help with a bunch of overhead fees, but if you do charge cover and not a lot of people show up, then you have some unhappy patrons.""

Why? I never charged a cover for any of my pubs, and wether the place hit capacity of not was irrelevant. If one doesnt charge a cover and you get slammed one is screwed out of a bunch of money? 

What about the hundreds of people drinking? All that margin on pop? Overhead fees? Again, overheads are paid for by costing in the price of the good. It's the 'cost of doing business'. It is not the customers fault that X or Y business costs A or B to operate. Nor should the business penalise the customer just for browsing a good. (again, not withstanding any nightclub admission fee law)

Not many people show up? Thats business for you. It's swings and roundabouts. One can send barstaff home early, close early. 

I do concede though that comparing a nightclub to a pub may not be equitable. Now that I know, that its a club. (but then again, whom is to say one cannot?)

Yes, my opinions are still my own, and I do try to get to the logical point of an issue, and people can vote with their feet and wallets to a venue, and I appreciate that I do not *have* to go somewhere that I do not want to, and that noone is forcing me to go.

Not many businesses go without teething troubles, and I sincerely wish the business well.  :)

Skip to Friday, she comes over. Nothing good happens. We watch Doctor Who and Futurama then she goes home (her parents made her stay at home). Saturday she comes over, she can stay the night this time. So we fool around early in the day. I get to finger her, much to her pleasure. I keep dropping little hints like
    ""Do you know what would feel better?"". 
The night continues and we end up watching TV. She has a stomach ache... **FUCK**, she gets over that... she has a headache **FUCK FUCK**. We go to bed without incident.

**Now the fun begins.**
I wake her up at 7 in the morning, gently. We start making out and I resume the manual pleasure and I hear her whisper...

You are impossibly critical of the mistakes Darwin made because you have constantly ignored any kind of historical perspective. Darwin didn't have the benefit of taking classes or reading about Cultural Anthropology, Sociology, or Evolutionary Biology because they didn't exist yet. He was the one pioneering their very existence. He didn't know about socioeconomic factors of intelligence because it hadn't been studied yet.

He thought races being better than one another (through intelligence, etc) was based on biology because that was the only option. It was a given at the time and was one of the assumptions that he didn't think to question. He was building on the back of all those before him, not coming up with 100% new theories. There were major flaws in how scientists at the time viewed cultures, intelligence, genetics, evolution, biology, etc. Darwin helped to correct some of the flaws, but he didn't (and couldn't possibly) fix them all. Remember that this was a time when people thought that intelligence was completely imbued at birth, either through some sort of genetics, or by divine gift.

Yes, Darwin's culture was flawed by our current understanding. Yes, they were Eurocentric, that's History 101. Why are you surprised about this? Did you not learn about the Industrial Revolution? I'm not saying there is nothing racist about being Eurocentric in our current day view, only pointing out that you saying Darwin was a racist because of it is incredibly short sighted. By extension, you are saying that everyone in Europe before the 20th century was individually racist and should not be idolized, because they all shared the same flaws with Darwin. Don't you see how silly that is? You have a problem with an entire culture, but are singling out a single member of it for no reason other than that some people idolize him (myself not included).

[This is how you sound to me:] *Plato and Aristotle believed the Sun revolved around the Earth. But they should have known the truth. It wasn't that their culture didn't have the understanding at the time, they were just scumbag Geocentrists. They had no proof to back up their theories. They should have read about Galileo from the future and known the truth.*

&gt;And how do you believe I am falling into any trap? You don't know what I am basing my beliefs on by any means. I am certainly not trying to use Eugenics as a scare word--I am using it as intended. In his letters with other biologists and conversations (as documented by those individuals), he was coming to the idea that humans could and ought to target a 'better' race, most of which relied upon improving the already 'better' race (Caucasians). He certainly acknowledged the problems with this, but he was again becoming more open and progressive to the idea over time, going as far as suggesting that we could achieve a 'better' race (whatever that meant and whatever non-science that was based on) in the future, just as Caucasians are already better and more advanced than other races.

You understand the problem with secondary sources right? Again you're being vague, using that phrase ""coming to the idea"" again. That doesn't mean anything. I could say he was ""moving away"" from Eugenics and cite many sources, but that wouldn't prove anything either. The problem is that your statements contradict those who have spent their lives researching, on both sides. These are not a new arguments, you can find plenty back and forth about it in the links I posted long ago and elsewhere.

You ARE falling into a trap by using Eugenics as a scare word. Saying somebody advocates Eugenics brings forward a picture of Nazis performing genocide, not the kind of discussion Darwin was involved in. Also, just because he discussed the effects of something doesn't mean he advocated their execution, or that they were negative things to begin with. There are many kinds of Eugenics, just as there are many kinds of Social Darwinism. You can't lump them all together or your are showing how prejudiced you are against a group of very different thinkers. It's also important to note is there is a huge difference between ""promotional voluntary eugenics"" and ""state mandated eugenics"". The fact that Darwin was so reluctant to talk about any form of Eugenics for so long tells me all that I need to know: that he saw the danger and was hesitant in take any kind of stand.

Not many people care about Darwin's private letters except biographers. If Darwin was ""racist"" in his later private life, he must have made a huge turn away from being a proud abolitionist and a supporter of the Great Reform Act. But I don't think he was a racist any more than everyone else in his society, he was much more progressive actually. Nobody idolizes Darwin for his personal life or his private letters, they do so for his major works and theories. The fact that he said almost nothing about public policy and politics in his books is the point. Darwin was a Biologist, not a Social Darwinist, not a champion of Eugenics. He wrote theories on Biology and that is how he is judged.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w1yt9

LASTLY - the representation of minorities in the society also blew me the fuck away, just at how much we keep perpetuating these concepts from years and years ago. The one that blew me away the most is how much we are desensitizing violence not only towards women, but insanely towards certain groups, in this case the Arabs. Since the 9/11 tragedy, this group replaced the European terrorists, and they became the main antagonists. 

The craziest example I can think of is in the movie ""Rules of Engagement"". Basically the movie starts where the US embassy is surrounded by Yemen protesters, and in the middle of the protest, all of a sudden we see a colonel order the shooting of seemingly innocent and unharmed protesters. As the audience you are shocked and appalled. The movie continues to show a military investigation into what happened, and as it progresses you hear testimonials from the population of Yemen that they were unarmed and innocent and just wanting change; thus feeling even more anger towards the military actions. Middle of the movie, we see the MP investigator looking out the window and sees a young Arab girl with a missing leg, and decides to follow her to a back alley hospital treating the wounded, keep the young girl in mind though. As she goes through the alley he follows and stumbles on a tape, he takes it, and listens to the tape. On it we hear how the ""terrorists"" are planning on making the military look like butchers by first shooting at them and then forcing them to shoot back, before they get rid of the weapons. We, the viewers then get a flash back to the actual events, and we see that the ""peaceful protesters"" all of a sudden start pulling out weapons and shooting at the military together..... including the little 8 year old handicapped girl I mentioned earlier, as she takes out a John Wayne style revolver and aims it at the troops. 

It is at this scene where we see the Colonel, played by Samuel Jackson, make the order of ""waste these motherfuckers"" - and at that moment in the movie, we take back all the emotions we felt toward this group of people, including the little 8 year old girl, as we not root for the military to indeed, ""take out these motherfuckers"". In this last part of the movie, all of the humanity this particular group of people, the Arabs, had, we take it all back. Poetic justice gives us a feeling of justice being delivered and the people getting what they deserved. We still feel this as they pan the camera across all of the ""wasted"" bodies of the ""attackers"", so the women, children, elderly and especially men, all died because they started this. 

The concerning aspect is that before having this knowledge, I would just watch the movie, and feel the same justice that was delivered. The issue though is that it is repeated exposure like this that takes away any feeling we have toward a group of people, whether they are Arab, Latin, black, Asian or even country specific. It is this repeated exposure which makes us less concerned when we see things like this happen, especially to this group of people.

This is just some of the aspects which have been recently brought to my attention and made me focus on it that much more, because the way media shapes our lives is tremendous. Even reddit has a part in how our world is shaped. I do not have a solution yet, but just a cautionary tale of being more aware and getting more educated yourself to spot things like this. To understand your world better, because there are so many other things I still probably take just as is, but should not be. Rule your world.

I do also want to say thank you to everyone who gets through this long long long piece of mine. Second portion is probably not as coherent as the first, because I had a very long day and am starting to feel the weariness, but I wanted to come back here and finish this, even though it will have NO IMPACT on my life what-so-ever if I didn't.

Don't even get me started on Craft Beer Market. I SO dearly *wanted* to like this place, as was very excited to have a place that did beer that I could not get elsewhere.

I was disappointed. Guilty, I'm a beer 'snob', although I think it more accurate to label it as 'Beer Nazi'. Yes they have lots of beers, alas many of them is macro swill.

Being in it, I just feel like I am in a giant factory, a milking shed, where I am just a number to be dispensed beer. It's too big, the ceilings too high, the decor too hard, that makes a giant cacophony of voices, music, echoes etc. The distance to the benches on one side, over to the bar, and a glass wall on the other, with other patrons behind it, has to be at least 40 feet. It feels like I am in a home depot, only with seats and less lighting.

There is very little to intercept reflected sounds. No smaller partitions from floor to ceiling  and smaller roomlets. No curtains, limited carpeting. (again the facination with high ceilings of this owner chain baffles me) High, uncomfortable chairs, too small round tables. 

Pretty but understaffed overworked, and undereducated (not their fault) in the beer world, servers.

Overpriced beer. $9 for london pride IIRC. Zero head on the beer. 

I think, that in having 100 lines, they have just created an unmanagable situtation. A good pub doesn't *need* 100 lines. What it does need, is say cut it down to half that or less,  not stock the macro swill, and increase to at LEAST 10 cask lines.

Talking about dispensing. Having 100 beer lines isn't anything special, if many of them is just stuff one can get elsewhere. Nor is dispensing 100 lines through kegs. 

Kegs, if anyone wants to know, are different from casks. No disrespect to barstaff that operate keg taps, but i'm not kidding here, virtually anyone with working hands and eyes can serve beer from a keg. You could pull a random person off the street, show them once how it's done, and they could do it 100 times. It really is the landlords dream. (speaking as an ex landlord) Put glass under tap, turn on, fill to top, turn off. Very little wastage/ullage, easy to store, consistent.

The beer is usually pasturised and filtered, and can even be servable past it's best before date on the label. Since it's driven by CO2 or a nitro mix, it's always ready to go, unless the keg empties, and then getting it pouring again is as quick as one can get the coupler decoupled, into a new keg, flood the fob chamber, and release the float, and you have more beer, ready in seconds.

It is tempting, as a publican, to stock kegs only for the above reasons, but really, it's like the going to the dark side. Ultimately it's lazy, and souless. One knows one isnt giving the customer the best, most natural beer possible, but you also know you are still making money.

Cask beer, now that's where it's at. Keeping and serving cask beer takes way more skill and management. In a way, a cellar full of big casks (some as large as 22 gals) is like keeping your little babies happy. It tastes way better too.

No idea why they have to show the 'cellar' through double glazing. It's a cute touch I suppose. I suppose anything that educates beer drinkers on how beer actually works, is perhaps a good thing. Maybe it's handy for knowing what you have in stock visually, I have no idea.

And this one boggled my mind. Asking the server about the cask ales, they were out of it. I asked about when the next lot is in. Tuesday and Thursday if I remember were cask nights. It was a Thursday. It all goes in 15 mins apparently.

I thanked her civilly but this made me incandescent inwardly. UM. SO JUST GET MORE? ORDER MORE??!? GET BIGGER CASKS?!?!

Also, realising that the pint I was getting, actually wasnt a traditional pint, as in an imprerial pint, 20 oz. 568ml. Noooo, its that bastard American rip off the 16 oz pint, or 473ml.

If pubs were run like this in Europe they would be out of business. Yes, I realise, that ""you're not in Europe now!"" But does that mean that it's still acceptable to continue using insane business practices to the detriment of the customer?

 Some, nay, many pubs and bars in Calgary, just are *not* set up for bulk, fast, efficient service. Sticking with the bizarrely North American way of having a to wait for a girl/guy to some up to ones table, take ones order, then come back, in the time it would be quicker to do it oneself . In fact, I often just go into a pub and just go right up to the bar and order right from the barman/barmaid, and pay for that individual drink. 

The server method I like to call the 'Cheers' method, only because the first time I realised, that was actually how it was done in the States and Canada was by watching the Cheers show, and asking an American freind if this was actually the way it was done.

The other way, apparently, is called the 'London Bar' method. IE, one goes up to the bar, speaks direct to the barman/barmaid orders the drink, he/she pours it, you pay, tip optional, for each drink, and get the hell out of the way away from the bar for the next guy to order. It's rare to run a tab. Bar staff are typically paid a higher rate in the EU, so tipping per drink is normally not done.

If one does want to tip the barman, then one says 'and one for yourself' and invariably, the barman saves the drink til the end of the night, where, if one is lucky, a 'lock in' will be done, and whomever is left at inside will be guests of the landlord, and the barman will have that drink with you. Or he may just take it out of the til at the end of the night.

The london bar method is faster and more efficient, if the bar is long enough, one can have 4 or more barmen, the bar can be 5 deep, and people still get their drinks. By removing most if not all barstools from the bar when its packed, one can increase the people that get served.

If craft beer market followed this strategy the complaints about slow service would vanish. Get the servers behind the bars, turn them into barmaids, inform the customers about the new fangled 'london service' method using table talkers, voila, problem solved. Pay the barmaids/barmen a bit more for the less tipping, watch the volume of beer sold go through the roof.

Also, the method about pouring shots into thimbles (or 'jiggers' as they say here) is pure madness. It's slow, messy, wasteful and one sees brandy being measured, then vodka. In the SAME thimble. Free pouring bottles of expensive spirit in a busy, wet handed bumpy into eachother, many bottles squeezed next to eachother on high shelves, type environ is lunancy.

The soloution is to use 'optics'. Devices that attach to 1.5 litres of spirit, which are then put upside down on a rack, which dispense 25ml or whatever oz is the legal min, in about half a second, turn around, pop in the postmix, and voila, drink made in 5 seconds.

Anyway. Enough ranting. Suffice to say, I have looked into getting a pub up and running, but the red tape and curiously cartel like methods to frustrate you has made me think twice. Friends have told me that running a pub with no coors/bud/molson/canadian/keiths, and having no TV's. low volume music and cheap import beer would be crazy. 

You know what's crazy? Opening another pub with the same stuff everyone else sells.

&gt;Prices in Sydney are expected to increase over the next few years.

Oh, someone expect prices to keep rising? Debate closed. Do I need to show you the examples of people saying that prices would keep rising in the USA or other places where they collapsed? Was this serious or ironic?

&gt;I'm speaking in comparison to the United States, where it was practice for Greenspan to keep interest rates artificially low. When the GFC hit, the US interest rate had nowhere to go. Ours hit a 'low' of 5.75% before rising again.

Yes, they were higher than in the USA. But my question is how do you know they were high? Can you please answer to what I ask instead of going in a tangent?

&gt;I take issue with this and about half the rest of your post. You keep pulling specific examples from other countries to throw into doubt various elements of the Australian economy. If I say Sydney FC is better than LA Galaxy, you don't refute that by saying that Chelsea has a better defence and Real Madrid has a better offence.

You keep giving ""arguments"" as why there is no housing bubble in Australia. I keep showing you with reality that they are not arguments, they do not prove there is not a bubble. You can either acknowledge reality or keep living in your bubble. All you mention as reasons as why there is no bubble in Australia happened in other places where there was a bubble. Thats reality.

&gt;Your examples of Spain are stupid because they had vastly different circumstances to Australia at the time the crisis hit. They were sitting at over 40% government debt as a percentage of GDP in 2008, while Australia had no government debt.

Stop going in tangents. How is government debt related to the fact that there is a housing bubble in Australia?

All the reasons you mentioned as to why banks were propperly regulated in Australia, were applied in Spain as well. And there was a huge housing bubble that has collpased with the economy.

&gt;Yes... our big government with our socialised medicine, subsidised university fees, large social safety net, large public broadcasting service... not only maintained a budget surplus for years, but had money in the bank when the GFC hit.

See, you are politically indoctrinated and can not keep the economic conversation analitical and on topic. You needed to exteriorize your indoctrination even if it wasnt on topic. Being politically indoctrinated is bad for you, but in particular is the reason why you can not have a (as near as) objective economic discussion.

All the economies reach in natural resources can afford to have deficient and expensive services. You can see how Norway has petrol as opposed to the rest of the european northern economies, and are the only ones that have not cut back. Its no secret.

&gt;We have legislation that limited the banks ability to speculate and expose themselves to derivatives. See: Corporations Act, ASIC Act.

But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must needs invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth."" - Martin Luther

&gt; Is it completely absurd for one to love science and the God of the Bible at the same time?

Yes, because science says you can question everything including creation, god, prayer, belief, cults, and theology as a delusion.  Science rejects presuppositionalism is all forms, including the one which comes along for the ride with religion.  You cannot ""love"" science, without rejecting that which is unscientific.

&gt; *Of course, if there were hard evidence then it wouldn’t be based on certain faith commitments would it?*

There is no evidence for god, hard or otherwise.

&gt; Oh so you didn’t understand Trinitarian doctrine. Join the club.

If someone doesn't understand Newtonian mechanics he cannot really be considered a physicist, because its fundamental to physics.  The Trinity is fundamental to Christianity.  If you don't understand it, what does it mean to say you are a theologian (or have a PhD in it)?

&gt; *He can provide no better (persuasive) explanation explaining the origins of the universe than the religious person.*

Utter nonsense.  Even a layperson who has a passing familiarity with popular cosmology knows of the embedded multi-verse theory.  Its only not convincing because there is no evidence for it, but its at least plausible.  All the religious based claims are definitively wrong and easily demonstrated so regardless of evidence (which obviously couldn't exist.)  That's besides being preposterous in the extreme.

&gt; Do you know many atheist groups are there out there doing this kind of thing?

The Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity are two such groups.  Of course, they are secular, not atheist -- because these atheists are not *ASSHOLES* that don't let other people join their groups.

&gt; *Nazi Germany used Nietzsche’s philosophy and Darwin’s theory of evolution to justify the extermination of 6 million Jews is this really the fault of Darwin and Nietzsche?*

This is a lie.  They used poison gas, ideology, murderous intent, prayer and the blessing of the Catholic church.  The connection to Darwin is completely fabricated.  The connection to Nietzsche is highly unlikely (though I am not an expert) as his nihilistic outlook would not have endorsed the Nationalist Socialist agenda in the first place.

&gt; *Go study the great atheist secular societies of the last 100 years and see how they’ve made the world a better place. Start with Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Hitler, etc.*

Stalin and Pol Pot did not make a society based on atheism.  You can't do that, as atheism is not a philosophy or doctrine from which you can derive any ideas for making a society.  Hitler was, of course, a god fearing man.  Strictly speaking ""secular"" means separation from religion, not the eradication of it.  Hence the Soviet Union and Cambodia were not actually secular societies -- they were government enforced religion-free societies.  The United States and Turkey are secular societies in letter because of their constitutions.  However, both countries are not really atheist countries because of their highly religious populations.  Hence the only ""atheist secular"" societies are those that have separated their government from religion and their people basically left religion behind regardless of government policy.  This has only occurred, to an extent, in certain European countries (especially Scandinavian), Iceland and Japan.  Those societies seem quite nice.

I'm not super-knowledgeable, so perhaps upvoter222 could rewrite this for me.

Everyone in Europe used to be super racist against Jews (read the Shakespeare play, 'The Merchant of Venice'). You may be familiar with the phrase, ""Final solution to the Jewish problem"" - the euphemism (polite term) used by the Nazis for their Jew-killing concentration camps. These words were NOT first spoken by the Nazis, they were used in a letter by a Russian nobleman in the late 1800s, he was talking about a grand plan for moving all the Jews to Palestine (also named Israel). 

Basically, everyone in Europe hated Jews, so they started moving them to Israel, the spiritual home of the Jews (although for many centuries previous, the ACTUAL home of the Muslims). They figured it would get rid of them, without being too cruel and just killing them all. Read up on 'The British Mandate'. This movement intensified as a reaction to the Nazi Holocaust - no-one really liked Jews (old ways die hard :-( ), but they also recognised that the Jewish, as a people, had suffered greatly. This dichotomy (split-feeling) further fuelled the desire to move them all to their own little country.

The people who were actually living in Palestine/Israel did not like their new neighbours. The quickly changing racial make-up of the area inflamed passions. This was the primary cause of friction.

Yes, you dont want to share a bar with a bunch of people who smell like they havent bathed in a week, or have 8 week homeless beards, or look like they have been sleeping on cardboard and smell like wee.

But, also, I am sure we can both agree, that theres degrees of 'not dressing nice'. A mix of folks, some in suits, some in jeans and tee, the odd guy with dirty clothes and hard hats, students, moms and pops,  would be entirely normal in a EU or UK pub.

One way, to stop 'ner-do-wells, is yes, charge a cover. However, a sparkling clean pub with switched on staff, interesting selection of beers, landlord who is willing to bar trouble makers, and if neccesary call the police should have no hassle with that kind of thing.

	Hexavalent chromium will cause a serious bad symptom to humans, making it difficult to cure the pain which perishes a dermatitis or eczema. In recent years, the pollution problem of hexavalent chromium has attracted people’s great attention. The cost of treating industrial waste slag contains hexavalent chromium is very expensive, and secondary pollution can be caused easily too, If it can be used in cement production, both the environmental pollution and the cement productive cost will be reduced. However, the problem of hexavalent chromium also introduced to cement industry accordingly. So how to reduce the Hexavalent chromium content in cement?
	
	Ferrous sulfate, Stannous chloride and Stannous sulfate are widely used in cement industry as a reducing agent, and all these three agents have very good effects. But the cost of Stannous chloride and Stannous sulfate are too high to be used on a large scale (Stannous chloride: USD 8000/MT, and Stannous sulfate: USD 9500-12700/MT). Ferrous sulfate is a common and cheap chemical which only cost USD80-160/MT, non-toxic with very stable chemical property. What’s more, adding q.s. ferrous sulfate into cement will not affect the product property such as bending strength, compressive strength and water solubility etc.
	
	In June 2003, the EU has issued regulations that the cement and the cement production which the content of water soluble hexavalent chromium exceeding 0.0002% were prohibited from selling and using. It has been found that adding 0.09% ferrous sulfate into the cement will reduce the hexavalent chromium content to 0.00012%, it is lowcost and effective, What’s more, the experimental results shows that the reductive stability of ferrous sulfate is present well, and the packet of the cement can be kept up the content of exavalent chromium no more than 0.0002% in 180 days.
	
	Ferrous sulfate granular and powder can be mixed into cement when producing, ferrous sulfate granular can be put into clinker to be grinded together, and ferrous sulfate powder can be mixed with finished cement to be used to reduce the content of water soluble hexavalent chromium.

First off, the lower end of the blade is much too close to the grip to have a sharp point like that.   One mis-calulated or ill-practiced swing will embed it deeply in your forearm, at which point you now have the double issue of an open wound (potential infection vector) and the loss of combat function due to the wound.

The blade is similar in design to that of the European [Glaive](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaive) with the minor exception of the removed spike or hook from the ventral side.  The problem here is that short shaft (a proper Glaive has a 2 meter long shaft) removes much of the force availible to the weilder in terms of a swing.  Also, Glaives were designed as massinfantry weapons, designed to stop cavalry and mass infantry charges, not for individual combat.

The shaft of the bat is not reinforced where it was drilled through, so now there are weak points.  We've all seen pro baseball players break bats during games, and while they have the strength and skill to swing much harder than the rest of us, they are also hitting much smaller, lightweight baseballs, not heavy human heads attached to even heavier human bodies.

Finlly, there are major drawbacks to relying on a melee weapon like this as your primary defense weapon.  It takes years of heavy training and dedication to use such a weapon effectively for more than a few minutes.  Ask anyone who fights in the SCA or Renn Faire, melee combat is fucking hard work that the average person can't endure for more than about 5 minutes.  It's a much better idea to have a small-caliber assault rifle like an AR-15, KA-74, AR-18, Sig-552, H&amp;K G36C, or some other such weapon.  I know, I know, ""what about ammo?  What about the noise?""  First off, here in the US you can purchase ammo EVERYWHERE.  And calibers like .223 and 5.56m are so common it's ridiculous. You can find oodles of it.  Secondly, suppressors, which can be gotten a hold of, don't silence a shot but difuse and deaden the hot, and since zombie's don't have a working cerebral crtex, they won't be able to do anything like focus closely on where the sounds is coming from

&gt;
&gt;WHEN, on a Sunday morning in September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that it was his ""melancholy duty"" to inform the nation it was once again at war, Australians wearily accepted the sacrifice to come.
&gt;
&gt;A generation earlier, more than 60,000 Australians had died in what had been referred to as the Great War.
&gt;
&gt;Across both wars just short of 100,000 Australians were killed.
&gt;
&gt;That's 30 a day, every day, for every year of both wars.
&gt;
&gt;We were in it for the long haul. The future of the free world was at stake. Australian lives would be sacrificed. That was the cost of freedom.
&gt;
&gt;In August 1966, during the Battle of Long Tan, 18 Australians were killed, the bloodiest day for us of the Vietnam War. Eleven of the dead were conscripts, one was a student not old enough to vote.
&gt;
&gt;Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar.
&gt;Families reel as fallen Diggers named
&gt;
&gt;End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar.
&gt;
&gt;It shocked the nation, but our prime minister vowed soon after that he was going ""all the way with LBJ (US President Lyndon Baines Johnson)"" and we must have agreed: Harold Holt won that November's federal election in a historic landslide, in no small part based on our enthusiasm for the war.
&gt;
&gt;Six years later, Australians' view of that conflict - still the longest in our history - had changed and helped Gough Whitlam's Labor Party to power.
&gt;
&gt;But the Liberals had been acutely aware that the nation's appetite for the war had waned and they were slowly withdrawing our men and women from the unwinnable contest, the last Australians being killed in combat in September 1971.
&gt;
&gt;Five privates of the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment died that day, a bloody, final punctuation mark in a war that had exhausted our country.
&gt;
&gt;We were in Vietnam for the long haul; Australians had bravely won battles, but the nation's heart wasn't in it.
&gt;
&gt;Neither is the heart any longer in the fight for Afghanistan, polls indicating that two-thirds of us want out.
&gt;
&gt;The deaths over the weekend of three more Australian troops, and the wounding of six others, attacked by a so-called ""rogue"" Afghan soldier will further erode support for our presence there. As it should.
&gt;
&gt;Our soldiers are adamant their job to train a reliable local defence force will not be completed by the Canberra-imposed deadline of 2014.
&gt;
&gt;They'd know. When my colleague Ian McPhedran recently spent time with them in Afghanistan, he observed the local trainees.
&gt;
&gt;They were lazy, ill-disciplined, untrustworthy and even mutinous.
&gt;
&gt;They often dropped their loaded rifles to steal fruit from trees, rather than protect their people.
&gt;
&gt;It's a curious thing that Prime Minister Julia Gillard, her predecessor Kevin Rudd, his predecessor John Howard, and the alternative prime minister Tony Abbott agree that Australia is there for the ""long haul"".
&gt;
&gt;The long haul is never spelled out. That is because there is no achievable end in Afghanistan.
&gt;
&gt;It is a long haul to a hell devised by Islamists who despise modernity, Western freedoms, and who see democracy and its concepts, such as equality for women and education for girls, as a full-on cultural assault.
&gt;
&gt;These are men who wish to live by the backward ways of the seventh-century birth of their troubled religion.
&gt;
&gt;We are wasting our time, our defence budget and the lives of our noble sons, by getting touchy-feely about building these people schools and bringing water to their villages when too many of them hate us and plan to kill our children.
&gt;
&gt;When Europeans a century ago sat in smoke-filled drawing rooms and drew lines of administrative convenience through what had been their empires, they did so ignorant of the lives of those who would forever after be ruled by those geographic co-ordinates.
&gt;
&gt;Those people resent it, and I don't blame them. Afghanistan is not a country and it never has been.
&gt;
&gt;It is a collection of often uneducated, sexist, stubbornly prejudiced, rigidly narrow-minded, violent tribes - untrustworthy men who stabbed us in the back until we thought it a brilliant idea to give them weapons and training.
&gt;
&gt;Now they shoot us.
&gt;
&gt;We are in Afghanistan to rid them of the Taliban and perhaps introduce locals to the idea of democracy.
&gt;
&gt;Fat chance. The Taliban's deadly response regularly costs allied lives.
&gt;
&gt;Not that I am proposing a retreat from the War on Terror.
&gt;
&gt;But when our significant other, the US, secretly organises talks between Afghan President Hamid Karzai's leadership and the ape-like Taliban, you know things aren't going so well.
&gt;
&gt;Rather than expensively invest in troops on the ground, perhaps we should spend a fraction of that on decent intelligence and use unmanned drones to hunt and kill our prey.
&gt;
&gt;The US drone attacks are working with greatly increased efficiency.
&gt;
&gt;In recent months the allies' drones have lopped off some important heads from the Taliban/al-Qai'da Hydra.
&gt;
&gt;But it grows more heads; Afghans are among the most fertile of nationalities and in their ranks are some of the most resentful people on the planet.
&gt;
&gt;In the absence of measurable goals with a deadline that our troops believe they can achieve, we should think of better ways to combat this menace.
&gt;
&gt;Relying more on Western technology that is the fruit of modern and wealthy democracies has a ring of common sense to it.
&gt;
&gt;We'll kill some innocents along that way. That's war. It's a war on terror and we have a right to share the terror around.

The same goes for asylum seekers, arguably to a greater extent even.

At least. But alas, we the Greek people were never asked to vote on these matters.

 Instead our PM now presents us with a fait accompli since he unilaterally signed so many agreements popular opinion was often against. The economics minister last night, following the PM's speech, was explaining to the media what the referendum will be about. And, in essence, he said it would ask the Greek people to choose between a future of drachma and terrible living standards outside the eurozone, or to continue on the route we're already on within the European family and common currency. 

 I don't really see anything positive coming from this. All the opposition leaders are already calling for elections. Most of the people on the street are calling for elections. And the PM presents us with a dilemma, after-the-fact, that will only help further divide the people. 

 Also, the government has lost all credibility with this move. Word from Brussels is they were not even briefed on this and all this raises a question: Did the Greek government enter a historic agreement bringing together all of the EU, the banking and private sector, with all economic and political costs involved, just to defer its own decision to a referendum nobody asked for?

Currently the metagame (metagame is basically the current understanding of how you play to win the game. This is often shortened to just ""meta"") is separated into NA style and EU style.

NA style is Tanky-dps top, AP mid, Ranged AD + support bottom, and jungler.

EU style is AP top, AP mid, Ranged AD + Support bottom, and jungler.

Currently, NA style seems to be the de facto standard.

Now, you're level 14 so this means very very little to you, but it's something to think about as you level up.

Job roles:

AP carry - The AP carries job is to burst down the enemies carries.

AD carry - The AD carries job is a little bit more complicated. Usually it's simply to DPS (short for damage per second) the enemy's carries; however, sometimes the enemie's tanky-dps, or tank, is the main problem and can no longer be ignored. When this is the case, the AD carries job might require her to buy a Madred's Bloodrazor and dps the tanky-dps/tank.

Support - Support's job is to get her carries fed, keep track of the jungler (with Clairvoyence), ward the river, ward the dragon/baron, and overall protect your carries. This is probably the second most complicated job.

Tank - The tanks role is to get the enemy to use their CC (crowd control, things like stuns and silences) and ultimates on her and to disrupt the enemy's backline (their carries). The enemy is going to try to ignore the tank, the tank's job is to not be ignored.

Jungler - The jungler's job is the most complicated of them all. The jungler's main job is to gank (to attack the enemies in the lanes) the lanes. A successful gank does not always mean killing the gankee. Causing the gankee to waste a flash or ghost is also considered a successful gank. The jungler's second main job is to control the neutral monsters and buffs. Typically, you'll want to give your AP mid blue buff when you can, and give your AD carry red buff (typically you don't want to do this on your first clearing). Third main job is to disrupt the enemy jungler from having an easy time getting experience.

Tanky-DPS - The tanky-DPS can do mutilple jobs. They are sometimes tank, sometimes jungler, sometimes they actually are a ""tanky"" damage dealer. 

****************************************************

The beginning of the game usually involves protecting your jungler; however, since you're level 14 you probably don't have to worry about that.

The laneing phase is crucial as it sets the tone for the game. With the exception of the support and jungler, you want to focus on CS (creep score, basically how many minons you kill). To accomplish this, you only want to **last hit**. Last hit means to wait until the minion is about to die, then kill it. The point of doing this is so your lane doesn't push and expose you to ganks.

The laneing phase ends after the first tower is destroyed. This is the begging of mid-game. Mid-game involves controlling dragon and trying to push down other towers. Often this time involves small skirmishes instead of full out team fights. During this time, it's important to keep up with your CS.

This roles over to late-game where Baron is typically obtained and you push to win.

I started getting tired near the end. :P Hope this helps.

That's wrong. Freedoms are user freedoms. Original developers are required to keep the rights of users. Original developers voluntarily reduce their rights to ensure the rights of users.

**Freedom 0** protects user of licences saying ""this program cannot be used in Europe"" or ""this program cannot be used by military pourposes"". You can use the program without any limitation. 

&gt; I ignore terms of service entirely anyway.

So you are following Rule 0 in no FreeSoftware. You break licences in no FreeSoftware but FS is granting you to do it.

**Freedom 1**: Again is a user freedom. Freedom of ""look inside"" if you want. if you don't have the skills you can hire someone. Free Software is about freedom. it isn't about money. If you have lots of money you can't pay anybody to look inside Mac Os or windows and it's possible in linux. You can choose to use or not this freedom but always is going to be your right.

**Freedom 2:** 

&gt; I pirate things, functionally it makes no difference what licence they come under, I will share it anyway.

The main difference is one is your right and another is a crime/offense. 

**Freedom 3:** Ok, you are not a programmer. But you can be using programs that require this rule. Firefox it's an evolution of Netscape Navigator. Chromium is free version of Chrome, Libre Office come from Open Office, Open Office come from StarOffice and so on. 

Each time you, as user, use a program that is a fork of another, you do it by freedom 3

I don't get the reasoning behind this idea, it'll almost certainly re-introduce the uncertainty about Greece's future at the rating bureaus, nullifying all efforts that have been made to calm that trend. Even if the populations votes 'yes' (highly unlikely at this point), they'll be worse off.

Actually we at the non-profit Citizens Foundation have already implemented most of your suggestions in our OpenActiveDemocracy software platform. 

We recently won the  European award in the 2011 eDemocracy Awards, see http://ibuar.is/citizens.is/?p=250 for more info

Your main criteria: 

• An online community that is accessible across the globe, in multiple languages 
--- Check. Our interface is already available in English, French and Icelandic (fully translated) as well as Greek, German, Dutch (partly translated). It only takes a few hours to translate to any language and the translation is fully crowd-sourced and done on the website itself. An Arabic translation would be most appreciated :) Google Translate is also enabled for content. Geo-location functionality ensures that big countries can not override small countries but can also be easily turned off for international movements. 

• Simple and quick to start, so that we can support off-line movements while they’re still occurring (Arab spring, occupy wall-street) 
--- Check. It only takes a few minutes to create a new website for better world organisations. 
	
• Software that enables users to “skim the cream off the top,” meaning that the most crucial issues and solutions receive the most attention (as decided by the community)
--- Check and tested and works. So well that the capital of Iceland is using it actively to find out the top priorities of their citizens as well as the best arguments for and against each priority. 

Our Your Priorities website is our present to the world, a free deliberation website for every country in the world. http://www.yrpri.org/ 

In addition to that we have already used this software in real life situations with thousands of users. See a short blurb on our success with Better Reykjavik at http://ibuar.is/citizens.is/?p=53 as well as the Better Reykjavik website itself, http://betrireykjavik.is/ (you can enable Google Translate to read the content and choose English as your interface language). Yesterday (31. of October) the first priorities were transferred from Better Reykjavik to the City of Reykjavik Administration for processing. This will be done at the end of every month from now. 

Our software is open source and available on GitHub - https://github.com/rbjarnason/open-active-democracy

More information available on request at gunnar@citizens.is or just start using Your Priorities. We are more then willing to create new websites for the ""movement"" free of charge.

To solve the last-mile problem, Telekom is actually forced to give access to competitors for a fee that is fixed by a regulatory body.

No donations to any parties by either of the former state monopolies, but those are generally not very common anyway.

American sports tend to be full of roughly-equal teams; sure, there are dominant teams and shitty teams, but even the shitty teams can occasionally pull a win from the dominant ones, and doing so is fairly unremarkable. If the Bengals beat the Patriots, people are going to make jokes about it, but it won't be front-page news the next day.

European sports tend to be full of average teams, with just an elite few *incredible* teams. These incredible teams aren't just good, they're damn near perfect. For one of these super-teams to lose to an average team is so rare as to be worthy of outrage. These teams have a near-divine *right* to win. The only thing these teams live for is to play against other super-teams, and in doing so they provide one hell of a spectacle.

Essentially, American sports trend towards the egalitarian; European sports are very laissez-faire.

Aah, so it is the Greek government now? At least there we agree. All that talk about lazy Greeks is nothing but rabble rousing. Fits perfectly with the Sun and other trash ""newspapers"".

As for your questions, we have a couple of options, which were all discussed when this whole ordeal started in 2009. You remember? It didn't start a couple of months ago. Back then, we had a choice to help right away and solve the issue with only a small amount of money (compared to what we have to pay now). Instead, Merkel and Sarkozy stalled and stalled and then finally made a decision to give a minute amount of money bundled with ridiculous terms. Those terms were guaranteed to trash what was left of the Greece domestic market, compounding the problems Greece was/is in. On Top, that ""aid"" money was to be spent strictly on paying back loans. Which means no, we didn't do anything to help Greece get out of their sinkhole. It had to go straight back to our own banks. Things like that are called bail-out money. Yes, nearly all of the Greek aid money was bail-out money for the banks, nothing else.

So, yes, Greece was in a bad place, but had many options back then. They for example could have gone bankrupt right then and there. But of course, we couldn't allow them to risk our banks 25% profit margin goals. So we started putting a lot of pressure on Greece and made sure, the banks could keep their goals. All at the price of pushing Greece into a much worse situation. A situation bad enough, that it now actually threatens the whole of Europe.

In the EU telecom is working on licensed spectrums, and the technology, interop between carriers and everything covering how things works are standardized.

I'm sure this did indeed cost a lot of money back in the days, especially with the transitioning from older, non GSM-technologies, but the result has been such a remarkable success that most people today have forgotten the mess we had and that something even existed before GSM. The investment, for society as a whole, has paid off tremendously.

So yes. It wont come cheap, but they made the calls, they pay the price. In the end, political concerns will probably cause even politicians to see the value of a working mobile telecom market, when the US starts lagging even more behind the rest of the standardized world than they already do.

All i see necessary is that all data shown to have insignificant matches the model. The chi^2 is related to the likelihood the model is true.

If you haven't seen many dodos, basically your chi^2 sucks. Of could people in Europe saw many white swans, their model is very insistant on there being no [black swan](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Black_swan), but of course, their measurement did have bias; they looked at Europe. Basically there is a postulate in their belief in white swans there; there is only one species/race of swan.

Physics actually has a similar postulate. We do assume the physics to be consistent everywhere. And as far as we see, it is. (We don't expect an 'Australia') Distinguish here between physics and our theories! Because we expect physics to be the same everywhere, minimally, we expect the theories to be true up to energies/speeds/etcetera we have actually measured about it. Of course in actuality we value our postulates more; we really only expect things to be different when the theory goes wrong. For instance, blowing up of values, mismatch between field-theories and GR. Probably it is more subtil, because supersymmetry(SuSy) deviates from the standard model earlier, and aims to equal forces at high energy..(For the implication-minded: not to say SuSy attempts to include GR)

Of course we *know* there are different similar species, but we have never seen the consistency of physics ever violated.  So the belief in only one species of swan should already have been much weaker even before black swans were discovered.

There is repeatable -as-in other people come up with the same conclusion about something when given a theory; it is unambiguous. Of course the conclusion may include probabilities, then the prediction is just about counting different cases, and requiring a good chi^2 to consider it likely. *Just maybe* a theory can be good if you can't calculate probabilities of different posibilities, as long as the 'posibility space' is much smaller than space of actual outcomes.",True,2,,False,2,0,0,t1_c2w3cvu

&gt;The most basic sausage consists of meat, cut into pieces or ground, and filled into a casing. The meat may be from any animal, but traditionally is pork, beef, or veal. The meat to fat ratio is dependent upon the style and producer, but in the United States, fat content is legally limited to a maximum of 30%, 35% or 50%, by weight, depending on the style. The United States Department of Agriculture defines the content for various sausages and generally prohibits fillers and extenders.[4] Most traditional styles of sausage from Europe and Asia use no bread-based filler and are 100% meat and fat excluding flavorings.[5] **In the UK and other countries with English cuisine traditions, bread and starch-based fillers account for up to 25% of ingredients. The filler used in many sausages helps them to keep their shape as they are cooked.

It is true that Italy (Europe in general) in the past centuries was under the Church influence, but only in a political way. The way I see it, the past was worse for what I am saying, because religion really was irrelevant to the leading people, probably even to the Pope. Not to mention the Kings of England. It was the lowmen who were mostly manipulated with religion. In the northern industrialized Italy, the secularization in 1920 has already happened and is quite similar to the current situation.

Banks bear a great responsibility for this mess. The gave out loans to countries and people that could under no circumstances repay them, just so they could keep up whith short term profits. Instead of regulating them to stupidity (as part of a nationalisation scheme), they were recapitalised and left to cause the same mess again. 

The only true alternative for Europe now is this ( in my view obviously)
1. Debt forgiveness (it has happened numerous time in the past, it can happen again)
2. Fix the long term economic problems of peripheral economies not by blanket market policies, but by resetting the state. For example, instead of firing most Greek public sector workers, create a useful public sector that can support private initiatives. 
3. Regulate the banks (and no, the won't go anywhere)
4. Strengthen the EU funding schemes, while at the same time having an organisation that makes sure that these funds don't go the pockets of a few corrupt. 


At some point, one has to draw the conclusion that markets are not omniscient, and come up with the relevant policies. I am pretty sure that the are economists and industrialists out there that have a much more coherent plan than mine. If not now, I don't know when.

If you believe that all Americans speak English or come from the same (or even remotely similar) backgrounds or even engage with each other on a baseline level of ""americanism"", you are hilariously incorrect and little or nothing can be done to help you.

Regarding heritage, I think you also vastly overestimate the amount of common heritage Americans share, or vastly underestimate the effects of having your nations neighbor each other for over five hundred years. I can't see an argument that one or the other has significantly more impact on economic or social development. Yes, there's a strong argument that the Euro is new and not well-recieved, but it's not like there have been (with the exception of the obvious, like WWII) any issues being internationally transient in Europe. Even for Americans, once you're there it's rather easy to nation hop.

Now regarding laws, Europe has both the EU and the UN, both of which compel their member nations to have remarkably similar laws. You would be hard-pressed to find significant differences between the laws of neighboring countries in Europe, and for every one you find, there's almost certainly a similarly disparate legal disparity between two neighboring US states.

Now more to the point, I'm basically arguing with myself here since you outright refuse to back up your arguments (""The US is one country with a shared heritage, laws, language and culture"", for example, has no logic behind it in your posts) and if this continues to be the case, this will be my last reply in this thread.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w3nqf

a.) It's not the existence of the private school - it is the funding. Yes, there are private schools in the states, most of them are unaffordable to the middle class without outside funding. In your province, the government pays a significant portion of the check. 

b.) You said the system did not exist where you live or in the other countries in Europe that routinely beat both of our school systems on standardized tests - this has been proven to be incorrect on your part.

c.) You said that such systems draw away talent from the public schools, hurting those schools - again, this have been proven to be incorrect on your part.

d.) Usage is irrelevant - the EXISTENCE of the system is the important part. In your province, if the schools do not provide a decent education - many middle class people have the means to put them into a decent school with the state's blessing and financial assistance. As a result, the State know they must provide a good service or the schools (and State) lose a significant amount of funding. The mere presence of competition helps improve the schools - and if they don't give a good service, then the kids aren't trapped in a failing system.

Let me give you my area's system for comparison.

I live in a consolidated district that covers several small towns. The schools in the district range from very poor to excellent dependent entirely on where you live in the district. In some of the more populated areas - your assigned school will vary from from one street to the next.

Now, funding isn't the issue here - as I said, all the schools are in the same district with the same funding. Most of the newest schools are in the poorest neighborhoods and are the worst performing. They have the newest computers (at least until they are trashed and/or stolen) the newest equipment, etc.

I'm lucky enough to live in an area where my kids go to the good schools because for me to be able to even move them to a different school in the same DISTRICT requires the school to fail their basic skills assessment several years in a row.  They literally could fail seven out of ten years and still keep their accreditation as long as they didn't fail four years concurrently. Now, if these schools can barely teach the basic reading, writing, math and science to keep their accreditation, it is pretty easy to deduce that their chances of actually challenging the students or teaching them anything advanced enough to help prepare them for the post-industrial economy we live in is pretty much nonexistent.

For me to put them in one of the private schools in town would require me to spend about $8K a year per child, per year - or a total of about $416K over thirteen years not including tuition increases or financing. And while I am shelling out that cash - I still get to pay my state sales tax, my income tax, and my property tax to support the failing government school monopoly, essentially paying twice for the government failure to provide basic essential services.

Pay the money or move - those are my options.

Comparatively, in your area - assuming the funding per-pupil funding is about $6K - that would mean that the government would pay about $202K of that over thirteen years meaning I would only have to pay $214K to get my kids a decent education.

The benefits you take for granted are denied to us here in the states meaning that many bright and motivated kids are still given substandard educations because their families don't have the means to move or pay the full amount out of pocket....and the schools have much lower incentive to change.

If - as we are told so many times by so many people - the ""school choice"" system doesn't work and the private schools don't do a better job - then the issue would simply go away if it was implemented since few parents would be willing to pay out of pocket for a worse education and many would still have to even with a voucher system.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w3o7q

Also, there is quite a [story](http://www.truth-out.org/last-union/1315492298) behind the current state of USPS.
&gt;It was only a few years ago that the USPS was considered not only stable, but thriving. The biggest volume in pieces of mail handled by the Postal Service in its 236-year history was in 2006. The second and third busiest years were in 2005 and 2007, respectively. But it was two events: one crafted during the Bush years and another supervised by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, that would cripple this once great institution.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps it was its booming history that first drew Congress' attention to the Postal Service in 2006 when it passed the Postal Accountability Enhancement Act (PAEA), which mandated that the Postal Service would have to fully fund retiree health benefits for future retirees. That's right. Congress was demanding universal health care coverage.
&gt;
&gt;But it even went beyond that. Congress was mandating coverage for future human beings.
&gt;
&gt;""It's almost hard to comprehend what they're talking about, but basically they said that the Postal Service would have to fully fund future retirees' health benefits for the next 75 years and they would have to do it within a ten-year window,"" says Chuck Zlatkin, political director of the New York Metro Area Postal Union.
&gt;
&gt;It was an impossible order, and strangely, a task unshared by any other government service, agency, corporation or organization within the United States. The act meant that every September 30th, the USPS had to cough up $5.5 billion to the Treasury for the pre-funding of future retirees' health benefits, meaning the Postal Service pays for employees 75 years into the future. The USPS is funding the retirement packages of people who haven't even been born yet.
&gt;
&gt;The hopeless task was made even more daunting when Wall Street blew up the world's economies. It was this, and not the invention of email, that became the Postal Service's death knell. Zlatkin finds the whole ""blame it on the Internet"" excuse amusing. The Internet had already existed for quite a while in 2006, the USPS's busiest year, not to mention that every item purchased on Amazon and eBay - every piece of information addressed to stockholders and bank customers - still needs to be snail mailed, which is enough volume to keep the Postal Service prosperous.

Anyway, the entire problem with Israel is that it's a ""Jewish"" state.  The country itself has an official ethnicity.  There is no such thing anywhere else in the industrialized world.  In 1948, the Jews already had enough people in Palestine to be a significant political force, unlike in Europe.  However, the idea of a ""Jewish state"" is what gave Israel the right to evict Arabs from their homes.  Had there just been a new state drawn there, with whatever population already existed, well that would be nothing new in the Middle East, as most of those borders are European-made.  When you explicitly give one ethnicity the ""right"" to control the land, however, you just change from one persecuted minority to another.

Today, Israel is the morally indefensible actor because it is not abiding by any set of rules--anywhere.  Their biggest ally, the US, continually asks them to stop building settlements, yet they continue.  Controlling Gaza and the West Bank can be argued as a security issue, as can blockades and other policies.  Settlement building, however, *outside of Israel's borders*, is just land grabbing.  Plain and simple.  It is those zealots that feel they are entitled to land--that no one else in the world agrees they are entitled to--who are in the way of peace and progress.  You cannot cry victim while simultaneously taking over more and more land.

Your post is correct in that there are very few morals when it comes to international relations.  Morals and ethics are far too philosophical to be used to gauge international politics.  There are, however, international norms and standards.  One of them is the borders that the U.N. laid out for Israel in 1948, another is the 1967 borders after peace was made, another is the Geneva conventions and other agreements that dictate how ""administrative"" territories like Gaza should be treated.

After looking at the best rated response I  don't feel there are any posts that adequatley cover why people believe in and join the Mormon church from the 1800s until present and how the reasons roughly remain the same . The post by st_thomas_aquaman was a great response addressing why people that lived around Joseph Smith joined the Mormon church and thought it was very believable, but I think it leaves out quite a bit and doesn't address how Mormonism attracted so many converts overseas and got them to leave behind their business, way of life and even family at times. The church grew rapidly and when they sent missionaries to Europe less than 20 years after the establisment of the church the Mormon missionaries had huge success and baptized scores that would eventually leave behind everything in order to come to the ""Zion"", meet the prophet Joseph and make America their new home in order to help build the Kingdom of God. There are a couple foundational claims that have drawn people to Mormonism and continues to do so even now and I feel that as long as the Mormon church exists these reasons will remain the dominant appeal to members and potential converts. The overarching appeal and narrative of Mormonism lies in a concept of restoration, current revelation and a divine authority given to man directly from God.

The first concept that should be explained is the ""restoration.""  The restoration explains the reason why and the need for God to call a prophet  after 1800 years of silence since the death of Christ and why the catholic church and reformation were not adequate enough. Mormons believe that a cycle has continued since the dawn of Man ( Yes a literal Adam and Eve thousands of years ago ) and that cycle consists of a pattern known as a restoration and an apostasy. The concept in its simplicity is that God gives man free will to choose and believe what he may, but in order to return and live with God in his presence after we die we must do his will and live his gospel. God taught Adam and Eve his gospel, gave them commandements, and Adam set up God's church on the earth. Only through God's church and obedience to his commandments can mankind return and live in his presence. Adam was called and given an authority Mormons refer to as priesthood and with this authority he acted as God's mouthpiece. Eventually nearing death Adam was told by God who to give the authority and passed it on to a certain son and the succession of authority supposedly continued, ensuring that God always had a mouthpiece to direct and lead his children back to him. Eventually, through mans free agency the gospel that was given to Adam and passed down to his sons etc. ( succession of prophet to prophet ) was lost because it was overwhelming rejected, tampered with and perverted. God rescinded his authority, revelation the world, and ceased to call any other prophet to lead the people for a period of time. This time is refered to as ""apostasy"" which denotes a falling away from the original truth. After a time and in God's wisdom he would later restore his authority by calling a new prophet and setting his church up again. Thus the pattern cycled over time where God would restore his church and authority and take it away when man was too wicked to live by it. 

The periods of time where God restored his church and authority and it remained available to mankind is called a ""dispensation."" In Mormonism there are a few major dispensations ( 7 or so I think ) . Biblical prophets like Adam, Enoch, Noah, Moses, Isaiah ??, and Jesus Christ were all the head hanchos of their respective dispensations. Every time God restored his gospel and authority after an apostasy a new dispensation would begin. As far as what God revealed at each dispensation it was usually different, the main gospel and authority, however always remained the same. For example, with one dispensation God would decide to reveal how he created the earth, the universe etc in detail and with another dispensation he would withold that information and say... give an allegorical account of the creation like what is found in Genesis. So with all these dispensations God would always reveal what was necessary for mans salvation, but sometimes he would go even further and explain a lot more. 

Eventually time flies and we get to the Birth of Christ. Mormons believe that Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God being half God and half mortal because he was also the son of Mary. Because Jesus Christ was the son of God he was immortal, but because he was the son of a mortal mother he was also capable of making mistakes and sinning. To make it brief the narrative of Christ goes like this. Jesus was capable of sin, but because he was perfect and did the will of his father in all things, he was clean and could forever dwell in Gods presence. The problem was that the rest of mankind was not only mortal * not immortal and died unlike Jesus * but also sinned and as a result would die both a physical and spiritual death. Jesus offered to become a vicarious sacrafice to appease justice and offered his life willingly and shed his blood for the sins of mankind. That means Jesus gave up his life and raised himself up through his God given power given by his father and in turn made it possible for every mortal being who ever lived to also become immortal and ressurrect. In Mormonism this is considered salvation and is a free gift given too all of mankind no matter what they believe or how wicked they are in this life. Since Mormons believe man is held accountable for his own actions and Adam brought death into the world it is only just that Jesus bring life back to mankind and raise everyone regardless of what they have done. A just and free gift. The shedding of Christ's blood is also a free gift but one that comes with conditions. In order to be cleansed from sin so that you can live in the presence of God after you are resurrected you need to live the gospel and obey the commandments given by God. This idea is called ""exahltation"" and is not the same as ""salvation"". You can be saved and live eternally, but you have to be exahlted if you want to live with God for eternity. 

So if Christ was born and offered himself up, restored the gospel, called apostles etc. why would God need to call a prophet in the 1800's almost two thousand years later? Well that little cycle of restoration and apostasy occured again. According to Mormon theology Jesus was rejected and though the church he set up grew, his apostles were also rejected over time and through persecution, the church doctrines changed and were lost and God took his authority away from man again. Mormons refer to this time as the great apostasy, great denoting that there was never a time like this since the history of man where so much darkness and false churches were set up claiming to be from God. According to Mormons  hundreds of years went by in this time of great darkness and good righteous people began to notice that the catholic church was not being led by God and erred and a reformation began and brought about a schism of protestants churchs. Well eventually Joseph Smith was born in a land where that had freedom of religion and God in his wisdom chose this 14 year old boy to become the new prophet of this last and final dispensation. Theologically Joseph's job was to restore God's true church on the earth again and this restoration was going to be differnt from every other restoration that happened. This was going to be the final restoration, a time where God restored all truth, all scripture and all commandments and doctrines. This would also be the last restoration to prepare Christ for his second coming. That means eventually all the questions will have answers. We will know how everything works, how the earth and universe was made, who exactly is God and if that God has a father etc.  Mormons like to refer to these things as ""deep doctrines."" Anyway there is an appeal here that eventually well learn everything there is to know and become just like God both in knowledge and in behavior (I.E. we become perfect and no longer have desire to sin.) 

So what has been and still is one of the greatest appeals to Mormonism is that God has called a living prophet in this final restoration of his gospel who supposedly speaks to God face to face and in turn tells all of us what God's will is. This is the final restoration and it won't be long until Jesus comes back to reign on earth as its rightful King. The Mormon religion provides the only path to return to God and receive exaltation through the restoratoin and through God's authority. With the concepts of a living oracle of God who reveals God's will to the world, a church set up and literally led by God, a sure way to return and live with God, and a religion that claims to be able to provide all the answers to everything and also miracles like those done by Jesus Christ its not hard to find the appeal. The idea of a restoration and divine authority become particularly appealing when theres thousands of religions and thousand more sects and branches of said religions.

It's history has been one of countries endlessly invading one another, empires being built and destroyed and a general level of ambient carnage. This way of running a continent reached its bloodiest level in the last century and after the second of two world wars, the Europeans decided that enough was enough and that all this silly warmongering had to stop. To this end, the European nations who weren't currently being ruled by the Soviets formed a community: At first it was about collaborative trade in coal and steel (the ECSC), but over time the countries began to work closer and closer together, eventually forming what is known as the European Union. Primarily, this was a political and trading union designed to bring the member states closer together and ultimately reduces the chances of another war breaking out. However, after a while it took on a life of it's own.

Seeing that the EU seemed to work rather well, some of the nations involved thought about taking the idea further and proposed a currency union known as the Eurozone. This would involve all those who signed up ditching their own currency and instead taking on a new one that was shared by it's neighbours. But why would they do this? Well, for one, it would make trade amongst European nations much easier as they wouldn't have to be constantly exchaging different currencies. On top of that, having a bunch of countries club together would give Europe a lot more clout. For example, the Franc could never go toe-to-toe with the dollar but maybe a currency based on the Franc, the Deutche Mark and numerous others could. In fact, there was serious talk for a time that the Euro could become the world's reserve currency, something that would give the Euro nations a massive advantage over other powers.

So that was the theory, but in practice things were a little different. For one, the Brits wanted nothing to do with it along with some other nations so it ended up with only some EU members being inside the Euro while some retained their own currency. Another thing about it was that it was quite different from other currencies for a number of reasons. For one, all the various members still had their own governments, their own finance ministers and set their own taxes while most currencies only answer to one central authority. Also, it's central bank didn't really have the sort of power we usually associate with the likes of the Federal Reserve. 

Having said that, the Euro did seem to work for a good many years. Naturally, this lead to more nations being allowed to enter in the hope that it would grow even stronger and bind Europe closer together. While the world economy was ticking along ok, this was fine but when things went wrong it exposed an underbelly that the planners probably hadn't counted on:

1. The countries involved were so diverse that no single currency could really serve all the members adequately. As a result, the strong economies ended up propping up the weaker ones and this began to grate on electorates.
2. Because there is very little central authority, it's very hard to do things quickly, as is evident from the last year or so.
3. No one really counted on the Greeks lying for many years about how much they had borrowed or quite how badly mauled some of the weaker nations would be by the economic crisis.

So yes, what was a very noble and highminded idea has become somewhat of a victim of reality and could actually be quite destabalising to Europe in the end, all of which would be tragic as it was part of a project to bring Europe together in the hope that peace could last.",True,13,,False,13,0,0,t1_c2w3zse

Allerdings halte ich die aktuellen Politikprobleme eher für Probleme der Komplexität in Verbindung mit guter Lobbyarbeit. Durch den komplexen Alltag sind die Probleme, mit denen sich Politiker beschäftigen müssen ebenfalls viel komplexer geworden. Das ist auch eine Art Transparenzproblem. Eine Vorgang ist nicht nur intransparent, wenn er geheim gehalten wird, sondern auch intransparent, wenn er hinreichend komplex ist, dass kaum noch jemand versteht worum es geht.

60 Jahre BRD, 50 Jahre EU, und dann in der wissenschaftlich exakten Sprache der Juristen. Wer soll da noch durch die Gesetze und Verträge blicken? 

Und die Lobbys arbeiten sehr intelligent im Auftrag ihrer jeweiligen Industrien und überzeugen die Politiker, dass das, was sie nicht ganz durchblicken in Wirklichkeit 'gut für die Allgemeinheit' ist.

Das ging lange gut. Selbst die unverschämten Stromkonzerne waren zwar demokratieschädlich, aber haben unsere Staaten nicht bedroht. Die Finanzindustrie schafft es aber ganze Staaten zum Wanken zu bringen. Das ist von keiner Industrie oder Lobby eine organisierte Aktion. Das ergibt sich einfach, wenn Marktteilnehmer, die Eigeninteressen verfolgen, Einfluss auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess nehmen. Zu ihren Interessen. So lange die Leute noch alle Gesetze und Folgen verstehen, kann man Interessenpolitik noch leicht aufdecken.

Aber die Kombination von heutigen Lobbys (zehnmal so viele wie Politiker, an Universitäten ausgebildet um den Politiker zu erklären wie gut doch ihre Ideen sind) und der Komplexität verschiedener Sachverhalte ergeben eine brisante Mischung. 

Oben drauf dann noch der angeblich begrenzte Einfluss der Politik durch Globalisierung (der kleinste gemeinsame Nenner bei Umwelt- und Arbeitsschutz sowie Löhnen gewinnt) und wir haben ein ziemliches Problem, welches m.E. so noch nicht da war. 

Wir hatten halt noch nie so lange stabile Demokratien. Zeitgeschichtlich vielleicht schon, aber die Zeit läuft heute schneller.

Ich dachte immer, dass man einfach die Wissenschaft fragen könnte. Die weiß ja was objektiv vorteilhafter ist. Aber über Kooperationen und daraus folgenden ""Gefälligkeitsgutachten"" sind schon so viele Lehrstühle korrumpiert, dass ich das inzwischen auch als sehr kritisch sehen muss.

Die Welt muss einfach gemacht werden. Wir brauchen einen Erklärbär. Und je erfolgreicher der ist, desto mehr werden Lobbys an den Erklärungen mitschreiben.

It was not possible for anyone foreign to buy tickets until the week of the match. I bought my ticket at a bank called San Paulo Intesta.  Branches are all over the city. You have to bring your passport (so they can make sure you're not a hooligan) and they accept cash only. It was very easy. If you get a ticket this way, make sure you bring your passport to the match. Your name is printed on the ticket, and they compare your passport picture to your name. 

Now, if this important match happens to sell out before you can get a bank ticket, have no fear. There are options. 

There were many many many people scalping tickets outside San Siro, and many have British accents. Scalped tickets will probably be pricey, but you know...you gotta do what you gotta do. If you go this route, again make sure you have your American passport going into the stadium. you're not supposed to be able to attend the match if your name doesn't match the name on the scalped ticket, but you can feign ""dumb american tourist stupidity"" and be fine. 

Also, you can ask your hotel if they can acquire a match ticket on your behalf. Tell them you'll pay a commission or a tip. You might have to fax a copy of your passport to them. 

Finally, the San Siro is awesome! Remember there are no concessions inside, besides cola, candy, and cigarettes, so make sure you grab a panini or bratwurst from one of the many trucks outside the stadium.  Also, if you take the subway, be prepared to choose a side, Milan, or Barca, when you exit. You'll have a better chance of getting a scalped ticket if you go the Milan direction.

You're suggesting that regulation is not important in these situations.

so then, you would be in favor of insider trading or sweatshops too, since these too are just ways of maximizing the existing systems to optimize reward?

The point here is that the system is arbitrary.  There is nothing ESSENTIAL about the system you have described.  It is a set of rules set in place through incentive structures that maximize return on investment in a local (i.e. greedy) way, in the computational sense... no long-term future, immediate reward.

Per your rationale, you are suggesting that this is the way it should be, because the system is fundamentally a gamble.  My assertion is that this is not correct; there should be safeguards to prevent people from losing their homes and making the kinds of investments that you suggest are natural in your interpretation.

I have many contacts in the financial industry in France, for example, and they suggest that these types of transactions are illegal in Europe; the suggestion is that if the risk is designated beyond a certain threshold for the payer, the lender may be guilty of predatory lending, since it is highly likely, per sociological data, that the payer cannot pay the loan in full.  My contacts laugh at the possibility of the 2008 crisis having happened in France, because those types of loans would have been laughed off as ridiculous, for both the lender and borrower.

You assume the system is the way it is because it is in the essence of finance.  it's not.

You assume risk should not be controlled, because, hell, caveat emptor.  

That's called predatory lending, and in human relations, that's sociopathy.

In my opinion the difference is that most European nations have homogeneous religious beliefs in their territory, so religion became just another institution like the army or the police and simply lost the ideological charge. In the US where there is still competition for religious dominance between various faiths, there is still heated debate. 

Take for example Italy. I live there and everyone is a Catholic, in theory. Practically noone goes to church let alone believe in chastity or not using a condom. Abortions are legal. They voted a transexual in parliament and the catholic right wing politicians are the worst offenders of catholic doctrine, most of them being divorced, having kids out of marriage, not to mention serial pervert Berlusconi a self proclaimed devout Catholic. Defacto nobody cares about it. 

Until they feel menaced by something that is. Islam or any other religion is not that welcome at all. So you see people that could not care less about church, protesting the opening of a mosque.

&gt; Corruption: Corruption has become an issue of major political and economic significance for the Portuguese. The responsible authorities and many civic associations and think tanks are trying to combat corruption before it increases further. Many abusive lobbies and corruption schemes are related to concessions, unclear approvals to contractors and economic groups, or job creation for and commercial agreements with friends and family members, mainly involving the huge public sector and companies. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, as well as a number of politicians with wider responsibilities and power.[42][43] Notable criminal cases include the Face Oculta, the Oeiras Municipality Mayor Isaltino Morais scandal, the Apito Dourado and the Saco Azul de Felgueiras. According to the 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index of countries published by Transparency International, Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption, out of 180 countries. In 2009 it had slumped to the 35th place.

This view caused the Cold War, since Russia was trying to do the same thing from the other perspective - but even with Russia fallen, we still perceive that infecting people with democracy would be good.

So, Israel was initially considered a kind of infection point. From it, democracy would spread thru the region and liberalize it. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and over time, Israel became something different - Israel became a sledgehammer in the region that we could use to negotiate with other regions. Now generally when people talk about that they talk about Palestine, but it goes deeper than that - our interactions with every Middle Eastern Arab nation are conducted while, essentially, we hold the leash of a huge, snarling bulldog.

Over time, unfortunately, our leash has become less effective. Israel, I believe, no longer views itself as acting in concert with us, and no longer trusts us to look out for it - and since we're not looking out for it, why would it listen to us?

Other factors: Israel realized very quickly that America was its lifeline. It has a very strong lobby of American citizens. For whatever reason, the Right has attached itself to Israel as well, which I find weird, but I find a lot of Neoconservativism very strange. Interventionism being a tool of the right instead of the left is a reasonably new thing, and it's confusing to me.

Finally,  I want to emphasize the geopolitical realities. America's an island. A really big island, but an island. That means America NEEDS a way to have a presence elsewhere, to be a super power. (Please - I recognize that we could debate the role of America and if we should be a super power, but just for the sake of this explanation, let assume we want to be a super power) - This is why we have tons of carriers. This is why we have bases all over Japan and Europe, which we pay for in incredibly large amounts. The problem is that Japan and Europe, while valuable allies, don't actually have any raw materials.

In terms of accessible raw materials, Africa and the Middle East are our choices. In Africa, everything is horribly destabilized. It's very hard to operate anything or control areas in Africa without committing a LOT of troops and losing a LOT of goodwill. But in the Middle East, there are powerful, secure dictators who you can do business with and trust to still be there tomorrow. Israel is another lever we can pull, and a place we can stage stuff from. It's a way of applying pressure and controlling the region. It's a strong ally, assuming things go to shit. It's got, by far, the best military in the region,etc, etc.

r/atheism has traditionally been a place where questioning theists and new atheists can find a support network-- typically American, because as many Europeans on Reddit seem dead set on emphasizing, religion apparently doesn't matter in most European countries.  Though this might be true for you, you simply cannot apply the same logic of how religion is over in, say, Italy to how it comes across in the U.S.

You may think American atheists' reactions are disproportionate, but American theists are the vast majority.  Here, your level of religiosity, especially for politicians, television hosts, newscasters and so on, determines the respect you get.  It is legitimately a massive deal if any public figure says anything about being a nonbeliever.  Do you have televangelists raping your citizens for guilt-money in Europe?  Megachurches?

I see your point in regards to American, though I refute your claim that there is not a great deal of shared cultural heritage between non-immigrant (or illegals) in the US. It is tangible through the cultural projection of the US everywhere else in the world.

I imagined a grasp of the English was a criterion for becoming a citizen? While Spanish might soon be the majority language in the States, it isn't yet (while English is not the official language, you cannot argue it is not the de facto language). Americans may speak other languages, but the primary language in the United States is English. I don't see how this is hilarious in any way.

I think your argument that the US has neither is laughable. It is quite palpable.

Just as the US has come into its own culture during the 300 years of its existence, so had the nations of Europe, through wildly varied ways and for a much longer time. Your time scale is hopelessly short if you only look back sixty years. Just in the previous century Europe has been laid waste twice. The century before that saw major conflicts both on the continent, revolutions and massive global endeavours. The end result of all this history for each individual country can not be neatly summarized and lumped together.

While you might say the EU and the UN enforces laws on Europe, it de facto enforces European (more specifically, French revolutionary) ideals and laws on everyone else.

A shared currency that has had a short and rocky life does not make a unified continent (one of the largest economies doesn't even participate!). In another fifty years I am sure the landscape will be radically different and I might agree that we have moved to more of an European nation. However, it is far-fetched right now and fallacious to assume.

First, liberty is not the means to a better society, it is the ends.   It is the way society solves problems without having mobs attack each other.   True, that a society based off of free exchange tends to become more prosperous.   The prosperity is the consequence, not the end goal.   I mean, imagine if somebody came along and said ""prove our society would be more prosperous without slavery"".   Well, nonsense.  The onus of proof is on the people imposing.  

Second, about the north European countries, and many other countries.   Many of these countries are like Saudi Arabia in that they get their money from oil and commodity exports to more industrial countries.    Their model would fail horrible if they actually had to produce their wealth like the US does.   Also, google the ""economic freedom index"".   You will find that many of these countries that have high taxes make up for it in different ways like they have no tariffs or light regulations, few labor laws, or uncontrolled trade markets, or extra strong respect for property rights.   If you are going to look at the success of the welfare state, look at **ALL** the countries on the planet, not just a few near the top of the economic freedom list that also happen to have some social programs.  

Third, there are lots of case freedoms even if there is no perfect freedom.   Go back to that economic freedom list.   Some countries regulate credit markets, others don't.   Some countries regulate wages, others don't.   Some countries have high tariffs, others don't.  Some countries have big welfare states, others don't.

People are jumping to conclusions that Greeks, down to each citizen are responsible for the mess in Europe. I don't understand that logic. I can understand that for instance, people in Germany and other countries are angry because they don't want to be screwed helping the Greeks and other countries. But the major problem are the bankers that are continuously lending money to Greece. Greeks never wanted any of this. Greeks didn't want to be lent money out of it's debt from the IMF/Troika. The idea first of all is preposterous. Lending money is going to get Greece out of debt? It just increases the debt. Secondly, one of the reasons Papandreou got voted into power was because he promised Greeks he would not go that route. He lied. And yes, Greeks shouldn't have been allowed to enter the EU, because they cooked their books. But Greek politicians also lied to the Greek people painting everything beautiful and nice. 

Banks are the real problem, which is the point I'm getting at. Banks borrowing money from the European Central bank at a low interest rate, and then lending it at 10-15% or perhaps more, how can banks not make money? Then Banks get bailed out from their reckless decisions, placing that weight on the shoulders of the people in the EU. There is no future if this is how the markets are going to continue. It's obvious that it can't. And collateralizing debt on public assets is where the true profit is at. That is why bankers, and the elite are waiting for Greece to default, so as to take Greek assets for hardly anything at all. Even the Chinese/Russians are waiting in line to buy up Greek assets. It's incredibly immoral. It's not only going to happen in Greece either. But also Portugal, Ireland, Spain, etc. I feel incredibly sad for these countries, because their wealth, the public wealth of these countries are going to be privatized. Greece for instance no longer owns any of their ports. None of their major roads, and most of their airports. In the past Greeks went to war and shed blood, when these assets were in danger of being lost. 

Greece, and other EU countries in debt like Portugal, Spain, need the following. They need to eliminate their toxic environment that disallows real wealth to be created. They need to spend money to create real wealth, (even though that may even sound preposterous as well). Through entrepreneurial inventions, technologies, new ideas, etc. But banks don't want this type of progress. They are in the business to bail themselves out, place their debt on the people, and to steal wealth. Global banks tell Greek politicians what to do, and they do it. There is no one left to trust. But I don't think people should focus their anger on Greek people. I don't see the logic in that. Sure Greeks are responsible for many wrongs, but these global bankers are at large the most at fault. They are destroying Europe. I wonder how the US will fair though once the default comes. The US apparently has insured the loans foreign bankers lent out to Greece, Portugal, and Spain.

There are many people who like to talk about things like ""right to exist"" and the Holocaust, and religion, and disproportionate Jewish influence in western politics, but the truth is these things don't actually matter. They add to the story and make it more interesting, but this is how the whole thing would have played out, with or without any of those things (including the Holocaust). Great Britain and the Allies wanted to draw lines so that no single nation could rise out of the region and stand against us, and that's what we did. It was helpful to have a few million Europeans who were itching to go there and didn't need any additional incentives, but that's just icing. We wanted it cut up and fighting with itself, and that's what we got.

The US doesn't have a right to exist, Sweden doesn't have a right to exist, etc. In fact, as friendly as we all like to think of these pretty Scandinavian countries, if Finland collapsed, or was ravaged by disease or civil unrest to the point that it couldn't defend itself, Sweden and Russia would be fighting over it like wild dogs over a ham bone, and it wouldn't take a whole day.

It was put into place after heavy lobbying from Zionist organizations cried out for Western nations to come to the aid of Israel after the Arab states had organized as aggressors against Israel during the Suez Crisis. The oil wealth in the region has always been one of our key concerns, but our 'friendship' with Israel has been pretty important too. 

Israel has many times acted as the aggressor and to intentionally start conflicts in the region, often with our support or with us just looking the other way. I, as an American, am concerned with the situation because of the effects a large scale Middle Eastern war would have on the rest of the world. If the Arab nations would ever unite against Israel again, we would quite likely be looking at WWIII. Fortunately, kind of, they are mostly too frightened that Israel will use the nukes they have been promising to unleash for the last 30 years on their neighboring countries. The sway the Jewish/Israeli lobbyists/government has over our politics and decision making is abhorring. This is a nation that has intentionally attacked US troops (USS Liberty Incident) in order to hide their own trickery and complete disrespect and disregard for human life. 

Contrary to popular opinion, the Jews were the first in the region to begin to use terrorist attacks against the Palestinians, rather than the other way around. There were many Jewish radical organizations that existed prior to statehood that were proponents of terror attacks that were absorbed into the Israeli Defense Force upon receiving statehood. In fact, some of the most prominent members who carried out some of the most atrocious attacks against Palestinians became high level cabinet members and even eventually Prime Minister in Israel. 

To me, the real problem in the area is Israel. They refuse to come to the table with reasonable offers for peace or cohabitation and refuse to concede that the land they live on is STOLEN. To me, what we did in '48 was the equivalent to giving the Indians the United States and kicking us all out to Canada because of 500 year old grievances. The Israelis are very quick to use violence and have often made use of 'preemptive strikes' to scare the Palestinians before there have been any conflicts between the two groups, like in the 1967 War. Israel invaded Syria, Egypt and Jordan to show the Arabs who was boss, with our support of course. Israel also lends us some strategic value due to its geographical location. 

In blindly pushing weapons, money, and allowing for Zionist groups to have so much power, we have created a monster in Israel. They cannot be controlled, will never step into line with international opinions on the validity of Palestine's statehood bid or their desire to have a state in Israel. Israel has done exactly what they have wanted since they began settling Palestine again. They tricked the local Palestinians and created massive organizations to buy land for dirt cheap and sell it back to Israeli settlers. Even when the US and Great Britain instituted holds on immigration to the area from the 20s-WWII, many Jews snuck over illegally, though with the situation and Europe and the fact that most countries had closed their borders to the Jewish immigrants, who can blame them? My largest issue with the Zionists is their cruelty and refusal to see the Palestinians, who are in all likelihood their long lost cousins, as humans, worthy of rights and protection under the law. There are many important issues that are situated within the greater conflict, and their affect on world politics through our lifetime will be very very scary.",True,1,,True,1,0,0,t1_c2w4qte

SPOILERS AHEAD 
   I think a lot of fantasy readers dislike these books because they are in many ways the anti-epic and a complete subversion of the Tolkien tropes. Bayaz in particular is like a bizarro Gandalf, a brutal, Machiavellian figure who uses finance and military might as proxies in his unceasing war against his ancient rival. Logan is the closest the books have to a hero, but is wont to go into a berserker rage and kill his oldest friend or the odd child who gets in his way. Glokta is fascinating and sympathetic, but is, you know, a torturer, and co-opted by Bayaz in the end. 
   Ultimately I think these books will resonate with anyone who loved Tolkien but was bothered by the automatic pro-Western, pro- Christian Europe overtones and the demonization of the foreign devils that is so evident in them.

Defence policy is a lot murkier than people assume, it could even be a decade or two until adequate management would take effect but then you'd be taking on the vested interests of arms firms and representatives with those factories or bases in their constituencies. Lockheed would 'flip the fuck out' along with the relevant senators and congressmen/women. To add onto the foreign policy matter as an English School theorist, I believe the United States should continue its role in donations of foreign aid and involvement within the UNSC, although I'd recommend not being so veto-heavy either but once again, that's a whole new kettle of fish.


For the banking sector the US could take a page from the EU proposals on having their own fund to protect themselves from failure than having to rely on the state again.


The bad loans situation would still happen in a more market oriented system, there aren't enough punitive measures in effect to keep the banking system at bay, I hate the fact that businesses have to have basic ethics shoved down their throat but we've already learned they cannot self regulate.

On social policies I remain disappointed and the 'States' Rights' element really needs some assessing due to the vagueness of the American constitution as a whole. Instead of having fully equal rights you'd be encouraging a system in which groups of people would have varying rights just because they live in a different state. This is where the gay and women's rights rings true. The ""Why don't they just move?"" argument is also ridiculous too because it forces people who have done nothing wrong to move elsewhere just to experience rights they should have in the first place. So there does need to be better scrutiny at a federal level or a fucktonne of extra amendments to the constitution to guarantee inalienable rights across the board (Taking the Canadian system as an example here for their constitution). There's also the point on where people draw the line on what is a right and what is a privilege. I come to blows with Libertarians here because I'm a strong believer in a safety net and see healthcare as a right for all citizens.

On another separate point I believe in a different attitude to drug policy, I want the legalisation of marijuana (With research into potential legalisation for other soft drugs) but only from licensed vendors with businesses able to grow supplies for retail consumption. Plus this makes those sales taxable which can then help support the American economy further, by just decriminalising it the money would still go to scumbag dealers rather than business owners. Hell, there'd be cafes and corner shops in inner city districts rather than boarded up buildings with such proposals.
 

I'll admit though, I'll always be ideologically different and I have every damn right to be. I'm a social democrat and proud of it. I criticise all systems including my own but it's clear enough to tell that I'm not cut from American cloth.

Our baby's about a month old and had no problems from it (Yes, I know this is anecdotal).

I've always thought this safety hysteria for ""risks"" like this was a bit extreme. You can cause damage from a lot of foods if you eat enough of it, and alcohol is no different.

It would take people realizing that it doesn't matter what heaven you think you'll get to when you die, you have 90ish years here before that you need to figure out what to do with.

Resources are another huge issue. We have limitless resources at our disposal, our entire planet is a perpetual motion machine just waiting to be harnessed. We could generate limitless power with minimal impact to the planet, easily, and in more ways than just solar or wind. But again, why would we solve our energy problems? Then we wouldn't make billions on our current fossil fuels.

There are limitless reasons to make bombs, and although humanity has the ability and knowledge to create ingenious solutions to problems we would rather argue about who is better at what. 

None of these are new problems, since the beginning of history man has fought over government, religion, and resources. The only difference is were no longer firing arrows, were firing missiles and everyone is on a razors edge waiting to hit that button. 

Basically, yes we can avoid it, but people have to change. We have to trust each other and work together and realize that we are on a very fine edge in human history and one small thing in either direction will tip the scales. 

Im sure most people disregard the doomsday scenario, i mean, were civilized people, we would never do something like that... again... for the third time. 

The issues we face aren't big issues. There's just no one that wants to accept or fund the answers.

Basically, you worship your way and i wont in my way.

Create new ways to get resources, this one is indescribably simple, but no one will pay for the development of unlimited water and power, even if i could set up new designs for them in a few weeks for no cost (which i would do btw) no one will build the facilities.

They also did not offer citizenship to the Palestinian Arabs that lived there. 

When Israel declared statehood it's greatest concern, as you can well imagine, was an attack from antisemitic Europe. Israel offered citizenship to the 900,000 Palestinian Arabs that lived in the area. Strength in numbers and all that. 155,000 Palestinian Arabs took Israels offer and stayed in their homes and became Israeli citizens. Those Arabs and their descendents make up one fifth of Israel's population today. Let me ask you honestly - did you know this? It's not hidden knowledge but it is never mentioned by Palestinian advocates.


In one of the biggest dick moves in history the remaining Palestinian Arabs rejected Israel's offer of citizenship and chose to wage war with Egypt and Jordan. They lost and became refugees. The West bank and Gaza were given back to Egypt and Jordan and in 1967 Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and the Palestinians prepared to attack Israel from that same land. Israel won that war. From 1967 Israel has kept the land and kept a boot on the throat of the Palestinians who continue to suicide bomb and fire rockets and vote in Hamas. The Palestinians do not want peace or a state.

If you want to experience true SPANISH culture, I highly recommend Madrid. Barcelona is part of Catalunya, which has a very different culture than the rest of Spain.

You can find people believing in and worshiping a lot of Saints and dancing music called ""Palos"" which is related to Santeria. Also those same people practice things like Voodoo, especially in the south-west side of the Island (which is close to Haiti). Many others, mostly residents of the rural areas, still believe in ancient legends like [Ciguapa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguapa) and [Galipotes](http://www.monstropedia.org/Galipote) and can give you testimony of personal encounters.

All these beliefs go with a dressing of ultra conservative Christianity (and all the tree branches) influenced and enforced by the Spaniards in the times of the Colonization of the Americas, served with the local traditions ([Aborigenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas#Other_parts_of_the_Americas) and their deities). If you give all those dangerous ingredients the chance to mix, you obviously will read this kind of barbarism being commit by the people. Thankfully in my country, people are a little bit less savage (a little bit less...), not saying that people in Africa are animals or with the intention of offend people, but I come from a country that has similarities, and the simple fact that you mention that you are an Atheist can lead people to tag you with a ""lost soul"" label, a ""devil worshiper"", a ""bad influence for the Youth"" and so on.

The Russians massacred upwards of 20,000 Polish officers by tying them up and shooting them in the back of the head (Read Katyn Woods Massacre) for fear of reprisals by the Poles after the war.

Every post of church vandalism I have ever seen has been met with comments of ""Not cool, man.""

No, I don't, but I'm sure statistically they exist. They seem to lack influence, though. You say that the reason that this doesn't happen is because all there is to being atheist is to not believe in a God, but I would think that the actions I described would be what a *zealous* or *militant* atheist would do. But, despite how many such atheists you think there are in the US or on r/atheism, I, again, have never seen any such behavior.

Typically you must believe with absolute conviction that drives you to do something you would not normally do to be a zealot. Personally, I call out bullshit, and I argue against lies. I imagine many people do that. If you are an atheist, and you live in a society in which a lie (religious myths and dogma) is actively propogated and proselytized to the public in public institutions and through public policy, calling it out is what you should do, even if you are a theist or a Christian or a Muslim or Jew or Pagan. 

If religion were strictly personal in the US, if it were not influential in government and in public institutions or elections, I think very few would care much about it, much like in Europe and Australia and other nations.

I'm sorry, the way you are summarizing my thoughts, are you disagreeing with me? I just want to understand better. You want people to blame Greek people because they borrowed money from the IMF/Troika that they didn't want? They were opposed to it from the get-go. They knew they couldn't afford it. Hence the protests. But you want to blame the Greeks? You want to blame Greeks for voting in at around 50% someone that lied that they wouldn't go to the IMF/Troika for loans, but did it anyways? 

And you don't think banks are to blame at all? The memorandum states that Greece must give up most of it's assets to banks upon default. (Side note: According to the Greek Constitution, anyone that signed such document commits treason. Greece went to war when for example when Mussolini asked for a couple of ports from the Greek government.) But these bankers are ""pure spirits"" that are just trying to ""help out"" without having any intention of having Greece default so that they could acquire them? 

I'm in no way saying, Greeks are not to blame. I said no such thing, and I think you are oversimplifying my previous post. But the problems these bankers are causing in Europe outweigh Greece's problems by a long shot. 

And it's like no one is aware of what happened in Argentina early 2000. If I follow the logic of some of the people here, I should have said back then, ""Argentinian people are to blame for their own actions for placing in corrupt politicians, and placing themselves in debt."" It's pretty damn easy to place the blame on the people, but I don't think it makes much sense. Today, Argentinians pay private corporations abroad for the tap water they use. Their own water is not their own. They lost so much. Poverty went up, crime went up, the suicide rate went up... To me that's just immoral. Bank Boston closed down because of their immoral actions and involvement. The point is, no country would do that to themselves. Greece is protesting, because they don't any of this.

Greece has the same problems and all this idiotic talk about the lazy Greeks only serves to put the blame on everyone except the ones who are actually responsible. It separates us from them, when instead we should all be on the same side and try to change the system enough so it won't collapse.

I think the majority of criticism of American beer is based on the American Light Lager style that gets pumped out of Bud/Miller/Coors on a regular basis and as such craft beer aficionados often default to the position that people who complain about American beer are complaining about BMC, unless the complaint is made specifically about something else.  ""I don't like beer"", is ludicrous statement.  Beer is such a nebulous term, it'd be like saying ""I don't like sandwiches"".  And 90% of the time it seems like the majority of people's beer experience is based on Bud, Coors, Labatt, Molson...or maybe some generic American Pale Ale and they've never even had a stout, or a hefeweizen, or an English Barleywine.  Their opinion of beer is, in fact, ignorant.  And we're used to it.

I see complaining about the extreme stuff as a bit weird, as well.  It's like being annoyed someone is having too much fun with their hobby.  Also, it's just not representative of what American craft and microbreweries are actually doing.  Despite the amount of press the extreme beers get, they're a small minority of what we brew.  In the Boston area where I live there are a ton of small breweries making Belgian saisons.  We've got one guy who literally makes nothing but session beers and cask ale.  Full Sail brewery also has a session series, and they distribute nationally.  There was a brewery in my hometown that made mostly Pale Ales, ESB and Scotch Ale...it was generic, but solid.  And they distribute to like 4 states.  

American breweries are also carrying the torch of traditional techniques and Belgian styles that are becoming unpopular in Europe.  Sierra Nevada, New Glarus, and Allagash all ferment some beers using traditional open fermentation in coolschips.  While craft beer in America is a very new scene, we definitely respect brewing heritage but we're also young punks and want to have some fun with it every now and then.

I really don't understand what Israels game is anymore. They have lasted this long because they have had public opinion on their side but they have let that slip nearly entirely. They are in a position where they only have one ally and that ally becomes less and less relevant every passing day.

I have no idea why the Israelis don't look into the future and realise the next 70 years will be completely different to the last 70. They really need to do something about it. I know religion and reason don't go hand in hand but IMO a large part of where the Israel situation goes and perhaps whether there is even an Israel in the future depends on what actions they take now.

I would say for one Israel needs to stop seeing itself as a Jewish state. Don't bring religion into politics because in a lot of nations that is a huge mistake, a lot of countries may have been religious in the past but that is no longer the case and there is a growing backlash for religion. This is one of the reasons the EU has the relationship it does with the likes of Israel and Saudi Arabia. People here really don't like being involved with shit like that.

I think the same would apply to alcohol. A few weeks back, I submitted a question which asked why many drugs are illegal where tobacco and alcohol aren't. The (I believe) most accurate answer I received was  
&gt;Some drugs are illegal to keep the monopoly going for the current legal ones. Prohibition has never worked so eventually with enough time this will change, but until the money is taken out of the system (private prisons and the like) nothing will change.

Of course, the  conspiracy theorist side of me kind of believes that it's due to the powers not wanting us to open our minds for fear of what truths we may realise.

I know I'm going off on a bit of a tangent, but alcohol and tobacco cause more physical harm than a lot of other drugs, yet they are deemed to be acceptable. At the same time, I don't have the right to put something in my body that causes a lot less harm and affects nobody but myself.

' Today, Israeli contributions to U.S. national interests cover a broad spectrum. Through joint training, exercises and exchanges on military doctrine, the United States has benefited in the areas of counter-terrorism, intelligence and experience in urban warfare. Increasingly, U.S. homeland security and military agencies are turning to Israeli technology to solve some of their most vexing technical and strategic problems.

' This support includes advice and expertise on behavioral screening techniques for airport security and acquisition of an Israeli-produced tactical radar system to enhance force protection. Israel has been a world leader in the development of unmanned aerial systems, both for intelligence collection and combat, and it has shared with the U.S. military the technology, the doctrine and its experience regarding these systems. Israel is also a global pacesetter in armored vehicle protection, defense against short-range rockets, and the techniques and procedures of robotics, all of which it has shared with the United States.

' In missile defense, the United States has a broad and multifaceted partnership with Israel. Israel's national missile defenses — which include the U.S. deployment in Israel of an advanced X-band radar system and the more than 100 American military personnel who man it — will be an integral part of a larger missile defense spanning Europe, the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf to help protect U.S. forces and allies.

' Israeli-developed defense equipment, some of which benefited from generous U.S. aid, now used by the U.S. military include short-range unmanned aircraft systems that have seen service in Iraq and Afghanistan; targeting pods on hundreds of Air Force, Navy and Marine strike aircraft; a revolutionary helmet-mounted sight that is standard in nearly all frontline Air Force and Navy fighter aircraft; lifesaving armor installed in thousands of MRAP armored vehicles used in Iraq and Afghanistan; and a gun system for close-in defense of naval vessels against terrorist dinghies and small-boat swarms. Moreover, U.S. and Israeli companies are working together to produce Israel's Iron Dome — the world's first combat-proven counter-rocket system.

' Counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation is deep and extensive, with the United States and Israel working to advance their common interest in defeating the terrorism of Hamas, Hezbollah and Al Qaeda and its affiliate groups, and preventing nuclear proliferation in the region. There are joint Special Forces training and exercises and collaboration on shared targets.

' This intimate relationship reinforces overall U.S. intelligence efforts by providing Washington with access to Israel's unique set of capabilities for information collection and assessments on key countries and issues in the region.

US tax code today is at the most progressive level it's ever been since the post war period. Also US tax code is far more progressive than any European nation. While Western Europe has higher top marginal rates it also has much higher rates on median and bottom earners.

""For example, when refundable tax credits and other tax incentives are included across the entire income spectrum, the United States has the most progressive income tax code among its peer nations, although its overall income tax rates are below the OECD average.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax


So look, if you want to raise taxes on the rich to Clinton levels or Western European levels I'm fine with that. But part of the bargain has to be that you have to raise those tax rates across the board to match. You can't keep expecting the wealthiest 1% to shoulder a higher and higher proportion of the tax burden like the US has been doing. Sacrifice has to be shared across the spectrum. The US in 2011 has the most progressive tax system across both time and space, so how can you justify making it even more progressive.

I believe this is the central reason that OWS is rejected in middle America. Democracy is a double edge sword. It's bad side comes out when populism is exploited to allow a majority to perpetually raid a small minority that doesn't have the votes to defend itself. The nightmare scenario here is Zimbabwe, where a populist politician runs the economy back into the stone age by increasingly redistributing from a small productive elite. 

Whether you think this comparison is valid or not, it is what middle America is seeing when it looks at OWS. Logically one would think a movement standing up for 99% would have 99% support. Instead it has below &lt;50% support. 

If you want OWS to be taken seriously you have to articulate why America which already has the most progressive tax system of any first world nation should redistributing even more. You have to explain why OWS's plan for redistribution is different than that which has doomed a hundred Soviet and third world countries to poverty.",True,0,,False,0,0,0,t1_c2w5o7k

Frankly, I think even bothering other people about their beliefs at all (i.e. the lame Facebook shit) is an example of a zealous or militant atheist. Again, there's absolutely nothing involved in being an atheist. It just means that you, personally, don't believe. It's no one else's business. 

Once you start trying to force your beliefs on other people, even if it's as simple as acting superior to a Christian on Facebook, you're being  militant, because most atheists don't do *anything* about their lack of belief, as they shouldn't. They just don't believe. That's all there is to it.

&gt; If you are an atheist, and you live in a society in which a lie (religious myths and dogma) is actively propogated and proselytized to the public in public institutions and through public policy, calling it out is what you should do, even if you are a theist or a Christian or a Muslim or Jew or Pagan.

I *don't* live in a society like that, though, and nor do many of the other atheists on Reddit. I've argued in the past that there should be a separate subreddit for pissed-off American atheists, because their experience is not representative of people elsewhere in the world.

&gt; If religion were strictly personal in the US, if it were not influential in government and in public institutions or elections, I think very few would care much about it, much like in Europe and Australia and other nations.

I think the fact that there are people being just as vocal about their atheism as the religious people are about their religions means that's *never* going to happen in the US, unfortunately.

The reason religion is *not* part of public policy in Europe, Australia and here in Canada is because no one gives a shit about it, even if the country is nominally Christian-dominated. Just don't bother each other and everything will calm right down.",True,3,,False,3,0,0,t1_c2w5q9e

Furthermore, european integration was heavily pushed by Germany and france after WWII, if you are interested, look up the Montanunion, that's where the starting point of european integration was concieved. One of my grandfathers was a soldier on the western front, but he never talked about the war, I think he was a pow with the americans for a year and a half or so. My other grandfather was 14 when the war ended and barely dodged the Volkssturm (conscription of the old and really young to be thrown into the meatgrinder). All of his male classmates died ""defending"" a bridge that was hit by a russian bomber. When his town was taken by the russians, he was forced to help load bombs into bombers starting from a nearby airstrip that were used to bomb the City of Breslau. 

The germans and the russians used to be best buds for a really long time, Kaiser Wilhelm even helped Lenin get to Russia in 1917 to get the revolution going so that the eastern front could calm down. Furthermore a part of Germany was part of the eastern bloc as you hopefully remember.

The one country that germany has still some strained relations with, is in my opinion poland. This is due to the fact that poland got crushed between the soviets and germany and that a big part of the genocide was committed in poland ( auschwitz, warsaw ghetto, etc.)
Furthermore a big part of now poland used to be german and the germans there after WWII were pretty heavily discriminated against. Fortunately my grandfather and grandmother could leave in 1960 before they closed it of completely, because my grandfathers brother was in the navy and stationed in Bremen.

So now that that's out of the way now to your last question:  I visited the KZs and I visited the town in now poland, formerly Silesia in prussia, where my grandparents are from. And it feels humbling to know where we come from, it makes you feel sad to see all the hate and violence people have done to each other.

The difference between Germany and the US, is that we had acts like the famous ""kniefall"" of willy brandt, who fell to his knees in warsaw in honor of the victims of the genocide. I never saw anything remotely as powerful from an american head of state, even though with the whole slavery thing, the trail of tears, the japanese internment and other things, the US would have plenty of things to feel guilty about. You are shaped by the society you live in, you don't get to decide that you only take the good and the rest is put off as: I didn't do none of that. 

So what, you live in a system that profiteered from the systematic exploitation of slave labor, that committed genocide on the native americans and others. Funny how both african americans and native americans are still extremely disenfranchised compared to the comfy position white people are in. You don't see any relation between the history and the present situatioN? well I do, that's why I make this assessment. 

And I feel the situation pretty much vindicates my interpretation. Look at japans role in Asia, they are pretty much hated by the koreans, chinese and most other countries because they never acknowledged the atrocities they committed in their imperialistic period ( rape of nanking for example is still denied by a lot of japanese people).

I had started going back to church because I liked to sing and missed being in a choir. I kept seeing this woman my age out of the corner of my eye. She was a foot shorter than me, very kind looking and worked at the church. I confided to a mutual friend that she had caught my eye and soon found myself on group dates where we could spend time together.

We went on a trip with the choir to sing in a church music festival in England. While we were there, she wanted to complete a fine china pattern she had been collecting and to eat lots of European chocolates. We went everywhere together, took long walks and spent time getting to know each other. She surprised me late one night in a small pub by asking if my intentions towards her were ""honorable"" and I said ""Yes"" at which point we became engaged. ( And I continue to maintain to this day that she asked *me* to marry *her*... )

We were married the year I turned 30. We discovered shortly thereafter that we would not be able to easily conceive and start the family we wanted. So we started a business and worked hard to earn the money necessary to adopt. When I turned 40, we had a successful marriage, a successful business and had adopted our son. By the time I was 43 we had our daughter as well.

I'm 44 now, still love her like newlyweds. We hold hands when we walk places, of course now with kids on either side or sometimes between. I have a comfortable home, good friends, a well stocked bar and am making the time to be the kind of father and husband I've always wanted to be. 

I am utterly, completely overwhelmed by how blessed I feel everyday. This is especially true when I contrast how utterly and completely lost I was at 25.

Atheist Americans for the most part aren't trying to declare Atheist supremacy. There aren't large numbers of Atheists trying to force every one into a society where we are all Atheists. Most Atheists are only trying to fight for their share of social space, and to defend themselves against Theists who seek to pass laws that undermine, disenfranchise, and even persecute Atheists. 

A lot of what you probably perceive are individuals who are vocally Atheist and who are very excited about their revelation. (These people make up the majority of r/atheist.) They are very much the same as a person who becomes born again, and while the revelation is desperately important to that person, the rest of us really don't care. Most atheists/agnostics in America are like yourself, silent and not concerned with the beliefs of others. 

However, some Atheists see themselves as being superior, because they have a position which is rooted in science and fact. This is no less a system of belief, and Atheists are just as capable of being ignorant and faith based as devout Theists. Instead of hearing the sound of a thousand whinny new Atheists you should look beneath the surface at the sub-conflict. 

A major difference between America and Europe is that America has a very conflicted story when it comes to religion and its founding myth. Many of the original British colonies were actually created so that religious groups could set up their own theocratic states. (The Puritans in New England, the Catholics in Maryland.) Others were set up to be religiously tolerant. Very different from Italy's Catholic creation story where the church predates the nation and is a part of its identity.

However, unlike individual states and other countries the United States was founded as a secular nation which respected all religious beliefs and supported none. This worked out fairly smoothly as the country was majority Christian and the different Christian groups generally were able to co-exist and ignore the founding ideal. (Sporadic violence often occurred between groups, but nothing like the middle east.) Because of the homogeneous nature of the population it was easy to pass laws imposing religious ideals and expression on society, even though these laws were in opposition to the founding ideal. As the population has shifted and different groups have grown this has created conflict.

Fast forward to today, and what you get are two opposing sides which are very vocal minorities. On one side you have theists of all shapes and sizes who are upset by what they perceive as a lose of their majoritarian power and limitations or removal of their ability to flaunt their beliefs and make laws based on them. On the other you have Atheists who for the first time in American history are beginning to have greater numbers and who are just trying to get America to live up to its founding notion of a government that doesn't support or impose religion on others.  (Example, very few atheist would want to put ""in no god we trust,"" on our money, but all would be in support of removing ""in god we trust,"" because both slogans effectively serve to disenfranchise individuals who believe the opposite and provide at least incidental support for what can be considered a religious belief.)

You say you don't care about religion, but I read a certain amount of animosity towards Atheists for what you perceive as attacks on religious people. While you may be free today to be Agnostic or an Atheist in Italy, it wasn't always the case. At certain times you would have been slowly tortured and possible killed for a lack of belief.

Fortunately, both our countries are more civil, but there is still a conflict and in America that conflict has serious ramifications on the way our society is structured and our daily lives. As a minority Atheists have to be loud and they have to confront those individuals who for what ever reason seek to force them out of the marketplace of ideas. This sadly often sounds whinny, or conceited, and often comes in the form of intellectual bashing. However unfortunate or annoying this often occurs because in a discussion between two or more individuals where one or more clings strongly to a belief there is no possibility for rational discourse. 

So, no. It is not an attempt to impose fundamentalist Atheist viewpoints or an attempt to emancipate oneself from bad experiences of youth, but a combined over exuberance and lack of rational discourse with a very serious struggle for equality.

TL; DR: American Atheists are a vocal minority struggling for equality and a secular state that lives up to the founding ideal. European states have a luxury of being fairly homogenous in religious identification which is part of the culture and thus leads to significantly less vocal conflicts.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w68s9

There are plenty of unemployed youth in Greece with higher education degree who are perfectly capable of holding specialized jobs and/or starting businesses.

You can't evaluate the cost of nationalized jobs unless you evaluate the cost of outsourcing, corruption at the higher levels, tax loopholes for businesses, etc. Really, an economy is a whole. What goes on in the highest spheres is what is kept secret. We'd probably just stand in disbelief if we had an accurate picture of who owns the wealth and where they put it.

The culture we ""project"" throughout the world is just as much of an awkward presence at our table as it is at yours.

The movies Hollywood comes out with are as much a show of our diversity as a country as they are a show of how blind Hollywood is to the world around them. Yes, many of the movies we produce tell stories against the backdrop of a coherent country, but that country is not the United States of America.

The television shows we produce are only of the most generic and bland variety. ""Friends"", for example, portrays a wonderful, beautiful city full of life and people where people form small, close-knit social networks and only ever seen to work like an hour a day. That city, while it is referred to as New York, is not anything like New York. Not my experiences of New York at least. The majority of television from here is like that, portraying a watered-down version of what really goes on. It's inauthentic and bland.

Long story short, I feel that the bonds of culture within the US are only ever so slightly stronger than they bonds of the culture of the entire combined Western world. It's really not a thing. I probably have almost as much in common with you, a Norwegian, as I have with someone living in a different state in the US.

Yes, in order to become a citizen you have to speak and understand English on a certain level. That is true. That does not, however, imply that people retain that knowledge, or that children born here are taught English. You know English, does that lessen your cultural bonds with your country? Lots of groups here are *vehemently* opposed to integration, nearly every major metro area has a ""Chinatown"" and a ""Little Vietnam"" and a ""Little Italy"" because people are so opposed to losing who they are. These places are insular, and there are people who live the majority of their lives inside of small regions of cities so they won't be exposed to anyone else's culture. That seems like the opposite of a unified culture and language.

&gt;The end result of all this history for each individual country can not be neatly summarized and lumped together.

History != Culture

The fact that they've had to grow up around each other over and over again seems to support the notion that they're more unified that you're letting on.

&gt;While you might say the EU and the UN enforces laws on Europe, it de facto enforces **European** (more specifically, French revolutionary) ideals and laws on everyone else.

So you're saying that we're all conforming to Europe's legal ideas? Seems like, again, Europe is closer to being a single, unified entity than you're letting on.

Regarding the Euro, the Euro is simply an explicit statement of the status quo as I have seen it in the last two decades - money in Europe is transient. You can change one currency to another and even spend one country's currency in a neighboring country with little fanfare. In the US, with the exception of a few very limited areas (Airports, the city of New York, the city of Las Vegas), it is easier to purchase a congressman than it is to get francs turned into dollars.

Complains about big, obnoxious, pretentious beers

But seriously though, on the one hand I can understand where you're coming from; if your sample population comes from the ""bro you gotta try this"" category of XXXTREME beers (many imperial stouts, double IPAs, strange fruit concoctions, etc) then I agree with you. Some American craft beers are completely over the top simply for the sake of being over the top.

That's far from the norm though, IMO. Breweries like Victory, Sierra, Oskar Blues, Left Hand, Brooklyn, etc (to name some of the more well-known ones) do an excellent job marrying the characteristic American 'boldness' with clean, well-balanced beer. Sure, American tastes in craft beer are typically going to mean a more present hop aroma/bitterness (for example) than you would see in a classic European style, but that certainly doesn't mean all American beers are ""in your face"".

I know many Americans agree with me in saying that while lots of European beer is executed perfectly within a certain style and is excellent by any standard, the lack of variation and/or the unwillingness to stray from a given style makes them largely forgettable. Again, this isn't to say they're not fantastic beers, but here in 'Murika we drink and brew ALL styles from ALL countries, and hell, we even make up some of our own styles. As a home brewer I've tried some crazy stuff, but most of my best beers have been subtle tweaks to more classic styles. The point is that I take a classic style and make it my own.

Anyway, idk if you have access to many Victory beers, but they have some very well-executed beers brewed in the classic European styles (the brewers went to school in Germany), as well as some bigger American-style beers. They might be worth checking out.

I heard about this whole dubstep fad about a year ago. I knew America didn't follow this type of music as much as the UK, Europe, or even AU (where my relatives listened to electro all through high school). I, personally, was into all types of rock so I never really got too into the genre. Daft Punk was catchy, but most electro music was too far out there form me. When it started to become widespread (read: popular in frats), I gave the genre another listen because I'm not a hipster. Turns out I love it. Who doesn't love a good beat? It's predominant in pop and hip/hop, and producers are *the most* sought after piece of the puzzle of music creation. They're the ones that make someone like Rihanna famous.

A whole lot of the country is drowning in debts they incurred willingly without any thought. They are currently very pissed off that the government is not helping them at the expense of those that didn't.

Most of the government is currently focused on pushing EU membership through, which is a very iffy subject in the country though I am a unionist, without much thought to educating the country as to why. For example, I'm fully aware of why I support membership, but I really have no clue what the government wants there because all they say has absolutely nothing to do with the EU reality I was educated in (by the EU).

Most of our political process goes into securing the position of the financial elite. As an example we are currently facing a rather serious issue with both our real estate and renting market because the banks control most of it after having forced people into default from their property (forcing them into the rental market) and refusing to put the property into the real estate market to recoup the losses the claimed the property for. They are essentially attempting to take full control of all shelter here in Iceland so they can control the price of a basic necessity. The governments attempt out of this was to use the welfare system to subsidize the rent of families thrown out of their homes rather than prevent the blatant market manipulation.

Then I read all sorts of ""ICELAND IS AWESOME AND DID EVERYTHING RIGHT!"" headlines in foreign media. It's wrong, we're not. We made the healthy decision of not bailing out our banks. That's it. It was not done for the people but to protect the owners of the bank.

The people here aren't even united. We spend most of our time squabbling over nonsense rather than issues that actually matter. We'd rather argue about whether or not entrapment is ok when it comes to prostitution than attempt to change all of the above.

* Both are expected to give up integral territory in the name of peace.

That's a generalization. I'll be the first to say that I wouldn't feel comfortable in the middle of them (but then again, I wouldn't be comfortable with Portuguese people from the 1700s), but to say that they all are zealots is just plain wrong.

Hopefully the Muslim world will mature and in the future keep their faith more to themselves. Obviously their attempts to Islamize Europe are doom to fail, we may be riddled with guilt but we're also filled with nationalism and patriotism for our country and continent that will fire up again if we feel threatened. And we know what happens when it does.

All in all, they're still human, and it's not difficult to understand their motivations. With time, they'll probably get past this and feel the same way about what lots of them are doing nowadays as we feel about what we did centuries ago.

One of my knocks of paleo is that it considers 10,000 years is an insufficient period of time to ensure an adequate adaptation to agrarian diets, yet lactose tolerance increased to high frequencies in Europe just a few thousand years after animal husbandry was invented.

Paleo is probably safe, but I would not cut brown rice, oats and beans out of a diet.  Some of their other claims about omega-6 oxidizing in the body have little scientific evidence.  I asked about that in /r/askscience and was told that your body utilizes the omega-6 fats long before they can begin to go rancid.  Finally don't worry about olive oil, avocado oil, coconut/palm oil, hemp oil and probably even butter/lard, which are all things paleo support.  Paleo warns to keep away from vegetable and seed oils (soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, safflower/sunflower oil, shortening, hydrogenated oils) yet conviently leaves out the fact that the ones you purchase in stores are refined to remove the omega-6 thus making them safe for cooking.  Still I would follow paleos advice and stick to olive/avocado for cold meals and normal cooking and coconut/palm/butter for HIGH temperature cooking.

Paleo suggests a diet high in meat, where as my ideal diet would be higher in avocado, egg, coconut and almond.  Like I said the paleo avoidance of omega-6 is unwarranted imho.  However hemp seed has a much higher omega3/6 ratio.

****Part of the reason I believe the paleo diet works, is it gets you away from processed foods.  However I think it unfairly also eliminates things such as brown rice, oats, beans and corn.  These things will also keep your diet much cheaper than one high in meat.****

See http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/paleo and http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/keto but remember these are not well supported diets.  I can not say much about keto, it is also probably safe, but it is weird.  I have never purposely attempted to fall into ketosis for a long period of time, but theoretically you will survive.

&gt;&gt;Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. It has a state-level government and local governments in 98 municipalities. Denmark has been a member of the European Union since 1973, although it has not joined the Eurozone. A founding member of NATO and the OECD, it is also a member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

Denmark, with a mixed market capitalist economy and a large welfare state, ranks as having the world's highest level of income equality. It has frequently ranked as the happiest and least corrupt country in the world. The national language, Danish, is closely related to Swedish and Norwegian, with which it shares strong cultural and historical ties.

* BF3.exe has stopped woring
* Server is full (when it displayed as not full in the server browser)
* Server is changing map soon 
* Disconnected from the server (before even connecting)
* Disconnected from the login server
* You have already reserved a slot on this server (if I have a slot, why is there no join button?)
* The most fun one, BF3.exe simply doesn't open, and Origin and Battlelog need restarted to get anywhere. 

Battlelog works kinda ok if you are playing on your own. However with friends, it isn't so much using Battlelog to select a server, but rather trying to trick Battlelog into doing what you want it to do. There is slightly more success using the Quick Game option, but then you don't know what the hell you're getting, even if you setup the filter correctly, because some server admins think it's a good idea to throw 64 people into a map designed for 32 people, and its just an unenjoyable mess around choke points.

Battlelog is a fantastic idea, executed horrifically. It's actually worse than Origin.

On the topic, I'll refute just a few of your points:

* Both have been dragged into war by their neighbors. - Now, I don't have a problem with someone being sympathetic to Serbs, but this is just outright false. Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic initiated each and every armed conflict in the 1990s. It was possible for him to since he gained control over the entire armed force of the ex-Yugoslavia. Check your facts please, such as the ICTY verdicts against Serb army and political officers but also newly discovered (previously classified) Serbian government internal documents which clearly describe how Serbia armed local Serb communities in Bosnia and Croatia and provided them with all sorts of support to accomplish their twisted goal of removing every non-Serb from their territories. Israel may have been dragged in the wars of '48, 56', '73, but in the '67,'82 and 2006 it was Israel initiating the armed conflicts (notably failing in the last one, but winning all the other ones).
*Both are, to varying degrees, highly internationally isolated. -Again, I don't see Israel as being isolated, at least not in the places where it matters. Sure, they may not be welcome in Venezuela and Cuba, but they are still able to purchase German submarines, travel freely to USA and EU and export equipment to China or India. On the other hand, Serbia is as of lately on the verge of another armed conflict with EU+USA forces in Kosovo. Their FM Vuk Jeremic however boast soaring bilateral relations with Nigeria, Uganda, Qatar,Angola  and similar ""heavyweights""

* Both are US client-states. NO! Serbia could be described as being Russian client-state maybe (which would not be completely true), but definitely NOT USA-client state. Serbs have clearly stated on many occasions unwillingness to join NATO, even though it was offered to them. And see my previous point too.

* Both have neighbors and/or hostile minority populations who threaten their continued existence. - Oh yes, I remember when Bosnian army was holding Belgrade captive to a savage medieval 4-year long during the 1992-1995 war, during which we killed by sniper and grenade fire about 10,000 men and women, and about 1,200 children. Oh, and to close off, we accepted a peace agreement legitimizing a Bosniak Entity on half of their territory, which was sealed off by massacring 8,000 Serbian men and boys (youngest one aged 13) at the very end of the war /sarcasm off.

If you're really not a Serb nationalist, you should check your sources because they seem awfully wrong.

The little guy has no rights because the little guy doesn't own a business where he can give himself rights.

If a company wants to pollute a river and it's only clients are in Europe or china who could give two shits about a polluted river in the US, then there is nothing the locals can do about it.  Since they cannot boycott a company who doesn't need their business.  That is China's problem right now.  All the factories serve foreign markets, so the locals have no way to stop them.  The people who get jobs are just happy to have a job, they won't boycott as they would lose their job.  If they did boycott, the company would just bus in poorer people to work from western china.

&gt;I see the argument on the other side and I sympathize but I do not accept that anyone has the right to tell a property owner what to do with their assets.

And when a distributor refuses to sell anything to that local business and instead only sell to walmart?

The fact is your small business example is one of the biggest cons of all time.  You always cite this small business, but in reality everything would very quickly become large companies that monopolize markets, companies would be able to sign contracts with suppliers to gain full exclusivity in an area.  A single monopoly would eventually control each sector of business.  History proves that with monopolies like AT&amp;T that had to be broken up.

&gt;I truly believe in our modern society no significant business could survive the public relations nightmare and the loss of revenue caused by holding racist, exclusionary policies

As for that statement, that is a joke.  If walmart monopolizes the market and fires all the black employees, there is nothing anyone could do about it.  There would be no competition and their exclusivity contracts would bar any competition from forming.

from [forums.catholic.com:](http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?p=6998873)

""The first reason is that God judged it the right time.

From a human socio-political framework, the Roman Empire was the first empire to establish a real parliament, it had well defined laws, a system of engineering and roads far ahead of any other previous empire, which meant missionaries could travel relatively easily. It endured for a thousand years from rise to fall (that's five times our Australian history in the European sense and nearly four times US history). It had religious freedom with the exception of compulsory homage to the emperor.

Peter and Paul did not go to Rome for no reason. Paul was able to appeal to cast iron laws, as a Roman citizen, to go to Rome to appeal to the Emperor himself. He couldn't have done that under the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, or Alexander. Likewise Paul wasn't chosen by accident either. His personal Roman citizenship was an integral part of his ministry.

There was peace of a sort which allowed Christianity to spread within its empire. There were Jews all over the place, not only due to trade but previous dispersions, thus providing a reference point for the new religion.

There was a lingua fraca, the Greek language, due as much to Alexander as anything else.

There was a high level of philosophical and moral thought in Greek and Roman literature. 

It was well administered. Some women had influence in high places. It was not a tribal society, as some Middle Eastern nations are even today.

In short, the Roman Empire and the political world of the time suited the spread of Christianity as no other empire had up to that time. 

We might argue that God can do anything, which is true. But in practice He usually delegates as much as possible. If He was to delegate the job of spreading Christianity to humans (and He only spent 3 years in direct human ministry Himself before handing the responsibility over), then He would have to do so when conditions would allow them to spread the message with some sort of realistic timetable.

WIth hindsight, the Roman Empire was possibly the first time that it was feasible, given human constraints.""

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/08/22/1009489/-Breaking-Down-the-Half-Pay-No-Taxes-Myth

http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3505


&gt;50% of the taxation comes from the top 1% of society. Ergo, there are a lot of coat tail riders, who aren't motivated to support themselves, OR other people.

Let's break it down further. If 95% of the population (of 100 people) words hard every day and is not a coat tail rider but makes 50,000 dollars a year, and gets taxed 20% they generate: 950,00 dollars. If then 5 individuals (5%) make 500,000 dollars a year, and are taxed 40%, they generate: 1,000,000 dollars. Oh look 5% the same that 95%. The 95% are not necessarily ""freeloaders"" if the top 1% is making 10 million a year, and is taxed at a higher rate. If you don't understand why it is fair to tax someone who makes 500k a year a greater percentage than someone who makes 50k a year, this isn't a discussion worth having, though I'd love to hear your ideas about why it is unfair.

Again countries like Denmark have income taxes rates of up **70%** and they seem to function fine. People still work hard, go to school, and the world revolves around its axis.

You do realize that *high income tax does not equal -&gt; large benefits for the unemployed*? Right? You can have absolutely no unemployment benefits, and have massive income tax. I don't see how high income tax means people will not be motivated to work or to become ""free loaders"". Tell me how it does and I will attempt to solve the ""problem"".

&gt;Socialism sounds good on paper, but fails in practice, unfortunately.

Most of the countries in Europe are far more socialist than American and many of them are surviving fine and have been for years. There is nothing about socialism that makes it inherently unstable. Hell, monarchies have lasted longer than any democratic country on this planet. I'd love to hear some *evidence* for why socialism ""fails"".

Every spell cast is a roll with a dice, crits and damage is determined by a dice. Guild Wars 2 however will be normalized and everything will come down to how good the team is comparing to the other team, hard and raw skill based combat. This is why a game like Starcraft II is so big, because everything is fixed, the damage is fixed, the completion timer is fixed, and it just comes down to who has the best skill.

PC-gaming unfortunately is the most unfair platform for eSports, since your opponent literally could sit with six screens around him and get a 360 degree overview of what is around him, that a person with a laptop cant. This is basically the same when we talk about addons, one with addons that auto-interrupt, or flash a big warning when someone casts a heal is too imbalanced in competitive play. This is also why you never see a pro in WoW tournaments (i.e. Blizzcon) use addons, they are not allowed to do this.

So you criticize people for making generalizations... by making a generalization about them? Fuck you for assuming that all the people on unemployment are just whiny young people. What about all the hardworking factory workers laid off by GM? Or for that matter, all the other companies that had to make cuts due to the economic downturn. 

People like your father are great, but it's incredibly foolish to think that everyone can be like him. It reminds me of Bioshock: all the capitalists and libertarians jumped at the chance to move to this new city with the hopes of becoming entrepreneurs and making their fortunes, forgetting that someone needs to scrub the floors. With no social safety net, those who could not find decent work had to live in squalor. 

Is that really what you would prefer? More homelessness, more crime, more disease, political instability. These are the unavoidable consequences of not having a proper social safety net. 

If you have a system set up for economic inequality, it will not last. It can't. There are certain services and commodities that can be rendered with very high net profits. Consider professional athletes or a popular video game or song. There is high demand and high supply, but the supply is inherently controlled by a few players. In a situation like this, wealth is funneled from the population at large to a select few people. I'm not saying that Alex Rodriguez is a bad guy or is in any way to blame for the economics of his own success, but consider this: does he make $32M per year because that is how much his work is worth, or because he happens to be a scarce resource? I'm sure he works very hard, but your father probably works just as hard, yet he doesn't make $32M.

Now, let's extend this example to industry. Ever since the industrial revolution, it has become ever more possible to generate more goods with fewer employees, thanks to mechanization. This creates the same situation of wealth being funneled from the many to the few. As long as companies can provide cheap goods to a wide audience with a high profit margin, the wealth gap will increase. Those who acquire this wealth will spend some, invest some, but save most of it in order to pass on to their children. It's a natural human instinct. As people become poorer, they become less able to afford new goods, and they become angry and frustrated. Once these angry and frustrated people become numerous enough, they will act. In a democratic country, they will vote or those who promise wealth redistribution. In an oppressive country without free elections, they will eventually revolt and overthrow the ruling elite. Of course, those who control the wealth don't want people to democratically decide to limit their ability to make more money, so they bribe and lobby politicians to pass ever more restrictive laws and move the country closer to fascism, until eventually it reaches its breaking point and there's a violent revolt. 

So how do we prevent this? Progressive taxation. It makes sense economically to have tax brackets with those who make the most paying a higher percentage of taxes. It is wealth redistribution, but that doesn't make it bad. The rich shouldn't be taxed *excessively*, because that would disincentive people like your father from doing what he did. But currently, taxes are too low. Based on observations from European countries, as well as Canada and Australia, it should not be difficult to conclude that the best course of action for America would be to raise taxes on the highest earners. People like your father could still be successful, but people like A-Rod wouldn't be able to afford as many extravagant luxuries. These countries have much greater upward mobility and a much higher median standard of living. And if you want an example of a country that demands social services and a high standard of living without paying high taxes, look no further than Greece. ",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2w7f8p

Tastosis are the self modled casting archon ( an archon being a unit made from fusing two other units togeather) and are most people's favourite commentators due to thier synergy.

MMA is just a boss and won MLG columbus with some really impressive play, interviewed later he said he had prepared a small speech for his fans but forgot the words when  they began to chant so loud.  North american and europeans fans are notoriously louder and energetic than korean ones.

MC is well known for being agressive towards his opponents with little ceremonies. It's all for show but it makes for interesting on stage rivalries and creates storlines to follow  from event to event when the same players meet up a lot.

( Despite only highlighting Korean players there are tonnes of talented and top tier players from all over the world, infact a Canadian/ american currently plays in code s which is the hardest section of the GSL)

Also there is now barcraft where E-sports fans can act like your  average hockey or football lover and go down to  specific bars during big events and watch the game streamed to a tv while enjoying some booze and fun with friends and fellow fans.

After World War II, Britain found itself in fierce conflict with the Jewish community, as the Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.[73] At the same time, thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees from Europe sought a new life in Palestine, but were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps by the British. In 1947, the British government announced it would withdraw from the Mandate of Palestine, stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews.[74] The newly created United Nations approved the Partition Plan for Palestine (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181) on 29 November 1947, which sought to divide the country into two states—one Arab and one Jewish. Jerusalem was designated to be an international city—a corpus separatum—administered by the UN.[75]

The Jewish community accepted the plan,[76] but the Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it.[77] On 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and Arab bands began attacking Jewish targets.[78] The Jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out, but they gradually moved onto the offensive.[79] The Palestinian Arab economy collapsed and 250,000 Palestinian-Arabs fled or were expelled.[80]

On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, the Jewish Agency proclaimed independence, naming the country Israel.[81] The following day, the armies of four Arab countries —Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq – attacked Israel, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War

As for stonefarfalle's comment, you have to look at the root cause of the company potentially going under if he doesn't automate the job. It's probably because technology has made whatever job this is more efficient and therefore with capitalism, the price of production goes down, while the demand and scale of economy means less money is made per unit. Meanwhile productivity still goes up with fewer jobs.

Many companies today in the bad economy are slashing jobs by the thousands in order to report positive income for the sake of Wall Street. Sure the company stays afloat, but for how long?

As more and more people go unemployed, less consumers exist to support the companies. Eventually there is a tipping point were the company, no matter how many jobs are cut in the short term, can't report a profit to appease the investors.

Detain even more and the reaction will be even more vicious.

The government is also short on cash and stretched thin. If enough people refuse to pay, the government couldn't financially cover the cost of domestic military operations or government activities. It would be a race to chaos... could the government regain control before enough people stop paying government fees or would they run out of funding and lose control over their own workers and enforcers?

How many Senators would keep working if they didn't have the promise of a paycheck? How many soldiers would carry out government orders if they had to turn guns on their own without getting paid?

Europe is in financial trouble, Japan is recovering from their tsunami/earthquake/nuclear reactor meltdown/volcanic eruption, China isn't very friendly with the US government, the middle east isn't too happy with us right now, the corporate fat cats would pack up and flee the country before pumping money into the government... it would be a total disaster.

Nazi Germany did this, too, but not unique.

Relocation and settlement creation, US=trail of Tears, Russia=pale of settlement, Belgium=Congo (and all imperialism/colonization/expansionist entity ever) etc etc.

 Nazi Germany did this, however, this, too is not unique.

Blockade. Nearly every country has done this as well, every siege done is a blockade. US=Berbery coast, Russia=Ukraine, can't think of recent examples offhand, but this generally not considered a travesty of holocaustic proportion

Ghettoization. Nearly every country has done this as well, from the black US ghettos, to the European ghetto, to the Indian caste etc etc 

This, too, Nazi Germany has done, but is not unique.


None of these things are ok, they are all evil. But not unique. Yet, Nazi Germany is a byword for inherent evil so bad, that none compares to it.


So what does make it unique?

Here is an example: A murderer who goes around killing indiscriminately is not as feared as a guy who builds a factory, a slaughterhouse for the sole purpose of murdering people.

Nazi Germany built mass factories, with extensive planning and massive support system and bureaucracy to eradicate people with modern, mechanized and tested efficiency. 

Another unique factors include the fact that it was meant to be total annihilation. 

Other events/acts that are not the same, but comparable,  include Pol Pot, Rwanda etc.

Yes, Israel can be said to do horrible things, and it can be hated, vilified and protested for its actions, but no one can claim that they are similar to Nazis. For when you say Nazi, you do not mean all the other horrible things it did, you mean holocaust. there is nothing comparable here. Nothing.

Do you see how this is a faulty and hypocritical argument?

There is nothing faulty and certainly nothing hypocritical about it. I am judging a man and his work based on his own thought process and decisions. He came to these conclusions independently, even if it was also the prevailing thought at the time. The common notions of human origin certainly did not force Darwin away from coming up with his theories regarding Natural Selection and the like, so his racism should not be passed off as something tolerable because it was common at the time.

&gt;You are impossibly critical of the mistakes Darwin made because you have constantly ignored any kind of historical perspective. Darwin didn't have the benefit of taking classes or reading about Cultural Anthropology, Sociology, or Evolutionary Biology because they didn't exist yet. He was the one pioneering their very existence. He didn't know about socioeconomic factors of intelligence because it hadn't been studied yet.

Since when do you need to take courses on these topics to not have an unsubstantiated belief on the topic? His beliefs certainly weren't grounded in any scientific logic or reason, but it didn't stop him from applying those beliefs to his science. There is pretty much no way you can have a more clear position on the topic of race--he was racist enough that, without any science or even pseudoscience to back up his position, he believed other races were inferior enough to construct his idea of human evolution around them.
&gt;He thought races being better than one another (through intelligence, etc) was based on biology because that was the only option. It was a given at the time and was one of the assumptions that he didn't think to question. He was building on the back of all those before him, not coming up with 100% new theories. There were major flaws in how scientists at the time viewed cultures, intelligence, genetics, evolution, biology, etc. Darwin helped to correct some of the flaws, but he didn't (and couldn't possibly) fix them all. Remember that this was a time when people thought that intelligence was completely imbued at birth, either through some sort of genetics, or by divine gift.

So let me get this straight--questioning God, religion, and the conception of the origin of the human species was not beyond Darwin, but questioning the belief that whites were superior to other races was too ingrained for him to challenge?

As to your point: The prevalence of homosexuality in the United States is 2-13% according to most studies and depending on the criterion (any homosexual experience, versus lifelong homosexuality, other stuff I'm sure). Atheists constitute roughly 2% of the population of the United States (although the number is rapidly growing), and [atheists are the least trusted group in America](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1786422&amp;page=1).

You might think atheists aren't oppressed because you live in a relatively tolerant neighbourhood, or aren't an atheist yourself (or have never spoken out on issues). In many states there is still law on the books stating you can't hold office if you're an atheist, despite it being unconstitutional. Maybe you just don't give a shit. You might also get that impression because in many places on the internet like this, atheists represent a disproportionately large amount of the readers, which is not the case in the United States. Also here on reddit two of the top 5 most active cities are Toronto and Vancouver, and Canada has a ~20% prevalence of atheism/agnosticism, which is about 10x that of the United States.

Who knows though, maybe you're just making shit up again.

If enough people refuse to pay, the government couldn't financially cover the cost of military operations or government activities. It would be a race to chaos.

This isn't true. The recent credit downgrade was because we no longer have a rational political process (e.g. we have too many republicans and they're unable to compromise). Despite the downgrade, we are still able to barrow large sums of money are relatively low interest rates. The only thing ""constraining"" us is the debt ceiling, which is routinely raised. Martial law would throw Congress' ability to regulate executive branch spending. In other words, we'd have no debt ceiling -- our creditors would decide when we've ""hit our limit"". (And the more they loaned us, the more likely they would be support us no matter how hard times got or how drastic the action because they'd like to see a return on their investment.)

Next, in a time of martial law you draft people. Engineers, Doctors, and young men are now instantly mobilized. This will of course create vacancies in the job market. This is a vital step, because both Doctors and Engineers tend to think systematically, which is something the majority of our population lacks. Now they're ""locked down"". Next, a large idle population of young men is always a bad thing in times of societal disruption, so rounding up as much of the population and putting them to work reduces the risk of the insurrection becoming full fledged. 

Third, the media does an in-depth report of a no-knock raid gone bad. Trust me, sooner or later one of them is bound to go bad. Endearing photos of a loving, white, suburban family that went on picnics, played soccer together, wrote to their local school board, gave to charity, played instruments was killed in their own home after the father, a tax protester, went for a firearm thinking they were being robbed. The rest of the family was cut down as collateral damage. Images of a child's brains splattered on the walls will haunt FOX, CNN, MSNBC -- with the question: Could THIS Happen to YOU? The media frames it as the family being a victim of circumstance. And that ""it wouldn't have happened if they weren't tax protesters.""

A lot of people, despite not having health care, a living wage, no escape from crippling student loan and mortgage debt, think long and hard about how they might get ""accidentally shot in the face 5 times"" by an M16 for being politically active in today's climate. How it might impact their family. How ""towing the line"" and waiting out this ""long emergency"" is a good idea. Government assurances that things ""will go back to normal soon"" will always get some of the moderates and ""undecided"" to sit on the fence. Government officials of all kind rally around the flag and preach the message that ""we will get through this"" and ""we will overcome"". If any discussion or discourse arises about the rights of the ""occupiers""/""protesters"" the official party line will be ""changing your government is possible and welcome in a free society such as ours, but no matter who is in charge or how the economy is doing, you have to pay taxes/obey laws/or Y/etc."". 

This re-frames the argument from ""OWS did X to call attention to Y"" to ""Things were already shit, but OWS did X when things were already shit, and now we have to do Z if we ever want things NOT to be shit again.""

Fourth, the government, in a need to create jobs and establish a cashflow capable of feeding a huge amount of interned people for a sustained period of time, begins to privatize services. Certain highways will now be toll highways. Companies will now bid on the rights to toll a road the way wireless companies bid on spectrum. At the same time the Federal Government raises the federal gasoline sales tax from 18 cents to 36 cents/gallon, bringing in another 54 billion in revenue. Tabacco and Alcohol taxes are also raised, with the argument that they're not regressive, as you can always avoid a consumption sales tax.

Fifth, routine domestic operation of UAVs become the norm.

Sixth, as America's economy worsens, we look like a more attractive manufacturing location compared to Europe. We suddenly have a huge influx of prison labor. (Okay, these last two are way too cynical.)

If you cared to look at your country before bashing others, you might realize you're not the pinnacle of self-righteousness and good principles in a sea of countries (that's the rest of the EU) that are only working to undermine yours and take your money and waste it.

Fuck it, you think that we Portuguese, Spanish or Italians just as bad as an entity that had some members shamelessly participating in corruption in such a way that lead to at least 8000M€ being loss? You think we citizens are also to blame for the fuck ups of another country because we also happen to be in economical difficulties? Do you realize how absurd it is to claim that, that ""Italy, Spain and Portugal are just as bad."" and present as evidence a copypaste from Wikipedia that says that ""Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption, out of 180 countries. In 2009 it had slumped to the 35th place."" and provide examples about cases of corruption from bad referees? It's fucking insane!!!

It does make life less complicated if we just *fudge things* a little so they better fit with our assumptions. Reading only serves to complicate what ignorance could make simple and pleasant. 

&gt;Some atheists may be anti-religious, but I bet you have a hard time finding one who would rationalize massacre or genocide in order to achieve it.

You'll have a hard time finding Christians and Muslims who feel that way, too. You just hear about them on the news and the internet. You should go to an American Mosque sometime and see how *scary* and *extreme* they are.

&gt;There is a huge difference between being anti-something and debating the issue civilly, and using your religion to justify killing everybody who opposes you.

There sure is. Of course, I can't think of a time where my life has been touched by a true Holy War. Even the Taliban's attacks on the United States were primarily motivated by our foreign policy. 

&gt;And enough with the ""politically motivated"" excuse. Everybody is politically motivated to some degree. This isn't a problem.

This is going to be good...

&gt;If we rationally debate and compromise, even the most extreme political subjects can be handled relatively civilly. The problem occurs when people think that their political motives are somehow worthy of violence against others, and are unwilling to negotiate. 

Oh, so all these ancient conflicts and divisions are just because people are being silly? Assuredly, your belief that there are no real problems in the world couldn't have been influenced by your gentle, conflict-free life of leisure and comfort? 

&gt;This describes violent dictators, oppressors, and (most commonly) people who use religion to justify their actions.

Of course, it describes whatever subset of people you isolate it to describe. Let's not worry that it also describes people who don't have a *purely religious* motive for their actions. I would love to see your statistics on this. 

So, we eliminate all religion by clicking our heels together and saying a Hail Mary in Dawkins' name. This is great because now we'll merely have people who kill each other in the name of their nation, ideology, or whatever other categorization they select? Somehow, I don't think the elimination of any division of ethnicity will make resources plentiful and divide territory in universally acceptable manner. 

What a magical faith-driven world you live in. I am amazed you have the gall to think you're above religion.

Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis

The book claims to represent the largest collection and review of the global Intelligence Quotient (IQ) data, surveying 620 published studies from around the world, with a total of 813,778 tested individuals. Lynn's meta-analysis lists East Asians (IQ 105), Europeans (100), Inuit (91), South East Asians (87), Native Americans (87), Pacific Islanders (85), South Asians and North Africans (84), non-bushmen Sub-Saharan Africans (67), Australian Aborigines (62), Bushmen and Pygmies (54). The average human IQ of the world is estimated to be 90.[3]

Lynn defines races as the genetic clusters or ancestral population groups identified in previous genetic cluster analysis by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues in their 1994 book The History and Geography of Human Genes.

Pá, não podes dizer que o Cristianismo é bom quando se matou tanta gente em seu nome e que o Islamismo é mau pelos mesmos motivos.
A bíblia, tal como o corão, também diz para matar montes de gente (se quiseres arranjo-te citações), não é por o corão dizer para matar quem não acredita e a bíblia dizer para matar homossexuais que a bíblia passa a estar numa posição de superioridade moral, continua a ser perda de vida humana, não?

Em suma, a religião deles é merda mas a nossa não fica muito atrás. Nós é que felizmente não a seguimos à letra (a não ser que, por exemplo, mates quem trabalhe ao Sábado - Ex-31:14) e não andamos por aí a falar dela.

Se lesses a bíblia com o espírito crítico com que leste o corão eras capaz de te aperceber disso. Eu nunca li o corão nem nunca sequer li a bíblia na íntegra, mas o que sei de ambos os textos (que não deixa de ser bastante) é que não são muito diferentes.

And even well before I moved there - even with just visiting for the first time when I was a kid - it was blatantly and instantly apparent just how much more NYC offers culturally. Art, music, food, fashion, architecture, commerce, finance, design, exposure to international cultures, and on and on, it is the US's foremost, dominating international city. It is the US's gateway to Europe and the rest of the world, and for good reason.

Aside from ""the beauty of the Seattle environment"" and being small in population with gobs of elbow room suburban-style, there's no comparison whatsoever between Seattle and NYC. Whatever Seattle has as a result of itself being a ""city"", NYC has, and has it bigger, better, more intensely and with more variety. You can find virtually anything there, for anyone, any scene (*and* it doesn't shut down at 10:00pm), any taste, at any price range, from pretty much anywhere in the world.

Life is not easy there. There are things I loved about living there, and there are things I hated about living there. NYC is unforgiving and I sure as hell wouldn't raise a family there (whereas is Seattle I would), but what you do get from it when it gives (or when you take) cannot be gotten anywhere else.

If you have never been, go. You'll see.

This isn't a bash against you, or hate against Seattle (hey, I chose to live here too for now, right?), but I can't tell you how many times I've run into people in Seattle who think that just because Seattle is a ""city"" and is ""urban"" (which I don't think it really, really is) and does offer some interesting things, that everywhere else couldn't possibly offer more.

9) The international profile of AIDS patients is inconsistent. Germ-related diseases affect the same demographics world-wide. This is not the case when American and African results were concluded;

America: 90% Male 10% Female (97% in Risk Groups)
Africa: 50% Male 50% Female (No Risk Groups)

AIDS hits harder in industrialized nations (America and Europe) because it is believed that more IV Drug use is rampant. Dr. Duesberg even believes that the AIDS strain in Africa is a different one than in America. ""Different as day and night.""

Philippe Krynem (French Humanitarian) posted in the London Sunday Times (October 3, 1993) ""There is no AIDS, it is something that has been invented."" After spending time in the so-called ""epicenter"" of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.


10) AIDS occurs without HIV infection. Most people with HIV never develop AIDS. ""The evidence in support of HIV is based solely on correlation."" Correlation does not prove causation. If HIV is a harmless passenger Virus we should see: ""People with AIDS not infected with HIV"" and ""People with HIV who are healthy and do not get AIDS."" That is exactly what is happening. There are 4,621 (in 1993) documented cases where patients with AIDS do not have HIV. 

The CDC Definition of AIDS:

Kaposi Sarcoma + HIV = AIDS
Kaposi Sarcoma - HIV = Kaposi Sarcoma

Pneumonia + HIV = AIDS
Pneumonia - HIV = Pneumonia

Dementia + HIV = AIDS
Dementia - HIV = Dementia

This is their definition. If you have HIV with a certain disease, you have AIDS, if HIV is not present - it's the fault of the original disease. There is no HIV specific disease anywhere. Such a joke. This definition of AIDS ""creates a near 100% correlation between the virus and AIDS."" ""This 'correlation' is not objective, or scientific and is deceptively self-fulfilling.""

~ as of 1993
Estimate of Total HIV infected: 28,000,000?

Two weeks is plenty of time to hop around a number of places in Europe. 

I'd personally start off in Stockholm. You can then take the day long train ride it takes to get to Copenhagen. (You actually go over one of the largest bridges in Europe between these two countries.) 

Stockholm is a very clean and relatively strait laced place. But Sodermalm is a great island in the city center with a lot of great bars and cafes. I stayed at a hotel on a boat (docked next to a gay party boat) withen walking distance of everything. You can see everything you need too in roughly two days.

Copenhagen is much more of a party place. It's a incredibly bike friendly city as well. It's incredibly easy to rent a bike and ride around. Denmark is ridiculously expensive compared to the states, so 2 days there is plenty. One spent exploring the city proper, and one in the hippie comune Christiania. A lot of people just go to Christiania because you can buy soft drugs freely there, but it really is worth walking deep into it and checking out all of the  houses. 

From Copenhagen you can head onto Berlin. I've never been there myself, but I've heard nothing but good things about it. 

Prague is another amazing city you could easily spend days in. It's pretty cheap, and it isn't as touristy in the winter months. 

London is always the easiest hub from the US - Europe. So you can also think of that as a start and end point of your journey. I've never bought a ticket with Airline miles myself, but if you can't return from a different city than you arrived, London is the best option. There is a number of ridiculously cheap no frills airlines. But most have serious amounts of hidden fees. Easyjet in my experience has been the least painful in my experience, but to be honest, I haven't used them in 4 years... so it could be drastically different.

I've also lived in Ireland for a number of years, so if that interests you I could tell you everything I know.  I know it's a bit of a ""cliche"" trip for most Americans, but if you go into it with the right mind the country is really amazing.  

if any of this interests you, I can help you out with planning. I can seriously do this stuff with my eyes closed now.

Actually if there are several people waiting for a limited number of surgery rooms, then that is a reason to wait. Heart surgery rooms are not cheap, so government must ration care. If they make heart surgery available to everyone on a next day basis, then the cost becomes equal to what the US currently has.

&gt; And many common medical procedures cost way more than most people could ever afford to pay. We need some sort of risk pooling.

I agree with the first part, that healthcare is too expensive. Government granted monopolies are to blame for the costs though. 

The second part I disagree with. When you say ""pooling"", what you really mean is charity. When you say pooling, it suggests that everyone is going to pay an equal share to everyone else. For example, if 5 people are pooled, but one of them is really sick, the cost for the other 4 goes up past the amount they really used. Thats charity. In addition, I'm sure you think if one of those 5 people was richer than the others, that he should pay more into the pool. This is a charity system through and through.

&gt; Then why didn't charitable contributions go up with the Bush tax cuts.

because the tax cuts didn't help those that give the most (i.e. middle class). When a few rich people increase their donations, it doesn't equal the amount that a lot of people can achieve. 

I can just turn this around on you. Why have charitable donations been decreasing through the years?

&gt; Wouldn't we be more free if we didn't have to fear getting sick?

If you have $100, then you're free to do with it as you want. If I take $90 of that $100, for mandatory healthcare, are you more or less free as a result? Obviously less free, especially if you were already spending a portion of your money to stay well. 

&gt; Your quote didn't mention anything about the capacity of those facilities.

Valid point. It's entirely possible that the Canadian facilities are larger than the US, hence there would be fewer of them, but with the same capacity. I doubt this, but it does remain a possibility I agree.

&gt; But they are just as important as anyone else when measuring the success of the system.

it's then not a measure of effectiveness of healthcare treatment. It would also encompass other aspects as well, like ambulance transport to the hospital, regional climate, regional diet and other aspects. Another example of why US mortality is higher, is because we drive cars more than the Europeans.

You might be referring to my other post where i was negative about giving this vote to people who are not properly informed, or educated (the stereotypical resident of a remote village, also a pensioner, a teenager, etc) and by which i stand by. I am Greek btw. And i would feel the same for any other nation, its nothing about intelligence - just information. Who knows exactly what all these agreements are?

 Secondly, i agree with everything you say in this post. I think in much the same way and share the same reluctant approval for the loan agreement, at this stage we've now reached. I can also do nothing but admire you saying that the people must be given the chance to get their say. Because that is the decent thing to do. I only have objections with regards to the timing. And i will add something more on this.

 The referendum now is much too late. If it had been held before the original memorandum, the PM could have got the legitimacy he is now seeking to continue or an order from the people to seek other alternatives. As we hear from the media and other politicians, there were options to achieve better terms for loan agreements from elsewhere (eg Russia), or we could have defaulted, or sold rights for oil and gas exploration as its suggested these resources exist in big amounts under Greece, or whatever other proposal would have come forward. By public order. It would still be a risk involving uninformed voters to decide but the stakes where smaller -although still very high- and there would be a lot of time to plan and for clear proposals to be made by all sides. 

 Now we're in a situation where we have already borrowed vast amounts of capital inflating the already huge debt and a default will be even worse than before - for all parties involved. And we are not alone in this. If we now as a country backtrade on what we've agreed on, it could spell disaster for the European project and we'll even get to be blamed for it. We're simultaneously affecting Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland  who are in the same path we are on more or less and if Greece, the 3% of European debt or so, defaulted early on they could still find their way out. If we default now i can only ssuppose it will be much more difficult. So it will be a disaster, possibly the end of the euro.

 And who wants the end of the euro? I tend to think not the majority of people in Greece (but it is in the interests of some protagonists of the corruption ""scene""). So in the end, with a referendum, the current government will get a clean sheet and find new legitimacy. Even if the people said yes only to keep the country in the European Monetary Union and not make an entire continent sink into further crisis, not to give support to a government that would lose an election before entering. There is your super populsit move. With a democratic due process giftwrap.

 I don't even want to go into what happens if the answer is no. Its possible we remain in the Eurozone. But not likely i think. The referendum question's wording will be crucial.

 Anyway there are so many things to be said, especially in areas a non-Greek wouldn't be familiar with, that i can't possibly fully expand my way of thinking here. But to add to the bit about the weird timing. The PM did two things today. One is this, the other is he scrapped ALL the top Army officials. In total 16 high ranking officers, including the top 4 in command. As if an international uproar and domestic upheaval wasn't enough for the day (This move and its causes and implications, as well as the timing obviously, are very highly criticised in Greece). But it had to be today for some reason. I can only speculate about why we must have panic of all sorts but i know an old saying that i trust and that is that panic is an ill advisor.

Well, not quite. The US put the war in the Pacific on a much lower tier than the war in Europe, and barely enough forces and equipment were committed in the Pacific to ensuring that Japan didn't expand their holdings. Even so, the Japanese were beaten back. If the US had committed their full resources on the Pacific War, it would have been over in very short order, well before 1946.

The Japanese never had a chance. Their entire strategy was a lightning-quick grab at enough resources (again, mostly oil) to negotiate with the US from a position of power.

That's because he is playing on the greatest team in history. If van Persie had Xavi, Iniesta and Messi feeding him instead of our midfield, he'd have scored 50 goals in 2011 alone.

He might have a point. But the thing is he's an anglosaxon writer talking to anglosaxon readers speaking in terms they can culturally understand and go ""No wonder, these lazy bastards..."", which is what most of this thread is about. Don't get me wrong, but I am a southern european who has lived in anglosaxon countries for more than 12 years and I know both ways of thinking.

Cars are just an example. Having a nice car is something that in southern European countries is a MUST for a lot of people (think Jersey shore, times 100. Portuguese call it 'having a submarine parked next to the slum'). Hey, when I was a 20 yo I was driving a shitty car and when I saw people with way worse jobs than mine driving around these nice, powerful cars I always wondered how did they do that. Well, I have an uncle working in car finance and it turned out to be that it was quite common that some people would put as much as 90% of their monthly salary towards a flashy new car, to be paid in 10 (TEN) years and that's how they could afford a car that was worth nearly 10 times mine. Hey! A lot of them are now nearly 40 and they're still in the same job if lucky and living with their mothers. See now how they can afford to own an expensive car? Stupid, I know.

And that's just an example, I could give you thousands. But the truth is, if you've got a job, it's **nearly impossible** to evade taxes. And even if it wasn't so, for what? Most people wouldn't even consider a job that doesn't pay taxes, because then when you get fired you've got no right to benefits, and believe me, in these countries sooner or later you are gonna be on the dole with a wife and kid and mortgage payments, and that's how most people make it.",True,0,,True,0,0,0,t1_c2w8uaw

They probably wouldn't even be in this mess, because nobody would have given them the shovel they needed to dig themselves into a hole.

Anyway, they could have devalued their currency. This would still have had some negative effects, because practically everything with moving parts or a battery has to be imported and is priced in euros or dollars, so the average Greek would have had to work much longer to be able to afford, say, a new laptop or a car. Most clothes are imported, and so is oil. Everything would have gotten much more expensive.  
On the plus side, debt would have been reduced, relatively. Local services would have benefitted. You can't afford that new dress, but you can still go out for dinner, so you spend your money there instead. It also would have helped exports, although the problem here is that Greece doesn't have much of an export industry besides tourism.

When you have your own currency, you can just devalue it over night. Everybody would have a reduced income in practice so the country could become competitive again. It's not nice, but at least the pain is spread equally.  
If you don't have your own currency, then you have to get to the same point by reducing wages. This is what Greece is currently going through. Only, you can't simply proclaim that everybody will earn X% less from tomorrow on. Instead, this is a long and painful process that affects people to various degrees, and while their salaries get cut, their debt remains the same.

Now, if Greece would want to switch to a new drachma, it would enter unchartered territory, and there be dragons. It wouldn't help with debt. They'd still owe euros, and they would default, probably unorderly. Most of the Greek debt is owed to their own banks, so their entire financial system would be wiped out. There is no way their banks could survive such a hit, especially not after everybody would have moved their capital out of Greece to avoid the devaluation.  
Without a banking system and capital, companies can't get credit. This means no new machines, no increased production, no new jobs. Companies that rely on imports, be it services, components or raw materials, have the contracts with their suppliers in euros or dollars. They wouldn't be able to afford those, go bankrupt, and people would lose their jobs.   
This leaves direct investment from the outside, attracted by low wages. But would you invest in a country that is in total economic and social collapse, and where local suppliers that you'd have to rely on could be gone tomorrow? People would be very unhappy, and whether the political system could survive would be at least questionable. If you think austerity is bad, just imagine what would happen if Greece would be cut off from outside capital entirely and the government would be made to make do with only what it takes in through taxes in an economy in the state of collapse.

For Europe, this would raise some very tough questions. If it went really badly, we might even end up with a highly militarized failed state as a worst case scenario. However remote the possibility, to have something like this within the EU would be such an enormous threat that the other members wouldn't be willing to take the risk.  
Even if you disregard that, the exodus of especially young Greeks that would have to be expected would lead to social tensions in the other member states. Greece would almost certainly be made to exit the EU ""voluntarily"".

I know this reads like doom and gloom, but this is the risk. It doesn't have to become all that disastrous, but it would almost certainly be *very bad*, and you don't bet a whole country on a hunch that, who knows, it might actually turn out well.",True,9,EURO,False,9,0,0,t1_c2w8wsp

Perhaps it's a particularly Scottish thing (I'd like to think so but I may be biased!) but I'd rather be poor and free than a bit less poor but not free.

Probably Europe (including the UK, we may not be in the Euro but we're closely tied to the fate of it) would be considerably poorer if the Euro was to bomb out, and that becomes very likely if Greece defaults... my preference would have been for a Greek default at the start of the bailouts. The problem is that now too far down the line to take that option and it is probably best to continue with the bailouts.

As for the Greek people being stupid I don't believe so. I don't really think that I thought you did either. I did take exception to you deriding farmers making decisions about economics but I answered that elsewhere so I won't go into it again.

Now that I do know you're Greek I do also want you to know I'm sympathetic.

You're dead right on the referendum. The Greek people should have been given the choice of the bailouts (and the implication that they should continue past the first if required) or no bailouts and accepting the bailouts would have been a very reasonable mandate to continue with them. 

The sad part of course is that the clock cannot be turned back. I would imagine the majority of people in Greece feel that a minority have abused the system and gotten rich and fat while Greece was part of the Euro and it isn't fair that everybody in Greece needs to suffer.

your cv is all right, employers don't even read it all, they just get the bottom line as long as you put a nice picture of yourself on it, and maybe rework some of the phrasing, and emphasize your language qualifications and teaching experience as a private tutor, etc (you could also take an online CELTA or TEFL course for teaching english or some other qualification)

It was unfair - I don't think any objective person would disagree with that, just as Jewish treatment in Europe was unfair.

And it would be good if people accepted refugees unquestioning, be they Jew or Arab.

It would also be good if people housed the homeless, but if Europe forced Africa to  house  the people it  made homeless at the expense of it's own people, we would call that unfair. 

&gt;No country has ever done that to my knowledge.

Exactly, but the Palestinians did, they were made to.

It's entirely irrelevant.

Text:

&gt;When you've been in the BBC as long as I have, you rise to the lofty position where you get to deal with complaints. So I thought I'd start this blog by heading off the single most common complaint about the BBC's space coverage: the way we write the acronyms for the US and European space agencies in lower-case letters - ""Nasa"" and ""Esa"".

&gt;If I'd had a pound coin for every time someone wrote in to say, ""It's 'NASA' and 'ESA', you dummies"", I could have gathered together enough cash to start my own space programme.

&gt;It's a style thing. The BBC only uses upper-case for the acronyms in which each individual letter is sounded, as in, err, ""BBC"". It's supposed to make pages with lots of acronyms look less ""bossy"", and it gives the reader an idea of how to pronounce ones they've never encountered before.

&gt;I didn't make this rule, but I do follow it. It has some logic to it.

&gt;As with all ""rules"", there are exceptions. Take for example the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System used by US. It's a network of satellites in the sky that other spacecraft use to communicate among each other and with the ground. Some people say it ""Tee-dress"", but for us to write it as ""Tdrss"", or even ""TDrss"", frankly looks bizarre. So you'll only ever see me write it ""TDRSS"".

&gt;Like I said, there is some logic to the rule.

Ask the undergraduate advisor in the Physics or Astronomy department at the school you end up at - they will tell you what classes to take and where you will actually have decisions to make.

Something that will be *very* helpful: work! At some point (last couple years) you should look into getting a ""job"" (you won't get paid, hence the quotes) with a professor at your institution. You'll get academic credit for it, a letter of recommendation from the prof (as long as you aren't a *complete* screwup), and you will get *real* experience.

While you are an undergraduate, learn to cook for yourself. Not ramen and microwaveable dinners - real food. It will help during the next stage.

If you find that you enjoyed (or didn't entirely hate - undergrad work can be basically grunt work at times) your time as an undergraduate in physics, apply to graduate school. If you are in the USA, you will be applying to a PhD program - six-ish years, you start with a B.S. and end up with a PhD. If you're in Europe, I believe you do a Master's program first and a seperate PhD program after.

If you find that you don't like it, then do something you do like. Don't be afraid to look into other areas that interest you during your undergraduate years - you will have plenty of room to explore.

During grad school you will get paid, either as a teaching assistant (teaching labs, grading homework) or later as a graduate researcher (doing SCIENCE). You don't make very much money at this stage, deal with it. Here is where knowing how to cook helps, because you will eat well for less money. Grad school should also give you health insurance if you're in the US, which is *amazing.*

After grad school, you apply for postdocs. These are stints at different schools, a few years at a time, where you work under a professor (well, more alongside them - grad students are the underlings). Sort of like grad school but with a little more money, from what I've heard.

You want to know what my routine is like?

I sit at my computer and make graphs and look at them for 8-10 hours a day (breaking for lunch, obviously). That sounds bad. It isn't. I like what I do. The vast majority of our work is in processing the data that comes back from the telescopes and satellites we have staring at the sky. The next largest chunk of time is spent writing proposals to convince the people in charge of those telescopes that what *we* want to look at is way more interesting than what other people want to look at. If a proposal is accepted, the telescope looks at it. Maybe we actually go to the telescope to do this, but in an increasing number of cases nowadays, the telescopes are automated and the data is just piped in over the network.

I work only with data from satellites, so I never get to go to my telescopes :)",True,4,,False,4,0,0,t1_c2w9fgj

&gt; It would be nearer the truth to say that the entire history of the region is one long confessional feud that when allied to ultra-toxic nationalism was strong enough to drag the entire modern world into a catastrophic war in the summer of 1914. It nearly did the same to post-Cold War southern and Adriatic Europe after 1990, and it was only halted at a terrible cost in blood. **The clerical element of this nightmare was obscured by the media’s habit of referring to the three contending parties as “the Serbs,” “the Croats,” and “the Muslims.” You can see at a glance that there is a lack of symmetry in that already sketchy and subjective picture**.

Don't you remember this from the Danish media too? It was always the Serbs, the Croats and all those Muslims fleeing over the mountains and turning up in mass graves. The religious aspect of the war was *never* covered in the evening News.

&gt;In the 1990s, the nationalists of “Greater Serbia,” who sought to remove non-Serb populations from their soil and from the soil of neighboring republics, were overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian and held together by religious imagery and propaganda. Meanwhile, “the Croats” was another collective noun for the Roman Catholics of Croatia and Western Herzegovina who also wanted a “pure” religious state of their own. During the 1940s, they had actually enjoyed possession of such a state in the form of a Nazi protectorate run by an extreme Catholic fascist party named the Ustashe. Serbian memory of this period is extremely traumatic, not least because the Ustashe program included forced conversion of the heretical Orthodox as well as cruel collective punishment for those who declined it.

[Want to see what happens to Jews in Muslim countries?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries#Rise_of_modern_antisemitism_in_the_Middle_East) 

- **Algeria -** Almost all Jews of Algeria left upon independence in 1962, after being deprived of Algerian citizenship by the authorities.

- **Bahrain -** ...The first two days of demonstrations in Bahrain saw rock throwing against Jews, but on December 5 mobs in the capital of Manama looted Jewish homes and shops, destroyed the synagogue, beat any Jews they could find, and murdered one elderly woman.

- **Egypt -** In June 1948, a bomb exploded in Cairo's Karaite quarter, killing 22 Jews. In July 1948, Jewish shops and the Cairo Synagogue were attacked, killing 19 Jews.[1] Hundreds of Jews were arrested and had their property confiscated. Nearly 40% of the Jewish population of Egypt had left the country by 1950.[12]
In 1951, the fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion was translated into Arabic and promoted as an authentic historical document, fueling anti-Semitic sentiments in Egypt.[39] In 1954, the Lavon Affair served as a pretext for further persecution of Egyptian Jews.
In October 1956, when the Suez Crisis erupted, 1,000 Jews were arrested and 500 Jewish businesses were seized by the government. A statement branding the Jews as ""Zionists and enemies of the state"" was read out in the mosques of Cairo and Alexandria. Jewish bank accounts were confiscated and many Jews lost their jobs. Lawyers, engineers, doctors and teachers were not allowed to work in their professions. Thousands of Jews were ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to take only one suitcase and a small sum of cash, and forced to sign declarations “donating“ their property to the Egyptian government. Foreign observers reported that members of Jewish families were taken hostage, apparently to insure that those forced to leave did not speak out against the Egyptian government. Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left, mainly for Europe, the United States, South America and Israel, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets.

- **Iraq -** In 1941, following Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, riots known as the Farhud broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.

Far from free riding on the US, most of Europe has adjusted its defence spending downwards on the basis that it faces few external threats.  The US  has increased its spending to allow it to carry out unethical and unnecessary wars of aggression. 

&gt;This decline in capability has come about not just because we are spending less, but because we continue to spend badly. Military funding is channelled through dozens of separate national programmes and structures, creating enormous duplication and failing to achieve economies of scale.

He's spot on there. 

&gt;While Europe has half a million more military personnel than America, it can deploy just a fraction of them overseas.

This is a good thing. It limits the  ability of our politicians  to pursue ill conceived military adventures. 

&gt;What America sees in Nato is yesterday’s vision of the future: allies with declining capabilities, reluctant to put troops in harm’s way, and an institution ill-suited to addressing US interests – especially with defence cuts looming in Washington as well.

The British armed forces don't exist to address US interests.

&gt; How do we reassure the Americans that Europeans are committed to the transatlantic alliance?

We shouldn't. NATO has passed its sell by date. US and European interests have diverged. It's time to go our separate ways.

&gt;The answer, therefore, is for Britain and France to lead the way. The starting point would be our recent bilateral defence treaties, which have the potential to deliver real savings through joint procurement, R&amp;D, maintenance, training, and shared military doctrine.

He's back on track. This is the way forward. 

&gt;If European nations can develop an interlocking strategic view as a prelude to common procurement, it will not only create genuine defence co-operation, but allow us to make the huge savings necessary – and start to build a globally competitive European defence industry.

Defence procurement is primarily about politics: giving cash to well connected industry, providing jobs in marginal constituencies, developing kit suitable for export at the expense of domestic needs. A European defence industry would be a mess of internecine procurement wrangles.

&gt;The second problem with the current arrangements is that London and Paris see the new treaties differently. For Eurosceptics, it’s the Entente Cordiale re-created; an exercise stopping at Paris. But for the French, it represents much more ... The French vision is to create a wider process of co-operation between like-minded countries, based on practical steps and national interests. This is the right vision – but it is anathema to some in London.

Spot on again: it's the right way forward but the Eurosceptics won't stand for it.

&gt;Unless others are involved, it will not be able to provide for our collective security when the US declines to lead. 

This has to be our main objective.

Some body rub places offer full service, some don't. The ones that limit things to a handjob and some groping generally feature better body rubs. Some licensed massage therapists work at those sort of places because, they tell me, it pays rather better and allows better freelancing conditions.

You pay a flat rate for the body rub and negotiate for extras, often at the flip, although you can do it up front if you're a regular.

Not how the study of ethics works. Just like the pioneering thought in Europe centuries ago with Nietzsche was nihilism, the pioneering thought in our modern society is now starting to define what morals are to the individual. The main man in this movement, Derek Parfit, is much like a Nietzsche of modern times. I'm not advocating something I personally believe in, just pointing out that you don't seem to see how the study of ethics is changing in modern society.

His view on prioritarianism pans out a little like utilitarian theory with a corollary that in addition to boosting ones sense of morals, the idea of doing greater good for those who are worse off is better than doing the greater good for those who are better off.

The mentality of Soviets was actually very similar to mentality of Americans: the desire to build career and succeed through work. This is very different than for example Europe where people would like to have nice life first and foremost and career/work is second to that goal.

That's an innocence that you only cherish once in your lifetime, and childhood is an amazing time where the world is more magic than ever.

There's a short tale in which there is a very poor little boy who is trying to get money, penny by penny, everyday in front of a train station in Europe. (Very resumed) A man (the narrator) approaches the boy and the kid asks him for a penny, or how he could work for one. The man asks why he wants pennies and the boy said ""So I can go to America and meet my dad"". I'm 9 years old and my dad went to America 17 years ago, so said my Mom, and the man who sells train tickets said that if I get 10.000 pennies I can have a train ticket to America. I'm only 64 pennies short!""
The man decided to not give the boy a penny and leaves.

He doesn't give the boy a penny because if he gave the kid one, he'd be closer to disappointment. So he decided to let him live in his dream than going back to the dreadful reality.

TL;DR (the story) - in some cases it's better to let people live happy dreams than in awful realities.

I think many Israelis seem to struggle to see Palestinians as the the native people, who were wronged, just as Jews in Arab countries where wronged when they were kicked out. I think this view has to be addressed. Often posters here see Palestinians as guests or pests, who have no real claim to anything, not their land, not their water, not their own history, which is tragic, as in doing this they are erasing their own history and their own humanity.

In many ways, this attitude echoes how the natives of Africa, America and Australia where treated by the Europeans, who today  are embarrassed by those actions.  I have seen  Jews in America wearing Native American head dresses as a way of trying to defend this approach! 

This attitude enables Israel's settlement programme and failure to give  up East Jerusalem, which will doom any 2 state solution.

Leaving aside the bad press this will get, fairly or unfairly, for all atheists, the decision itself seems unbelievably petty. 


The crux (ho-ho) of the argument, that a cross might imply an endorsement of Christianity, is so far out of line with common sense it astounds me.

If AA thinks that a christian group of policemen putting up crosses on symbolic graves of officers is against the 1st amendment, [what are they going to do about these](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/American_War_cemetery_at_Madingley_-_geograph.org.uk_-_7250.jpg) ?

A lot of US redditors talk glowingly about the treatment of atheists in the UK and the rest of Europe. [These are what our secular society puts up in our war cemeteries](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cross+of+sacrifice&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949&amp;sei=%20ApmwTs2LCInJhAfhhLjPAg) .


America is, and for a long time will be, dominantly christian. Atheists should rightly push for fair treatment, equal rights, and an end to their hounding by the media and public opinion.

Legally attacking everything you can isn't going to help. Don't kid yourselves. The interpretation of the 1st amendment that is allowing these kinds of challenges is (and I say this as an atheist) far from the only one, and given the composition of the Supreme Court you guys are one counter-appeal away from some serious trouble.



Aside from the law, why not think about this logically. When religious people perceive their faith as under attack, nothing good comes of it. **You may have pushed a handful of crosses off public land, but conservative groups now have an issue to pay for a hundred times that in billboards.** It may not be state-sponsored, but it's society that oppresses atheists in the US.

-The U.S. supported a dictatorial takeover of Greece post WWII

-The IMF, a US controlled institution, was sent into South American and post USSR Eastern Europe  to budding democracies to turn them into debt slaves; making their labor and resources more easily exploited.

-Greece's debts were hidden by a collaboration between their government and Goldman Sachs, another US spawn

-France and Germany, and probably the US, can't let Greece fail because their banks are highly over-leveraged and invested in Greece.  Bailing out Greece is actually bailing themselves out.

-Unless you live in New Zealand I doubt your country is in better shape.  All western 1st world countries, and even China are in in equal or greater trouble.  Greece just happens to have a smaller economy and is the first to fall

That is one of the very reasons I support independence. I think Scotland would be a modern, open, liberal society. I think the breadth of ethnicities elected as SNP MSP's (but also for Holyrood as a whole) is an example of this and nothing demonstrated it better than the swearing in cermony. An independent Scotland could hardly be more  illiberal than the current Union under Blair/Brown or the current incumbents.

Regarding Europe, I think there are as wide a range of views on this within the SNP as you would find among your friends, family and workmates. While the idea of an integrated Europe, without barriers to trade or employment and, importantly, no more wars, is a good idea, the direction of travel is not what we were sold back in the 70's. I wonder if membership of EFTA might not be a better prospect - but that might be academic as Iceland and Norway are considering membership of the EU.

With the way things are changing at the moment who knows what the shape and direction of the EU will be in two years time or whether the Euro will exist. You don't jump your fences until you have to, Alex Salmond knows this and so I think he is keeping his powder dry.

I think things such as the EU and the currency are things to be decided by an independent Scotland rather than the SNP. I think the current position of keeping the status quo will allow for market stability as the ultimate solution emerges, probably through a series of referenda in an independent Scotland.

I don't follow your point about handing back power to Europe we have regained from Westminster. Currently, as part of the UK, these powers reside with Europe. Surely we would only be regaining sovereignty not already pooled with the EU?

I for one detest the Indian name. Not for any dislike towards my brethren from another continent, bur rather for the constant reminder of a 500 year old fuck up. Indian is like a constant and constricting lead collar, it subjugates us. No matter what our collective accomplishments might be, at best we are so and so, that Indian dude. In pre-Columbian times, we had distinct names with which we were known and addressed by. When I hear the word I can think is it wrong to expect that same respect, everyone else gets it, why not us? 

That one would think its appropriate to still call us by that irratates the snot outta me. Heck, European friends of mine have universally been more respectful than many americans about this. And now that I am in canada, Everyone has been all manor of respectful and downright cool about it. I dunno, it seems backwards the rest of the world gets it especially when there is usually enough information available to most americans to do differently. Some use the fact that ""we"" still call ourselves Indians, and unfortunately this is still true for some, and likely will be until that generation moves on. You have the people who have known nothing else, who havent been exposed to any other way of being, so they accept what they know. 

My people, The Mohawks, or Kanien:keha, are a fairly educated bunch. We know what we would like to be called. We are generally pretty up front about it. Most of the media outlets in the state know to address us by our chosen names, so maybe there is some progress. I know that in the south and out west especially, it is often much less progressive.

&gt;
&gt;The OIC attracted attention at the opening session of the meeting in Putrajaya, Malaysia, on 16 October 2003, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia in his speech argued that the Jews control the world: ""They invented socialism, communism, human rights, and democracy, so that persecuting them would appear to be wrong, so that they can enjoy equal rights with others. With these they have gained control of the most powerful countries and they, this tiny community, have become a world power.” He also said that “the Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million, but today the Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.”[35][36]


&gt;The speech was very well received by the delegates, including many high ranking politicians, who responded with standing ovations"".[37][38][39] International, non-Muslim reactions, however, were appalled. ""We view [the remarks] with contempt and derision,"" said a U.S. State Department spokesman. The foreign minister of Italy, who was the chairman of the European Union, called the incident ""gravely offensive."" Malaysian officials later clarified that Mahathir had been trying to say that despite having been a marginal and persecuted community the Jews have survived—by use of brains, not brawn. The former prime minister said this in relation to the decline of Muslim knowledge in the 20th Century.[38]

""Race to the bottom, no? And that she should at least be content because she didn't get something even worse? Uhh…""

Yeah she should be. ""even worse"" you sound like she was shot with a gun. She was hit with a belt that will leave bruises for all of 2 or 3 days.
I'm from eastern Europe. Your definition of abuse is a lesser punishment in our society, and most of the world.

"" Besides, the judge committed a crime, and motives don't really matter in legal situations. ""

Motives don't matter in legal situations? Should I even continue reading the rest of your argument? Motives most certainly do count.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motive_(law)

""If I kill someone because they cheated on me, I still killed someone. Do I get off the hook? Does the punishment change in any way? No.""

This could influence your sentence. 

""So you're point is that she knew about it and broke it, thus, she knew what was coming? And that it's not that bad because you've had worse?""

Not because I had it worse, but because she chose to break the rules and planted a camera anticipating her father would punish her. She then refused to cooperate, perhaps further increasing the punishment. Point is, she knew it was being recorded, her parents didn't, she could have set the situation up in her favor.

"" But this is ridiculously over the top for downloading stuff off Kazaa""

That's your opinion. Her parents are obviously fearful of technology, for all they knew they could be getting a lawsuit that could cost them the house had she been caught. This isn't over the top. We can from her mother talking that they had gone over this before. 

""And guess what? Will she stop using Kazaa? Probably not.""

So complete disregard for your elders is something completely acceptable in America. I can live with this. I'm not sure how you can. It's parental authority, and you obey it unless it's out of line.

 Her parents disapproved against her PIRATING, which we all know is such a noble cause. I hate paying for stuff so I steal it all the time too. My parents tried to tell me I was wrong but I made a call to the police that my dad beat me and that was that. /S

""that's simply because they are such banal statements that nobody really pays attention to.""

So if she is really abused then if nobody cares about her statements because they are banal and unoriginal such as ""my dad is abusing me"" people won't care? Good argument.

""Pretty much every parent who beats their children like this has the exact same arguments.""

Indeed they do. God forbid they say something like ""My child is out of line"" when punishing their children. Every parent needs an original line or their actions are null and void right?

They are well known in the anthropology and archaeology communities and have been rigorously tested, and many ancestors of those tribes were still alive during first contact. Additionally these mounds were known around JS's time as well. Ol' Joe was reported to have dug up some of these mounds himself and on one occasion arbitrarily assigned a Nephite name to a skull he found. Again I must stress that these mounds were in scientific journals that JS would certainly have had access to. Also know that evidence for a large sophisticated society is not proof of the book of mormon, only that a large sophisticated society existed in a particular time and place.  It also cheapens the accomplishments of the American Indians and their complexity of culture by saying it needed outside influence, say from the middle east, to be able to exist as it did.   

As for DNA evidence, the author suggests (very happily) that for the Ojibwa, DNA evidence links them and people from Galilee. I'm in the field of Anth. and have never heard this, so I would politely ask him for evidence. Remember native remains and funerary objects are protected under NAGPRA. Additionally, the video he links discuss the haplogroups associated with native populations. She mentions haplogroup X present in 3% of the population of Natives. Haplogroup X is originated from a mutation some 50,000 years bp from haplogroup N (present in the middle east) and further divided approximately 30,000 years bp to X1 and X2 and then into numerous subclades including x2a and x2g which are found in North America. There are subgroups present in the Altai Region of Central Asia which holds one of the theories of migration to N.A. which this haplogroup came with haplogroups A,B,C,D (which are present in all Native Americans and come from Asia. There is also the Solutrean theory in which the solutrean culture (a stone age culture) Also known as the clovis culture came over during a period of atlantic freeze on boats some 20,000 years ago (which is probable because of the diffusion of material culture) and were there is contact there is...well...you know....bumpin' uglies. Where the Druze group in Galilee have X1 and x2 the subclates do not match. The amount of time needed for mitochondrial mutations is not conducive to the time scale put forth by the book of mormon (which when written was oppurating from the biblical stance on the age of the world which was only 6500 years which is why early anthropologist created modern American racism. Sorry about that). 

Further down on one of that post there is a video where a man is describing a fortification mound and how its defense worked against the laminates. Conjecture is not proof and has no basis in science. He, nor anyone else, has any empirical evidence for what he is saying. 

Again for all of the evidence in the Smithsonian, scrolls with pre-columbian writing? I assume he is referring to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_scroll). I have seen now evidence of written language in prehistoric N.A. as apposed to pictographs, petroglyphs, dendroglyphs, and what we know today as native art that was sometimes done on materials such as Navajo sheep skin in the southwest or cedar bark in the northwest and rolled and saved for ceremonial occasion. 

There were and are today indeed light skinned natives. I myself know of a full blooded native as far back as you can go with fairer skin then me, and my ancestry is northern europe. I must say, there is such thing as human variation and these anomalies exist in any population (not exclusively referring to light skin) and represent in a very real sense evolutionary biology.

Lastly he does talk about the amount of artifacts indicates a massive war. Let me say this, I just excavated what may have been a pit house that house 3 or 4 people over the summer, and the amount of materials and debitage surrounding the structure was staggering. Many archaeological sites yield enough material from a 10% sample to study for a lifetime. Just saying.

I don't think this is necessarily a good thing. The thing that makes video games separate from other forms of media that make popular fiction is that games other media make you the observer. Games have the ability to make you the protagonist.  A generic FPS where you're hand held from Point A to B with cinematic, Michael Bay-esque action scenes spliced in between is not what I would consider to be a good game. 

&gt;Then we have games like Mass Effect that seem to be better science fiction than any of the new Star Wars films. 

Not to nitpick, but I don't really consider Star Wars to be science fiction. Star Wars has a lot more in common with Tolkien than it does with Asimov, so it doesn't take much for something to do science fiction better than it. 

In my opinion, gaming as a whole does not have a golden age, gaming genres have golden ages. If you're a flight sim fan for instance, this is not a golden age for you. There was a time when flight simulators outsold all other PC genres combined. Today, they are made by extremely small boutique development studios and Eastern Europeans.

Not because of Greece, but so that Greece can become the ""experiment"", of what may soon happen to Spain and even Italy.  Its economy is small enough that different techniques can be tried to get them back on their feet without imperiling the rest of Europe.

That is, if Greece leaving the Euro is an unmitigated disaster, there is no way that Spain or Italy will follow in its footsteps.  But if Greece recovers, after a fashion, by returning to the Drachma, then Spain and Italy might be able to do the same thing.

From my point of view, the best way for a faster Greek recovery is to not only bring back the Drachma, but also to create a transitional currency.  And there is a very good example of how such a transitional currency was used before, to great effect.

When the currency of Weimar Germany, the *Papiermark*, was hyperinflating, it was decided to transition to a new currency, the *Reichsmark*.  But a third currency, a very stable currency, called the *Rentenmark* was created as a buffer between the two.

In the case of Greece, this third currency could be 100% backed with fungible commodities, the value of the commodities and the currency both fixed by the ECB.  

This can then be used to create an ""abundance trade regime"".  Literally anything that Greece is still able to produce for export can be counter-tariffed, so that it is sold for high prices in the rest of Europe, and other products, produced in excess in Europe, can be sold to the Greeks at an artificially low price.  In this manner there can be a slow and steady return to value in the Drachma, which eventually can reach convertibility in Euros, via the controlled third currency.",True,4,,False,4,0,0,t1_c2wb1xu

Language is thought to have evolved along with consciousness and empathy because it involves theory of mind (the understanding that other people have minds, which it is argued is at the root of communication). The big questions surround how much of our brain and vocal tract evolved along with language - for example, did sign language exist before spoken language?

The thing around modern languages is much more recent (i.e. not as tied to evolution) but still linked to that, because many people argue that language is hard-wired into the brain to various degrees, and some go so far as to say there is a universal grammar (for example, all languages have sounds, but do all languages have verbs?). The languages spoken in Europe, with exceptions, all have common roots in a 6000 year old language that you could potentially learn if you travelled back in time, but may have had no writing system. That's probably as far back as we can go in terms of recognising features from present languages.

&gt; Yeah she should be. ""even worse"" you sound like she was shot with a gun. She was hit with a belt that will leave bruises for all of 2 or 3 days. I'm from eastern Europe. Your definition of abuse is a lesser punishment in our society, and most of the world.

Example of fundamental disagreement that will never be overcome. Also, this happened in Texas, not in Eastern Europe. Although this can be debated from a Eastern European perspective I don't really see the point in that, because the actual decision of punishment will come from an American perspective. Say what you want about American law ought to be, but more useful is what the law currently is.

&gt; Motives don't matter in legal situations? Should I even continue reading the rest of your argument? Motives most certainly do count.

Hmm well I'm not well versed in legal matters, but I think that this particular motive, whatever it may be, won't change the punishment. But I don't know.

&gt; Not because I had it worse, but because she chose to break the rules and planted a camera anticipating her father would punish her. She then refused to cooperate, perhaps further increasing the punishment. Point is, she knew it was being recorded, her parents didn't, she could have set the situation up in her favor.

So you're saying she provoked her and set up the situation in the case where if the parents knew the full outcome, they would have acted differently? So if police record someone speeding in say, a rural highway where few people expect to get caught, they ""set up"" the situation? And should the parents have behaved this way even if they knew there was no camera? See, that's where the fundamental disagreement comes in. You'd say that they could have done it and not be in the wrong, whereas I think they'd be in the wrong..

&gt; That's your opinion. Her parents are obviously fearful of technology, for all they knew they could be getting a lawsuit that could cost them the house had she been caught. This isn't over the top. We can from her mother talking that they had gone over this before.

Another fundamental disagreement, since I think it's over the top and you don't.

&gt; So complete disregard for your elders is something completely acceptable in America. I can live with this. I'm not sure how you can. It's parental authority, and you obey it unless it's out of line. Her parents disapproved against her PIRATING, which we all know is such a noble cause. I hate paying for stuff so I steal it all the time too. My parents tried to tell me I was wrong but I made a call to the police that my dad beat me and that was that. /S

For the first part, I'm simply pointing out that the thing is not effective. Say what you want about what American parental authority/child relationships should be, but in the context of the existing situation, the punishment would not have been effective. I'm not supporting the disregard for authority, you misinterpreted. I'm pointing out the effect. Forst the second part, I already said ""Perhaps she was in the wrong, ok, I won't argue w/ that.""

&gt; So if she is really abused then if nobody cares about her statements because they are banal and unoriginal such as ""my dad is abusing me"" people won't care? Good argument.

I am against banalities not because they have been said so much, but against the specific ones that have been refuted many many times. I think that yours have been repeated many times and subsequently responded to, but that's just how it appears to me.

&gt; Indeed they do. God forbid they say something like ""My child is out of line"" when punishing their children. Every parent needs an original line or their actions are null and void right?

Again, they need a valid line, not necessarily original. Some problems are common throughout families, I'd say.

I'm familiar with the argument, but every essay I've read (including the one you linked) that proposed the same argument argued for it ""historically"". That is, they show that the current inequality came to be thanks to state intervention, and assume that therefore the same inequality would not exist without state intervention.

The argument sounds nice on paper, but I am not convinced. Coercion does not necessitate a market, so even though industrial capital used the state as its preferred tool for coercion, I see no reason why capitalists would not be able to have their own private coercive force, or even collude together to have a joint force to maintain themselves on the top. Until I see experimental evidence that this would not happen, I will not be convinced. For the most part, in the real world it appears that in the event of a power vacuum, local rich families simply become feudal lords, and exchange protection for serfdom. This appears to have happened in every weak state I know the history of, in East Asia, the Middle East, Europe or South America.

I have, however, seen that it is true that deregulation generally leads to greater inequality, and it is not evident to me that this trend would subside once you eliminate *all* state power. Although it is possible that this is true only because only provisions that hinder capitalist growth tend to get deregulated, and rarely the laws that protect them. ",True,7,,False,7,0,0,t1_c2wb8t5

I think it's a good potential revenue stream, but I don't think it will be enough to compensate for MGM's substantial balance sheet problems. MGM has a massive debt-to-equity ratio largely as a result of their disastrous City Center Project in Las Vegas which was a clusterfuck on many levels. MGM is way too over-levered to a Las Vegas  recovery, which may never come back, at least to pre-2007 levels and lacks true short-term Macao exposure (the US MGM equity controls a mere 50% of one casino in Macao). For those who don't follow the sector closely, Macao is the driving force behind casino stocks at this point, as Macao revenues for this year look to be more than FIVE TIMES that of the Strip. While MGM might see a short-term pop from this event, fears of a global slowdown and medium-term bankruptcy concerns (they're considering opening a mega-resort in Vietnam and another Macao casino, if they can win the concession) which will result in an even more leveraged balance sheet. Further, while online gambling might be profitable for the company, it's highly unlikely that it would be enough of a boon to lower their debt levels from the City Center calamity. 

Boyd has a more reasonable debt situation, is a smaller company (making it easier to move the proverbial needle) and would be the better play of the two; however, Boyd's success, like MGM, is highly contingent upon a US economic recovery and a concomitant rise in discretionary spending. Significant appreciation in the stock will come only if America (and, in turn, Europe) can get into a more fiscally stable situation where people feel it's safe to return to the casinos and spend some discretionary income. 

Full disclosure: I'm net long the casinos with Asian exposure (LVS, WYNN, MPEL) using various instruments, as I feel they're a much better play than the predominantly American exposure ones. That being said, now doesn't seem like the time to get into the Asian casino trade as they've had quite a run up from their bottom last month.

I guess for starters, I've been raised in a very liberal-esque family. Both my parents are researchers that were raised in Europe, so I've been raised to believe that evolution does exist, and that stem cell research should be supported and what not. However, I also believe that the bible is a metaphorical explanation for how the world was created, and that it shouldn't be taken too literally.

I'm also entirely pro-choice, for gay marriage, and I define myself to be a liberal.

That being said, I still believe in the holy trinity. I go to church, and I read the bible. But as said earlier, I treat the bible more as a metaphor.

One thing that does truly annoy me (and possibly atheists/agnostics as well) is when religious groups feel the need to CONVERT ALL THE PEOPLE! At the moment, there's a ""religious movement"" at my school where this club is saying Christianity is the only way to go. It disgusts me. People should be allowed to believe in what they believe in. However, most religious people in this country feel the need to promote Christianity like it's the only option. It's not. I don't go telling all my agnostic/atheist friends that they'll go to hell if they aren't the children of God, because that's not what I believe. If I did do that, I would have no friends.

I know there are probably other reasons as to why atheists/agnostics are bitter towards theists. This is the reason that makes me dislike certain people that share my religious beliefs. I don't know if this helps much, but hey, it's worth a shot. ",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2wbcpd

Troubled people need professional psychiatrists, not just people who happen to know a little bit about what to say to get troubled people to temporarily feel better. Asking a priest to pray away your mental health problems is on the same level as asking a priest to pray away your cancer.

I do realize that realistic Christian behavior is not at all synonymous with following the Bible word for word. However, every time I suggest to Christians that they should just adopt the Jefferson Bible, they give me weird looks. Your Bible is *attached* to your religion. By that very fact, it *can and will* be used to justify atrocities. A software engineer would call something like that a ""bug"": it results in bad things. Christians seem adamant to retain those bugs in their religion, purely for the sake of tradition.

Yes, I think ""The Reason For God"" is poorly argued. The man is a good writer and can be pretty convincing, but if you strip away the language, at the heart of the book are the same old tired arguments that have been made and debunked ages ago. Let's take his stance on the Problem of Evil, as a start. If I remember correctly, he asserts that evil might even be evidence for the existence of God. He gives examples of people who experienced misfortune but gained ""spiritual"" insight. Basically, ""suffering builds character"".

Fallacy number one: cherry-picking. What about the people who, due to suffering, become psychopaths and mass murderers? What about the people who die because of their suffering? Fallacy number two: just because something bad *could* result in something good does not at all turn that bad thing into a good thing itself. By this reasoning (excuse me for invoking Godwin's Law) Hitler's actions could be excused because they led to the end of war in Western Europe. Basically, he responds to the existence of evil by saying ""but hey without these specific instances of evil these specific instances of good would not have happened. Therefore, God is actually good!""

Or, let's discuss the chapter in which he points to the ""clues"" for the existence of God. None of them are rigorous. He thinks the Big Bang necessitates a supernatural force, but that's basically invoking a God of the Gaps. The vast universe, infinitely hostile to life, is supposed to be some sort of ""cosmic welcome mat"". It's like he's never heard of selection bias. His observation of the ""regularity"" of nature is a purely psychological construct, and he also ignores the law of chaos that rules at the quantum scale. Our perception of beauty has an easy evolutionary explanation. Just because reason comes from natural selection does not invalidate reason; that evolution gave us the ability to prove 2 + 2 = 4 does not mean that without evolution 2 + 2 = 5. Nature is not at all deterministic; determinism is a statistical illusion. He basically says ""to me, the way things are *seem* to support the existence of God; I just feel it in my gut.""

Think of it as a paradigm. Fighting wasn't a beneficial endeavor before agriculture (it was easier to move somewhere else than fight another group for where they currently were). It was almost as if people just didn't even think it was a thing to do at all.

But when people settled down and started *storing* food and resources, then war became ""profitable"". Fighting was only useful because there existed other, non-nomadic cultures which had a lot of resources stored up so that their populations could grow. That ""warrior"" paradigm started to spread to traditionally nomadic cultures. And in the case of Native Americans, they had no choice **but** to fight the Europeans. They could leave their range, but that would just allow the ""warrior"" paradigm to spread into their land. They could build weapons and resist, but that too would merely spread the warrior paradigm. Or they could simply not-resist, but this also wouldn't prevent the warrior mentality from spreading.

In that sense, agriculture *isn't* natural because it contradicts our biological and evolutionary make-up. Other species may practice what looks like agriculture (ants ""farming"" fungus), but the difference is we practice agriculture principally for the purpose of storing surplus for population growth.

Unfortunately we're now at a point where our agricultural infrastructure is completely dependent on a resource in dwindling supply (oil, and I suppose fresh water as well).

In the late 1800s/early 1900s, Leopold II set up a joint stock company with him as pretty much the sole beneficiary.  He forced black natives to hunt for ivory, lay down railroad tracks in malarial swamps, and extract the rubber sap that was abundant in the area.  To do so, he had his troops take black women as captives and cut off the hands of those who did not obey or reach their quotas.  His soldiers razed villages, raped women, and were responsible for the death of up to 10 million natives.  And he never set foot in the Congo.  Europe did not care about his activities in the Congo because Leopold lied and said he was using missionaries to christianize the region.

His schemes were eventually revealed to the world at large by the journalist ED Morel and the Irish nationalist Roger Casement.  Major figures such as Mark Twain joined the anti-Belgian Congo movement.  It was really one of the first multinational media controversies.  

I did a paper on how technology allowed Leopold's soldiers to enter the Congo where others hadn't (Steamships were a big help, new technologies used ivory and rubber, the trains made it possible to ship the good from inland, the print media had a huge impact on the unveiling of the case, etc).",True,2,,False,2,0,0,t1_c2wbs0p

Your neighbor would be much more likely to owe you money if they thought you had very little debt, than if they thought you had a mountain.  For a long time people thought it was half of what it really owed.

Now the complex part . . . why the rest of Europe cares.

Let's say you're a big bank.  What is your job?  Well, people give you money, you loan out the money, and in return you give people a small cut.  So how much is the bank worth?  Well, what we're not worth is how much actual cash people have deposited with us, because we no longer have that cash.  What we're worth is what the value of all those loans we've made.

So what happens is Greece defaults?  Well, let's say people have deposited $1B in cash with us.  Between cash on hand and what we considered to be the value of all our loans, the total value of our bank is $1.2B.  Part of this includes a loan to Greece, which if they pay off, is worth $300M.

Now Greece defaults.  That $300M value we assigned to the loans now is assigned a value of $0.  We owe our customers $1B, but we only have $900M in assets.  We are now insolvent.  Depending on the laws of the country you are in, you might have to shut down.  If your customers find out, they might start taking out all their money, and then regardless of the laws you just don't have that last $100M and are going to be shut down anyways.

Now let's say bank B loaned you $100M.  If you become insolvent, then that $100M loan is now worth $0 as well.  If this is enough to cause a solvency crisis in bank B, then they go bankrupt and their creditors . . .

Everyone is interconnected and one trigger can bring the entire system down.  Note that the trigger wasn't that bank A lost $300M in cash or some hard asset like gold -- they were forced to make the value of their bonds (i.e. a piece of paper) to $0 because the law says they have to.  What if the law makers get together, work out a deal that say you only have to mark it down to $150M even though odds are Greece is going to default anyways?  You're still solvent!  And now you have time to try to figure out a way to keep being solvent if you have to mark down the other $150M a year later.

But in your heart of hearts, you know the value of that piece of paper isn't $300M or $150M, even though you are allowed to say it's worth that much.  It's $0.

The last piece of the puzzle . . . leverage.  The numbers I used are $1B in cash, which turned into $1.2B in paper assets.  The real numbers are closer to $1B in deposits means we can place bets up to $10B in size.  As a result, if you lose 10% of your money, you are insolvent!  Are you a European bank and have 10% of your assets in Greek Bonds?  Uh oh . . .

Now . . . the other half . . . credit default swaps.

A credit default swap is essentially a bet.  If country Y goes insolvent, then you win.  The guy you made the bet with has to pay you the value of the bet.  Let's say in your heart of hearts you think this piece of paper is worth $0, but everyone else thinks it's worth $300M.  You can buy the $300M piece of paper (which pays you a lot of interest), and then place a bet that the country will default.  You'll make a lot of interest while the country is willing to pay it, and when it does default, you win the bet.  What can go wrong?

Well, two things can (and are) going wrong.  The first is called ""counterparty risk"", which almost everyone assumed was zero.  CDS (and all derivatives) are bets.  They are also zero sum, in that if you win, someone else is losing.  So what happens if the loser simply cannot pay you?  Well, you're screwed.  This happened in the United States three years ago with AIG -- AIG took the other side of a lot of what turned out to be bad bets, and when they couldn't pay, the US Government decided to pay their bets for them.  This should have been a big hint that counterparty risk isn't zero, but everyone still acted like it was.

Oh, and those banks we talked about above?  They are the counterparties to a lot of these bets.  If they go insolvent, then unless someone bails them out, if you're holding a CDS they issued you are screwed.  What if you're the bank that wrote the CDS and the country decides to default?  Well, the value of those CDS' is going to go up, and since it is a zero sum game your value is going to go down proportionally.  You could then end up insolvent because you now have to cover bets you thought were sure losers.  

So what else can go wrong?  Well, let's say the country defaults, but everyone pretends they didn't.  This is what is happening in Europe right now.  All of a sudden, by the decree of the ECB, the $300M loan is worth $150M.  But also by the decree of the ECB, this does *not* count as a default, and thus does not trigger the CDSs.

So let's say you're a hedge fund that held $300M in greek debt, and some expensive CDSs to cover it in the case of the default.  You just lost $150M in value on your loan.  In addition, on your books you said the CDS would cover you if this happened (after all, you placed a bet that should have paid you off if it did happen!) but thanks to the referee, you don't win the bet because of a technicality.  No money has changed hands, but all of a sudden the number in your book is at least $150M less, when a week ago you thought that was impossible.",True,20,,True,20,0,0,t1_c2wbu5i

wifi. We want to be able to get this done in mere seconds in case we are
passing by quickly such as in a car.

Our message gets passed along in this way hopefully always getting
closer to its recipient whose location we specified in general and
perhaps specifically by encrypting to his private key.

Or perhaps we want to send a message to the free Internet-enabled world.
We cruise around and it gets sent to a fixed location device nearby a
busy street. Every hour or two a mobile phone passes by on its way to
the airport. That mobile phone is going to get on a plane and go
somewhere in the world.  We know this because of the location
probability distribution. We know that device within hours is very
likely to be in contact with a dedicated wired Internet connection. We
dump every message we possibly can on him, starting with the messages it
is mostly likely to be able to deliver followed by less likely messages
because our connection is just temporary and will get dropped as we move
out of range, possibly while we are still transmitting.

That device lands at the airport in Europe somewhere where it disburses
its messages to other mobile FP speaking devices. In fact, it probably
already did so on the plane before everyone turned their phones off or
even in the departure area while everyone was waiting to board. But it
might also do so in the arrivals hall although it may not because it is
satisfied that it has already delivered to enough other devices with a
high probability of being in contact with a wired connection soon.

In a nearby concesssion along the terminal on the way to the baggage
carousel someone has discretely stashed a fixed FP speaking device. It
spends all day receiving and transmitting messages to different parts of
the world as the FP speaking mobile phones walk by on the way to their
international flights. Via the probability broadcasts it knows who is
likely returning to China, to Pakistan, to Venezuela, etc. although it
only knows these places at lats/longs. There is also a similar box in a
neighborhood on the main thoroughfare passing almost as many messages
from the taxis and buses as they go by. Not to mention all of the FP
speaking devices being carried by passengers furiously exchanging
messages as they move throughout the airport.

Our message eventually hits one of these devices with a wired or
otherwise unmetered Internet connection where it hits a gateway which
converts the message to a tweet, an email, a facebook entry, whatever.

So how do we get return messages or even ACK packets (receipt
verifications) back? Are ACKs even necessary? Probably not. Certainly
not at the low level. Let the receiver reply to the message in their
higher level protocol if they want to ACK it. This is like UDP.

Say our contact (be it a person, a website, a twitter account, whatever)
in the Free World receives our message, does whatever needs to be done
with it, and wants to send us a message such as ""The Good Guys are
sending in the cavalry on Monday, sit tight."" Or someone could
theoretically subscribe to a twitter feed via a gateway and have all
tweets with a certain hash tag packaged up and sent to them.

Their return address would have to be an approximate lat/long where they
expect to be able to pick up the message. They may even choose a very
specific lat/long which is nearby where they expect to be able to pick
up the message but of course never their exact location, just something
to report as their exact location when picking up messages to ensure the
message ends up on a nearby FP speaking device and is directly routed to
them first when they pass by to ensure they get their message.

The message would be routed in the direction of their return address
wherever possible. The message will either have some sort of To: address
in the application layer (like email) or it will be encrypted
specifically to them if they care about privacy. The receiving device
would receive all of the messages the sender thinks it should have and
then pick through them for specific messages addressed to them either by
name or lat/long or whatever.

Would the message from the Free World with Internet access ever arrive?
Getting to a place with a wired net connection is a lot easier than
getting from such a place to a specific area or town such that one might
have a chance to pick up the message. What is the range of the typical
wifi? Indoors or with various sorts of obstructions let's say 35m. A
typical freeway has a lane width of 4m. So anyone within 8 traffic lanes
(a whole freeway width, in the US) is within range. That actually
creates a LOT of opportunities for message passing.  What are the
chances that a device will pass another FP capable device on the
freeway, find each other, and exchange messages? My wifi enabled mobile
phone sees many wifi access points as I go down the road. How many
people do you come within 35m of throughout the typical day? I bet it is
a lot. Especially if you live in a densely populated area or travel on a
freeway. The chances of coming into contact with another FP enabled
device depends on how many you can get out there into the world but I
don't think you would need nearly as many as there are mobile phones out
there to do some real good.

If a device has 4G of flash available and we set the average message
size even at 10k we can store a LOT of messages. Do the math. We could
store messages for such a long time that their chances of being
delivered eventually actually get pretty high. The speed of delivery
then becomes a function of how many FP enabled devices are out there.

Why would anyone who isn't a revolutionary run this on their phone or in
a fixed place device?

You need a killer app to get everyone using it. That would also serve to
obscure any dangerous revolutionary traffic. You need some chaff to hide
in.

Something like this could replace SMS messaging. Especially in a
confined area such as a school, an office, or a small town or congested
city area where the messages would potentially travel very quickly.
Teenagers love this sort of thing.  Create an app to run on their smart
phone. Sell very cheaply FP enabled SMS only devices. Let them spread
all over the world.  Each device generates its own key, devices can be
paired like bluetooth so you know who is who and won't suffer man in the
middle attacks where the devices transparently encrypt the messages to
each other's keys. Call it ""friending"". Hide all the complicated fancy
crypto stuff which would just scare people off, just claim the
communications to be ""secure"". Definitely avoid any certificate
authority type nonsense. Use the ssh trust model. Anyone really betting
their life on it would be obliged to understand the technology a little
better.

So it looks like software and mobile phone apps are the best way to go
here. You could build a physical device and call it a freedom box if you
really wanted but I would create it with the intention of it being used
by kids as secure adult-proof communications devices for spreading
high school gossip. Not a boring wall-wart which nobody will buy
ensuring per unit costs remain high. But do make it small and with
ability to connect to an AC power supply so it could function like a
wall wart and possibly external antenna and be hidden somewhere. It
wouldn't even need a graphical screen necessarily. Text only LCD
displays very inexpensive compared to the fancy high rez touch sensitive
smartphone displays currently shipping. Would kids go for pure text
messaging ability and no voice, digital camera, web etc?  Who knows. But
SMS sure is popular, especially in third world countries where this is
likely to be needed. Most of SMS is just black and white text.

Most of the world can't afford a fancy phone with voice anyway.

Things to consider:

Could a bad guy build a device or abuse the protocol to suck up all of
our messages becoming a black hole preventing message delivery?

How can we make such broadcasts inconspicuous yet recognizeable? How
often should they announce so as to conserve power? Maybe only announce
while moving. Perhaps as detected by accelerometer if we aren't fancy
enough to have a GPS. Maybe announce whenever we passively listen and
hear another device. If he just came into range he was moving so he was
announcing. Some such discovery protocol needs to be worked out.

It would be nice if we could somehow track replies vs who we sent the
original message through. That way we could calculate the probability
that any one particular node consistently fails to deliver. On the other
hand, you can't have negative reputation on the Internet. You can just
fake up a new identity. Perhaps even completely unnecessary if we can
run into enough honest devices to get the message through. Maybe it
would be better to track who likely got us a reply faster. That is a
form of positive reputation which is more doable.

Just my 2 cents. :)

option 1, Papandreou reneges to the EU, shit hits fan, possible expulsion from the EU or some other kind of sanction. He's out less than a year when people realize that telling their fiscal saviors to get fucked isn't a productive way forward and pin it on him. 

Option 2, Papandreou reneges on the people, accepts the bailout anyhow, riots intensify as popular sentiment turns against a government that they (not entirely wrongly) feel has sold them to Berlin and Brussels, and he and his government get sacked.

2) Who willingly lied to the European Union over their fiscal situation?  Again, that would be Greece (yup, GS helped)

&gt; I intended to write a story ... But I found something else. 

Incredibly trite and overused lead, but I'm listening.

&gt; ""Obviously, everybody has their own expectations of you, but you have to have your own expectations for yourself. For me, I'm right on track."" My jaw nearly dropped, but the arguments he put forth over the next hour made sense. 

Really? Your jaw nearly dropped when somebody didn't say “Yeah, I'm totally screwing the pooch right now.”

&gt; ""Obviously, when I went to Europe it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to,"" Adu said. ""I know a lot of people may look at it and say, 'Ah, man, he's not going to live up to anything and he's not going to be anything.'""

OK, admitting things went wrong. Please go on.

&gt; ""I was just unlucky. I was very unlucky.""

So, he goes on to say that at his first stop (DC Utd) he was unlucky b/c he was the highest paid player in a locker room with veterans who had already won trophies, thus building resentment. Fair enough.

&gt; Most of all, Adu bemoans never having run into a coach in Europe willing to champion his cause and allow him a margin for error. Rather than being afforded time to grow into a role, Adu said, he was expected to contribute immediately -- something he blames on his own stature and salary -- and when he didn't deliver, his development was foisted onto others through loan moves. 

Really? You're 18, you haven't blown away MLS, you're going completely on potential, and you expect some coach who is paid to win games immediately to coddle to your professional growth? 

&gt; ""Going on loan all the time didn't help,"" said Adu. ""I wish I would have just been in a place where I had a home, where I was able to develop as a player, like a lot of people get a chance to do. But some people just don't. When I got to Benfica, I was 18 years old and they were already expecting me to go out and light it up. It was never going to happen when you make such a big jump from MLS to Benfica."" 

Guess what, buddy? When you were 18 and went to Benfica you may have already been deemed a future prodigy by some media, but in reality there were 100s of 18-year-olds from all over the world that were just as good – some obviously a little more hungry to improve than you.

&gt; Before the tournament was over, he'd returned to Greece and was told by Aris that if he didn't take a 50 percent pay cut, he was no longer welcome at practice or games. Adu balked and from July to November scrambled to find a new club. …  So Adu swallowed his pride and decided to accept the move to lowly Rizespor, situated in the remote Northeastern corner of Turkey.

He refused to take a pay cut? That's really swallowing one's pride. Yeah, he went to Rizespor – and it only took him months to realize nobody else wanted him.

&gt; Adu, who stood out in unexpected appearances in the [Gold Cup] semifinals and final, parlayed the call-up to a move to the Union, taking a pay cut to enable his return to MLS. (His 2011 salary is listed at a guaranteed $594,884 by the MLS players' union.) 

He had some nice moments, but there are a lot of players making a lot less who have only started six games this season.

&gt; Across the table at lunch, he filled out his light blue hooded sweater well, biceps bulging underneath the thin cloth. 

The Situation's biceps bulge, too. Should he play soccer?

&gt; On the field, he looked as fit and explosive as ever 

He hasn't looked explosive since playing in the youth ranks. His biggest knock, his entire career, is that he has the body of Aaron Lennon and the speed of Peter Crouch. Not the combo you're looking for.

&gt; The other knock on Adu had always been his complete disinterest in defending. ""When I did go pro, the one thing that did keep me off the field is defense,"" Adu said. But he no longer shies away from carrying his weight once the ball turns over. ""That's night and day for me right now, I've gotten so much better at that."" 

OK, this is where he completely loses me. How many times over the last four years have we heard about a new commitment to defending from Freddy or some other Freddy apologist? Why are we to believe him this time? What about general movement off the ball? 

&gt; Off the field, Freddy Adu is changed. ""The most glaring difference is that his mom doesn't have to drive him to practice anymore,"" said Alecko Eskandarian, a teammate of Adu's on United and now the youth technical director for the Union. ""Other than that, I think he's smarter, he's wiser, he's learned some life lessons through his mistakes."" 

I should hope someone is more mature at 22 than at 14. 

The moral of the story is we get about 1-2 of these Freddy ""he's totally mature and playing defense and turning it around this time"" slurp stories a year. Freddy can say all he wants. This writer's jaw can drop all he wants it to.

But to me, someone who'd like to see him break into a high level of play, actions speak louder than words.

10k yrs ago the standard farming package in Europe began to spread, taking with it the Pan-Indo-European language and culture. This included a religion whose gods had names which were words for standard things in the world, such as

anyway, here's some interesting stuff for each topic you suggested

Math: Talk about infinity. Even if you don't go into mathematical detail and make it a really rigorous concept, it's still a really fun thing to think about. If you want to go into deeper math, perhaps talk about what 1/0 would mean, infinitesimals, and perhaps if he's really inspired, limits etc.

Science: Teach him basic circuits. My dad was an electrical engineer, and I spent many car rides with him doing problems like ""If the voltage is 10 Volts and the resistance is 5 Ohms, what's the current?"" which not only helped me in EE classes in college later, but was also really useful for algebra. Again, if you don't want to go into the math, it's cool to understand how electrons are zooming around in wires and how they can be used to do stuff like make light or power cell phones, etc.

Language: teach him about Proto Indo European and this [chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEuropeanTree.svg). The fact that so many languages may have all stemmed from some historic unknown language blew my mind. Plus, it's cool to see a bunch of different words all related to each other.

Well you ignore the second part of that point, which is that part of self defense is your ability to convince others to help defend your rights.  But I don't believe in the concept of ""rights"" as it's commonly used in politics, because typically the statist will claim the rights are either derived from some non-existent entity like Government or God, or at best try to back them up with a logic-based argument similar to Hans Hoppe's ""self ownership"" claim (which I'm currently grappling with and undecided on).

So rights don't exist like a chair or a shoe does, they're just a customary mode of behavior.

&gt;Gay people have been successful at gaining popular support in recent years, but you ignore that one way the gay movement did this was through the successful deployment of political power via government.

I disagree with this point, and I'm not sure you can back up your claim.  Basically your claim has to be something along the lines of:  ""The people inside government are generally more sympathetic of gays than the people outside government, even though the people outside government select the people inside government.""

Your claim against the marketplace not protecting gay rights is also lacking evidence.  Markets cater to consumer desires.  Gays have a variety of goods/services that are produced specifically for them.  Gay people are also capable of buying guns and protecting themselves, assuming they choose to do so.

&gt;True. But there's no reason why this will always be the case. Trendlines are moving in the direction of federal recognition as we stand.

Gay rights have existed in previous societies, to a much greater degree than they do today.  Regression in this area is very possible, especially in the event of a total economic collapse (as I expect will occur in the US and Europe very soon).

* eddie shore was toughest, meanest guy to ever play the sport. he is a 'titan' in that he preceded the gods we are more familiar with.

* something like 80% of nhl players are canadian. the populace of canada feels that since someone cold invented the game and since queen victoria's governor (stanley) donated a $20 cup that own all rights to all things hockey in perpetuity and that anything that distracts from this claim, eg an american team winning, is an affront to god and nature. pity them. vancouver is canada's san francisco, freaks, flakes and apparently anarchists.

* real men wear black (and gold)

* the instigator rule makes a mockery of the sport and allows cheap shot pansies to get away with poor sportsmanlike conduct. it's an extra penalty for the first guy to drop the gloves, thus scum like ulf and cooke and and and most europeans (not on the bruins) don't worry about being regularly beaten to a pulp, as they should be.

I'm not a min-maxer - but I live with one. So this is one of his builds.
Pathfinder is supposed to be 3.5 compatible, so he took advantage of that, using aspects from  pathfinder to enhance some things from 3.5 (and no, not the most broken aspects, just the ones that seemed awesome but some-what reasonable.)

Okay so it's a scout/ranger, (scout is a class out of the 'Complete Scoundrel"" 3.5 book - The ranger part was originally the variant from the same book, which gets extra feats instead of spells) whose abilities stack when you use the ""swift hunter"" feat (Also from the Complete Scoundrel)

It uses skirmish damage (which are the bonus damage dice you get after moving in a round), precision damage, and many shot (as well as 'greater many shot') to make heavy hits from within his 30 foot range, but still stay just out of touch of the enemy. If you think you'll get as far as 9th, this build uses the 'retraining' mechanic (which is in pathfinder, as well as 3.5) to change feats which has more purpose when the character was lower level, into more advantageous and streamlined, feat combinations.

The key thing is the ""Swift Hunter"" Feat... and many shot, if you get that far.

Okay, I know there may be a few more feats in there - but he has them written all over the place, and it'll give you some room to customize.

Default is equally bad for Greece as accepting the loans. On the one hand accepting the bail out means drastic cuts in everything for the next decade plus. Defaulting also means drastic cuts to everything, inflation soaring, wages dropping and the entire EU banking system crumbling down.

IF the rest of the EU was in decent shape, I would say that probably defaulting would be the lesser of 2 evils, since a debased drachma would spur growth in Greece and their services become competitive in the EU. However, defaulting now would most certainly cripple the entire EU financial sector (and with it China possibly the US also, as well as the UK). 

Iceland had the advantage that they weren't as integrated as Greece, and of being very small ($200 billion debt defaulted on) Greece is heading to more than $350 billion, and Italy is more than $1 trillion.

However, in our current political climate the bailouts will not be able to be pushed through congress and we could slide into a new recession. The Occupiers will be blamed for it (even though it was inevitable) and they will be violently evicted by some other ""grassroots"" organizations.

Things will continue down hill from there, with Greece declaring bankruptcy and breaking away from the EU. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland wills soon follow. This will result in a severe economic backlash *on top* of the recession, causing us to slip farther into depression. This will happen by spring.

As the economy collapses, we'll see a revival of the Arab Spring, and this time there won't be any way to contain it. It will spread all across Africa and the Middle East, causing a sharp rise in the price of oil. As oil prices soar NATO will probably start intervening in Saudi Arabia, and that entire region will basically implode in war. The nations will start picking sides, and with most of the world's powerful nations involved we'll be facing World War III.

The war will drag on for many years, claiming millions of lives and destroying country after country. Combined with climate change, peak production, over population, ocean acidification, over-fishing, and deforestation will lead to mass extinction on a global scale. The oceans will fill with bacteria slime, the land will dry up and erode away, the ice caps will melt away, and well end up in a run-away cycle that completely destroys our current environment.

In its death throws the governments of the world will launch the nuclear arsenal in a last-ditch attempt to win. This, of course, will result in mutually assured destruction thus wiping out the majority of mankind from the face of the Earth. A nuclear winter will set in and lead into a new ice age that will last a few million years. Humanity will either die out or persist underground.

If you'd even looked at the bailout package, 50% of the debt is being instantly wiped off. 50%! Oh but apparently that's not enough. What should we do then? Just say ""oh sorry Greece, you screwed up, but we'll pay the costs""? Fuck that. The Greek people weren't complaining when their government threw them a party - a government *they* elected. In case you haven't noticed, the entire world is suffering from crisis. My generation is going to be paying for bail-outs for years to come. Why the fuck should Greece be any different?

Why should the Greek people be burdened by debt? Because we don't live in some fantasy world where it's acceptable to fuck over the entirety of Europe just because you want to retire at 61 and live a lazy life. What do you think should happen? Should the Germans, who retire at 68, just pay for all of Greece's debt and let them carry on living their lazy lives until they incur another massive debt crisis in 10 years time?

I'm genuinely astounded that you think it's right for the Greeks to get a free ride on this one. The Germans didn't give their people a referendum on the bail out - you know why? Because they knew the answer would be 'no' and they knew that the bail-out was the best thing for Europe. Greece wanted to be a part of the EU, and they wanted to be a part of the Euro - nobody forced them into that. Now that they're threatening to ruin it for everyone else, they need to shoulder their responsibilities. The bail-out package isn't remotely fair on countries like Germany, and is a massive favour to Greece and it's frankly disgusting that they're now set to reject it.

Also fuck you for this paragraph. 
&gt;The truth is that you don't want the Greek people to dismiss their debt because it will have a negative impact upon you. Your point of view is borne of selfish desire to maintain your own standard of living. You want them to be debt serfs so that your life isn't disturbed.

Sarkozy is scared to death of Greece telling non-Greek debtors to pound sand. He's scared to death of a default of such proportions. France's AAA rating is hanging by a thread and he knows it. Further, French bank exposure to Greek debt means that a disorderly and full default means that recapitalization of French banks will be required, and this will shove France's sovereign debt over the cliff and their pristine AAA rating into the past. It throws the entire EFSF scheme into question because it wholly relies upon a AAA rating of France. Once that goes the whole thing goes.

Merkel is scared but less so. Germany is wholly prepared for a monetary union breakup and will simply convert back to the DM should the currency union fail. It's not their preferred route, but they will only suffer to the extent that the rest of Europe suffers while still maintaining top-dog status.

Even further than that, it's not just about Greece. Whatever Greece does leads the way for Portugal, then Ireland, then Spain and finally with Italy. Whatever Greece gets will be summarily demanded by the other 4 PIIGS. This is an apocalyptic scenario that is simply unacceptable from a Eurocentric POV. The union must remain! We must pull out all the stops!

No matter what is decided by the rest of the EU, Greece has little to lose. They truly hold all the cards because everything else depends upon them going along with the plan. Greece's economy is in a death-spiral. The alternative to default is debt-slavery and a long, drawn-out economic malaise. A reset of their debt, while immediately a chaotic and problematic issue, is better for them in the long-term compared to the current scheme.

Back at home, Papandreou has little to lose. He's already got his back against a wall. What he's done is pit the people against his rivals. If his rivals move to remove him, dissolve his government and prevent a referendum, the people will turn their ire on them. His rivals must allow him to go forth lest they become the bad guys. He is in full control here. He is playing everyone against one another and he will maintain his leadership.

Further, the only thing worse from a Eurocentric POV than a popular referendum is a dissolution of the Greek government and elections held months from now. It would destroy everything they think they've accomplished.

That's why they called the referendum. It's binding (Greece has constitutional provisions on what referendums can be held and as long as there's 40% or 50% turnout it's binding - they've only ever had 1 other referendum to get rid of the monarchy).

If they vote ""yes"" he's hoping that unrest would settle down as the public obviously wants it. If they vote ""no"" well then the shit's going to hit the fan.

I think that despite the unrest, it's still a 50-50 vote. A lot of people realize the alternative is total chaos. Even the opposition parties realize this, which is why they want elections not a referendum.

No political party is seriously considering default I don't think. As long as PASOK has a parliamentary majority, the opposition can vote against austerity measures knowing that they will pass anyway and they get political brownie points. Now, they have to put their money where their mouth is and tell people to either vote yes or no - the worst possible situation for any political party.

In essence, he's made it a black and white issue, and forced the other parties to play ball rather than oppose it from the safety of their minority positions. 

This is the reason the opposition wants elections, because they can gain power, and still continue what was started under the guise that it's a one way street.

It's a very dangerous game, but the social situation is reaching critical point and something needs to give. He's banking on the people to vote ""yes"" and the opposition to oppose any default as well. 

Possibly, and this is a long shot, he's also banking on the situation getting so desperate so as to prompt some other action from the EU. Italy certainly now has more impetus to press ahead crucial reforms. The private sector also, now faced with a 100% loss (plus a lot more if CDSs are triggered) may agree to more than their current 50% ""haircut"" or agree to swap short term bonds for long term ones. 

One thing is certain. This is possibly the ultimate game of brinkmanship. He's not only put Greece on the line, but the entire European (some would say global) recovery.

I was referring specifically to the various social systems in those countries which create dependency and engender ignorance. The people simply become greedy and vote for whoever promises to give them rainbow-shitting unicorns. It creates an environment in which people vote based upon their feeling of entitlement.

You are correct that all countries are mixed-economies and are neither purely socialist nor purely capitalist.

&gt;All the power in a nation is with the people who control the money. In that sense, socialism is barely alive and well at all.

I would disagree. It's alive and well for those who control the money. It's amazing how a system can become corrupted, is it not?

But hey, ""if only"" we could put the right people in charge, right?

&gt;Besides, the most stable societies on the planet today are the social democracies - with Sweden leading the ranking. Not at all coincidentally, the nation with the greatest social equality on the planet? Sweden.

Sweden's stability and social equality are wholly made possible by its unique position in regards to its natural resources. Its social-democracy works because it is small and is fortunate in regards to its land's wealth.

&gt;It's bloody rich to blame socialism for this issue, when it is rooted completely in the asinine, warped, dysfunctional way we apportion resources today, namely money and profit.

Money and profit are not the problem. False currencies which reward those at the top and punish those at the bottom are the central problem.

&gt;Furthermore, this current peak in the on-going crisis was started by the US selling its government to the highest bidder overtly and deregulating the financial markets.

The US is not wholly to blame. The EU is just as culpable. Both the US and EU played the game of taking on debt in bad times and not paying it off in good times. Everyone is guilty.

I will, however, wholly admit that piecemeal deregulation in a heavily-regulated environment is asinine and played a large role in this whole mess.

&gt;There's now a 1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble or something along those lines in addition to the fact that humanity is having a crisis because it owes itself too much money.

No, it owes itself too much fake currency. The unsound currency is the primary driver and creator of the debt levels we now see. It is all an illusion backed by nothing more than faith. It doesn't exist if we don't agree it exists. ;)

&gt;Socialism or not has nothing to do with it.

Socialist social policies have everything to do with it. People bought into the idea that government could solve all their problems. They stopped paying attention to details and instead began listening to trite soundbites, silly slogans and fake promises of utopia.

The people are ignorant because their leaders told them to be, and they did so because they wanted to believe the lie that government can create wealth and guide an economy to the promised land.

&gt;This is a crisis in the money system. 

On this you are correct, but understand it's currency, not money.

&gt;It's a crisis in the money system that has no real connection with real world reasons, either - it's a consequence of letting type A personalities with the maturity of 12-year-olds in the ""financial sector"" one-up each other until we've come to this point.

The educated Christians I knew in Europe didn't seem to believe in hell *literally*, but took it more so as a *metaphor*. They recognized the absurdity of Biblical claims, so they interpreted them as something more sensible. Example:

* There isn't an actual devil, it's a metaphor for the evil parts of yourself.

* There isn't an actual hell, it's a mental state you end up in if you give in to evil.

* God wants you to stay away from evil, and come to ""him"". But free will is such an important principle that he can't force you to *not* end up in a bad mental state. You have to make your own decision.

Such Christians take *everything* as a metaphor. That makes it harder to debate religion with them, because what they believe is so entirely fluid and adaptable. But as far as it works, it's actually a good thing; when they encounter evidence, they're often willing to adapt their faith instead of denying the evidence.

The success of capitalism and industrialization in wildly different cultures: East Asia, India, and parts of the Middle East, and the success of industrialization sans capitalism in the Soviet Union seem to indicate that ideology and culture did not play a huge role in the ability of a nation to industrially develop which is overwhelming (of controllable factors) what determines military power and national wealth.

The US's position in the world is mostly the result of history and geography. A nation with vast resources &amp; huge room to grow with little opposition from professional, European militaries, born right at the instance of western industrialization and protected (mostly) from the conflicts which ate up so much of the western world's industrial output—it's timing and location could not be better for a developing nation. And then, the real kicker—Europe is absolutely decimated – twice! – in a few decades, almost completely knocking out their productive capacity for a time.

Europe's wealth compared to say, Africa, is a much more complex (and necessarily much longer) story but to similar ends. If the Ottoman's would have had a bit more luck on their side—a victory in Vienna in 1529—we very well could be writing about why the Islamic world was such a predominate force over the last few centuries.

Now, I may be a bit too fatalistic in this argument so far.

Actually, that's not true. Without delving into the details (the Devil is there), the current projections still leave Greece with a 120% debt:GDP ratio in the year 2020. It is barely sustainable with the best case projection (an unlikely event).  The people will suffer and still have to pay on the debt. It does not alleviate their problems. It exacerbates them.

&gt;What should we do then?

Reject all the debt. Every single penny. Reset. Start over.

&gt;Because we don't live in some fantasy world where it's acceptable to fuck over the entirety of Europe just because you want to retire at 61 and live a lazy life.

You think they'll be able to do that if they reject the debt? No fucking way.

Further, Europe bears responsibility for allowing it to occur in the first place. The Greeks did not do this wholly on their own. Everyone was greedy. EVERYONE.

&gt;Should the Germans, who retire at 68, just pay for all of Greece's debt and let them carry on living their lazy lives until they incur another massive debt crisis in 10 years time?

The only way they'll incur such a debt again is if someone is once again stupid and greedy enough to buy that debt.

&gt;I'm genuinely astounded that you think it's right for the Greeks to get a free ride on this one.

Rejection of the debt will not entail a free ride by any means. Who's living in a fantasy world? They'll have to start all over again from scratch.

&gt;Because they knew the answer would be 'no' and they knew that the bail-out was the best thing for Europe.

Oh that's right. The ""elites"" who created this whole mess know better. Get real.

&gt;The bail-out package isn't remotely fair on countries like Germany, and is a massive favour to Greece and it's frankly disgusting that they're now set to reject it.

Oh please. Germany wants it as much as anyone.

The bailouts are not a ""favor."" They are a burden. They require the Greek people suffer while everyone else is OK. That's insane.

Allow me to note that my perspective of the exact same sets of data as you just related leads me to conclude exactly the opposite of what you appear to be concluding.

* Soviet Russia was in fact very industrialized, but their overall productivity compared to the US was quite abysmal.

* As China is increasing in economic productivity it is slowly-and-inexorably becoming more liberal and humanistic. That's not to say that it is *sufficiently* these things; but that year-over-year it's becoming so.

* The areas of India which are most productive are also those areas where the greatest amount of individual self-definition exists; and concommittantly ideals of secular humanism such as women's suffrage are more common there. 

Etc., etc..

&gt; And then, the real kicker—Europe is absolutely decimated – twice! – in a few decades, almost completely knocking out their productive capacity for a time.

I assume you're referring to WWI &amp; WWII. In which case I can only say that these are what you call statistical outliers; datapoints you drop from a set when graphing the line.  Even if we *do* consider them -- even *with* those devestations -- WWI&amp;II-Europe never fell to the levels that, say, India or Africa was at *at the same time*. And it retained its overall levels of ""Enlightenment values"".

The Safari is the FIRST and ONLY Indian SUV to be tested and certified as per 74/297/EEC (European Regulation) with regard to the protection of the driver and the front passenger in the event of a full frontal collision.

Your fav site, team-bhp says this in their discussions on SUV safety often.

Endeavour/Everest I could not find any data on. However, pickup trucks are generally prone to toppling over. Also, the body on chassis (ladder frame) construction - in some cases mean that they are not the safest. However, it all varies car by car, so impossible to say clearly. What we know for certain is that American crash safety standards are extremely stringent, and if the vehicle is sold there, it usually is much much safer than anywhere else.

Mahindra XUV500 has a monocoque construction, which is done right, can be safer than the body on ladder route anyday. The question is, is it done right or not. At this point, we can only speculate, so let us try that.

XUV is shorter, so will be less prone to tipping over. That said, the Endeavour might be much safer when it actually tips over. But we have no data, so let us call it even there.

Excerpt from Wiki about ranger: The Ford Ranger was the first small pickup to introduce dual air bags as safety features.[citation needed] It received an ""acceptable"" frontal crash test rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety when they were first tested in 1998, while many of its competitors received ""marginal"" or ""poor"" ratings at that time. The exception was the Toyota Tacoma, which also got an ""acceptable"" rating.[11][12]

The 2010 model year brought the addition of front seat combination head and torso airbags to improve passenger safety in a side-impact collision and earned Good rating through the Insurance Institute For Highway Safety's Side Impact Test. Also Electronic Stability Control was added for the 2010 Models as Standard Equipment.[13]

In the Roof Strength Test conducted by Insurance Institute For Highway Safety, the Ford Ranger earned an Acceptable rating.[14]

---- all this is about different variants, so I am not drawing many conclusions from that.

dwsAuto.com loves Mahindra, and Mahindra loves us back. However, I am not dwsAuto - I am here in my personal capacity, and I have opinions and guesses which, OMG, could be sometimes not based on full data!

And again, we have seen some videos of XUV50 crash tests. They were not forthcoming about where they were conducted, and that is understandable. It HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY SAFETY CERTIFICATION YET. That is for sure. The company is working towards it, and will get it - I think - after some reinforcing of the chassis to meet European and US standards.

About team-bhp - I have been a member of team-bhp for a decade. I generally express my dislike of our links appearing there if at all. That is because I am in team-bhp as an enthusiast, and so are the rest of our team. dwsAuto articles are for the lay reader. We have never been warned, and some of us actually know team-bhp mods quite well.

So you can take your ridiculous warnings and shove it. No need to get this worked up, as you don't have a clue about XUV safety, and neither do I. Till both the vehicles we are talking about are tested and receive their ratings, we won't know. So till then, everything I say is my guess, and everything you say is your guess.

**End of the day, you are who you are and what you like will be perfect. Typical right winger. End of the day I am who I am, and what I like need not be perfect. I like the XUV, been recommending it to many, and don't advice people to buy the Endy or Safari at all. For those with safety worries, I tell them to wait if they want to be sure. **

Also the due date might change with new US done in the first trimester. Don't get irritated by this, it's only an estimate. Second, you suspect your gf to may have been with another guy. You should evaluate your relationship together and either drop these suspicions fast and completely (I think they are highly toxic for any relationship) or work with your girlfriend how to rebuild your trust to her (you both have to work on that). Lastly you not being able to understand all her doctor tells you is an issue that is best tackled by asking (maybe even asking in english) more questions, not less.

No, you're making the assumption that the rest of Europe has to pay that debt. That debt is owed to **banks**. Why must the banks be bailed out?

&gt;You realise that would destroy the Euro, and that that would bring down all of Europe's economies, and, guess what, would have pretty bad consequences for the rest of the world too?

Those economies are going down anyway. These last three years were not a recovery. They were a last ditch effort to save a dying system based upon ever-growing debt and consumption fueled by that debt.

You want to keep the system going because you falsely and erroneously believe that it will somehow be better. It won't. It's far worse than simply starting over.

You are giving in to fear. You are fearful of starting over. You think there is nothing worse. I beg you to believe you are wrong.

&gt;Sure, everyone was greedy, but Greece was particularly so.

Some PIIGS are more equal, amirite?

&gt;That's why they're in this fucking mess - it's not that they've been turned into everyone else's whipping boy, it's that they were so greedy and so irresponsible that this whole situation has come about.

Who enabled them?

&gt;Yes, everyone wants this bail out to happen, because if it doesn't then everyone will be dragged under.

You make the false assumption that the bailout is going to solve everything. It won't.

&gt;That's not selfish, that's just common sense.

Sure it's selfish. You don't want your standard of living to drop. Newsflash: It's going to anyway. The only question is how it happens and where we stand in the end.

&gt;Greece was greedier and more irresponsible than any other country, and they need to make it right.

I would say Germany was greediest. They benefited most from the EMU and want to maintain that dominance.

&gt;Rejecting the debt simply isn't an option - this isn't Argentina.

Why not? Do you think people shouldn't be able to declare bankruptcy and start anew?

Are you aware of debt jubilees? Do you think debt is a moral obligation?

&gt;The Euro would be completely destroyed - why the fuck should 12 other countries be dragged into ruin because one country couldn't at least have a small semblance of fiscal responsibility?

Those 12 countries allowed this situation to occur through their own errors and malfeasance. They bear an equal burden of blame. They are not innocent victims.

Last year, I spent few weeks traveling by myself in Europe after my study abroad ended. On one of my last days, I was watching the World Cup final in the bar below my hostel in Paris. I didn't know anyone there, and ended up sitting with two guys from the hostel. One of them I had briefly met a few days before, but the other guy (Francis) ...well, I was completely struck by him from the first moment.

I thought he was a local at first, because he kept talking with the older couple next to us in French, but he was actually from Quebec and just beginning his trip backpacking around Europe. After the game, we went out and bought a cheap bottle of wine and sat by the river for hours talking. His English was only so-so, but we were able to communicate pretty well. Francis and I agreed to meet up the next morning at breakfast to spend the day together (...Along with the other guy! Alas!) That day itself was uneventful in regards to this story—I was leaving the following morning and knew I probably would never see him again, so I was accepting that there would never be anything between us.

However, that evening the three of us had planned to have dinner together. As I was leaving the hostel, Francis stopped me to let me know that it turned out to be a seafood restaurant. I don't like seafood whatsoever and he had gotten food poisoning from fish recently...so we found our friend (who had already sat and ordered), apologized, and promised to meet up later. ...This never happened.

Instead, Francis and I bought some cheap ready-made food at a grocery store. He bought a bottle of wine, and I begged some silverware off the bar. We walked down to a park by the river and had a picnic. In Paris, the sun doesn't fully set until 10–11PM in July. We stayed out talking, watching the sunset, and then watching the stars for hours. At some point, there was a pause in the conversation, and we just held each other's gaze until he leaned forward and kissed me. Ultimately we were in the park until 2AM, when some cops told us it was closed and we had to leave. We moved to a courtyard near the hostel, staying until 5AM. I had a flight at 8 or 9 in the morning, and hadn't even packed yet...so suffice to say, I did not sleep at all that night.

We exchanged Facebook information, and after that messaged back and forth regularly. Francis wanted to have someone to talk to about his trip who was just as passionate about travel as he was, and I wanted to live vicariously through him because he was going to all the places I didn't have a chance to see. Oh, and the occasional flirtation—although things devolved into more of a friendship.

Months later, somehow we decided to meet up and travel Southeast Asia together the next summer. We agreed that if we ended up getting sick of each other (as often happens when traveling with someone; it's a relationship and friendship killer) we would just part ways amicably. There wasn't a significant friendship there, so we could kill it without too many regrets.

Fortunately, this wasn't the case. 70 days, 24 hours a day, constantly within 20 feet of one another. For the first week it was purely in the friends zone, but our relationship developed as we became comfortable with one another. I don't think I ever could have done that trip with anyone else I know. We never fought, never got annoyed with, never got mad at each other. We saw each other's highs and lows, went through some truly stressful situations, and still just grew closer every day. I cried when we said goodbye at the airport.

A month later, I took a train up to Montreal to visit him for a week. A month after that, Francis came here. We talk constantly. We haven't defined our relationship, and I don't know what this is, to be honest. There's very little chance we can ever truly be together, at least not for many years.

Earlier when we were messaging, he wrote (translated to English): ""I'm writing this in French so that you don't know how much I love you and how much you mean to me. I think it's better that way.""

That's the first time either one of us has said ""I love you,"" and he doesn't even know I know.

No, I'm not. The people that might have benefited from a German victory are the ones that ended up suffering most from the Soviet victory. Alas, Germans often were pretty goddamn shitty towards the people that had the highest hopes for them (see: Ukrainians, Cossacks) so the group is relatively small compared to those who were doomed to suffer regardless of who won.

&gt; You naive little... -- good thing most Finns aren't like you.

Don't get your panties in a bunch, I'm not cheering for a Nazi victory by any means. I just pointed out that it's a worthwhile intellectual exercise to avoid thinking of wars as purely black and white. WW2 was many things, but black and white it was not. Or if one of the main players was wearing shining white armor, I'd like you to tell me who the fuck it was.

England and the US come closest, which is to say:     
1) The greatest Empire in the world that effectively ruled the planet that refused to countenance anyone else rising in its stead (England could have allowed German expansion, but chose not to)       
2) A continental Empire grown of age that preferred the devil it knew (Great Britain) to the devil it didn't (a German controlled Europe), struck down an uppity new Empire (Japan) with barely disguised racist contempt and exploited the weakness of the current incumbent Empire to build its own informal Empire.

What would the world look like now had Germany won? Would it be dramatically different? How? I certainly can't imagine fascism having survived even as long as communism did - it's just not a really maintainable system of governance and Hitler didn't have *that* much time left in him. What would have happened on Hitlers death? What about when the war was over and the German people were enjoying the spoils *and not really needing NSDAP anymore*? Would they have gone the way of China, or would there have been a genuine revolution?

Yes, some people would have been murdered and that's terrible. Still, I'm not quite clear what the difference is between Stalin murdering X million people for who they are and Hitler murdering X million people for who they are.

* The EU is very undemocratic, it takes too much power away from the citizens. 

* The laws are bent to suit political aims rather than sticking to the rule of law, or rule of treaty (see 3% budget deficit limits) 

* Several countries used creative accounting to get in to the eurozone and are now crying because they squandered billions and did not reform their own markets to be more competitve (see Club Med countries)

* Pathetic economic protectionism, mainly by the French but there are others as well, where Danone is cited as a strategic industry. 

* CAP - this is so wrong I don't know where to begin.

* The absurd migration from Brussells to Strasbourg of the Eu parliament only to keep the French happy. What a waste of 250 million.

The EU I would like to be a part of would offer something more than corrupt MEPs and inept bureaucrats in Brussells. Yes, the Uk has its problems but none of them will be solved by joining the eurozone or further integrating with the EU.

If there is more Greek import than export, then the Drachme will decrease in value because they're exchanging them for goods more often than they want them back. This will mean Greek goods are cheaper, so people buy more Greek products, even if they're lower quality. If your country can't compete internationally, your economy benefits from being separated by a currency barrier.

If you have the same currency, then suddenly Greek products can be compared with German products on the same level, and can't become cheaper in Germany without being sold for less in Greece. The Greek market couldn't compete with the Germans, so Greek consumers bought German goods. This means Greek companies can't sell as much and have to sell their goods for less than they did before in order to compete with the Germans, so Greece enters a recession relative to Europe. This unfortunately coincides with the international recession, causing the Greek economy to collapse. When the Greek economy has stabilised the corporations that survive can compete with the European economy on equal footing.",True,16,,False,16,0,0,t1_c2wdknf

You do realize that from an Eastern European perspective, the US and UK were countries that happened elsewhere. The war was between the Nazi and Soviet Empires. So like... which one of those are you talking about here?

&gt;  What about their plans to work the 'untermensch' in the east to death in slave labour? What about the fact that they began a war of aggression which caused tens of millions of deaths? 

Still quite unclear which one you're talking about. (Yes, I know who *you* are talking about, but that's probably because for you history was taught from a very Western perspective)

&gt; I fail to see any advantages that a violent and barbarous regime like Nazi Germany's could possibly provide to outweigh the vast, vast amount of harm and suffering they wished to inflict on everyone who did not fit within their extremely narrow view of the world.

Again, the Soviets were hardly better, and they were the ones that in many ways won the war. Before the war 'the West' was actually bigger than it was after the war, where as the USSRs sphere of influence was decidedly larger and it had consumed nearly 100 million people.

&gt; You mean for Germans, and maybe a select few nations deemed racially pure enough.

Hard to say, especially in the longer term. In the short term obviously Germany's allies would have benefited. In the longer term I suspect Fascism would have gone away faster than communism did, though that is obviously impossible to prove one way or another.

Like I said, in Eastern Europe it was Stalin v. Hitler, which is pretty much terror v. terror. Once you acknowledge that it's all going to suck anyway, the next questions are:    
How bad, for how many and for how long?     

I suspect German victory would have been better for #2 (how many) and #3 (how long), though I suspect it might have been a bit worse in #1 (how bad). I'd be curious to hear of your opinion on this.

Of course there *are* areas liberated by the Western allies: France, Netherlands, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. The question regarding those is:

What *would* have happened with them had Germany won against the Soviet Union? I certainly imagine there could have been a peace treaty drawn where Hitler - who always did pretty much what he had written down, though people always seemed to ignore his writings - gave up his Western holdings (who he always had claimed were peers anyway) to keep his Eastern holdings (most critically, the vast plains of Russia). 

In such a case the situation would have been pretty damn identical to what ended up happening anyway:     
Cold War in Europe with France/US/UK on one side and a powerful totalitarian country on the other. The border would have shifted left a little bit, but on the other hand the ideological schism wouldn't have gone too far.

Basically, each of the Elder Scrolls games explores a different province with the one exception of *Elder Scrolls: Arena,* which included the entirety of Tamriel.

Skyrim is the province of Tamriel most analogous to Northern Europe, which has given rise to the natives of Skyrim being called ""Nords"" as well as a very unique visual style reminiscent of Scandinavian landscapes, weaponry, armor, and architecture.

The Nords are not the only residents of Skyrim, however. There are many other sentient beings that inhabit Tamriel. Playable in Skyrim are the races of Man: Bretons, Imperials, Redguards and Nords; Mer: High Elves, Wood Elves, Orcs and Dark Elves and ""Beasts"": Argonians (Lizard People) and Khajiti (Feline-esque beings).

In the past few games, the combat gameplay has been centered around three different approaches: stealth, melee, and magic. These could be mixed and matched to the users preference, and could be effectively used in concert in the previous game, *Oblivion.* For example: Fire a poisoned arrow at an enemy, so that they take damage from the poison and extra damage from the sneak attack. As the enemy draws closer, hit them with a few projectile spells or strengthen your defenses with magic. When they are in range, finish them off with your sword and then voila!

&gt;One of the most troublesome questions about Utopia is Thomas More's reason for writing it.

&gt;Most scholars see it as some kind of comment or criticism of contemporary European society, for the evils of More's day are laid out in Book I and in many ways apparently solved in Book II.[5] Indeed, Utopia has many of the characteristics of satire, and there are many jokes and satirical asides such as how honest people are in Europe, but these are usually contrasted with the simple, uncomplicated society of the Utopians.

&gt;Yet, the puzzle is that, some of the practices and institutions of the Utopians, such as the ease of divorce, euthanasia and both married priests and female priests, seem to be polar opposites of More's beliefs and the teachings of the Catholic Church of which he was a devout member. Another often cited apparent contradiction is that of the religious toleration of Utopia contrasted with his persecution of Protestants as Lord Chancellor. Similarly, the criticism of lawyers comes from a writer who, as Lord Chancellor, was arguably the most influential lawyer in England. However, it can be answered that as a pagan society Utopians had the best ethics that could be reached through reason alone, or that More changed from his early life to his later when he was Lord Chancellor.[6]

&gt;One highly influential interpretation of Utopia is that of Quentin Skinner.[7] He has argued that More was taking part in the Renaissance humanist debate over true nobility, and that he was writing to prove the perfect commonwealth could not occur with private property. Crucially, he sees Hythloday as embodying the Platonic view that philosophers should not get involved in politics and the character of More as the more pragmatic Ciceronic view; thus the society Hythoday proposes is the ideal More would want, but without communism, which he saw no possiblity of occuring, it was wiser to take a more pragmatic view. Utopia is thus More's ideal, but an unobtainable one, explaining why there are inconsistencies between the ideas in Utopia and More's practice in the real world.

&gt; Further evidence can be cited to show that More intended for us to see Utopia as genuinely his ideal society. The method of making a story about an imaginary place told by an imaginary man has the effect of distancing More from his radical political thoughts. Apart from Utopia, meaning ""Noplace,"" several other lands are mentioned: Achora meaning ""Nolandia"", Polyleritae meaning ""Muchnonsense"", Macarenses meaning ""Happiland,"" and the river Anydrus meaning ""Nowater"". These names are designed to emphasise the illusory nature of the work and Raphael's last name, Hythlodaeus meaning ""dispenser of nonsense"" helps to discredit his words among those who get the joke.

&gt; The name Raphael, though, may have been chosen by More to remind his readers of the archangel Raphael who is mentioned in the Book of Tobit. In that book the angel guides Tobias and later cures his father of his blindness. While Hythloday may suggest his words are not to be trusted, Raphael meaning ""God has healed"" suggests that Raphael may be opening the eyes of the reader to what is true. The suggestion that More may have agreed with the views of Raphael is given weight by the way he dressed; with ""his cloak was hanging carelessly about him""; a style which Roger Ascham reports that More himself was wont to adopt. Furthermore, more recent criticism has questioned the reliability of both Gile's annotations and the character of ""More"" in the text itself.

You're delusional. The reason we face fewer external threats is because of US spending and sadly, some of their external wars of agression (e.g. Afghanistan, not Iraq).

Putin for one would probably be quite happy to invade parts of the former soviet bloc given half a chance and in the longer term who knows what China will do. There may well be a clash of civilisations at some point.

&gt;Yes there will be pain for the middle classes but as other countries in similar situations have shown, it may resolve itself quicker than most 

Maybe but it all depends on your priorities. If your priorities are independence and maintaining state wealth, you might be willing to sacrifice your short term happiness for that. After all if you arent independent and if you sell out everything, you are just moving the problem further down the future. What will happen in 2020 when Greece will have 120% debt with most of the state wealth sold for scraps?

We will still be greatly indebted and we will have no wealth. What makes you think that will be better for us? Most people think that we get money for free while in fact we dont get money for free, we get loans. 

And you might say ""what about the 50% haircut""? That haircut doesnt affect most of our loans. If anything it affects mostly our retirement funds. Out of the 300billion estimated debt, it only affects like 60 billions. The debt towards the european central bank and imf isnt affected. So we essentially get ""30 billion for free"", many of those come from greek banks and greek retirement/healthcare funds(which were funded by the greek state anyway since we have state healthcare/pension system for the most part).

And in exchange we keep getting new loans(so we become more indebted), we sell whatever state wealth we have(harbours, airports, real estate, energy production company, etc), shitload of unemployment, crap wages, etc. The alternative would be to get out of EU, ditch euro and get a cheap currency to make Greece an attractive investement place. At the very least a very attractive vacation place. This automatically greatly increases our exports and brings in investments and jobs.

Essentially what every damn country in the world does. You have your own currency, thus you can do whatever the damn you want. You are in command of your own economical policy. You want to increase exports, you drop the value of your currency. And with protectionism, you can still maintain low prices on basic goods(like food).",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2wdy0f

&gt;Like other key thinkers during the European Enlightenment, Voltaire considered himself a deist, expressing the idea: ""What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.""
 &gt;
&gt;As for religious texts, Voltaire's opinion of the Bible was mixed. Although influenced by Socinian works such as the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum, Voltaire's skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical-political writers like John Locke.
&gt; 
&gt;This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Catholic Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire's death, saying, ""The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket....""

J.T. Ready

Date of Birth:  1973
Location:  Mesa, AZ
Ideology:  Neo-Nazi
J.T. (Jason Todd) Ready, a former member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement, specializes in bashing immigrants. After being court-martialed twice, Ready was discharged from the Marines for bad conduct in 1996. Ready, who has run for various Arizona offices usually without success, advocates for the placement of landmines on the border and rails against Jews and nonwhites. In June 2010, Ready led a group of armed extremists into the Arizona desert to apprehend immigrants and drug smugglers.

Criminal History
In 1992, Ready was arrested for damage to property and aggravated assault with a weapon. He accepted a plea bargain and was convicted of assault. Ready had been with a friend who destroyed a car mirror with a baseball bat. 

In 1996, while serving in the Marine Corps as a lance corporal, Ready was court-martialed twice. The first time, after being absent for eight days without authorization, he was convicted of unauthorized absence, failing to follow an order or regulation, and larceny and wrongful appropriation. He was convicted, demoted to private and jailed for three months. Later that year, Ready was court-martialed again for conspiracy, assault, and wrongful solicitation and advice. He was found guilty, spent six months in detention, and was discharged from the Marine Corps for bad conduct.

In 2007, Ready was pulled over for driving a vehicle with a fake license plate. He was carrying a 9mm Beretta handgun at the time. Ready was arrested and charged for possessing a traffic preemption emitter, which is an illegal device that can change traffic lights from red to green.

In His Own Words 
“This is a white, European homeland. That’s how it should be preserved if we want to keep it clean, safe, and pure.” 
— Ready speaking at a National Socialist Movement rally in Oct. 24, 2009

“The jew [sic] itself knows it is a parasite. I have had them admit as much to me and laugh in my face… But a parasite cannot carry on in its parasitic nature if it is exposed for what it really is. Their whole house of cards comes tumbling down for all to see. Like in 1933 Germany. Just because it has two legs, does not change its nature any less than a six-legged parasite stops sucking blood. There have been many pogroms when the host people stops being victims of these vampires. Another pogrom is approaching.”
— New Saxon blog posting, May 8, 2010

“This is the minuteman project on steroids. We’ve got people with assault weapons. We will use lawful, deadly force when appropriate.”
— KOLD News 13, June 21, 2010

Background
J.T. (Jason Todd) Ready attended Mesa Community College in Mesa, Ariz., where he was the president of the Mesa Community College Republican Club. In 1996, Ready joined the Marines but he was discharged that same year for bad conduct. 

In 2004, Ready tried to make a career for himself in politics, running for a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives. One of his campaign goals was to defeat the threat he claimed was posed by undocumented immigrants to American health and culture. He told a reporter that the state could improve its education system if it would “deal with this mass illegal influx of foreign students who do not even embrace the same language and culture as Americans and who spread tuberculosis, whooping cough, lice, and other third-world biological diseases to other children.” He was defeated in the election.

Ready made headlines in March 2006 when he fired a pistol at a Latino man armed with a BB gun (no criminal charges resulted from the incident). At the time, he was running for the Mesa City Council. His campaign was further derailed when, shortly after Ready volunteered to act as master of ceremonies at the Mesa Veteran’s Day parade, it came to light that he had been court-martialed and drummed out of the Marines.

In May 2006, Ready led an anti-illegal immigration group he created, Americans First, in a protest on the Mexican consulate in Phoenix. He told The Arizona Republic, “We are advocating that the government of Mexico should be designated a ‘threat nation’ because they are openly subverting our laws and sovereignty.” Running as the only candidate in a primary later that same year, Ready won a post as GOP precinct committeeman in a west Mesa district. Shortly thereafter, Ready became a prominent volunteer with the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, a border-watch group described by then-President George W. Bush as being comprised of “vigilantes.”
 
In September 2007, Ready marched under a swastika banner in Omaha, Neb., with brown-shirted members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM), a group he would later join. Ready gave a speech at the rally, where he was billed as an “Arizona Republican activist.” That same year, Ready quietly created a profile on the neo-Nazi social networking site New Saxon, run by the NSM, and appeared at the neo-Nazi National Vanguard's “Winterfest” gathering in Phoenix in December 2007. 

In 2008, these acts came to the attention of Arizona congressmen John Shadegg, Jeff Flake, and Trent Franks. In a letter addressed to the chairman of the local Republican Party, they asked that everything possible be done to expel Ready from his position as GOP precinct committeeman. However, Ready retained his office until his term ran out in 2008, though he did not seek reelection.

Rejected by the Republican Party, Ready soon found a home with his fellow neo-Nazis, joining the nearly 2,000 registered users of New Saxon as “Viking_Son.” In 2007, his New Saxon profile displayed photographs of Ready wearing a kilt and a bulletproof vest, and scouring the desert for “illegals” through a pair of binoculars. Ready listed his “turn-ons” as “a woman who loves our Race, Kultur [German for culture], Heritage, History and Future,” identified the racist fantasy novel The Turner Diaries as his favorite book, and described himself as a big fan of neo-Nazi teen pop duo Prussian Blue. 

In November 2009, Ready displayed a large portrait of Hitler at an anti-illegal immigration rally held at the state capitol building in Phoenix. When a protester attempted to take the portrait from him, Ready shoved the protester to the ground.

On June 19, 2010, Ready, now claiming he had left the NSM, took a group of heavily armed civilians into the Vekol Valley in Pinal County, Ariz., a border area noted for drug smuggling and illegal immigration. He described the action as “the Minutemen project on steroids.” Ready and about 10 other civilians, including Harry Hughes, a poster on New Saxon and NSM mailing lists, and NSM regional director Jeff Hall, armed with rifles and pistols, “secured” an abandoned building and led armed “patrols” around the desert. 

Local law enforcement agents did not welcome Ready’s assistance. Paul Babeu, the sheriff of Pinal County, said: “Though I appreciate their support and offer to take up arms and patrol, this would not be helpful, and would only cause a strain on already strained resources, and their safety needs to be a priority. I do not ask or encourage them to come here.”

That didn’t seem to crimp Ready’s style. In a June 2010 New Saxon forum post, he wrote, “I would eventually like to fund a whole plattoon [sic], full-time, against the Narco-Terrorists. This will take a group effort, however. But we will take it Direct Action against the enemy and kill them (lawfully).” On the New Saxon forums, Ready requested that his supporters donate guns, smoke grenades, and pepper spray to aid the effort.

Ready claimed to have quit the NSM on July 4, 2010. He told a reporter that he intended to concentrate on the border and his personal life. Ready said he would continue his efforts to stop ""narco-terrorism"" by leading his self-styled militia, Ready's Rangers, on patrols in Arizona's Vekol Valley. ",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2we0gq

This is not uncontroversial in the country, but I find it kind of hard that they would want to do a 180, especially now that they want to join the EU. Egypt have their own inner turmoil to deal with for the moment, the military junta would probably rather work to secure their position in the country for the time being. Syria and Hezbollah aren't really strong enough to mount a serious fight Israel, though I doubt that Israel would go to an attack alone. This could be seen in combination with the US escalation of forces close to Iran. Are we seeing the buildup to a war between an US-Israel coalition against Iran? There are certainly forces in all countries who would like this, though Iran would probably have liked to be stronger and have more allies. The only countrie that really comes to mind that I know are friendly to Iran, at least on their side in opposition to the US, is Venezuela. For them to declare war would be a stretch and a disastrous decision on their part. They have oil, though. They might stop selling to the US altogether.

When it comes to the rest of the Middle East, I'm a little unsure about how regional politics have played out in Irans favour/disfavour. Some countries might be closer to Saudi Arabia and hence be hesitant to go against one of SAs allies, or they might have direct financial ties with the US. I think Iran would be hard pressed to find a clear ally in the region and you have to be well endoved in the ball region to want to go to war with the US in the first place. I think the danger might rather be for the future, as a war with Iran might get the different peoples and countries of the region to forget their differences in opposition to the US. A more united Middle East might become a way bigger threat to the US in the future.

Pakistan, I think, are scared to defy the US. China are too smart to go to direct war with the US, though they might supply the other side, as you pointed out.

Those are some hefty myths right there. First of all, Iran has proxies which border Israel: Syria and Hezbollah. Second, Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah all have *tons* of rockets and missiles with the capability of blanketing Israel in ordnance. Sure, Israel's little ""Iron Dome"" might be able to take out a few, but they will be insanely overwhelmed. So they can sit back and just fire missiles and *still* cause more damage than Israel ever could with its air force, which can barely make it to Iran and only by violating Jordanian and Iraqi air space, the later of which will *certainly* not have any of that. The idea that Israel owns the air is laughable. They have good planes, no doubt, but in order to own the air you must get rid of any enemy air defenses, which Iran has up the wazoo. Syria also has some air defenses as well, and Israel operating over Lebanon will simply draw the Lebanese military into the fight, besides causing more civilian deaths than military deaths. Israel will take heavy losses if they try to continuously bomb Iran, plain and simple. In the end, those losses could never be worth whatever damage they might be able to cause (which wouldn't be that much). 

&gt; but from non-governmental sources.

Iran and Syria are both governmental sources, and Hezbollah is technically part of the Lebanese government.

&gt;Syria is the only state actor that is in a position to do something, but there's no way they'll challenge a completely unoccupied Israeli army by themselves - that'd be suicide, particularly in the middle of their own uprising.

You seem to think that raining ballistic missiles all over the country *isn't* doing something. That is very wrong. It's also wrong to think Syria couldn't do something against Israel, or that Israel would be completely unoccupied. They would be dealing with Hezbollah and Hamas *plenty*. And if 2006's Israel-Lebanon war is any indication, the Israeli military ain't all it's cracked up to be. They would not be able to just run over the Syrians like they did in the past, mostly because of anti-tank and anti-air missile advances since then. Syria might take the opportunity to take back the Golan Heights, which they could do because Israel would be occupied getting the shit bombed out of them and Hamas and Hezbollah (and probably all Palestinians) making life hell.

&gt;I suspect the big players of Turkey, Egypt and Saudi-Arabia would secretly be delighted, while internally and on the international stage condemning the shit out of Israel and using its actions for their own benefit.

You don't understand Saudi Arabia. They are allies of Israel and enemies of Iran. They *want* Israel to attack Iran because Iran challenges their own regional supremacy. 

&gt;The real question would be someone - Russia, China or even the EU - supplying high quality air force and air defenses to Iran. I wouldn't be too shocked of, say, the French provided some SAM systems after Israeli air raids (though I doubt the EU would give anything that could be used in an aggressive fashion).

Ridiculous. The EU wouldn't give Iran squat. And how do you not know about the S-300 SAM systems Iran already acquired?? They also have the S-200 system, as well as a number of other systems which are more than capable of dealing with both the Israeli and the US air force. I'm not saying they will shoot every plane down, but they will make it *very* difficult to operate in that air space and the US and Israel will definitely lose planes.

&gt;As long as the US stays out of it, there's a relatively low chance of a 'real' war starting.

There's no universe in which that makes sense.

&gt;Israel might get itself embargoed by a great many countries though.

Both have recreated a sizeable chunk of what the US did with Nimitz but neither are quite there. Britain lacks nuclear powered range. The French options lack raw capacity. If Britain and France co-operated we could have actually built more carriers and got parity with at least the last generation of US equivalent (the newer US carriers are even more scarier than the Nimitz).

Then there is the Eurofighter/Rafale nonsense. What a waste of time to have 2 planes with very similar capabilities. OTOH we don't have an equivalent to the F-35 nor does it seem we will have one any time soon. Again practiced integrated defence policy would have allowed us to make a Eurofigher and a carrier launchable fighter that is designed for the role rather than tacked on.

EU infrastructure is currently designed to play a supporting role to the US. We add meat to the picture but rely on the US for specialised equipment and can't take on missions like the F-22 can.

Naturally, it’s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax  in a way that it is harmonized  across many markets.  However, it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations.  Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral.  In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one.  Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.

If the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT, the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous, volatile transactions towards other markets. Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile, so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets, which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.

Naturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe.  Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading.  But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT (but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized).

As far as Sweden goes, my understanding of Sweden’s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected, they were less severely effected that less regulated markets.  Furthermore their response was more effective, created a softer landing, and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets.  Perhaps it’s not perfect to be out front with a FTT.  And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect.  But it’s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse, the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today. Perhaps, given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS, that’s not an unqualified good thing… but that’s another discussion.

And yes, there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.

lastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax.  Nor the end of speculative trading.  Nor chasing 100% of speculators out of the European market.  I’m advocating for a slight and smart readjustment of tax policy and regulation of financial markets.",True,1,ASTR,False,1,0,0,t1_c2we3zw

There are two routes to take: the technological route, and the political one.

The technological route means making software that does two things: (1) allows people to communicate privately without the authorities knowing what they're saying or even who is talking to whom, and (2) allows people to communicate publicly without the authorities being able to trace who said what.

This is what [FreedomBox](http://freedomboxfoundation.org/ FreedomBox) are doing; it's also something that's been proposed as a [policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Policy2011/comments/ltgyk/freedom_computing/) for Pirate Party UK.

Mentioning the Pirate Party takes me on to the political route. Unfortunately the USA isn't democratic enough for the Pirate Party or any other 3rd party to be successful -- the 2 big parties have established a complete lock-in over access to power. And that's itself a large part of the problem: if the two candidates are a Republican backed by corporate dollars, and a Democrat also backed by corporate dollars, it's pretty obvious that the winner will be a corporate shill.

Fortunately we're at a good time for reforming US politics. The Occupy movement have achieved prominence, and one of their arguments is that the political system is tilted towards the rich, and so we need to get money out of politics.

Pirates might not be successful in the USA, but they might be in Europe, and if they are, they are likely to put government money behind FreedomBox and similar initiatives.",True,12,,True,12,0,0,t1_c2we538

That said the referendum as described in the media is not legal. The constitution forbids referendums on fiscal matters (like in most Western countries). If Papandreou actually goes on with it, he will have to word it differently. Something like ""exit the EU"" yes or no. We cannot have a referendum that says ""do you want to pay for the loans that the government signed for"".

As far as politics go. Polls say that 70% of the people want to remain within the Euro zone. So the PM is leveraging that and he wants a referendum instead of actual elections that he would lose. His plan is to come out after the voting and say: here you have it the people are with me, go on with the plan.

About the people. There is widespread fatalism. We know that we are in deep shit and there is no easy way out. Problem is that noone has a coherent voice and a reasonable plan for the future. Our politicians quarrel about stupid shit and only care about their posts. That is true of all 5 parties that are in parliament ATM. Pasok is in the brink of dissolution, Nea Dimokratia offers just vague promises about ""other solutions"" and the communists are daydreaming of the state owning the means of production because they know they will never govern and just talk like megalomaniac 15 year olds.

Read the news much? Not only were they never allies of Israel, but they downgraded relations with them.

&gt;This is not uncontroversial in the country, but I find it kind of hard that they would want to do a 180, especially now that they want to join the EU. 

They've been pissed at Israel quite a bit recently. It wouldn't be a 180. And Israel starting a regional war for no reason is a pretty serious issue. It may not seem like a big deal to you because you're not living there, but those people will certainly feel the effects, even in non-belligerent nations. And do you *really think* Turkey wants to join the EU at *this* point?? The EU is on its last legs.

&gt;Egypt have their own inner turmoil to deal with for the moment, the military junta would probably rather work to secure their position in the country for the time being.

The military isn't the only power in charge. The Muslim Brotherhood is also quite powerful there now. While the military might be calling the shots, the people have shown that their will is not to be trifled with. They already nearly stormed the Israeli embassy, which could have caused a war right then and there. They *hate* Israel, and if the military wants to keep power it will listen to the will of the people, and that will probably land them on the side against Israel should they choose to start a new war, especially if Gaza and the West Bank are heavily involved, which they will be.

&gt;Syria and Hezbollah aren't really strong enough to mount a serious fight Israel, though I doubt that Israel would go to an attack alone.

That's just ignorant. They both have thousands of rockets and missiles and would blanket Israel in them. They don't *have* to invade Israel in order to deal serious damage. Syria is not without military power. They have closed the gap between them and the Israelis substantially. If it was just them and Israel they would surely lose, but it's not just them. Israel will be occupied with Hamas, Hezbollah, the rest of Palestine, and all of the missiles and rockets raining down on them. That will allow Syria to possibly take back the Golan Heights, that is if their insurrection problem goes away. Who knows, maybe they could still do it. Maybe the people will rally around Assad just because they hate Israel more.

&gt;The only countrie that really comes to mind that I know are friendly to Iran, at least on their side in opposition to the US, is Venezuela.

So you don't know much about the Middle East or the world, huh?

&gt; For them to declare war would be a stretch and a disastrous decision on their part. They have oil, though. They might stop selling to the US altogether.

Who says they have to declare war in order to make an oil embargo against the US?

&gt; I think Iran would be hard pressed to find a clear ally in the region and you have to be well endoved in the ball region to want to go to war with the US in the first place.

Iran and Syria have a defense pact, so no, it's actually pretty easy. The US isn't some all-powerful god of war. They're currently getting schooled in Afghanistan on why you don't try to occupy people that already hate you. The US has better command and control and stealth planes (which only give so much benefit to the plane), and that's pretty much it. Other than that, Iran has similar capabilities. They also have the ability to decimate any US carrier fleet that comes near them, so I don't think they're too worried.

&gt; I think the danger might rather be for the future, as a war with Iran might get the different peoples and countries of the region to forget their differences in opposition to the US.

Hate to break it to you, but that time is now. There's very little chance for war in another 3 years when you factor everything in. It's looking like it will be soon or never.

&gt;A more united Middle East might become a way bigger threat to the US in the future.

Only if the US continues to try to occupy it and meddle with it. If we GTFO and mind our own business they will have nothing to hate us for.

&gt;Pakistan, I think, are scared to defy the US.

That's why they've been courting the Chinese.

&gt;China are too smart to go to direct war with the US, though they might supply the other side, as you pointed out.

They have no reason to go to direct war with us. They wouldn't be able to gain that much. Making it costly for us by supply the other side would yield more benefit than the effort they would have to put in.

&gt;I would say the same goes for Russia (weren't Russia involved in providing nuclear material to Iran or some such?).

Russia has already provided plenty of air defenses to Iran, including their S-300 system, which will make any air attack much more difficult. They had a plan to deliver fissile material for the purpose of fueling reactors and for use in medical research, but those products are only enriched a tiny amount, whereas nuclear weapons require highly enriched uranium. Such highly enriched material is difficult to make and would be more easily noticed than other material. That's why Israel always says they're a few years away from a bomb. They know how to make a bomb (the CIA gave them plans for one, hoping the flaw they made would slow them down, though they didn't tell the nuclear scientist who was giving them the plans for them and he alerted them to an error, which he said was obvious). The problem is that it takes years to make highly enriched uranium.",True,3,,False,3,0,0,t1_c2we9ho

As a direct financial supporter of MLG, to what extent is it fair to say that I am pirating anything? Am I getting something without paying for it? I am already paying MLG to provide me with a content delivery service, and to the extent their distribution network fails to distribute an otherwise *free product*, I have already compensated MLG for any ad revenue losses caused by their short-term inflexibility. 

The entire purpose of a subscription is to get their content in high quality and ad-free. Should they do something to disrupt the third party distribution without implementing their own solution at least as well, the result would be that they have damaged their own content. It would actually jeopardize their revenue by influencing my decision to continue sponsoring them, because now their content is less valuable to me.

So to put it shortly: *I challenge the notion that I am pirating anything in the first place.*

The bottom line is that as a paying customer, MLG is failing to adequately provide me with a nominally free service. I would like to get what I pay for, especially when the market price of the good is $0 anyway.

Consider this quote by Valve cofounder Gabe Newell, from [this interview](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/experiments-video-game-economics-valves-gabe-newell):

&gt; One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It’s a service issue. The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates. For example, Russia. You say, oh, we’re going to enter Russia, people say, you’re doomed, they’ll pirate everything in Russia. Russia now outside of Germany is our largest continental European market.

That's the sexist part as far as I'm concerned. 

As for countries in the east of Europe, those that were part of the block seem to have better gender equality simply because under the regime, the talents and skills of a person came before their gender, allowing women to enter professions that were traditionally reserved to men.

Complete bullshit.

&gt; Despite his right to silence, my client has repeatedly offered to be interviewed, first in Sweden before he left, and then subsequently in the UK (including at the Swedish Embassy), either in person or by telephone, videoconferencing or email and he has also offered to make a sworn statement on affidavit. All of these offers have been flatly refused by a prosecutor who is abusing her powers by insisting that he return to Sweden at his own expense to be subjected to another media circus that she will orchestrate. Pursuing a warrant in this circumstance is entirely unnecessary and disproportionate. This action is in contravention both of European Conventions and makes a mockery of arrangements between Sweden and the United Kingdom designed to deal with just such situations. This behavior is not a prosecution, but a persecution. **Before leaving Sweden Mr. Assange asked to be interviewed by the prosecution on several occasions in relation to the allegations, staying over a month in Stockholm, at considerable expense and despite many engagements elsewhere, in order to clear his name. Eventually the prosecution told his Swedish lawyer Bjorn Hurtig that he was free to leave the country, without interview, which he did.**

All our elders complain about how bad Gen-Y is. But Gen-Y isn't the problem. These baby-boomers are the most spoilt, self centred pricks I've ever seen.

They all grew up in the post-war economic boom. They had luxuries and technology, free education, cheap housing - the world was their oyster.  They are the ones running our governments, our business, the entire world. They've known fossil fuels were a liability for 40 odd years or more. We could all be driving electric cars, but they're greedy, complacent and lazy bastards and now we're stuck with exorbitant oil prices and the looming disaster of climate change.

They had their cheap housing, they've bought up all the good properties, inflated the housing market (especially here in Sydney). It's impossible for any young families to afford homes without selling their soul to repay huge mortgages.

They had their free (or at least extremely cheap) education too. They told their children they can't have jobs without a degree, then they force them in to 5-figure debts to get jobs that don't even exist.

They control our banks and governments and together they have royally fucked up the European and US economies because of it. The 1000 posts about OWS on Wall Street say it all.

People wonder why Gen-Y are so disenchanted, well, this is fucking why. They've royally fucked up the environment, our education system, our government, our economy and they've simply shrugged and said ""Oh well, we got ours"" and heaved the burden on to us.

* **AJ Auxerre** Very successful in the 90's with their manager Guy Roux. They are very irregular, as they would make it to the Champions League last year and almost avoid relegation the following season.

* **FC Girondins de Bordeaux** As stated, they are a pleasant team to watch, but they have been struggling to recover from Laurent Blanc and Yohann Gourcuff's departures, IMHO. Give them a couple more years.

*  **Stade Brestois** Team from Britanny, very strong identity and and pleasant old style stadium. Their main player Nolan Roux had an amazing season last year, he will probably leave for a big club soon.

* **SM Caen** Team from Normandy, playing good old dad's football. Their main players have been around for years now. Somehow they always manage to win the odd game against big teams.

* **Dijon FCO** Promoted this year, they stand their chance with good players like Jovial or Thil.

* **Evian TG** They went from National (3^rd division) to Ligue 1 in two seasons. They're a team Zidane and friends have invested in, managed a couple of good signings. Watch out for them.

* **Lille OSC** Current title holder, they lost Gervinho over the summer but with Hazard, Sow, Payet, Cole and good ol' Landreau in the goals, I wouldn't be surprised if they did something nice in the Champions League. Probably the best football display to watch.

* **Lorient** Very consistent team with their coach Christian Gourcuff. They always end around the 10^th place. Good philosophy of play and one of the best youth centres.

* **Olympique Lyonnais** A strong team with class and probably our best chance in the Champions League. Amazing players like Lopez, Bastos and Lloris. As stated, they have a renewed approach and practice a pleasant game. Title contenders, obviously.

* **Olympique de Marseille** Most popular team in France, incredibly strong fan base. IMO they somehow lack the character and the world-class players they need to hope for anything this season. Very poor start this year, and dreadful away strips.

* **Montpellier** Southern team, good stadium and a very effective stiker, Olivier Giroud. A bit inconsistent.

* **AS Nancy** Useless, rubbish. Somehow managed to avoid relegation year after year.

* **OGC Nice** Not much to be said either.

* **Paris SG** The new rich, loved and revered in Paris, hated pretty much anywhere else. Very good display, and for sure a title contender.

* **Stade Rennais** Team from Britanny, they are shooting for a Europe spot again. Very strong yet somehow frail in important games.

* **AS Saint-Etienne** Amazing history, as they made it to the C1's final in 1976 and very strong fan base. Lyon's historic rivals, they are the working class people's team. A couple of good players to watch for, like Rivière or Sinama-Pongolle. Hate them or love them.

* **Sochaux** Inconsistent, their midfielder Martin is the next best thing in the French media since he scored a double in his first game with the national team. One of the few remaining good team in the east of France.

* **Toulouse** Mid-table, not much to say about them.

* **Valenciennes** Lille's rival in the north, although nowhere as pleasant to watch and somehow playing in another league. They always managed to avoid the relegation zone in the end.

*Also, a couple of Ligue 2 team to watch for* : the old glories **Lens**, **Monaco** (though the are dangerously low right now) and **Stade de Reims** which stands a good chance to make it back the Ligue 1 for the first time since 1979. And, of course, **Le Havre AC**, who will be looking to open their new stadium next year with a return to the top flight.

This can only be done by sticking together. The world is better off dominated by the West than others, because someone surely will, there is certainly no lack in will to power in the world, and our values are generally better.

So, this one's really not fair to lay on WotC.

In the US, there are multiple large third-party tournament circuits (SCG, TCGPlayer, etc.) with significant cash payouts that attract a lot of players. In the US this works, because you can operate consistently in a bunch of different states and there's a large player base spread all over the country.

Now... try that in Europe, where suddenly you're operating tournaments in a bunch of different *countries* on a regular basis, and all of a sudden you're in deep trouble:

* Germany is right out, because nobody's really certain it's even legal to run a significant cash-payout Magic tournament in Germany (this is why GP Bochum paid out TVs and Playstations and such).
* France is probably out because of logistical issues (more legal fun: judging in France requires joining a labor union).
* etc., etc.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Running something like the SCG or TCGPlayer series outside the US would be a nightmare, and isn't worth anybody's money. So nobody -- including WotC (which does run the GPs, unlike the US where PTOs handle that) -- does it.

I disagree, and I'd say that the exact opposite is correct. To win an AV election, you need a decent number of 1st preferences, so that you don't get knocked out early, before you can attact lots of voters' lower preferences. AV thus favours candidates who a lot of voters really like (i.e. give 1st preferences to), and a lot of voters quite like (i.e. they get lots of lower preferences as well).

If you look at other voting systems that have been suggested as an alternative to AV, such as range voting, condorcet, etc, they allow a candidate to win even if not one single voter prefers that candidate over all the others.

Anyway, here's an alternate procedure for electing the European president:

To stand as president, a candidate needs to be nominated either by 2 MEPs or national MPs, or by 400,000 EU citizens (who would nominate them on a website).

The first round of the election is held at the same time as the European parliament election. Each voter marks each candidate out of 10: from 10/10 (best) to 0/10 (worst). If a voter doesn't mark a candidate, thet vote is counted as 2/10; a low score but not the lowest. 

These votes are then counted in multiple ways: [FPTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), [AV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting), [range voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting), [majority judgement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Judgment), and [condorcet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method). For FPTP and AV, if a voter gives *n* candidates the same highest score, it counts has *1/n* of a vote for each.

If one person wins by all these methods, they are elected. If not, it goes to a second round. Those eligible for the second round are: the range voting winner, the majority judgement winner, the condorcet winner, the top 3 FPTP candidates, and the top 3 AV candidates. So the second round has 3-9 candidates; in practise it would probably be 4-5.

The second round takes place 3 weeks after the first round. Voters vote the same way as the first round, and the votes a counted by both AV and range voting. If both systems produce the same winner, they are elected. Otherwise, condorcet is used to choose between the top two.
