Of course what we're really interested in, in terms of standard of living, is resource usage per capita (very tightly correlated to quality of life measures). It's generally held by folks who promote economic growth (which is almost everybody who has an opinion about it) that growth is the means by which populations go from poverty to, if not abundance, at least a tolerably modest way of life. And this has been historically true. It's the rising-tide-floats-all-boats theory of economic social change; sure, the rich (in this case rich nations) get richer, but the poor find their lot improved as well.

So, here in the States we have the highest energy usage per capita, maybe twice Europe's and many times that of the poorer nations. So, if we stick to this model and wish (as they likely do) that the poorer nations might rise to at least a European standard of living, then that means an several-fold increase in their per capita energy usage. Even if the US and Europe (and probably you too, Canada) don't increase their standard of living at all--or if they do, they do it without using more energy--the global per capita energy usage has to keep climbing. A lot.

And it can't. We don't have it. More and more sources are pinning global peak conventional oil production at around 2004-6, and if it production begins to decrease, as it seems it must, it's probably impossible to bring alternative energy sources online fast enough to even make up for the loss, *much less* account for the growth needed to bring everybody up to a palatable standard of living.

&gt; Neither party is actually anti-war or pro-military cuts.

&gt; If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap, look at the **large public works program** [emphasis added], **otherwise known as World War II**, that ended the Great Depression.

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

The most important thing to take into account here is how markets react to prices increases (in general meaning less supply while high demand) of raw material. I'll try to explain it using the example of copper in the 60's:

Copper was high in demand during the 60's due to increased demand of telephone usage. There was some worry that we would run out of copper before being able to wire up enough to meet the demand. The markets responded at first by searching for copper in places where it was previously too expensive, while at the same time more money was invested in finding substitutes for copper - which eventually occured (fiberoptics).
The substitute part in this story is the most important if we assume that peak oil has occured, as when prices rise enough to lower demand significantly, research for substitutes will also increase significantly.

&gt; Maybe some long shot like LFTR will swoop in and save the day, but I doubt it, and I certainly wouldn't bet the future on it. But even then, we must concern ourselves with:
Freshwater access,
Nitrite contamination of water,
Potential decline in phosphorus availability,
Declines in a number of rare metals and rare-Earth minerals used in the manufacture of so many of those glorious things that we create economic growth by purchasing.

As stated before, it's fundamentally important to understand how the markets and the price system in general tackles issues like these. To doubt human creativity (especially when there's big money to make) is simply a bad bet, considering our history.

&gt; And finally, while I'm no deficit hawk, we have to come to grips with the fact that our economic growth, at least here in the states, has for the last several decades been driven not by the manufacture of products but by the issuance of debt. We now have national debt, consumer debt, and even student loan debt at such levels that they will simply never, ever be repaid. So as we consider the other constraints, we may very well be looking at ""peak debt"" and it's accessory, ""peak credit"", and we may be drawing close to both.

This is something that I belive plagues most of the western world. It's a very valid concern, and the only result I can predict is a pretty nasty depression on the horizon (ironically, a depression/recession is actually the period of adjustment where a large number of individuals adjust their behaviour economically. Kind of like a healing process, whereas the Boom periods are those where the actual damage is done)

Well, I'm really not. I just wanted to clarify what really happened and to advise you to be truly confident in you answers before you make claims about things (ie if someone simply seached google for the us and canada wcg pages and took a skim at the rules and brackets, and then made the claims you did, there isn't sufficient evidence to make that claim)

I'm confused as to why you quoted back at me my statement about researching and making claims (well I'm not that confused, I'm guessing you wanted to take a shot back at mean after you assumed I was out here just to prove you wrong or something). I never even claimed that Jatt was ineligible for the USA qualifiers in my post (though I will admit I did think he should be DQd and still do, based on the rules). I just simply stated that to the best of my knowledge it seems very likely he played in the Canadian WCG qualifiers before the USA qualifiers. 

I made a long post earlier that talked in part about how foolish it is to dissect statements and rules word by word. What's needed is to integrate common sense into the interpretation of these statements. Like you stated you would need to get pretty technical if we were to argue that Jatt's representation is locked into the USA based on events from the past year. On the other hand I don't feel like any of my statements were anything technical. Going back to the common sense issue, I don't really feel it makes a whole lot of sense to lock in a person's country from year to year, to always have it apply retroactively. I can't really see WCG having qualms about a person who switches country from one yearly event to the next, so it would seem superfluous to create a rule that forced a person to lock into a certain country for over a year, when they would most likely overturn the decision the moment the player asked in the next year. Rather I'd say its more likely the context and true meaning of the rule is that one player is locked to a single country for one year, to prevent one person from gaining multiple attempts at going to WCG, which would probably be considered unfair for others and would go against the spirit of the nationality that WCG is structured upon. That's not to say you are wrong--it's not completely illogical that they would create a rule to lock in a player over several years-- but I would rule it less likely. So while you would be correct in saying technically Jatt is locked into the USA for this years tournament, by the specific wording of the rules, I would argue that in reality, he is not because it isn't a terribly sensible rule to have. Rather I'd argue they were not perfect in wording the rule but what they meant to say is fairly sensible, in that the country is locked for they year of WCG they are participating in. And of course this is assuming that last year's WCG was anything like this years.

But it wasn't. I'm not sure how much you know of last years WCG LoL tournament, but I'll assume you know nothing and go over it to be safe. Last year's LoL tournament at WCG was not actually considered an official tournament at WCG, but rather (I'm not sure what to call it specifically) a show match kind of tournament. At the time, LoL had barely just been officially released and WCG was its first real LAN tournament, and the largest tournament for LoL ever. There was essentially no competitive scene and Riot essentially organized and handled the whole tournament for LoL. There was no competitive scene and Riot actually created a list of players who would be eligible for WCG based on preseason elo. But the main point is, though the event was played at WCG, it was never an official WCG event. There were no national qualifiers, instead it was categorized by server. There were only four teams invited, one from all of NA, one from all of EU, one from China, and one from SEA. So it was neither an official WCG competition nor a WCG competition in a certain country. As you may know, CLG broke apart this year for WCG to create Canada and USA teams with TSM because they weren't allowed to compete as persons of different nationalities. As you might also know, last year CLG, who still had people of different nationalities on their team, won the LoL WCG tournament by beating SK. So even with a technical interpretation of the rules, it is still false that Jatt had representation with the USA leading into this year.",True,2,,False,2,0,0,t1_c2w09nu

Between you and me, I am personally pretty suspicious of masturbation on the whole, full stop.  I think the universal praise it has garnered among ""experts"" in the field has almost no basis in the actual academic literature.  For several thousand years, masturbation's was tolerated but socially considered somehow bestial or subhuman -- at best, a morally neutral pale substitute to intercourse, at worst an unhealthy sign of deeper pathology.  Christianity carried this forward into its thousand-year reign in Europe, and taught consistently that masturbation was inhuman and injurious to current happiness and future salvation, thwarting ""God's design of interpersonal love"" or the natural law or whatever.  It was nevertheless widely tolerated among the laity, carrying strong condemnation but relatively light penances and lots of caveats about readmission into the state of grace.  (Indeed, the first known papal condemnation of masturbation, by St. Leo IX / St. Peter Damian in 1054's ""Ad splendidum nitentis"", spends more time talking about forgiveness for fappers than condemning the fapping in the first place!  He then goes on to condemn clerical sex abuse in terms harsh enough to send some in today's Vatican to the fainting couch.)  It's consistently portrayed as an act that thwarts true sexual love in both a physical and a spiritual sense.

Then the 18th century happens, and, inexplicably, absolutely everybody -- the rising secularists above all -- believed Marten's *Treatise of Venereal Disease* and its children, including Tissot.  Suddenly, the whole world believed masturbation caused actual *medical* problems, like blindness and madness, which had until then been old wives' tales at best.  By the end of the 19th century, truly horrific tortures, unimagined even by the darkest members of the Inquisition but in fact developed by Enlightened progressives, were widely promoted by such luminaries as Graham and Kellogg, all for the sake of reducing masturbation's evil physical effects.  It took another century for medical texts to start suggesting the obvious: that this was all bosh, that most people masturbate anyway, and they're not dead, are they?  Kinsey came along and confirmed that, yes, most people masturbate at some point in their lives.

And, that, according to every history I've read, was that.  Sexology determined that masturbation did not cause blindness, palm hair, or insanity... so therefore it must be a great idea!  But was there any actual science backing that up?  So far I've found no studies between Kinsey in 1948 and the AMA's decision to endorse masturbation in 1972 to justify that decision.  The literature of the time exhibits an ideological vendetta against the past that skews historical understanding of masturbation, demonstrates conclusively that masturbation is common and does no medical harm, then, noting that ""to demonstrate that an activity is medically benign is not equivalent to
claiming that is is beneficial,"" proceeds to engage in the wildest scantily-evidenced wishful fantasization I've seen since reading Lord Monckton's denial of global climate change.  The consensus that emerged out of that era has not since been seriously interrogated, so we have today a sexological field whose positive attitude toward masturbation has little more basis than the negative attitudes toward masturbation that were conveyed through old wives' tales and Freud's claim that masturbation caused neurasthenia -- yet which dresses its claims up as solemn fact and promotes masturbation as daily practice and therapy.  Indeed, today we have our own versions of the wives' tales, with people seriously believing that they could end up impotent or otherwise sexually crippled unless they masturbate early and often.  Much of what we have to do at NoFap is unpack those absurd ideas so that people who need help can give it to themselves.

In short, our culture still hasn't recovered from the masturbatory hysteria of the early Enlightenment.  The pendulum's just swung back the other way, to an embrace of masturbation entirely out of proportion to the available evidence.  My own experiences are inconsistent with the new consensus just as much as with the Victorian consensus.  The pre-Enlightenment consensus, on the other hand, makes a certain amount of sense to me.  It's not 100% of the way there, but it gets certain things about my sexual experiences right that nobody else has stated since.  C.S. Lewis, whatever else I think of him and his books (and who reportedly struggled with NoFap for much of his life), described how I feel about it pretty much exactly:

""I agree that the stuff about 'wastage of vital fluids' is rubbish.  For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself… After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison.""

So, personally, I suspect that masturbation is a hindrance to everyone's psychosexual well-being.  I suspect NoFap has stumbled onto something that neither religion nor academia has been capable of recognizing for the past several hundred years.  I suspect masturbation is inherently vicious, and whether the effects that show up in your life are large or small, visible or invisible, is largely a matter of luck and self-awareness.  I could be wrong.  But right now there's not a lot of science about it either way -- just an unaccountable ""consensus"" view without very much grounding in a holistic human anthropology.

And so I am a NoFapper.

I am definitely in the minority here.  I would say that *most* NoFappers would condemn only the excessive, disruptive masturbation that is ruining so many of their lives right now, and they would probably say that if you can fap ""in moderation"" (whatever that ends up meaning), more power to you.  This site takes no official position, but is generally geared toward dealing with addictions, as you say.  Fine by me.  Even if we disagree a little about the ultimate health of masturbation, the people of NoFap are one of the best groups of guys (and girls!) I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, and they have been a tremendous help to me in my own quest to stop fapping forever.

Have you ever tried it, ManOnTheMoon?  Gone 90 days with no PMO (porn/masturbation/orgasm, including non-orgasmic ""playing with yourself"")?  It might be worth a try.  Who knows?  You may learn something entirely surprising about yourself.  Or you may be the very first person to make it through the whole 90 days, go back to fapping, and report that you're happier fapping than not.  Either way, science wins.

You are certainly right that masturbation and porn are not synonyms.  It is important to make that point.  Let me make the equally important point that smoking and lung cancer are also not synonyms.

**TL;DR: Yes, I personally suspect sexual research, virtually dormant on this question since the 1970s, will eventually demonstrate that masturbation is problematic and is to be discouraged.  However, I am a minority here at NoFap speaking only for myself.**",True,1,week1,True,1,0,0,t1_c2w1cvj

Don't even get me started on Craft Beer Market. I SO dearly *wanted* to like this place, as was very excited to have a place that did beer that I could not get elsewhere.

I was disappointed. Guilty, I'm a beer 'snob', although I think it more accurate to label it as 'Beer Nazi'. Yes they have lots of beers, alas many of them is macro swill.

Being in it, I just feel like I am in a giant factory, a milking shed, where I am just a number to be dispensed beer. It's too big, the ceilings too high, the decor too hard, that makes a giant cacophony of voices, music, echoes etc. The distance to the benches on one side, over to the bar, and a glass wall on the other, with other patrons behind it, has to be at least 40 feet. It feels like I am in a home depot, only with seats and less lighting.

There is very little to intercept reflected sounds. No smaller partitions from floor to ceiling  and smaller roomlets. No curtains, limited carpeting. (again the facination with high ceilings of this owner chain baffles me) High, uncomfortable chairs, too small round tables. 

Pretty but understaffed overworked, and undereducated (not their fault) in the beer world, servers.

Overpriced beer. $9 for london pride IIRC. Zero head on the beer. 

I think, that in having 100 lines, they have just created an unmanagable situtation. A good pub doesn't *need* 100 lines. What it does need, is say cut it down to half that or less,  not stock the macro swill, and increase to at LEAST 10 cask lines.

Talking about dispensing. Having 100 beer lines isn't anything special, if many of them is just stuff one can get elsewhere. Nor is dispensing 100 lines through kegs. 

Kegs, if anyone wants to know, are different from casks. No disrespect to barstaff that operate keg taps, but i'm not kidding here, virtually anyone with working hands and eyes can serve beer from a keg. You could pull a random person off the street, show them once how it's done, and they could do it 100 times. It really is the landlords dream. (speaking as an ex landlord) Put glass under tap, turn on, fill to top, turn off. Very little wastage/ullage, easy to store, consistent.

The beer is usually pasturised and filtered, and can even be servable past it's best before date on the label. Since it's driven by CO2 or a nitro mix, it's always ready to go, unless the keg empties, and then getting it pouring again is as quick as one can get the coupler decoupled, into a new keg, flood the fob chamber, and release the float, and you have more beer, ready in seconds.

It is tempting, as a publican, to stock kegs only for the above reasons, but really, it's like the going to the dark side. Ultimately it's lazy, and souless. One knows one isnt giving the customer the best, most natural beer possible, but you also know you are still making money.

Cask beer, now that's where it's at. Keeping and serving cask beer takes way more skill and management. In a way, a cellar full of big casks (some as large as 22 gals) is like keeping your little babies happy. It tastes way better too.

No idea why they have to show the 'cellar' through double glazing. It's a cute touch I suppose. I suppose anything that educates beer drinkers on how beer actually works, is perhaps a good thing. Maybe it's handy for knowing what you have in stock visually, I have no idea.

And this one boggled my mind. Asking the server about the cask ales, they were out of it. I asked about when the next lot is in. Tuesday and Thursday if I remember were cask nights. It was a Thursday. It all goes in 15 mins apparently.

I thanked her civilly but this made me incandescent inwardly. UM. SO JUST GET MORE? ORDER MORE??!? GET BIGGER CASKS?!?!

Also, realising that the pint I was getting, actually wasnt a traditional pint, as in an imprerial pint, 20 oz. 568ml. Noooo, its that bastard American rip off the 16 oz pint, or 473ml.

If pubs were run like this in Europe they would be out of business. Yes, I realise, that ""you're not in Europe now!"" But does that mean that it's still acceptable to continue using insane business practices to the detriment of the customer?

 Some, nay, many pubs and bars in Calgary, just are *not* set up for bulk, fast, efficient service. Sticking with the bizarrely North American way of having a to wait for a girl/guy to some up to ones table, take ones order, then come back, in the time it would be quicker to do it oneself . In fact, I often just go into a pub and just go right up to the bar and order right from the barman/barmaid, and pay for that individual drink. 

The server method I like to call the 'Cheers' method, only because the first time I realised, that was actually how it was done in the States and Canada was by watching the Cheers show, and asking an American freind if this was actually the way it was done.

The other way, apparently, is called the 'London Bar' method. IE, one goes up to the bar, speaks direct to the barman/barmaid orders the drink, he/she pours it, you pay, tip optional, for each drink, and get the hell out of the way away from the bar for the next guy to order. It's rare to run a tab. Bar staff are typically paid a higher rate in the EU, so tipping per drink is normally not done.

If one does want to tip the barman, then one says 'and one for yourself' and invariably, the barman saves the drink til the end of the night, where, if one is lucky, a 'lock in' will be done, and whomever is left at inside will be guests of the landlord, and the barman will have that drink with you. Or he may just take it out of the til at the end of the night.

The london bar method is faster and more efficient, if the bar is long enough, one can have 4 or more barmen, the bar can be 5 deep, and people still get their drinks. By removing most if not all barstools from the bar when its packed, one can increase the people that get served.

If craft beer market followed this strategy the complaints about slow service would vanish. Get the servers behind the bars, turn them into barmaids, inform the customers about the new fangled 'london service' method using table talkers, voila, problem solved. Pay the barmaids/barmen a bit more for the less tipping, watch the volume of beer sold go through the roof.

Also, the method about pouring shots into thimbles (or 'jiggers' as they say here) is pure madness. It's slow, messy, wasteful and one sees brandy being measured, then vodka. In the SAME thimble. Free pouring bottles of expensive spirit in a busy, wet handed bumpy into eachother, many bottles squeezed next to eachother on high shelves, type environ is lunancy.

The soloution is to use 'optics'. Devices that attach to 1.5 litres of spirit, which are then put upside down on a rack, which dispense 25ml or whatever oz is the legal min, in about half a second, turn around, pop in the postmix, and voila, drink made in 5 seconds.

Anyway. Enough ranting. Suffice to say, I have looked into getting a pub up and running, but the red tape and curiously cartel like methods to frustrate you has made me think twice. Friends have told me that running a pub with no coors/bud/molson/canadian/keiths, and having no TV's. low volume music and cheap import beer would be crazy. 

You know what's crazy? Opening another pub with the same stuff everyone else sells.

Do you realize the same happened in the USA? Rent prices adjusted later than selling prices.

You keep throwing all this facts as if they mean there is no housing bubble and I keep giving you examples of how the same facts happened previous other housing bubbles. What you think is a prove of no housing bubble its not. Yet you seem convinced you are giving propper answers.

&gt;Prices in Sydney are expected to increase over the next few years.

Oh, someone expect prices to keep rising? Debate closed. Do I need to show you the examples of people saying that prices would keep rising in the USA or other places where they collapsed? Was this serious or ironic?

&gt;I'm speaking in comparison to the United States, where it was practice for Greenspan to keep interest rates artificially low. When the GFC hit, the US interest rate had nowhere to go. Ours hit a 'low' of 5.75% before rising again.

Yes, they were higher than in the USA. But my question is how do you know they were high? Can you please answer to what I ask instead of going in a tangent?

&gt;I take issue with this and about half the rest of your post. You keep pulling specific examples from other countries to throw into doubt various elements of the Australian economy. If I say Sydney FC is better than LA Galaxy, you don't refute that by saying that Chelsea has a better defence and Real Madrid has a better offence.

You keep giving ""arguments"" as why there is no housing bubble in Australia. I keep showing you with reality that they are not arguments, they do not prove there is not a bubble. You can either acknowledge reality or keep living in your bubble. All you mention as reasons as why there is no bubble in Australia happened in other places where there was a bubble. Thats reality.

&gt;Your examples of Spain are stupid because they had vastly different circumstances to Australia at the time the crisis hit. They were sitting at over 40% government debt as a percentage of GDP in 2008, while Australia had no government debt.

Stop going in tangents. How is government debt related to the fact that there is a housing bubble in Australia?

All the reasons you mentioned as to why banks were propperly regulated in Australia, were applied in Spain as well. And there was a huge housing bubble that has collpased with the economy.

&gt;Yes... our big government with our socialised medicine, subsidised university fees, large social safety net, large public broadcasting service... not only maintained a budget surplus for years, but had money in the bank when the GFC hit.

See, you are politically indoctrinated and can not keep the economic conversation analitical and on topic. You needed to exteriorize your indoctrination even if it wasnt on topic. Being politically indoctrinated is bad for you, but in particular is the reason why you can not have a (as near as) objective economic discussion.

All the economies reach in natural resources can afford to have deficient and expensive services. You can see how Norway has petrol as opposed to the rest of the european northern economies, and are the only ones that have not cut back. Its no secret.

&gt;We have legislation that limited the banks ability to speculate and expose themselves to derivatives. See: Corporations Act, ASIC Act. There are legal conflicts of interest for an Australian bank to engage in speculation, especially if it involves betting against their own customers like US banks were.

Thats not what GS is about. Can you please stop going on tangents to avoid answering? I want prove that Australia has a GS-like legislation like you claimed.

Btw, USA also has regulation that forbid banks to bet against their own costumers.

&gt;You repeatedly tell me I need to 'check reality' and then you whinge about me insulting you?

How weird of me, right?

Deutsche Post still comes close to being a monopoly on letters in Germany, which is hardly surprising given the low profitability of providing a nation wide mail service. Although, they do have some competition, especially for local mail, and even more competition for parcels. Telekom has plenty of competition, Post Bank never had a monopoly and has recently been taken over by Deutsche Bank.

To solve the last-mile problem, Telekom is actually forced to give access to competitors for a fee that is fixed by a regulatory body.

&gt; Were the guys at the top well-connected to certain politicians and the ones that replace them continue to be? (Large donations to certain parties, etc.)

No donations to any parties by either of the former state monopolies, but those are generally not very common anyway.

The guys at the top all have/had relevant backgrounds managing large corporations in the respective or related industries and no political affiliations I could find. The first head of Deutsche Post eventually got caught withdrawing some of his personal taxes, and if memory serves me right then one of the EU commissioners who were responsible for the liberalization of the telecommunication market did in fact go on to work for Telefónica.

American sports tend to be full of roughly-equal teams; sure, there are dominant teams and shitty teams, but even the shitty teams can occasionally pull a win from the dominant ones, and doing so is fairly unremarkable. If the Bengals beat the Patriots, people are going to make jokes about it, but it won't be front-page news the next day.

European sports tend to be full of average teams, with just an elite few *incredible* teams. These incredible teams aren't just good, they're damn near perfect. For one of these super-teams to lose to an average team is so rare as to be worthy of outrage. These teams have a near-divine *right* to win. The only thing these teams live for is to play against other super-teams, and in doing so they provide one hell of a spectacle.

Essentially, American sports trend towards the egalitarian; European sports are very laissez-faire.

The Greek government took money from those banks, and now because they're having a rough spot they should just be forgiven the loan? They deserve free money because they spent everything they had?

Aah, so it is the Greek government now? At least there we agree. All that talk about lazy Greeks is nothing but rabble rousing. Fits perfectly with the Sun and other trash ""newspapers"".

As for your questions, we have a couple of options, which were all discussed when this whole ordeal started in 2009. You remember? It didn't start a couple of months ago. Back then, we had a choice to help right away and solve the issue with only a small amount of money (compared to what we have to pay now). Instead, Merkel and Sarkozy stalled and stalled and then finally made a decision to give a minute amount of money bundled with ridiculous terms. Those terms were guaranteed to trash what was left of the Greece domestic market, compounding the problems Greece was/is in. On Top, that ""aid"" money was to be spent strictly on paying back loans. Which means no, we didn't do anything to help Greece get out of their sinkhole. It had to go straight back to our own banks. Things like that are called bail-out money. Yes, nearly all of the Greek aid money was bail-out money for the banks, nothing else.

So, yes, Greece was in a bad place, but had many options back then. They for example could have gone bankrupt right then and there. But of course, we couldn't allow them to risk our banks 25% profit margin goals. So we started putting a lot of pressure on Greece and made sure, the banks could keep their goals. All at the price of pushing Greece into a much worse situation. A situation bad enough, that it now actually threatens the whole of Europe.

And that is my point. Yes, Greece was in a bad place through their own fault. Then we came in at made it infinitely worse and now the whole of Europe is in a bad place. And the only party, that actually gained from all of this are the banks. Everyone else has lost.

They don't have nearly as much medical knowledge as we do - but they're *cheaper,* and the average joe doesn't know if he saw an APN or an MD.  And at a certain point they won't be able to cut Medicare any more.  Many surgeries are barely profit-makers any more with Medicare, and sooner or later there will be doctors that say ""that's it, I'm not taking medicare any more, it's no longer worth my time.""

The real issue is that ""universal healthcare"" is never going to be what people imagine it as in America.  For example we will *never* have Sweden's healthcare system, because the American population is so vastly, completely different from the Swedish.  We are individualistic, have more variety in ethnicity and ethics, etc, etc.  No one wants to consider *all* of the facts when comparing health care systems, they just want to have pretty graphs that show ""cost of healthcare per person in countries A,B,C, and D"" without discussing lifestyles in each country, obesity rates, education level, unemployment, social factors, entertainment choices, and all of the other things that affect ""health.""

Anyway, the entire problem with Israel is that it's a ""Jewish"" state.  The country itself has an official ethnicity.  There is no such thing anywhere else in the industrialized world.  In 1948, the Jews already had enough people in Palestine to be a significant political force, unlike in Europe.  However, the idea of a ""Jewish state"" is what gave Israel the right to evict Arabs from their homes.  Had there just been a new state drawn there, with whatever population already existed, well that would be nothing new in the Middle East, as most of those borders are European-made.  When you explicitly give one ethnicity the ""right"" to control the land, however, you just change from one persecuted minority to another.

Today, Israel is the morally indefensible actor because it is not abiding by any set of rules--anywhere.  Their biggest ally, the US, continually asks them to stop building settlements, yet they continue.  Controlling Gaza and the West Bank can be argued as a security issue, as can blockades and other policies.  Settlement building, however, *outside of Israel's borders*, is just land grabbing.  Plain and simple.  It is those zealots that feel they are entitled to land--that no one else in the world agrees they are entitled to--who are in the way of peace and progress.  You cannot cry victim while simultaneously taking over more and more land.

Your post is correct in that there are very few morals when it comes to international relations.  Morals and ethics are far too philosophical to be used to gauge international politics.  There are, however, international norms and standards.  One of them is the borders that the U.N. laid out for Israel in 1948, another is the 1967 borders after peace was made, another is the Geneva conventions and other agreements that dictate how ""administrative"" territories like Gaza should be treated.  Israel does not hold itself to any of these standards, which is why Palestinians have so much support.

It's history has been one of countries endlessly invading one another, empires being built and destroyed and a general level of ambient carnage. This way of running a continent reached its bloodiest level in the last century and after the second of two world wars, the Europeans decided that enough was enough and that all this silly warmongering had to stop. To this end, the European nations who weren't currently being ruled by the Soviets formed a community: At first it was about collaborative trade in coal and steel (the ECSC), but over time the countries began to work closer and closer together, eventually forming what is known as the European Union. Primarily, this was a political and trading union designed to bring the member states closer together and ultimately reduces the chances of another war breaking out. However, after a while it took on a life of it's own.

Seeing that the EU seemed to work rather well, some of the nations involved thought about taking the idea further and proposed a currency union known as the Eurozone. This would involve all those who signed up ditching their own currency and instead taking on a new one that was shared by it's neighbours. But why would they do this? Well, for one, it would make trade amongst European nations much easier as they wouldn't have to be constantly exchaging different currencies. On top of that, having a bunch of countries club together would give Europe a lot more clout. For example, the Franc could never go toe-to-toe with the dollar but maybe a currency based on the Franc, the Deutche Mark and numerous others could. In fact, there was serious talk for a time that the Euro could become the world's reserve currency, something that would give the Euro nations a massive advantage over other powers.

So that was the theory, but in practice things were a little different. For one, the Brits wanted nothing to do with it along with some other nations so it ended up with only some EU members being inside the Euro while some retained their own currency. Another thing about it was that it was quite different from other currencies for a number of reasons. For one, all the various members still had their own governments, their own finance ministers and set their own taxes while most currencies only answer to one central authority. Also, it's central bank didn't really have the sort of power we usually associate with the likes of the Federal Reserve. 

Having said that, the Euro did seem to work for a good many years. Naturally, this lead to more nations being allowed to enter in the hope that it would grow even stronger and bind Europe closer together. While the world economy was ticking along ok, this was fine but when things went wrong it exposed an underbelly that the planners probably hadn't counted on:

1. The countries involved were so diverse that no single currency could really serve all the members adequately. As a result, the strong economies ended up propping up the weaker ones and this began to grate on electorates.
2. Because there is very little central authority, it's very hard to do things quickly, as is evident from the last year or so.
3. No one really counted on the Greeks lying for many years about how much they had borrowed or quite how badly mauled some of the weaker nations would be by the economic crisis.

So yes, what was a very noble and highminded idea has become somewhat of a victim of reality and could actually be quite destabalising to Europe in the end, all of which would be tragic as it was part of a project to bring Europe together in the hope that peace could last.",True,13,,False,13,0,0,t1_c2w3zse

Allerdings halte ich die aktuellen Politikprobleme eher für Probleme der Komplexität in Verbindung mit guter Lobbyarbeit. Durch den komplexen Alltag sind die Probleme, mit denen sich Politiker beschäftigen müssen ebenfalls viel komplexer geworden. Das ist auch eine Art Transparenzproblem. Eine Vorgang ist nicht nur intransparent, wenn er geheim gehalten wird, sondern auch intransparent, wenn er hinreichend komplex ist, dass kaum noch jemand versteht worum es geht.

60 Jahre BRD, 50 Jahre EU, und dann in der wissenschaftlich exakten Sprache der Juristen. Wer soll da noch durch die Gesetze und Verträge blicken? 

Und die Lobbys arbeiten sehr intelligent im Auftrag ihrer jeweiligen Industrien und überzeugen die Politiker, dass das, was sie nicht ganz durchblicken in Wirklichkeit 'gut für die Allgemeinheit' ist.

Das ging lange gut. Selbst die unverschämten Stromkonzerne waren zwar demokratieschädlich, aber haben unsere Staaten nicht bedroht. Die Finanzindustrie schafft es aber ganze Staaten zum Wanken zu bringen. Das ist von keiner Industrie oder Lobby eine organisierte Aktion. Das ergibt sich einfach, wenn Marktteilnehmer, die Eigeninteressen verfolgen, Einfluss auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess nehmen. Zu ihren Interessen. So lange die Leute noch alle Gesetze und Folgen verstehen, kann man Interessenpolitik noch leicht aufdecken.

Aber die Kombination von heutigen Lobbys (zehnmal so viele wie Politiker, an Universitäten ausgebildet um den Politiker zu erklären wie gut doch ihre Ideen sind) und der Komplexität verschiedener Sachverhalte ergeben eine brisante Mischung. 

Oben drauf dann noch der angeblich begrenzte Einfluss der Politik durch Globalisierung (der kleinste gemeinsame Nenner bei Umwelt- und Arbeitsschutz sowie Löhnen gewinnt) und wir haben ein ziemliches Problem, welches m.E. so noch nicht da war.

&gt; Corruption: Corruption has become an issue of major political and economic significance for the Portuguese. The responsible authorities and many civic associations and think tanks are trying to combat corruption before it increases further. Many abusive lobbies and corruption schemes are related to concessions, unclear approvals to contractors and economic groups, or job creation for and commercial agreements with friends and family members, mainly involving the huge public sector and companies. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, as well as a number of politicians with wider responsibilities and power.[42][43] Notable criminal cases include the Face Oculta, the Oeiras Municipality Mayor Isaltino Morais scandal, the Apito Dourado and the Saco Azul de Felgueiras. According to the 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index of countries published by Transparency International, Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption, out of 180 countries. In 2009 it had slumped to the 35th place.

Also [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) puts you in 32nd close to Spain, which is significantly behind the better European nations. Granted  you're not as bad as Italy or Greece :)

I see your point in regards to American, though I refute your claim that there is not a great deal of shared cultural heritage between non-immigrant (or illegals) in the US. It is tangible through the cultural projection of the US everywhere else in the world.

I imagined a grasp of the English was a criterion for becoming a citizen? While Spanish might soon be the majority language in the States, it isn't yet (while English is not the official language, you cannot argue it is not the de facto language). Americans may speak other languages, but the primary language in the United States is English. I don't see how this is hilarious in any way.

I think your argument that the US has neither is laughable. It is quite palpable.

Just as the US has come into its own culture during the 300 years of its existence, so had the nations of Europe, through wildly varied ways and for a much longer time. Your time scale is hopelessly short if you only look back sixty years. Just in the previous century Europe has been laid waste twice. The century before that saw major conflicts both on the continent, revolutions and massive global endeavours. The end result of all this history for each individual country can not be neatly summarized and lumped together.

While you might say the EU and the UN enforces laws on Europe, it de facto enforces European (more specifically, French revolutionary) ideals and laws on everyone else.

A shared currency that has had a short and rocky life does not make a unified continent (one of the largest economies doesn't even participate!). In another fifty years I am sure the landscape will be radically different and I might agree that we have moved to more of an European nation.

People are jumping to conclusions that Greeks, down to each citizen are responsible for the mess in Europe. I don't understand that logic. I can understand that for instance, people in Germany and other countries are angry because they don't want to be screwed helping the Greeks and other countries. But the major problem are the bankers that are continuously lending money to Greece. Greeks never wanted any of this. Greeks didn't want to be lent money out of it's debt from the IMF/Troika. The idea first of all is preposterous. Lending money is going to get Greece out of debt? It just increases the debt. Secondly, one of the reasons Papandreou got voted into power was because he promised Greeks he would not go that route. He lied. And yes, Greeks shouldn't have been allowed to enter the EU, because they cooked their books. But Greek politicians also lied to the Greek people painting everything beautiful and nice. 

Banks are the real problem, which is the point I'm getting at. Banks borrowing money from the European Central bank at a low interest rate, and then lending it at 10-15% or perhaps more, how can banks not make money? Then Banks get bailed out from their reckless decisions, placing that weight on the shoulders of the people in the EU. There is no future if this is how the markets are going to continue. It's obvious that it can't. And collateralizing debt on public assets is where the true profit is at. That is why bankers, and the elite are waiting for Greece to default, so as to take Greek assets for hardly anything at all. Even the Chinese/Russians are waiting in line to buy up Greek assets. It's incredibly immoral. It's not only going to happen in Greece either. But also Portugal, Ireland, Spain, etc. I feel incredibly sad for these countries, because their wealth, the public wealth of these countries are going to be privatized. Greece for instance no longer owns any of their ports. None of their major roads, and most of their airports. In the past Greeks went to war and shed blood, when these assets were in danger of being lost. 

Greece, and other EU countries in debt like Portugal, Spain, need the following. They need to eliminate their toxic environment that disallows real wealth to be created. They need to spend money to create real wealth, (even though that may even sound preposterous as well). Through entrepreneurial inventions, technologies, new ideas, etc. But banks don't want this type of progress. They are in the business to bail themselves out, place their debt on the people, and to steal wealth. Global banks tell Greek politicians what to do, and they do it. There is no one left to trust. But I don't think people should focus their anger on Greek people. I don't see the logic in that. Sure Greeks are responsible for many wrongs, but these global bankers are at large the most at fault. They are destroying Europe. I wonder how the US will fair though once the default comes. The US apparently has insured the loans foreign bankers lent out to Greece, Portugal, and Spain.

Resources are another huge issue. We have limitless resources at our disposal, our entire planet is a perpetual motion machine just waiting to be harnessed. We could generate limitless power with minimal impact to the planet, easily, and in more ways than just solar or wind. But again, why would we solve our energy problems? Then we wouldn't make billions on our current fossil fuels.

There are limitless reasons to make bombs, and although humanity has the ability and knowledge to create ingenious solutions to problems we would rather argue about who is better at what. 

None of these are new problems, since the beginning of history man has fought over government, religion, and resources. The only difference is were no longer firing arrows, were firing missiles and everyone is on a razors edge waiting to hit that button. 

Basically, yes we can avoid it, but people have to change. We have to trust each other and work together and realize that we are on a very fine edge in human history and one small thing in either direction will tip the scales. 

Im sure most people disregard the doomsday scenario, i mean, were civilized people, we would never do something like that... again... for the third time. 

The issues we face aren't big issues. There's just no one that wants to accept or fund the answers.

Create new ways to get resources, this one is indescribably simple, but no one will pay for the development of unlimited water and power, even if i could set up new designs for them in a few weeks for no cost (which i would do btw) no one will build the facilities.

Greece has the same problems and all this idiotic talk about the lazy Greeks only serves to put the blame on everyone except the ones who are actually responsible. It separates us from them, when instead we should all be on the same side and try to change the system enough so it won't collapse.

No the Greek are not more or less lazy then Germans, French, American or whoever else. And no, high wages are not really the biggest problem Greece has.

It's true that the Bush tax cuts lowered the rates on top earners, but they also dramatically lowered the rates on the median and bottom earners. By a lot more.

During the same period, the total share of the tax burden paid by the bottom 50 percent fell from 6.5 percent to 3.3 percent.

http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/ba606.pdf

US tax code today is at the most progressive level it's ever been since the post war period. Also US tax code is far more progressive than any European nation. While Western Europe has higher top marginal rates it also has much higher rates on median and bottom earners.

""For example, when refundable tax credits and other tax incentives are included across the entire income spectrum, the United States has the most progressive income tax code among its peer nations, although its overall income tax rates are below the OECD average.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax


So look, if you want to raise taxes on the rich to Clinton levels or Western European levels I'm fine with that. But part of the bargain has to be that you have to raise those tax rates across the board to match. You can't keep expecting the wealthiest 1% to shoulder a higher and higher proportion of the tax burden like the US has been doing. Sacrifice has to be shared across the spectrum. The US in 2011 has the most progressive tax system across both time and space, so how can you justify making it even more progressive.

I believe this is the central reason that OWS is rejected in middle America. Democracy is a double edge sword. It's bad side comes out when populism is exploited to allow a majority to perpetually raid a small minority that doesn't have the votes to defend itself. The nightmare scenario here is Zimbabwe, where a populist politician runs the economy back into the stone age by increasingly redistributing from a small productive elite. 

Whether you think this comparison is valid or not, it is what middle America is seeing when it looks at OWS. Logically one would think a movement standing up for 99% would have 99% support. Instead it has below &lt;50% support. 

If you want OWS to be taken seriously you have to articulate why America which already has the most progressive tax system of any first world nation should redistributing even more. You have to explain why OWS's plan for redistribution is different than that which has doomed a hundred Soviet and third world countries to poverty.",True,0,,False,0,0,0,t1_c2w5o7k

Furthermore, european integration was heavily pushed by Germany and france after WWII, if you are interested, look up the Montanunion, that's where the starting point of european integration was concieved. One of my grandfathers was a soldier on the western front, but he never talked about the war, I think he was a pow with the americans for a year and a half or so. My other grandfather was 14 when the war ended and barely dodged the Volkssturm (conscription of the old and really young to be thrown into the meatgrinder). All of his male classmates died ""defending"" a bridge that was hit by a russian bomber. When his town was taken by the russians, he was forced to help load bombs into bombers starting from a nearby airstrip that were used to bomb the City of Breslau. 

The germans and the russians used to be best buds for a really long time, Kaiser Wilhelm even helped Lenin get to Russia in 1917 to get the revolution going so that the eastern front could calm down. Furthermore a part of Germany was part of the eastern bloc as you hopefully remember.

The one country that germany has still some strained relations with, is in my opinion poland. This is due to the fact that poland got crushed between the soviets and germany and that a big part of the genocide was committed in poland ( auschwitz, warsaw ghetto, etc.)
Furthermore a big part of now poland used to be german and the germans there after WWII were pretty heavily discriminated against. Fortunately my grandfather and grandmother could leave in 1960 before they closed it of completely, because my grandfathers brother was in the navy and stationed in Bremen.

So now that that's out of the way now to your last question:  I visited the KZs and I visited the town in now poland, formerly Silesia in prussia, where my grandparents are from. And it feels humbling to know where we come from, it makes you feel sad to see all the hate and violence people have done to each other.

The difference between Germany and the US, is that we had acts like the famous ""kniefall"" of willy brandt, who fell to his knees in warsaw in honor of the victims of the genocide. I never saw anything remotely as powerful from an american head of state, even though with the whole slavery thing, the trail of tears, the japanese internment and other things, the US would have plenty of things to feel guilty about. You are shaped by the society you live in, you don't get to decide that you only take the good and the rest is put off as: I didn't do none of that. 

So what, you live in a system that profiteered from the systematic exploitation of slave labor, that committed genocide on the native americans and others. Funny how both african americans and native americans are still extremely disenfranchised compared to the comfy position white people are in. You don't see any relation between the history and the present situatioN? well I do, that's why I make this assessment. 

And I feel the situation pretty much vindicates my interpretation. Look at japans role in Asia, they are pretty much hated by the koreans, chinese and most other countries because they never acknowledged the atrocities they committed in their imperialistic period ( rape of nanking for example is still denied by a lot of japanese people).

The culture we ""project"" throughout the world is just as much of an awkward presence at our table as it is at yours.

The movies Hollywood comes out with are as much a show of our diversity as a country as they are a show of how blind Hollywood is to the world around them. Yes, many of the movies we produce tell stories against the backdrop of a coherent country, but that country is not the United States of America.

The television shows we produce are only of the most generic and bland variety. ""Friends"", for example, portrays a wonderful, beautiful city full of life and people where people form small, close-knit social networks and only ever seen to work like an hour a day. That city, while it is referred to as New York, is not anything like New York. Not my experiences of New York at least. The majority of television from here is like that, portraying a watered-down version of what really goes on. It's inauthentic and bland.

Long story short, I feel that the bonds of culture within the US are only ever so slightly stronger than they bonds of the culture of the entire combined Western world. It's really not a thing. I probably have almost as much in common with you, a Norwegian, as I have with someone living in a different state in the US.

Yes, in order to become a citizen you have to speak and understand English on a certain level. That is true. That does not, however, imply that people retain that knowledge, or that children born here are taught English. You know English, does that lessen your cultural bonds with your country? Lots of groups here are *vehemently* opposed to integration, nearly every major metro area has a ""Chinatown"" and a ""Little Vietnam"" and a ""Little Italy"" because people are so opposed to losing who they are. These places are insular, and there are people who live the majority of their lives inside of small regions of cities so they won't be exposed to anyone else's culture. That seems like the opposite of a unified culture and language.

&gt;The end result of all this history for each individual country can not be neatly summarized and lumped together.

History != Culture

The fact that they've had to grow up around each other over and over again seems to support the notion that they're more unified that you're letting on.

&gt;While you might say the EU and the UN enforces laws on Europe, it de facto enforces **European** (more specifically, French revolutionary) ideals and laws on everyone else.

So you're saying that we're all conforming to Europe's legal ideas? Seems like, again, Europe is closer to being a single, unified entity than you're letting on.

Regarding the Euro, the Euro is simply an explicit statement of the status quo as I have seen it in the last two decades - money in Europe is transient. You can change one currency to another and even spend one country's currency in a neighboring country with little fanfare. In the US, with the exception of a few very limited areas (Airports, the city of New York, the city of Las Vegas), it is easier to purchase a congressman than it is to get francs turned into dollars.

A whole lot of the country is drowning in debts they incurred willingly without any thought. They are currently very pissed off that the government is not helping them at the expense of those that didn't.

Most of the government is currently focused on pushing EU membership through, which is a very iffy subject in the country though I am a unionist, without much thought to educating the country as to why. For example, I'm fully aware of why I support membership, but I really have no clue what the government wants there because all they say has absolutely nothing to do with the EU reality I was educated in (by the EU).

Most of our political process goes into securing the position of the financial elite. As an example we are currently facing a rather serious issue with both our real estate and renting market because the banks control most of it after having forced people into default from their property (forcing them into the rental market) and refusing to put the property into the real estate market to recoup the losses the claimed the property for. They are essentially attempting to take full control of all shelter here in Iceland so they can control the price of a basic necessity. The governments attempt out of this was to use the welfare system to subsidize the rent of families thrown out of their homes rather than prevent the blatant market manipulation.

Then I read all sorts of ""ICELAND IS AWESOME AND DID EVERYTHING RIGHT!"" headlines in foreign media. It's wrong, we're not. We made the healthy decision of not bailing out our banks. That's it. It was not done for the people but to protect the owners of the bank.

The people here aren't even united. We spend most of our time squabbling over nonsense rather than issues that actually matter. We'd rather argue about whether or not entrapment is ok when it comes to prostitution than attempt to change all of the above.

A founding member of NATO and the OECD, it is also a member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

Denmark, with a mixed market capitalist economy and a large welfare state, ranks as having the world's highest level of income equality. It has frequently ranked as the happiest and least corrupt country in the world. The national language, Danish, is closely related to Swedish and Norwegian, with which it shares strong cultural and historical ties.

The little guy has no rights because the little guy doesn't own a business where he can give himself rights.

If a company wants to pollute a river and it's only clients are in Europe or china who could give two shits about a polluted river in the US, then there is nothing the locals can do about it.  Since they cannot boycott a company who doesn't need their business.  That is China's problem right now.  All the factories serve foreign markets, so the locals have no way to stop them.  The people who get jobs are just happy to have a job, they won't boycott as they would lose their job.  If they did boycott, the company would just bus in poorer people to work from western china.

&gt;I see the argument on the other side and I sympathize but I do not accept that anyone has the right to tell a property owner what to do with their assets.

And when a distributor refuses to sell anything to that local business and instead only sell to walmart?

The fact is your small business example is one of the biggest cons of all time.  You always cite this small business, but in reality everything would very quickly become large companies that monopolize markets, companies would be able to sign contracts with suppliers to gain full exclusivity in an area.  A single monopoly would eventually control each sector of business.  History proves that with monopolies like AT&amp;T that had to be broken up.

&gt;I truly believe in our modern society no significant business could survive the public relations nightmare and the loss of revenue caused by holding racist, exclusionary policies

As for that statement, that is a joke.  If walmart monopolizes the market and fires all the black employees, there is nothing anyone could do about it.  There would be no competition and their exclusivity contracts would bar any competition from forming.

As for stonefarfalle's comment, you have to look at the root cause of the company potentially going under if he doesn't automate the job. It's probably because technology has made whatever job this is more efficient and therefore with capitalism, the price of production goes down, while the demand and scale of economy means less money is made per unit. Meanwhile productivity still goes up with fewer jobs.

Many companies today in the bad economy are slashing jobs by the thousands in order to report positive income for the sake of Wall Street. Sure the company stays afloat, but for how long?

As more and more people go unemployed, less consumers exist to support the companies. Eventually there is a tipping point were the company, no matter how many jobs are cut in the short term, can't report a profit to appease the investors.

goverment sanctioned: Nearly Every country has a ""govt. sanctioned"" persecution past. Russia=pogroms, US=native americans/blacks/japanese, Iraq=Kurds etc etc. 

Nazi Germany did this, too, but not unique.

Relocation and settlement creation, US=trail of Tears, Russia=pale of settlement, Belgium=Congo (and all imperialism/colonization/expansionist entity ever) etc etc.

 Nazi Germany did this, however, this, too is not unique.

Blockade. Nearly every country has done this as well, every siege done is a blockade. US=Berbery coast, Russia=Ukraine, can't think of recent examples offhand, but this generally not considered a travesty of holocaustic proportion

Ghettoization. Nearly every country has done this as well, from the black US ghettos, to the European ghetto, to the Indian caste etc etc 

This, too, Nazi Germany has done, but is not unique.


None of these things are ok, they are all evil. But not unique. Yet, Nazi Germany is a byword for inherent evil so bad, that none compares to it.


So what does make it unique?

Here is an example: A murderer who goes around killing indiscriminately is not as feared as a guy who builds a factory, a slaughterhouse for the sole purpose of murdering people.

Nazi Germany built mass factories, with extensive planning and massive support system and bureaucracy to eradicate people with modern, mechanized and tested efficiency. 

Another unique factors include the fact that it was meant to be total annihilation. 

Other events/acts that are not the same, but comparable,  include Pol Pot, Rwanda etc.

Yes, Israel can be said to do horrible things, and it can be hated, vilified and protested for its actions, but no one can claim that they are similar to Nazis. For when you say Nazi, you do not mean all the other horrible things it did, you mean holocaust. there is nothing comparable here. Nothing.

If enough people refuse to pay, the government couldn't financially cover the cost of military operations or government activities. It would be a race to chaos.

This isn't true. The recent credit downgrade was because we no longer have a rational political process (e.g. we have too many republicans and they're unable to compromise). Despite the downgrade, we are still able to barrow large sums of money are relatively low interest rates. The only thing ""constraining"" us is the debt ceiling, which is routinely raised. Martial law would throw Congress' ability to regulate executive branch spending. In other words, we'd have no debt ceiling -- our creditors would decide when we've ""hit our limit"". (And the more they loaned us, the more likely they would be support us no matter how hard times got or how drastic the action because they'd like to see a return on their investment.)

Next, in a time of martial law you draft people. Engineers, Doctors, and young men are now instantly mobilized. This will of course create vacancies in the job market. This is a vital step, because both Doctors and Engineers tend to think systematically, which is something the majority of our population lacks. Now they're ""locked down"". Next, a large idle population of young men is always a bad thing in times of societal disruption, so rounding up as much of the population and putting them to work reduces the risk of the insurrection becoming full fledged. 

Third, the media does an in-depth report of a no-knock raid gone bad. Trust me, sooner or later one of them is bound to go bad. Endearing photos of a loving, white, suburban family that went on picnics, played soccer together, wrote to their local school board, gave to charity, played instruments was killed in their own home after the father, a tax protester, went for a firearm thinking they were being robbed. The rest of the family was cut down as collateral damage. Images of a child's brains splattered on the walls will haunt FOX, CNN, MSNBC -- with the question: Could THIS Happen to YOU? The media frames it as the family being a victim of circumstance. And that ""it wouldn't have happened if they weren't tax protesters.""

A lot of people, despite not having health care, a living wage, no escape from crippling student loan and mortgage debt, think long and hard about how they might get ""accidentally shot in the face 5 times"" by an M16 for being politically active in today's climate. How it might impact their family. How ""towing the line"" and waiting out this ""long emergency"" is a good idea. Government assurances that things ""will go back to normal soon"" will always get some of the moderates and ""undecided"" to sit on the fence. Government officials of all kind rally around the flag and preach the message that ""we will get through this"" and ""we will overcome"". If any discussion or discourse arises about the rights of the ""occupiers""/""protesters"" the official party line will be ""changing your government is possible and welcome in a free society such as ours, but no matter who is in charge or how the economy is doing, you have to pay taxes/obey laws/or Y/etc."". 

This re-frames the argument from ""OWS did X to call attention to Y"" to ""Things were already shit, but OWS did X when things were already shit, and now we have to do Z if we ever want things NOT to be shit again.""

Fourth, the government, in a need to create jobs and establish a cashflow capable of feeding a huge amount of interned people for a sustained period of time, begins to privatize services. Certain highways will now be toll highways. Companies will now bid on the rights to toll a road the way wireless companies bid on spectrum. At the same time the Federal Government raises the federal gasoline sales tax from 18 cents to 36 cents/gallon, bringing in another 54 billion in revenue. Tabacco and Alcohol taxes are also raised, with the argument that they're not regressive, as you can always avoid a consumption sales tax.

Fifth, routine domestic operation of UAVs become the norm.

Sixth, as America's economy worsens, we look like a more attractive manufacturing location compared to Europe. We suddenly have a huge influx of prison labor. (Okay, these last two are way too cynical.)

9) The international profile of AIDS patients is inconsistent. Germ-related diseases affect the same demographics world-wide. This is not the case when American and African results were concluded;

America: 90% Male 10% Female (97% in Risk Groups)
Africa: 50% Male 50% Female (No Risk Groups)

AIDS hits harder in industrialized nations (America and Europe) because it is believed that more IV Drug use is rampant. Dr. Duesberg even believes that the AIDS strain in Africa is a different one than in America. ""Different as day and night.""

Philippe Krynem (French Humanitarian) posted in the London Sunday Times (October 3, 1993) ""There is no AIDS, it is something that has been invented."" After spending time in the so-called ""epicenter"" of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.


10) AIDS occurs without HIV infection. Most people with HIV never develop AIDS. ""The evidence in support of HIV is based solely on correlation."" Correlation does not prove causation. If HIV is a harmless passenger Virus we should see: ""People with AIDS not infected with HIV"" and ""People with HIV who are healthy and do not get AIDS."" That is exactly what is happening. There are 4,621 (in 1993) documented cases where patients with AIDS do not have HIV. 

The CDC Definition of AIDS:

Kaposi Sarcoma + HIV = AIDS
Kaposi Sarcoma - HIV = Kaposi Sarcoma

Pneumonia + HIV = AIDS
Pneumonia - HIV = Pneumonia

Dementia + HIV = AIDS
Dementia - HIV = Dementia

This is their definition. If you have HIV with a certain disease, you have AIDS, if HIV is not present - it's the fault of the original disease. There is no HIV specific disease anywhere. Such a joke. This definition of AIDS ""creates a near 100% correlation between the virus and AIDS."" ""This 'correlation' is not objective, or scientific and is deceptively self-fulfilling.""

~ as of 1993
Estimate of Total HIV infected: 28,000,000? 
Total of Officially reported AIDS cases 1,393,649 (5%)
HIV Infected without AIDS: 95%
Estimated Total Aids cased: 7,700,000???

Anyway, I usually liked to play with minimal infamy score.  Have you ever seen a badboy war?  One playthrough I witnessed Austria get a little carried away with illegally annexing HRE territories and eventually every army in the continent was rolling through the Rhineland fucking shit up.  It was pretty amazing seeing the strongest army in Europe eventually chipped away.  Before the dust even settled Austria's war exhaustion was so high rebels started popping up everywhere and carving out their own pieces for themselves.  Literally cut the entire country into three separate parts.  It was glorious.

Well, not quite. The US put the war in the Pacific on a much lower tier than the war in Europe, and barely enough forces and equipment were committed in the Pacific to ensuring that Japan didn't expand their holdings. Even so, the Japanese were beaten back. If the US had committed their full resources on the Pacific War, it would have been over in very short order, well before 1946.

The Japanese never had a chance. Their entire strategy was a lightning-quick grab at enough resources (again, mostly oil) to negotiate with the US from a position of power.

He might have a point. But the thing is he's an anglosaxon writer talking to anglosaxon readers speaking in terms they can culturally understand and go ""No wonder, these lazy bastards..."", which is what most of this thread is about. Don't get me wrong, but I am a southern european who has lived in anglosaxon countries for more than 12 years and I know both ways of thinking.

Cars are just an example. Having a nice car is something that in southern European countries is a MUST for a lot of people (think Jersey shore, times 100. Portuguese call it 'having a submarine parked next to the slum'). Hey, when I was a 20 yo I was driving a shitty car and when I saw people with way worse jobs than mine driving around these nice, powerful cars I always wondered how did they do that. Well, I have an uncle working in car finance and it turned out to be that it was quite common that some people would put as much as 90% of their monthly salary towards a flashy new car, to be paid in 10 (TEN) years and that's how they could afford a car that was worth nearly 10 times mine. Hey! A lot of them are now nearly 40 and they're still in the same job if lucky and living with their mothers. See now how they can afford to own an expensive car? Stupid, I know.

And that's just an example, I could give you thousands. But the truth is, if you've got a job, it's **nearly impossible** to evade taxes. And even if it wasn't so, for what? Most people wouldn't even consider a job that doesn't pay taxes, because then when you get fired you've got no right to benefits, and believe me, in these countries sooner or later you are gonna be on the dole with a wife and kid and mortgage payments, and that's how most people make it.",True,0,,True,0,0,0,t1_c2w8uaw

Perhaps it's a particularly Scottish thing (I'd like to think so but I may be biased!) but I'd rather be poor and free than a bit less poor but not free.

Probably Europe (including the UK, we may not be in the Euro but we're closely tied to the fate of it) would be considerably poorer if the Euro was to bomb out, and that becomes very likely if Greece defaults... my preference would have been for a Greek default at the start of the bailouts. The problem is that now too far down the line to take that option and it is probably best to continue with the bailouts.

As for the Greek people being stupid I don't believe so. I don't really think that I thought you did either. I did take exception to you deriding farmers making decisions about economics but I answered that elsewhere so I won't go into it again.

Now that I do know you're Greek I do also want you to know I'm sympathetic.

You're dead right on the referendum. The Greek people should have been given the choice of the bailouts (and the implication that they should continue past the first if required) or no bailouts and accepting the bailouts would have been a very reasonable mandate to continue with them. 

The sad part of course is that the clock cannot be turned back. I would imagine the majority of people in Greece feel that a minority have abused the system and gotten rich and fat while Greece was part of the Euro and it isn't fair that everybody in Greece needs to suffer. 

As for the Army officials, that's worrying indeed and the type of thing normally done in a despotism or banana republic. Your PM would seem to be lurching around desperately to save himself.",True,4,SCOT,False,4,0,0,t1_c2w8y9b

[Want to see what happens to Jews in Muslim countries?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries#Rise_of_modern_antisemitism_in_the_Middle_East) 

- **Algeria -** Almost all Jews of Algeria left upon independence in 1962, after being deprived of Algerian citizenship by the authorities.

- **Bahrain -** ...The first two days of demonstrations in Bahrain saw rock throwing against Jews, but on December 5 mobs in the capital of Manama looted Jewish homes and shops, destroyed the synagogue, beat any Jews they could find, and murdered one elderly woman.

- **Egypt -** In June 1948, a bomb exploded in Cairo's Karaite quarter, killing 22 Jews. In July 1948, Jewish shops and the Cairo Synagogue were attacked, killing 19 Jews.[1] Hundreds of Jews were arrested and had their property confiscated. Nearly 40% of the Jewish population of Egypt had left the country by 1950.[12]
In 1951, the fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion was translated into Arabic and promoted as an authentic historical document, fueling anti-Semitic sentiments in Egypt.[39] In 1954, the Lavon Affair served as a pretext for further persecution of Egyptian Jews.
In October 1956, when the Suez Crisis erupted, 1,000 Jews were arrested and 500 Jewish businesses were seized by the government. A statement branding the Jews as ""Zionists and enemies of the state"" was read out in the mosques of Cairo and Alexandria. Jewish bank accounts were confiscated and many Jews lost their jobs. Lawyers, engineers, doctors and teachers were not allowed to work in their professions. Thousands of Jews were ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to take only one suitcase and a small sum of cash, and forced to sign declarations “donating“ their property to the Egyptian government. Foreign observers reported that members of Jewish families were taken hostage, apparently to insure that those forced to leave did not speak out against the Egyptian government. Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left, mainly for Europe, the United States, South America and Israel, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets.

- **Iraq -** In 1941, following Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, riots known as the Farhud broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.

Far from free riding on the US, most of Europe has adjusted its defence spending downwards on the basis that it faces few external threats.  The US  has increased its spending to allow it to carry out unethical and unnecessary wars of aggression. 

&gt;This decline in capability has come about not just because we are spending less, but because we continue to spend badly. Military funding is channelled through dozens of separate national programmes and structures, creating enormous duplication and failing to achieve economies of scale.

He's spot on there. 

&gt;While Europe has half a million more military personnel than America, it can deploy just a fraction of them overseas.

This is a good thing. It limits the  ability of our politicians  to pursue ill conceived military adventures. 

&gt;What America sees in Nato is yesterday’s vision of the future: allies with declining capabilities, reluctant to put troops in harm’s way, and an institution ill-suited to addressing US interests – especially with defence cuts looming in Washington as well.

The British armed forces don't exist to address US interests.

&gt; How do we reassure the Americans that Europeans are committed to the transatlantic alliance?

We shouldn't. NATO has passed its sell by date. US and European interests have diverged. It's time to go our separate ways.

&gt;The answer, therefore, is for Britain and France to lead the way. The starting point would be our recent bilateral defence treaties, which have the potential to deliver real savings through joint procurement, R&amp;D, maintenance, training, and shared military doctrine.

He's back on track. This is the way forward. 

&gt;If European nations can develop an interlocking strategic view as a prelude to common procurement, it will not only create genuine defence co-operation, but allow us to make the huge savings necessary – and start to build a globally competitive European defence industry.

Defence procurement is primarily about politics: giving cash to well connected industry, providing jobs in marginal constituencies, developing kit suitable for export at the expense of domestic needs. A European defence industry would be a mess of internecine procurement wrangles.

&gt;The second problem with the current arrangements is that London and Paris see the new treaties differently. For Eurosceptics, it’s the Entente Cordiale re-created; an exercise stopping at Paris. But for the French, it represents much more ... The French vision is to create a wider process of co-operation between like-minded countries, based on practical steps and national interests. This is the right vision – but it is anathema to some in London.

Spot on again: it's the right way forward but the Eurosceptics won't stand for it.

&gt;Unless others are involved, it will not be able to provide for our collective security when the US declines to lead. 

This has to be our main objective.

Imagine if millions of immigrants fleeing Dafur arrived in Israel and wanted to split Israel in two, half for Jews, half for Africans. Would it be fair to make Israel do this?

I think many Israelis seem to struggle to see Palestinians as the the native people, who were wronged, just as Jews in Arab countries where wronged when they were kicked out. I think this view has to be addressed. Often posters here see Palestinians as guests or pests, who have no real claim to anything, not their land, not their water, not their own history, which is tragic, as in doing this they are erasing their own history and their own humanity.

In many ways, this attitude echoes how the natives of Africa, America and Australia where treated by the Europeans, who today  are embarrassed by those actions.  I have seen  Jews in America wearing Native American head dresses as a way of trying to defend this approach! 

This attitude enables Israel's settlement programme and failure to give  up East Jerusalem, which will doom any 2 state solution. 

In returning to their ancient homeland, Jews were also returning to someone's actual homeland. This has to be acknowledged as does their dispossession. Saying things like there are no Palestinian people, is not the path to take.

That is one of the very reasons I support independence. I think Scotland would be a modern, open, liberal society. I think the breadth of ethnicities elected as SNP MSP's (but also for Holyrood as a whole) is an example of this and nothing demonstrated it better than the swearing in cermony. An independent Scotland could hardly be more  illiberal than the current Union under Blair/Brown or the current incumbents.

Regarding Europe, I think there are as wide a range of views on this within the SNP as you would find among your friends, family and workmates. While the idea of an integrated Europe, without barriers to trade or employment and, importantly, no more wars, is a good idea, the direction of travel is not what we were sold back in the 70's. I wonder if membership of EFTA might not be a better prospect - but that might be academic as Iceland and Norway are considering membership of the EU.

With the way things are changing at the moment who knows what the shape and direction of the EU will be in two years time or whether the Euro will exist. You don't jump your fences until you have to, Alex Salmond knows this and so I think he is keeping his powder dry.

I think things such as the EU and the currency are things to be decided by an independent Scotland rather than the SNP. I think the current position of keeping the status quo will allow for market stability as the ultimate solution emerges, probably through a series of referenda in an independent Scotland.

I don't follow your point about handing back power to Europe we have regained from Westminster. Currently, as part of the UK, these powers reside with Europe. Surely we would only be regaining sovereignty not already pooled with the EU?

&gt;**Antisemitism**
&gt;
&gt;The OIC attracted attention at the opening session of the meeting in Putrajaya, Malaysia, on 16 October 2003, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia in his speech argued that the Jews control the world: ""They invented socialism, communism, human rights, and democracy, so that persecuting them would appear to be wrong, so that they can enjoy equal rights with others. With these they have gained control of the most powerful countries and they, this tiny community, have become a world power.” He also said that “the Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million, but today the Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.”[35][36]


&gt;The speech was very well received by the delegates, including many high ranking politicians, who responded with standing ovations"".[37][38][39] International, non-Muslim reactions, however, were appalled. ""We view [the remarks] with contempt and derision,"" said a U.S. State Department spokesman. The foreign minister of Italy, who was the chairman of the European Union, called the incident ""gravely offensive."" Malaysian officials later clarified that Mahathir had been trying to say that despite having been a marginal and persecuted community the Jews have survived—by use of brains, not brawn. The former prime minister said this in relation to the decline of Muslim knowledge in the 20th Century.[38]

They are well known in the anthropology and archaeology communities and have been rigorously tested, and many ancestors of those tribes were still alive during first contact. Additionally these mounds were known around JS's time as well. Ol' Joe was reported to have dug up some of these mounds himself and on one occasion arbitrarily assigned a Nephite name to a skull he found. Again I must stress that these mounds were in scientific journals that JS would certainly have had access to. Also know that evidence for a large sophisticated society is not proof of the book of mormon, only that a large sophisticated society existed in a particular time and place.  It also cheapens the accomplishments of the American Indians and their complexity of culture by saying it needed outside influence, say from the middle east, to be able to exist as it did.   

As for DNA evidence, the author suggests (very happily) that for the Ojibwa, DNA evidence links them and people from Galilee. I'm in the field of Anth. and have never heard this, so I would politely ask him for evidence. Remember native remains and funerary objects are protected under NAGPRA. Additionally, the video he links discuss the haplogroups associated with native populations. She mentions haplogroup X present in 3% of the population of Natives. Haplogroup X is originated from a mutation some 50,000 years bp from haplogroup N (present in the middle east) and further divided approximately 30,000 years bp to X1 and X2 and then into numerous subclades including x2a and x2g which are found in North America. There are subgroups present in the Altai Region of Central Asia which holds one of the theories of migration to N.A. which this haplogroup came with haplogroups A,B,C,D (which are present in all Native Americans and come from Asia. There is also the Solutrean theory in which the solutrean culture (a stone age culture) Also known as the clovis culture came over during a period of atlantic freeze on boats some 20,000 years ago (which is probable because of the diffusion of material culture) and were there is contact there is...well...you know....bumpin' uglies. Where the Druze group in Galilee have X1 and x2 the subclates do not match. The amount of time needed for mitochondrial mutations is not conducive to the time scale put forth by the book of mormon (which when written was oppurating from the biblical stance on the age of the world which was only 6500 years which is why early anthropologist created modern American racism. Sorry about that). 

Further down on one of that post there is a video where a man is describing a fortification mound and how its defense worked against the laminates. Conjecture is not proof and has no basis in science. He, nor anyone else, has any empirical evidence for what he is saying. 

Again for all of the evidence in the Smithsonian, scrolls with pre-columbian writing? I assume he is referring to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_scroll). I have seen now evidence of written language in prehistoric N.A. as apposed to pictographs, petroglyphs, dendroglyphs, and what we know today as native art that was sometimes done on materials such as Navajo sheep skin in the southwest or cedar bark in the northwest and rolled and saved for ceremonial occasion. 

There were and are today indeed light skinned natives. I myself know of a full blooded native as far back as you can go with fairer skin then me, and my ancestry is northern europe. I must say, there is such thing as human variation and these anomalies exist in any population (not exclusively referring to light skin) and represent in a very real sense evolutionary biology.

Lastly he does talk about the amount of artifacts indicates a massive war. Let me say this, I just excavated what may have been a pit house that house 3 or 4 people over the summer, and the amount of materials and debitage surrounding the structure was staggering. Many archaeological sites yield enough material from a 10% sample to study for a lifetime. Just saying.

I don't think this is necessarily a good thing. The thing that makes video games separate from other forms of media that make popular fiction is that games other media make you the observer. Games have the ability to make you the protagonist.  A generic FPS where you're hand held from Point A to B with cinematic, Michael Bay-esque action scenes spliced in between is not what I would consider to be a good game. 

&gt;Then we have games like Mass Effect that seem to be better science fiction than any of the new Star Wars films. 

Not to nitpick, but I don't really consider Star Wars to be science fiction. Star Wars has a lot more in common with Tolkien than it does with Asimov, so it doesn't take much for something to do science fiction better than it. 

In my opinion, gaming as a whole does not have a golden age, gaming genres have golden ages. If you're a flight sim fan for instance, this is not a golden age for you. There was a time when flight simulators outsold all other PC genres combined. Today, they are made by extremely small boutique development studios and Eastern Europeans.

&gt; Yeah she should be. ""even worse"" you sound like she was shot with a gun. She was hit with a belt that will leave bruises for all of 2 or 3 days. I'm from eastern Europe. Your definition of abuse is a lesser punishment in our society, and most of the world.

Example of fundamental disagreement that will never be overcome. Also, this happened in Texas, not in Eastern Europe. Although this can be debated from a Eastern European perspective I don't really see the point in that, because the actual decision of punishment will come from an American perspective. Say what you want about American law ought to be, but more useful is what the law currently is.

&gt; Motives don't matter in legal situations? Should I even continue reading the rest of your argument? Motives most certainly do count.

Hmm well I'm not well versed in legal matters, but I think that this particular motive, whatever it may be, won't change the punishment. But I don't know.

&gt; Not because I had it worse, but because she chose to break the rules and planted a camera anticipating her father would punish her. She then refused to cooperate, perhaps further increasing the punishment. Point is, she knew it was being recorded, her parents didn't, she could have set the situation up in her favor.

So you're saying she provoked her and set up the situation in the case where if the parents knew the full outcome, they would have acted differently? So if police record someone speeding in say, a rural highway where few people expect to get caught, they ""set up"" the situation? And should the parents have behaved this way even if they knew there was no camera? See, that's where the fundamental disagreement comes in. You'd say that they could have done it and not be in the wrong, whereas I think they'd be in the wrong..

&gt; That's your opinion. Her parents are obviously fearful of technology, for all they knew they could be getting a lawsuit that could cost them the house had she been caught. This isn't over the top. We can from her mother talking that they had gone over this before.

Another fundamental disagreement, since I think it's over the top and you don't.

&gt; So complete disregard for your elders is something completely acceptable in America. I can live with this. I'm not sure how you can. It's parental authority, and you obey it unless it's out of line. Her parents disapproved against her PIRATING, which we all know is such a noble cause. I hate paying for stuff so I steal it all the time too. My parents tried to tell me I was wrong but I made a call to the police that my dad beat me and that was that. /S

For the first part, I'm simply pointing out that the thing is not effective. Say what you want about what American parental authority/child relationships should be, but in the context of the existing situation, the punishment would not have been effective. I'm not supporting the disregard for authority, you misinterpreted. I'm pointing out the effect. Forst the second part, I already said ""Perhaps she was in the wrong, ok, I won't argue w/ that.""

&gt; So if she is really abused then if nobody cares about her statements because they are banal and unoriginal such as ""my dad is abusing me"" people won't care? Good argument.

I am against banalities not because they have been said so much, but against the specific ones that have been refuted many many times. I think that yours have been repeated many times and subsequently responded to, but that's just how it appears to me.

&gt; Indeed they do. God forbid they say something like ""My child is out of line"" when punishing their children. Every parent needs an original line or their actions are null and void right?

Again, they need a valid line, not necessarily original. Some problems are common throughout families, I'd say.

Think of it as a paradigm. Fighting wasn't a beneficial endeavor before agriculture (it was easier to move somewhere else than fight another group for where they currently were). It was almost as if people just didn't even think it was a thing to do at all.

But when people settled down and started *storing* food and resources, then war became ""profitable"". Fighting was only useful because there existed other, non-nomadic cultures which had a lot of resources stored up so that their populations could grow. That ""warrior"" paradigm started to spread to traditionally nomadic cultures. And in the case of Native Americans, they had no choice **but** to fight the Europeans. They could leave their range, but that would just allow the ""warrior"" paradigm to spread into their land. They could build weapons and resist, but that too would merely spread the warrior paradigm. Or they could simply not-resist, but this also wouldn't prevent the warrior mentality from spreading.

In that sense, agriculture *isn't* natural because it contradicts our biological and evolutionary make-up. Other species may practice what looks like agriculture (ants ""farming"" fungus), but the difference is we practice agriculture principally for the purpose of storing surplus for population growth.

Unfortunately we're now at a point where our agricultural infrastructure is completely dependent on a resource in dwindling supply (oil, and I suppose fresh water as well). Anthropological statisticians estimate the world can only support about 1-2 billion people without *cheap and equitable* oil. We'll have oil for a long time, but we've sucked up all the sweet, light crude, and are left with the dregs now. Life is going to be really, really hard from here on out.

Greece sought every opportunity they could to hide their debt. I'd hardly county Goldman liable for the mess they've got themselves into.

&gt;France and Germany, and probably the US, can't let Greece fail because their banks are highly over-leveraged and invested in Greece. Bailing out Greece is actually bailing themselves out.

Well you ignore the second part of that point, which is that part of self defense is your ability to convince others to help defend your rights.  But I don't believe in the concept of ""rights"" as it's commonly used in politics, because typically the statist will claim the rights are either derived from some non-existent entity like Government or God, or at best try to back them up with a logic-based argument similar to Hans Hoppe's ""self ownership"" claim (which I'm currently grappling with and undecided on).

So rights don't exist like a chair or a shoe does, they're just a customary mode of behavior.

&gt;Gay people have been successful at gaining popular support in recent years, but you ignore that one way the gay movement did this was through the successful deployment of political power via government.

I disagree with this point, and I'm not sure you can back up your claim.  Basically your claim has to be something along the lines of:  ""The people inside government are generally more sympathetic of gays than the people outside government, even though the people outside government select the people inside government.""

Your claim against the marketplace not protecting gay rights is also lacking evidence.  Markets cater to consumer desires.  Gays have a variety of goods/services that are produced specifically for them.  Gay people are also capable of buying guns and protecting themselves, assuming they choose to do so.

&gt;True. But there's no reason why this will always be the case. Trendlines are moving in the direction of federal recognition as we stand.

Gay rights have existed in previous societies, to a much greater degree than they do today.  Regression in this area is very possible, especially in the event of a total economic collapse (as I expect will occur in the US and Europe very soon).

Things will continue down hill from there, with Greece declaring bankruptcy and breaking away from the EU. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland wills soon follow. This will result in a severe economic backlash *on top* of the recession, causing us to slip farther into depression. This will happen by spring.

As the economy collapses, we'll see a revival of the Arab Spring, and this time there won't be any way to contain it. It will spread all across Africa and the Middle East, causing a sharp rise in the price of oil. As oil prices soar NATO will probably start intervening in Saudi Arabia, and that entire region will basically implode in war. The nations will start picking sides, and with most of the world's powerful nations involved we'll be facing World War III.

The war will drag on for many years, claiming millions of lives and destroying country after country.

In case you haven't noticed, the entire world is suffering from crisis. My generation is going to be paying for bail-outs for years to come. Why the fuck should Greece be any different?

Why should the Greek people be burdened by debt?

I'm genuinely astounded that you think it's right for the Greeks to get a free ride on this one. The Germans didn't give their people a referendum on the bail out - you know why?

That's why they called the referendum. It's binding (Greece has constitutional provisions on what referendums can be held and as long as there's 40% or 50% turnout it's binding - they've only ever had 1 other referendum to get rid of the monarchy).

If they vote ""yes"" he's hoping that unrest would settle down as the public obviously wants it. If they vote ""no"" well then the shit's going to hit the fan.

I think that despite the unrest, it's still a 50-50 vote. A lot of people realize the alternative is total chaos. Even the opposition parties realize this, which is why they want elections not a referendum.

No political party is seriously considering default I don't think. As long as PASOK has a parliamentary majority, the opposition can vote against austerity measures knowing that they will pass anyway and they get political brownie points. Now, they have to put their money where their mouth is and tell people to either vote yes or no - the worst possible situation for any political party.

In essence, he's made it a black and white issue, and forced the other parties to play ball rather than oppose it from the safety of their minority positions. 

This is the reason the opposition wants elections, because they can gain power, and still continue what was started under the guise that it's a one way street.

It's a very dangerous game, but the social situation is reaching critical point and something needs to give. He's banking on the people to vote ""yes"" and the opposition to oppose any default as well. 

Possibly, and this is a long shot, he's also banking on the situation getting so desperate so as to prompt some other action from the EU. Italy certainly now has more impetus to press ahead crucial reforms. The private sector also, now faced with a 100% loss (plus a lot more if CDSs are triggered) may agree to more than their current 50% ""haircut"" or agree to swap short term bonds for long term ones. 

One thing is certain. This is possibly the ultimate game of brinkmanship. He's not only put Greece on the line, but the entire European (some would say global) recovery.

Actually, that's not true. Without delving into the details (the Devil is there), the current projections still leave Greece with a 120% debt:GDP ratio in the year 2020. It is barely sustainable with the best case projection (an unlikely event).  The people will suffer and still have to pay on the debt. It does not alleviate their problems. It exacerbates them.

&gt;What should we do then?

Reject all the debt. Every single penny. Reset. Start over.

&gt;Because we don't live in some fantasy world where it's acceptable to fuck over the entirety of Europe just because you want to retire at 61 and live a lazy life.

You think they'll be able to do that if they reject the debt? No fucking way.

Further, Europe bears responsibility for allowing it to occur in the first place. The Greeks did not do this wholly on their own. Everyone was greedy. EVERYONE.

&gt;Should the Germans, who retire at 68, just pay for all of Greece's debt and let them carry on living their lazy lives until they incur another massive debt crisis in 10 years time?

The only way they'll incur such a debt again is if someone is once again stupid and greedy enough to buy that debt.

&gt;I'm genuinely astounded that you think it's right for the Greeks to get a free ride on this one.

Rejection of the debt will not entail a free ride by any means. Who's living in a fantasy world? They'll have to start all over again from scratch.

&gt;Because they knew the answer would be 'no' and they knew that the bail-out was the best thing for Europe.

Oh that's right. The ""elites"" who created this whole mess know better. Get real.

&gt;The bail-out package isn't remotely fair on countries like Germany, and is a massive favour to Greece and it's frankly disgusting that they're now set to reject it.

Oh please. Germany wants it as much as anyone.

The bailouts are not a ""favor."" They are a burden. They require the Greek people suffer while everyone else is OK. That's insane.

&gt;It's an absurd ad hominem argument, based on no facts whatsoever.

* The EU is very undemocratic, it takes too much power away from the citizens. 

* The laws are bent to suit political aims rather than sticking to the rule of law, or rule of treaty (see 3% budget deficit limits) 

* Several countries used creative accounting to get in to the eurozone and are now crying because they squandered billions and did not reform their own markets to be more competitve (see Club Med countries)

* Pathetic economic protectionism, mainly by the French but there are others as well, where Danone is cited as a strategic industry. 

* CAP - this is so wrong I don't know where to begin.

* The absurd migration from Brussells to Strasbourg of the Eu parliament only to keep the French happy. What a waste of 250 million.

The EU I would like to be a part of would offer something more than corrupt MEPs and inept bureaucrats in Brussells. Yes, the Uk has its problems but none of them will be solved by joining the eurozone or further integrating with the EU.

You do realize that from an Eastern European perspective, the US and UK were countries that happened elsewhere. The war was between the Nazi and Soviet Empires. So like... which one of those are you talking about here?

&gt;  What about their plans to work the 'untermensch' in the east to death in slave labour? What about the fact that they began a war of aggression which caused tens of millions of deaths? 

Still quite unclear which one you're talking about. (Yes, I know who *you* are talking about, but that's probably because for you history was taught from a very Western perspective)

&gt; I fail to see any advantages that a violent and barbarous regime like Nazi Germany's could possibly provide to outweigh the vast, vast amount of harm and suffering they wished to inflict on everyone who did not fit within their extremely narrow view of the world.

Again, the Soviets were hardly better, and they were the ones that in many ways won the war. Before the war 'the West' was actually bigger than it was after the war, where as the USSRs sphere of influence was decidedly larger and it had consumed nearly 100 million people.

&gt; You mean for Germans, and maybe a select few nations deemed racially pure enough.

Hard to say, especially in the longer term. In the short term obviously Germany's allies would have benefited. In the longer term I suspect Fascism would have gone away faster than communism did, though that is obviously impossible to prove one way or another.

Like I said, in Eastern Europe it was Stalin v. Hitler, which is pretty much terror v. terror. Once you acknowledge that it's all going to suck anyway, the next questions are:    
How bad, for how many and for how long?     

I suspect German victory would have been better for #2 (how many) and #3 (how long), though I suspect it might have been a bit worse in #1 (how bad). I'd be curious to hear of your opinion on this.

Of course there *are* areas liberated by the Western allies: France, Netherlands, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. The question regarding those is:

What *would* have happened with them had Germany won against the Soviet Union? I certainly imagine there could have been a peace treaty drawn where Hitler - who always did pretty much what he had written down, though people always seemed to ignore his writings - gave up his Western holdings (who he always had claimed were peers anyway) to keep his Eastern holdings (most critically, the vast plains of Russia). 

In such a case the situation would have been pretty damn identical to what ended up happening anyway:     
Cold War in Europe with France/US/UK on one side and a powerful totalitarian country on the other. The border would have shifted left a little bit, but on the other hand the ideological schism wouldn't have gone too far.

&gt;One of the most troublesome questions about Utopia is Thomas More's reason for writing it.

&gt;Most scholars see it as some kind of comment or criticism of contemporary European society, for the evils of More's day are laid out in Book I and in many ways apparently solved in Book II.[5] Indeed, Utopia has many of the characteristics of satire, and there are many jokes and satirical asides such as how honest people are in Europe, but these are usually contrasted with the simple, uncomplicated society of the Utopians.

&gt;Yet, the puzzle is that, some of the practices and institutions of the Utopians, such as the ease of divorce, euthanasia and both married priests and female priests, seem to be polar opposites of More's beliefs and the teachings of the Catholic Church of which he was a devout member. Another often cited apparent contradiction is that of the religious toleration of Utopia contrasted with his persecution of Protestants as Lord Chancellor. Similarly, the criticism of lawyers comes from a writer who, as Lord Chancellor, was arguably the most influential lawyer in England. However, it can be answered that as a pagan society Utopians had the best ethics that could be reached through reason alone, or that More changed from his early life to his later when he was Lord Chancellor.[6]

&gt;One highly influential interpretation of Utopia is that of Quentin Skinner.[7] He has argued that More was taking part in the Renaissance humanist debate over true nobility, and that he was writing to prove the perfect commonwealth could not occur with private property. Crucially, he sees Hythloday as embodying the Platonic view that philosophers should not get involved in politics and the character of More as the more pragmatic Ciceronic view; thus the society Hythoday proposes is the ideal More would want, but without communism, which he saw no possiblity of occuring, it was wiser to take a more pragmatic view. Utopia is thus More's ideal, but an unobtainable one, explaining why there are inconsistencies between the ideas in Utopia and More's practice in the real world.

&gt; Further evidence can be cited to show that More intended for us to see Utopia as genuinely his ideal society. The method of making a story about an imaginary place told by an imaginary man has the effect of distancing More from his radical political thoughts. Apart from Utopia, meaning ""Noplace,"" several other lands are mentioned: Achora meaning ""Nolandia"", Polyleritae meaning ""Muchnonsense"", Macarenses meaning ""Happiland,"" and the river Anydrus meaning ""Nowater"". These names are designed to emphasise the illusory nature of the work and Raphael's last name, Hythlodaeus meaning ""dispenser of nonsense"" helps to discredit his words among those who get the joke.

&gt; The name Raphael, though, may have been chosen by More to remind his readers of the archangel Raphael who is mentioned in the Book of Tobit. In that book the angel guides Tobias and later cures his father of his blindness. While Hythloday may suggest his words are not to be trusted, Raphael meaning ""God has healed"" suggests that Raphael may be opening the eyes of the reader to what is true. The suggestion that More may have agreed with the views of Raphael is given weight by the way he dressed; with ""his cloak was hanging carelessly about him""; a style which Roger Ascham reports that More himself was wont to adopt. Furthermore, more recent criticism has questioned the reliability of both Gile's annotations and the character of ""More"" in the text itself. Claims that the book only subverts Utopia and Hythloday are possibly oversimplistic.",True,4,,False,4,0,0,t1_c2wdp7r

&gt;Yes there will be pain for the middle classes but as other countries in similar situations have shown, it may resolve itself quicker than most 

Maybe but it all depends on your priorities. If your priorities are independence and maintaining state wealth, you might be willing to sacrifice your short term happiness for that. After all if you arent independent and if you sell out everything, you are just moving the problem further down the future. What will happen in 2020 when Greece will have 120% debt with most of the state wealth sold for scraps?

We will still be greatly indebted and we will have no wealth. What makes you think that will be better for us? Most people think that we get money for free while in fact we dont get money for free, we get loans. 

And you might say ""what about the 50% haircut""? That haircut doesnt affect most of our loans. If anything it affects mostly our retirement funds. Out of the 300billion estimated debt, it only affects like 60 billions. The debt towards the european central bank and imf isnt affected. So we essentially get ""30 billion for free"", many of those come from greek banks and greek retirement/healthcare funds(which were funded by the greek state anyway since we have state healthcare/pension system for the most part).

And in exchange we keep getting new loans(so we become more indebted), we sell whatever state wealth we have(harbours, airports, real estate, energy production company, etc), shitload of unemployment, crap wages, etc. The alternative would be to get out of EU, ditch euro and get a cheap currency to make Greece an attractive investement place. At the very least a very attractive vacation place. This automatically greatly increases our exports and brings in investments and jobs.

Essentially what every damn country in the world does. You have your own currency, thus you can do whatever the damn you want. You are in command of your own economical policy. You want to increase exports, you drop the value of your currency. And with protectionism, you can still maintain low prices on basic goods(like food).",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2wdy0f

&gt;Like other key thinkers during the European Enlightenment, Voltaire considered himself a deist, expressing the idea: ""What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.""
 &gt;
&gt;As for religious texts, Voltaire's opinion of the Bible was mixed. Although influenced by Socinian works such as the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum, Voltaire's skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical-political writers like John Locke.
&gt; 
&gt;This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Catholic Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire's death, saying, ""The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket....""

This is not uncontroversial in the country, but I find it kind of hard that they would want to do a 180, especially now that they want to join the EU. Egypt have their own inner turmoil to deal with for the moment, the military junta would probably rather work to secure their position in the country for the time being. Syria and Hezbollah aren't really strong enough to mount a serious fight Israel, though I doubt that Israel would go to an attack alone. This could be seen in combination with the US escalation of forces close to Iran. Are we seeing the buildup to a war between an US-Israel coalition against Iran? There are certainly forces in all countries who would like this, though Iran would probably have liked to be stronger and have more allies. The only countrie that really comes to mind that I know are friendly to Iran, at least on their side in opposition to the US, is Venezuela. For them to declare war would be a stretch and a disastrous decision on their part. They have oil, though. They might stop selling to the US altogether.

When it comes to the rest of the Middle East, I'm a little unsure about how regional politics have played out in Irans favour/disfavour. Some countries might be closer to Saudi Arabia and hence be hesitant to go against one of SAs allies, or they might have direct financial ties with the US. I think Iran would be hard pressed to find a clear ally in the region and you have to be well endoved in the ball region to want to go to war with the US in the first place. I think the danger might rather be for the future, as a war with Iran might get the different peoples and countries of the region to forget their differences in opposition to the US. A more united Middle East might become a way bigger threat to the US in the future.

Pakistan, I think, are scared to defy the US. China are too smart to go to direct war with the US, though they might supply the other side, as you pointed out.

Those are some hefty myths right there. First of all, Iran has proxies which border Israel: Syria and Hezbollah. Second, Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah all have *tons* of rockets and missiles with the capability of blanketing Israel in ordnance. Sure, Israel's little ""Iron Dome"" might be able to take out a few, but they will be insanely overwhelmed. So they can sit back and just fire missiles and *still* cause more damage than Israel ever could with its air force, which can barely make it to Iran and only by violating Jordanian and Iraqi air space, the later of which will *certainly* not have any of that. The idea that Israel owns the air is laughable. They have good planes, no doubt, but in order to own the air you must get rid of any enemy air defenses, which Iran has up the wazoo. Syria also has some air defenses as well, and Israel operating over Lebanon will simply draw the Lebanese military into the fight, besides causing more civilian deaths than military deaths. Israel will take heavy losses if they try to continuously bomb Iran, plain and simple. In the end, those losses could never be worth whatever damage they might be able to cause (which wouldn't be that much). 

&gt; but from non-governmental sources.

Iran and Syria are both governmental sources, and Hezbollah is technically part of the Lebanese government.

&gt;Syria is the only state actor that is in a position to do something, but there's no way they'll challenge a completely unoccupied Israeli army by themselves - that'd be suicide, particularly in the middle of their own uprising.

You seem to think that raining ballistic missiles all over the country *isn't* doing something. That is very wrong. It's also wrong to think Syria couldn't do something against Israel, or that Israel would be completely unoccupied. They would be dealing with Hezbollah and Hamas *plenty*. And if 2006's Israel-Lebanon war is any indication, the Israeli military ain't all it's cracked up to be. They would not be able to just run over the Syrians like they did in the past, mostly because of anti-tank and anti-air missile advances since then. Syria might take the opportunity to take back the Golan Heights, which they could do because Israel would be occupied getting the shit bombed out of them and Hamas and Hezbollah (and probably all Palestinians) making life hell.

&gt;I suspect the big players of Turkey, Egypt and Saudi-Arabia would secretly be delighted, while internally and on the international stage condemning the shit out of Israel and using its actions for their own benefit.

You don't understand Saudi Arabia. They are allies of Israel and enemies of Iran. They *want* Israel to attack Iran because Iran challenges their own regional supremacy. 

&gt;The real question would be someone - Russia, China or even the EU - supplying high quality air force and air defenses to Iran. I wouldn't be too shocked of, say, the French provided some SAM systems after Israeli air raids (though I doubt the EU would give anything that could be used in an aggressive fashion).

Ridiculous. The EU wouldn't give Iran squat. And how do you not know about the S-300 SAM systems Iran already acquired?? They also have the S-200 system, as well as a number of other systems which are more than capable of dealing with both the Israeli and the US air force.

Both have recreated a sizeable chunk of what the US did with Nimitz but neither are quite there. Britain lacks nuclear powered range. The French options lack raw capacity.

OTOH we don't have an equivalent to the F-35 nor does it seem we will have one any time soon. Again practiced integrated defence policy would have allowed us to make a Eurofigher and a carrier launchable fighter that is designed for the role rather than tacked on.

EU infrastructure is currently designed to play a supporting role to the US. We add meat to the picture but rely on the US for specialised equipment and can't take on missions like the F-22 can. With full EU defence co-operation we could actually have a complete, end to end, military capability like the US and for cheaper than we currently spend.

Read the news much? Not only were they never allies of Israel, but they downgraded relations with them.

&gt;This is not uncontroversial in the country, but I find it kind of hard that they would want to do a 180, especially now that they want to join the EU. 

They've been pissed at Israel quite a bit recently. It wouldn't be a 180. And Israel starting a regional war for no reason is a pretty serious issue. It may not seem like a big deal to you because you're not living there, but those people will certainly feel the effects, even in non-belligerent nations. And do you *really think* Turkey wants to join the EU at *this* point?? The EU is on its last legs.

&gt;Egypt have their own inner turmoil to deal with for the moment, the military junta would probably rather work to secure their position in the country for the time being.

The military isn't the only power in charge. The Muslim Brotherhood is also quite powerful there now. While the military might be calling the shots, the people have shown that their will is not to be trifled with. They already nearly stormed the Israeli embassy, which could have caused a war right then and there. They *hate* Israel, and if the military wants to keep power it will listen to the will of the people, and that will probably land them on the side against Israel should they choose to start a new war, especially if Gaza and the West Bank are heavily involved, which they will be.

&gt;Syria and Hezbollah aren't really strong enough to mount a serious fight Israel, though I doubt that Israel would go to an attack alone.

That's just ignorant. They both have thousands of rockets and missiles and would blanket Israel in them. They don't *have* to invade Israel in order to deal serious damage. Syria is not without military power. They have closed the gap between them and the Israelis substantially. If it was just them and Israel they would surely lose, but it's not just them. Israel will be occupied with Hamas, Hezbollah, the rest of Palestine, and all of the missiles and rockets raining down on them. That will allow Syria to possibly take back the Golan Heights, that is if their insurrection problem goes away. Who knows, maybe they could still do it. Maybe the people will rally around Assad just because they hate Israel more.

&gt;The only countrie that really comes to mind that I know are friendly to Iran, at least on their side in opposition to the US, is Venezuela.

So you don't know much about the Middle East or the world, huh?

&gt; For them to declare war would be a stretch and a disastrous decision on their part. They have oil, though. They might stop selling to the US altogether.

Who says they have to declare war in order to make an oil embargo against the US?

&gt; I think Iran would be hard pressed to find a clear ally in the region and you have to be well endoved in the ball region to want to go to war with the US in the first place.

Iran and Syria have a defense pact, so no, it's actually pretty easy. The US isn't some all-powerful god of war. They're currently getting schooled in Afghanistan on why you don't try to occupy people that already hate you. The US has better command and control and stealth planes (which only give so much benefit to the plane), and that's pretty much it. Other than that, Iran has similar capabilities. They also have the ability to decimate any US carrier fleet that comes near them, so I don't think they're too worried.

&gt; I think the danger might rather be for the future, as a war with Iran might get the different peoples and countries of the region to forget their differences in opposition to the US.

Hate to break it to you, but that time is now. There's very little chance for war in another 3 years when you factor everything in. It's looking like it will be soon or never.

&gt;A more united Middle East might become a way bigger threat to the US in the future.

Only if the US continues to try to occupy it and meddle with it. If we GTFO and mind our own business they will have nothing to hate us for.

&gt;Pakistan, I think, are scared to defy the US.

That's why they've been courting the Chinese.

&gt;China are too smart to go to direct war with the US, though they might supply the other side, as you pointed out.

They have no reason to go to direct war with us. They wouldn't be able to gain that much. Making it costly for us by supply the other side would yield more benefit than the effort they would have to put in.

&gt;I would say the same goes for Russia (weren't Russia involved in providing nuclear material to Iran or some such?).

Russia has already provided plenty of air defenses to Iran, including their S-300 system, which will make any air attack much more difficult. They had a plan to deliver fissile material for the purpose of fueling reactors and for use in medical research, but those products are only enriched a tiny amount, whereas nuclear weapons require highly enriched uranium. Such highly enriched material is difficult to make and would be more easily noticed than other material. That's why Israel always says they're a few years away from a bomb. They know how to make a bomb (the CIA gave them plans for one, hoping the flaw they made would slow them down, though they didn't tell the nuclear scientist who was giving them the plans for them and he alerted them to an error, which he said was obvious). The problem is that it takes years to make highly enriched uranium.",True,3,,False,3,0,0,t1_c2we9ho

As a direct financial supporter of MLG, to what extent is it fair to say that I am pirating anything? Am I getting something without paying for it? I am already paying MLG to provide me with a content delivery service, and to the extent their distribution network fails to distribute an otherwise *free product*, I have already compensated MLG for any ad revenue losses caused by their short-term inflexibility. 

The entire purpose of a subscription is to get their content in high quality and ad-free. Should they do something to disrupt the third party distribution without implementing their own solution at least as well, the result would be that they have damaged their own content. It would actually jeopardize their revenue by influencing my decision to continue sponsoring them, because now their content is less valuable to me.

So to put it shortly: *I challenge the notion that I am pirating anything in the first place.*

The bottom line is that as a paying customer, MLG is failing to adequately provide me with a nominally free service. I would like to get what I pay for, especially when the market price of the good is $0 anyway.

&gt; One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It’s a service issue. The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates. For example, Russia. You say, oh, we’re going to enter Russia, people say, you’re doomed, they’ll pirate everything in Russia. Russia now outside of Germany is our largest continental European market.

Society is nothing but individuals interacting with one another: moreover, to the extent that they're interacting freely, that is a proper human society. With respect to the degree of coercion present in their interactions, that is the degree to which their interactions take place in a context that is something other than a human society. As such, I don't know what ""obligations"" you're talking about. People incur only the obligations they sign up for. 

Are you talking about public education or something like that? You'll note that people are enrolled as children, and that their enrollment is coerced. I'll just set aside for the sake of argument the question of whether public education and truancy laws are right or wrong; what I want to know is how you can explain that such an arrangement incurs an obligation -- even a moral one, if not necessarily a legal one?

Rand's philosophy is that obligations are not automatically incurred.

As to the relationship between industrialization and public education, industrialization happened in Europe and the United States long before public education; in fact, it was only the wealth produced through industrialization that allowed for the *luxury* of universal education supported by tax dollars. Are you saying that public education should have been mandated in 1,000 A.D., that peasants scratching a living out of the soil should have sent their children -- read: *farmhands* -- to school during the day, and that we could have had industrialization that much sooner? Too bad public education wasn't started back in the Stone Age.

As to luck and externalitites, I'm really not sure what you're talking about. *Atlas Shrugged* is a novel, and as such everything in their ought to serve some dramatic purpose. I can't read into it that luck doesn't ever happen and externalities are always negative. Would the book be better if one of its heroes was on his way to a job interview and had another applicant for the job accidentally fall down a flight of stairs and break his leg, thus ensuring that our hero got the job, though he might have been slightly less qualified for it? That can happen in real life, but what purpose would it serve in a novel? 

Now, all that aside, when I read the book, what I got from it was the idea that a commitment to reason as one's highest value essentially means being honest with oneself and honest towards others. I also took from it the idea that there is no unearned obligation or guilt. That's not the same as saying that charity is a bad thing. Charity shouldn't be motivated from some sense of guilt or obligation. Lastly, life is valuable and should be appreciated as such because *that's all there is.* There's nothing afterwards.

And now that the results of these bad decisions are coming home to roost, the Greeks want to just turn around and burn Europe instead of dealing with the consequences? That's shitty.

It wasn't because I was seeking a partner of my own race (or of *any* specific race).

...and if my kids end up marrying people of different cultural or racial backgrounds, I have no problem with it. Why would I care? I live in one of the most ethnically-diverse neighbourhoods in my province. I think it's something like 35% non-white. I see native, Asian and black people *every day*. I live next to some of them.

&gt;The European Union parliament has ratified the latest Brussels directive on ‘child exploitation’, the second such directive in five years.
[…]
But from several EU press releases, which are then uncritically re-printed in numerous mainstream media outlets under banners such as ‘EU cracks down on paedos’ etc, it is possible to ascertain the following key points :

&gt;* Possession of child porn will be punished with a minimum 1 year prison sentence.

&gt;* The definition of child porn will include any **cartoon** or **virtual image** of a person appearing to be under 18 and which is in a remotely sexual context.
* Possession of child porn will include the mere viewing of it. (In other words, if **one** picture of a **sexy manga girl in a bikini or a half naked rikku pic passes through your browser – internet cache – recycle bin, the courts will have no choice but to impose a minimum 1 year prison term if you are arrested and charged**. Likewise, if you are surfing an American porn tube site, and a thumbnail of a ‘barely legal 18 year old’ college girl video passes through your browser, you will face 1 year in prison without even having to have clicked on the thumbnail and watched the video).

&gt;With this, the USA is the only Western country in which lolicon is still technically legal. The USA has introduced bans in the past, but they have been struck down as unconstitutional. It is only a matter of time before some idiot judge somewhere upholds a loli ban in the USA, and then loli will be illegal in all of western civilization.

*However*, there are a few pretty big issues with it.  If you go roach in the mid-game, you won't have the upgrades for ultralisks or banelings, making them very cost inefficient vs a toss who has been upgrading well.  Additionally, ultralisk pathing generally limits how many you can make whilst still engaging in a reasonable manner.  This leads to the biggest problem, IMO - banelings are cost inefficient against most armoured units even without spreading.

That said, the two major reasons I don't use this style are high templar, immortal and archons.  All are very gass intensive, but so are ultras and banelings.  Well placed storms will *evaporate* speed banes, especially if you engage off creep, and immortals counter ultralisks so hard it isn't funny (as well as tanking baneling hits very nicely).  Likewise, archons are effective against both - and particularly so vs reinforcing zerglings - if the toss merges his archons after storming.  Stalkers are also cost efficient vs banelings, and an do a good job vs ultralisks with good blink micro and support.

IMO on equal economy, baneling/ultra depends on the ability of toss to respond.  I've used it at as a master zerg on EU and many Toss don't know how to counter - many keep making collossi/stalker which gets rolled by this comp.  However, it's a strategy that relies on your opponent screwing up - either in the early game to give you a huge base lead, or in the late game by sticking to collossus/stalker/zealot/sentry.",True,12,,False,12,0,0,t1_c2wfaxt

What tone?? I asked if you read the news much. You seem uninformed.

&gt;but before this Turkey has cooperated a lot with Israel. My guess is that this will blow over, Turkey are historically one of Israels strongest allies in the region and that is not without consequences.

And that was *before*, when Turkey was more beholden to the US and its influence, which it no longer is. They were never allies, by the way. Being an ally is by treaty. The *US* isn't even an ally of Israel (because we don't want to have to go to war just for them). It's not going to blow over, though. The US's influence is shrinking along with the world's patience for Israel. The whole world can now see what Israel does on a daily basis, and people can have a big influence, as we've recently seen.

&gt;Turkey has a long history of wanting to join the EU.

Again, that was before. Do you seriously think they are still serious about joining a group of countries on the verge of economic collapse? The EU is about the fall apart, so why would they join a sinking ship?

&gt;The current military junta are probably governing by realistic politics and from such a perspective they are unlikely to join the clearly weaker side in a struggle like this.

The realistic politics is that the people just ousted a dictator because they didn't like his ""realistic politics"". If you think they're going to continue to be warm and cozy with Israel then you haven't been paying attention.

&gt;Again with the tone. Can't you just say that you disagree with me?

You're hearing things. Ignorant was the correct term. It doesn't matter whether I agree or disagree.

&gt;Chavez is very anti-US so if it wasn't for the geographical location, Venezuela would probably band together with Iran in the prospect of a war.

They have the US puppet state of Colombia right next door. But they don't need to go to war to hurt the US. They have economic weapons.

&gt;I wouldn't say that the US is getting ""schooled"" in Afghanistan.

*I* would. You don't fail to occupy a country over 10 years without getting totally schooled.

&gt; They are not reaching their goals, sure, but those goals aren't purely militaristic and they're fighting a fight where it would be hard for them to win without oppressing everyone blatantly.

The US accepted the challenge knowing exactly what they would be doing, and they've been taken to task by the Taliban. Plain and simple. The Taliban have showed them that they can't win an occupation in a hostile land. Not with force, not with ""hearts and minds"", not with politics.

&gt;In military force the US ""schooled"" Afghanistan pretty quickly

Really? Because last time I checked they were still fighting. There's more to war than rolling your tanks down the streets and saying ""I won I won!"" 

&gt;Iran has a military.

FTFY.

&gt;but Iraq had one of the largest military foces in the world when the US invaded, remember?

Seriously? That is *incredibly* ignorant. Now I have to teach you about the Gulf War... *ugh!* Iraq had an ass-load of untrained conscripts using beat up, old Soviet crap that they didn't know how to use. The only reason they knew anything about fighting was because they spent 8 or 9 years fighting the Iranians, which were even worse off than *they* were *AND* the Iraqis had US help. So in 1991, Iraq had the biggest band of idiots with guns and tanks they didn't know how to use. They used a combination of WWI and WWII tactics in their war against Iran and used much the same tactics against the US. Turns out that means you lose against the US, considering we won both of those. Iran today, however, is a *totally* different beast. They've tailored their entire military as best they can for a showdown with the US, for obvious reasons. They have thousands of special forces, missiles, missiles, missiles, and more missiles. Missiles work, by the way. They're easy to use, effective, and hard to stop, plus they're relatively cheap. They work on tanks, air planes, and ships. They even work on buildings and runways really far away. They've got *all of that shit*. And they know how to use it. They *will* use it in a war and it will not be pretty for their targets. I hope you get the point.

My take on cost of living: if you are willing to live in a very small city or a rural area (and can make close to as much money there as you would in a city), living in a less interesting place could be worth it. But saving a few dollars by living in a shitty medium-sized city versus living in a world-class city is not worth it at all.

As far as being effective uncarved, iceland spar calcite naturally cleaves into optically effective rhomboids.  No carving necessary.  

&gt;Oh yeah, and they've reviewed the evidence that it works, but so did my scout group.

Yes, there haven't been any new discoveries.  The article uses the thin veneer of a new experiment to dress up a well worn story as news.

But the Vikings wrote about a valuable stone that was used, by people with expertise, to find the sun in a cloudy sky.  They were famous navigators in an era when compasses weren't known in Europe.  I don't think it is a stretch to assume they were using calcite to navigate. I think it is more of a stretch to think they were locating the position of the sun but not using it for navigation.

Violence in Christian societies has ranged from institutionalized witch hunts to full-on wars waged by quasi-theocratic governments. 

Yes, I argue on a regular basis that when a point is reached where the line of fault separating politics, poverty, emotional distress, psychological stability, religious conviction, tribalism, etc, has been blurred beyond recognition, then the undeniable correlation must be acknowledged, and an attempt made to establish how much of a contribution was made by each factor.

German cruelty truly started peaking when desperation crept in. If they had been victorious, its hard to tell how they would have compared. Ultimately the motivation (paranoia or something else) is irrelevant from the victims perspective.

&gt; The Soviets didn't start a war of aggression, I don't know what you mean here.

As a Finn I have to say I heartily disagree with that statement. I would also say there's a whole bunch of Polish dead in Katyn who would disagree with you - never mind the Baltic states.

&gt; (Fascism going away faster) I don't see why you suppose that. Just look at the Franco regime, and imagine what would have happened in Spain if the rest of Europe was still fascist when he died.

Franco was a staunch conservative. Whatever you think of his 'progressiveness', Hitler was no fan of status quo, making his Empire rather by definition extremely volatile. Hitler was also nearly 60 when he committed suicide, so he'd have been very unlikely so survive as long as Franco did.

&gt; Stalin's mass murders, while utterly horrific, did at least come on a basis of paranoid fear of subversion (making their ultimate scope probably more limited than that of the Germans had they won).

Even you go with 'probably' here. The Germans (before they started contemplating losing the war) were actually more lenient conquerors than the Soviets were until the war entered Soviet Union itself. Admittedly, there was a lot of people to be shitty to in there (and arguably being shitty to the people there was in many ways what lost the war for the Germans - had the Ukrainians joined them against the Russians... well, different discussion), but places like Denmark, Greece weren't suffering anything particularly untoward from the Germans (whereas the Soviets would have shipped a significant percentage of the population to Siberia at the very least).

&gt; Why would he relinquish France after successfully occupying it?

The same reason most people haven't hung on to occupied powerful countries after winning a war with them. What you can do is extract de facto tribute while letting them rule themselves. France had very little to offer Germany in a way, because the German population couldn't be roused to truly start massacring them (just seen as too similar, and the historical ties are too long). So basically you have this enormous will-rebel-any-day colony that, as long as you have it, will keep you embargoed by UK and the US. Pacifying the great Steppes would be a huge enough project *without* US/UK on your back, and there's really no way you could get them off your back without letting the Western countries go.

I suspect he'd have done it.

&gt;&gt; who always did pretty much what he had written down
&gt; Well, except for the Holocaust of course...

I think Mein Kampf was pretty explicit about his opinion towards Jews. Most people took it as ranting when he *actually meant every word*. 

&gt; The Japanese were much bloodier, you really only have to read a bit of the history there to see that (start with the Rape of Nanking).

Bloodier, yes, but you can die without bleeding. To truly cause death on an epic scale you have to start fucking around with food production. Rape on Nanking killed maybe 300,000 people, but Mao's Great Leap Forward might have killed over 40 *million*. I suspect the Japanese would have run out of thirst for blood before that, their point proven. No reason to kill your slaves, after all (and with Mao's communism, the whole Chinese population ended up in de facto slavery anyway).

&gt; Also, the Japanese didn't just want to take China, their reach would have spread all across South East Asia and the Pacific.

Which they could never have been able to do against the United States. If Germany wanted peace with the US, Japan would have either had to agree with the US demands for that peace, or go at it alone (in which case there would have been no Japanese Empire at the end of the war).

I fundamentally agree with you that an Axis victory would have almost certainly been worse for the world than their loss was. However, I think you'll agree that it's hardly a 100% black &amp; white issue considering the nature of many of the allies that the axis fought (read: Stalin and Mao).",True,2,,False,2,0,0,t1_c2wh0vb

I think the easiest way to explain it is by teaching you basic accounting. When you have 10 dollars on your bank account, you make your paperwork as if you have 10 dollars. If you take 5 dollars and lend them to your friend, then you *STILL* account for them as yours in the paperwork to the bank or government or whatever.

In case of Europe. If Greece leaves, then the remaining countries will have to do massive write offs. Now a country like Italy that is already in deeeeep shit will die if that happens. If Italy goes under, France goes under. If France goes under, the Euro is finished. It creates a domino effect you see.

If you lend 5 of your 10 dollars to Peter. Then you are still worth 10 dollars in the eyes of the bank. So you can borrow another 10 dollars from them so you have 15. So you spend 10 dollars. Now if Peter defaults on his loan, then you only have 5 to pay off the bank loan. consider you are seriously broke and go bankrupt then the bank has to write off that 5 dollars.

That is exactly what is happening with Greece right now. They borrowed from ECB massively. Spent the money and now cannot pay their loans back. They are actaully borrowing money to pay back their loans. That's known as the legal version of the Ponzi scheme.

Even if this is true, does that mean it should be modeled after? There are many historical practices, such as slavery, that are now regarded as generally terrible ideas.

&gt;&gt; he's a piece of shit and so is anyone else in the german military from 1939 to 1945.


Anyway..
&gt; other people have invaded and hurt other people, therefore it is okay to hurt and invade other people.

Pretty much so, by the standards at the time.  You were saying that individual soldiers were evil to be part of an invading force.  And I pointed out that invading other countries was really just par for the course back then.  For example, Greece invaded Turkey in 1919 [just to gain territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Turkish_War_\(1919%E2%80%931922\)), for example.  Backed by the British.

Remember that in 1870, the French declared war on Germany because they thought that the [Kaisar had been rude to an envoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ems_Telegram).  They didn't bother to check if the telegram was true or not (it wasn't).

Let me say that again: **in 1870, the French declared war against Germany for having bad manners and the story wasn't even true**.

Besides which, one cannot blame ordinary soldiers for invading when ordered to invade.  Blame that one on the people at the top.

&gt; if he wasn't a nazi, he wouldn't have joined an army that forced him to wear one.

Again, you're talking about the guy in the photo, not your original statement, and we agree about this.

Are you talking about Europe here or the UK? Europe borders on Russia and the middle east. Both of those regions could be the cause of future strife. North Africa is very close to Europe, again another potential hot bed of war.

GDP does not have much to do with defence spending especially since Russia does not necessarily need to import much, GDP at PPP might be a better guide but even then Russia has vast resources and a lot of weapons in storage.

Would Europe be willing and able to engage Russia in a land war? Bear in mind that the Baltics, Finland and parts of Eastern Europe would become the front line very very quickly. It's ok being back here in the UK but given the EU as a whole it's a bit different.

Imagine that you're Joe, owner of Joe's Discount Bicycles.  You make bicycles in your shop in Joestown Indiana and every scrap of material, every employee, everything that comes in or goes out of your shop comes from within the United States.

You pay your employees minimum wage, your pay some fixed rent on your building etc etc.

Great.  

So you can do some simple math and work out that you need to charge $150 per bicycle you sell to make $10 in profit, which lets you feed your kids and pay your mortgage and whatnot.

Now you decide to expand.  You're gonna sell your bicycles in Mexico.

We'll call your target customer Jose.  Jose makes $500 a month in Mexico so your bicycle is a big purchase for him but he can just swing it.  The problem is that Jose isn't paid in dollars, he's paid in Pesos.  Jose makes about 6700 Pesos a month, which works out to about $500.

Of that, Jose needs to have 2010 ($150) Pesos left over after bills and whatnot to buy your bicycles.  

But suddenly the strength of the dollar goes up!  The European debt crisis has driven investors out of European markets and they're buying up dollars left and right.  Dollars become more expensive on the world market and that means that it **takes more Pesos to buy a dollar**

Now since your production costs are all in dollars, you need to make $150 per bicycle to stay in business.  Since Jose's living expenses are all in Pesos he's getting 6700 Pesos a month no matter what happens in the international currency market but now Jose's 2010 Pesos worth of spending money doesn't buy $150 but $145.  Jose can't buy your bicycles anymore.  

That sucks for you.

The same sort of applies with Honda and Nintendo and a strong Yen.  A stronger Yen means other people's currencies don't buy as many Yen and Honda and Nintendo need to clear a certain price per unit in order to stay in business.  Thus a stronger Yen means fewer sales for them.",True,5,,False,5,0,0,t1_c2whlsa

Europe. 

Russia still has potential as an aggressor, but Europe would be far too much for them. They might try to get away with a bit of salami slicing: would we go to war for the sake of Estonia? Russia needs to be convinced that we will. 

I'm sure parts of the Middle East will remain turbulent but they won't have the means to invade  Europe  and neither will any country  in North Africa  for the foreseeable future. 

Having Turkey onside may become  critical though, and this raises some questions in a post NATO Europe.

&gt;it would be in our interest to defend our assets and more importantly our beliefs. 

It might be in our interest to defend our assets, or more realistically divest assets that can't be defended. I don't see how we can defend our beliefs though. Either we keep them or we don't. Unless we're invaded by a foreign power: we have to make sure that doesn't happen to any part of Europe.

&gt;Also, the EU is massive both politically and economically, I doubt it'd be in our interests to stay out.

War is usually bad for an economy. Whoever won some future clash of civilisations would have to do business with an unscathed Europe.

The only way that it might be in our interests to get involved  would be if a major player started getting so big that they represented a threat. 

&gt;Furthermore, i doubt China is going to give nice and clear warning signals saying ""hey guys, better tool up we're going to attack in 10 years!"" The UK had a massive warning about Germany pre-WW2 and did bugger all. Why would the EU be any different?

We need to track their capability and avoid wishful thinking. At the moment most of their defence spending is ... defensive. If that changes dramatically then we know someone's in for trouble.

Entièrement d’accord. Mon point est que la France n’avait aucunement besoin de ses empires pour être prospère.

(La France a eu deux empires; celui sous l’ancien régime, d’où nous sommes issus, et celui qui a suivi, établi par les bourgeois pour des raisons primordialement mercantiles).

&gt; Oublies-tu les guerres en Indochine/Vietnam et l'Algérie? Et, contre à ton raconte d'histoire, la France était une des plus répressifs de tous les grandes empires Européens, quelque choise qui est évident quand on lit l'histoire des pays colonisées en Afrique et Asie.

Mais oui. La France s’est déshonorée dans son empire et encore plus en voulant le garder, mais celà simplement parce qu’elle a été dirigée par des bourgeois, gens qui n’ont pas d’honneur. Ces gens là ne sont pas français dans l’âme, ils sont plus comme des crypto-anglo-saxons; ils ont dénaturé la France et causé son déshonneur.

N’empêche qu’il demeure que la France n’a jamais eu besoin de ses empires, la preuve étant les «trente glorieuses».

&gt; En plus, la croissance économique après la guerre en France à été soutenu par des milliards de dollars Americains - le plan Marshall, les autres mesures pour reconstruire l'Europe du Ouest, avec une chèque blanche pour des milliards pour la guerre en Vietnam avant 1954. Ouais, the English, selon toi.

Y’avait pas vraiment le choix; la France a énormément souffert de la guerre (les chleuhs ont peut-être pillé beaucoup de trucs, il reste que les amerloks ont balancé beaucoup de bombes sur la France) et sans le plan Marshall, elle n’aurait eu pratiquement d’autre choix que de devenir communiste pour pouvoir se reconstruire. Faut pas oublier que le parti communiste était la cheville ouvrière de la Résistance, et qu’il est demeuré pendant presque un demi-siècle le plus grand parti communiste à l’extérieur du bloc communiste.

Le plan Marshall était finalement pas mal intéressé de la part des amerloks…

&gt; Je ne comprend pas pourquoi c'est si important pour toi de hausser le drapeau Français et pisser sur le drapeau Anglais, c'est des Européens, des ex-pouvoirs continentales qui n'ont rien à faire avec la politique contemporaine en Amerique du Nord.

Warum bei jeder nicht absolut notwendigen Verzögerung jeder Volkswirt vermutlichdie Hände über dem Kopf zusammen schlägt ist zum einen die Gefahr von einem Totalschaden.

Der sieht so aus dass sich die Meinung durchsetzt, Griechenlands Situation lässt sich unter aktuellen Bedingungen nicht lösen. Scheitern würde das nicht an der Finanzierung, die würde die Eurogruppe auf jeden Fall und letztlich in fast jeder Höhe bereitstellen (reines eigenes Interesse). Scheitern würde es wenn klar wird, dass die griechische Führung keinen Sanierungsplan durchsetzen kann, sei es parlamentarisch oder gegen die Strasse oder bei irgendeiner Erhebung von Volkes Meinung. Die Details von so einem Plan seien mal dahingestellt, wichtig ist nur, dass er einigermassen durchführbar erscheint.

Tritt dieser Fall ein müsste im Vorhinein ein klarer Plan B installiert sein und allen Beteiligten (also allen Regierungen der Welt, der Finanzbranche und zu einem gewissen grad jedem der ein Girokonto hat) kommuniziert sein und allgemein für gut und verlässlich befunden sein. Das wäre ein Mechanismus, der Griechenland aus dem Euro und der EU ausschließt und einen Großteil der griechischen Auslandsschulden sicher übernimmt.

Das ist allerdings Heute nicht der Fall, den nötigen Plan B gibt es noch nicht uuund *lufthol* daaaann bleiben nur irgendwelche Ad-Hoc Maßnahmen um die europäische und dann vermutlich weltweite Kernschmelze noch zu stoppen.


Die andre Seite sind Verluste durch Oppotunität, als Dinge die deswegen nicht passieren. Durch die entstehende Unsicherheit steigen Finanzierungskosten für alle, vom Staat, über den Multikonzern, übers kleine Handwerkerle bis zum Häuslebauer. Deswegen werden viele Investitionen nicht getätigt, viele Aufträge nicht vergeben, viele Leute nicht eingestellt usw. Die Effekte multiplizieren sich durch verschiedene Mechanismen an denen man nicht einfach was ändern kann und die Folge ist ein viel tieferer Abschwung, als er eigentlich sein müsste.

&gt; within which legislation would the provisions be found?

The best answer would be from the law itself. The reasoning in each limitation is different but usually boils down to there being an implicit limitation to a given right that doesn't need to be written down. 


That might sound very wooly to you given that your constitution outlines the process in detail, but have you ever considered where those considerations come from?


I don't practice US law, but this list:

&gt;the nature of the right;
the importance of the purpose of the limitation;
the nature and extent of the limitation;
the relation between the limitation and its purpose; and
less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.

Is almost identical to considerations that we have to take into account in the UK when rights are being dealt with. Proportionality (the UK and ECHR term for the doctrine as a whole) was developed piecemeal by courts, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's inclusion in modern constitutions was inspired by European and US legal development.


As another example, judicial review of statute, a near staple of modern legal systems, was a novelty until colonial and very early US Supreme Court law developed it. Most modern constitutions have judicial review procedure clauses as a result. 

In summary, things that you're looking for in the US constitution don't exist because no one ever thought to put them in. Instead, due to the US political culture's aversion to repeated amendment, the courts developed them instead.

They increased the pace yes, but I think this was more a result of them increasing their pace to kill as many as possible, than it was some sort of growing inhumanity. It should be remembered as well that it took the Germans a bit of time to figure out how they were going to 'solve' their racial problems, and that they grew more efficient in killing over time. Finally, my previous point about the death squads which followed behind the army during Barbarossa showed pretty much what their grand plan really was going to be.

 
&gt; As a Finn I have to say I heartily disagree with that statement.

Okay fair enough, still, that invasion would not have happened had Germany not started their aggression.

&gt;Franco was a staunch conservative. Whatever you think of his 'progressiveness', Hitler was no fan of status quo, making his Empire rather by definition extremely volatile.

I'm not sure what sort of volatility you had in mind which would have resulted in successive governments turning back to democracy, liberalism and free expression.

&gt;Hitler was also nearly 60 when he committed suicide, so he'd have been very unlikely so survive as long as Franco did.

Yes, but my point there was that the international conditions required for someone like Juan Carlos to return a country back to democracy would not be there if Europe was dominated by other fascist nations. 



&gt;The Germans (before they started contemplating losing the war) were actually more lenient conquerors than the Soviets were until the war entered Soviet Union itself

Yes, that was a part of their racist ideology... Also, as I said my last post it took time for the Germans to fully figure out and implement their genocidal plans.

&gt;but places like Denmark, Greece weren't suffering anything particularly untoward from the Germans 

Again, this is a result of Germany's views on race.

&gt; The same reason most people haven't hung on to occupied powerful countries after winning a war with them.

I'd contest your claim of most, especially considering how thoroughly subdued France had become. Also, Hitler had outlined German claims to parts of France even before the war, I don't think it is unfair to suppose that these plans would have expanded as Germany's power increased.

&gt;So basically you have this enormous will-rebel-any-day colony that, as long as you have it, will keep you embargoed by UK and the US. 

I don't think that a defeated UK would be in much position to embargo anyone, and what would the US have done that they didn't do to the Soviets, especially after having joined the losing side of a war. 


&gt;I think Mein Kampf was pretty explicit about his opinion towards Jews. 

His opinion, but he never wrote anything about genocide.

&gt;Bloodier, yes, but you can die without bleeding. To truly cause death on an epic scale you have to start fucking around with food production.

Fair point.

&gt;Mao's Great Leap Forward might have killed over 40 million. I suspect the Japanese would have run out of thirst for blood before that, their point proven. 

Who knows how long the war would have dragged on there, and then when the communists inevitably continued their guerilla war, what sort of horrific reprisals the Japanese would have enacted to bring them into line. 

&gt;No reason to kill your slaves, after all

They could well have followed the lead of Germany.

&gt;with Mao's communism, the whole Chinese population ended up in de facto slavery anyway

Their lot was pretty harsh, but they didn't have the added effects of being a hated race to exacerbate their subjugation.

&gt;If Germany wanted peace with the US, Japan would have either had to agree with the US demands for that peace, or go at it alone (in which case there would have been no Japanese Empire at the end of the war).

But their ability to negotiate the ending of Japanese expansion would have been severely hampered by their being defeated by Germany.

&gt; However, I think you'll agree that it's hardly a 100% black &amp; white issue considering the nature of many of the allies that the axis fought (read: Stalin and Mao).

When the rest of the EU countries impose the toughest austerity imaginable upon Greece and give it just enough cash to pay interest payments back to them, you call it help.

Here is my problem though. When a nation goes to war with you, you do whatever you can to beat them back and secure your nation.  In the case of 67', after Israel won the war and pushed the perpetrators back, the arabs did not cease their ambition of Israel's destruction. Therefore, I do not feel Israel has any obligation to give the land back to hostile nations. It would be against its own security interest to do that. When countries were willing to accept Israel and be peaceful with them, we gave back land for peace (i.e. Egypt, Jordan). But the Palestinians have never been willing to recognize Israel's right to exist and for decades have been OPENLY calling for Israel's destruction (see Hamas Charter). So if the palestinians are so hell bent continuing their stance towards Israel for decades what do you expect? we just hold the land indefinitely for security reasons and ignore the needs of our people? 
But even regardless of this. When you mention international law, I assume you're talking about the fourth Geneva convention where it says that a state cannot transfer or deport part of its own civilian population into these new “occupied” territories. The whole reason for this law was to prevent forcible population transfers, thereby protecting the local population. I think this was largely in response to actions by eastern european countries. I think maybe yugoslavia but im not sure. Israel is not forcing any transfers or deportations. It does not place any residency conditions on its people.

And when talking about the importance of Jerusalem, for as long as Israelites have lived in Israel, their capital has always been jerusalem. Their historic ties to the city are indisputable. In contrast, Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Muslim nation or state and is never even mentioned in the Quran. So when it comes to importance, I do not see a clear reason why Jerusalem is so necessary all of a sudden other than its strong ties with Israel and its people.",True,0,,False,0,0,0,t1_c2wispn

that was the poland numbers alone. there were hundreds of thousands more jews who fled from different areas of europe.

The previous government was Nea Dimokratia. It presided for seven years.
Before that was a THIRTY year run by PASOK, with a three year interval by Nea Dimokratia in 1990.

Papandreou was also a Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Minister of Education when PASOK was last in power. He's also the son of Andreas Papandreou, the guy who was the PASOK Prime Minister most of the thirty years.

Do you REALLY think he had no idea? Do you REALLY think he believed there was more money?

When Nea Dimokratia came to power last time, the ND Prime minister pulled the exact same shit as this homonculus. He reported the real Greek debt to the European Union, and told everyone that PASOK had been running the vault empty for decades. He showed proof.

The current government acts as if the debt only got amassed at the seven years of ND power, because it's not in their interest to admit that most of the assholes in power right now were also in power right before ND.

Firstly, you are not using the typical, if maybe colloquial, definition of socialism which suggest a central control or a planned economy.

Frankly that should be obvious when we are discussing socialism in terms of libertarian belief.  Socialism from it's root is an anti-state political philosophy, unfortunately the term has been so bastardized and maligned that people assume it is statism.  The term simply implies collective ownership of the means of production - it doesn't expound on the nature of government.

&gt;How people interact in a free market is their choice, and whether labor is offered stock options and company ownership to entice their services is perfectly acceptable, though I don't see that as, how I understand socialism, ending a hierarchy structure where everyone is equal in ownership.

My personal belief is that companies organize based on a capital wage-labor paradigm because of the inherent inequities in our system of property law.  The system of English common law that governs property ownership in this country is nothing like any libertarian thinker has advocated - not the Lockean Proviso, not Rothbard's ""homesteading"".  Simply put it is a state of natural resource ownership that has been handed down from monarchs and tyrants.  The situation is even more disgusting in Western Europe, where the nobility still controls significant land holdings on this basis - some land that was actually even given to them by monarchs.

Any libertarian system of natural resource ownership recognizes the natural, untouched world as either ""unowned"" (in a Rothbardian tradition) or ""owned in common"" (in the Lockean tradition).  I believe that with an understanding that land becomes owned between the mixing of man, land and labor that we would see far less disparity in wealth.  One man simply couldn't own a stockpile of natural resources legitimately without making use of them, and therefore access to all of America's worth would be available to anyone willing to go out and work for it.  Combine this with the Lockean Proviso that a man should leave ""as much and as good"" for the next and you have a situation ripe for the development of socialist economy.  People have a vested interest in bringing others into the company to allow for more land ownership, more use of resources.  People are naturally understood to have common ownership of the land, so common ownership of the produce (assuming equal involvement in it's production) is natural as well.

&gt;We are middle of the road pushing toward european statism but we are still a free society in most cases. Free to fail, free to succeed.

I agree with you, but I think we have been growing into a more authoritarian country lately.  What I see happening is both parties moving towards authoritarianism but staying in the middle of the road on the left-right spectrum.  If the Obama presidency has made anything clear it's that both parties are willing to openly abuse our Constitution.

&gt;I don't get this at all. Can you explain?

Certainly.  This stems from the view of property that most libertarian thinkers hold.  Natural resources in our current system are believed to held by private interest or the government, for use at their disposal.  A large amount of undeveloped land has been purchased from land-holdings passed down generationally, many of these holdings originated from what most libertarian thinkers would consider ""illegitimate"" claims on land.  Either the government handed them out to it's cronys at some point, or sold them in auction when the government isn't the true owner of the land.  Redress for these illegitimate claims is very difficult in libertarian though because these ""owners"" would have an enormous amount of political/economic power if we were to convert to a libertarian society overnight.  So addressing these claims is a tricky subject.  Either you can leave claims as they are, you can break up ""illegitimate"" claims (very arbitrary), or you can leave the claims for a generation and ""start over"".  I think that leaving the claims, then allowing descendants to maintain claims that they are personally involved with working could be a fair compromise. There's no real clear winner in how the problem of illegitimate land/resource ownership would be solved.",True,1,,False,1,0,0,t1_c2wjewj

Technically, Europe has 3 5th generation fighter programmes; there is the Swedish Saab Gripen too. Europe plainly can't support three 5th generation fighter programmes, which is why each of them is struggling so badly. The Gripen looks the weakest, followed by the Rafale, followed by the Typhoon. But remember it was the French who pulled out of the original programme and decided to go it alone, after they weren't allowed to take the leading role (the French are VERY protective of their aerospace industry).

The F-35 and F-22 are frankly, nothing to get too excited about. You'd struggle to find an opponent worth throwing them at. Deep strike missions will be handled by UAV in the future, not super-expensive 6th generation fighters. France and the UK have already come to an agreement to jointly develop a MALE UAV for surveillance and ground attack purposes. 

The ideal siltation would be to cut the American's out of the picture completely; give France the second carrier we can't afford to run to replace their problematic current one, and take a few squadrons of Rafael's to run off ours to enable us to return to carrier operations far quicker then if we wait for the F35. Its cheaper, supports the capabilities of both countries, and enables good cooperation for future missions.",True,2,,True,2,0,0,t1_c2wjtp5

The point of saying ""*first* morally, and *second* in practice"" ... and you omitting the ""second""?   Oh, and you also omitting the ""third"" very practical issue?

BTW, I'm glad you are clear about how you think morality doesn't count in finance.  

You borrow more than you can repay, due to your own fiscal irresponsibility. Who should bear the loss?  

Why, ""the only question is"" which is the least painful option *for you*.  If your renegging on your debts and dropping the loss on savers who loaned money to you in good faith is the least painful for you, that's the correct option.  Morality has nothing to do with it, right?  

Although it may lead to a practical problem if you ever again need to ask anybody for a loan, should practical problems be all that matter to you.

&gt;The Greeks can't, that's plain for everyone to see.

Apparently its not plain enough for a whole lot of them to see.

&gt;The only question is, which is the least painful option. Defaulting now, or defaulting later?

There is no question at all about that at all. 

Very clearly, the least painful option for *the world* was the deal worked out between the Greek government and 17 other nations last week.

But hey, if some Greeks think it will be less painful for them to reneg on that deal, maybe sink Europe, and take a good part of the rest of the world with down with it, and they can make the govt do that ... hey, that's all that matters!  The least painful option for them!

The morality of taking half the world down because they don't want to keep a deal they agreed to, becuase the discount it gives them on repaying the debts they owe isn't big enough, has nothing to do with it.

 The 16% rate is imposed on a wider tax basis of 1.27, bringing the effective tax rate to 20.3%. 

 There are reduced rates of tax for certain income earners.

 Corporate tax in Hungary in 2011 is fixed at 19%.

 Corporate tax for income up to HUF 500 million is 10%. (HUF 250 million in 2010).

3. Friends list. The friends list doesn't update the status of players properly. After many times of failed party joins some friends go into a ""limbo"", where trying to invite them to a further game results in an error along the lines of ""friend not available"" (I forget the exact wording).

I also bought a really cheap Chinese-made valve amp secondhand for £50, and there's something about the valve amp (it's the European equivalent of the Epiphone Valve Junior) that is just immediately ""brighter"", ""clearer"" and better about it.

When I was at my instructor's one time, I plugged into one of his amps, and did a double-take as soon as I heard it - I'm sure now that the reason for that must've been that it's a valve amp. That's basically how I feel about the difference between my modelling and valve amps.

The Fender Mustangs have, by all reports, the best modelling on the market at the moment. Some people have sold their Fender valve amps in favour of them.

I believe that the difference comes down to your ears - some people can tell the difference, other can't. I don't think anyone would say (with blind tests and statistical significance) that a modelling amp sounds better than a valve amp, I think that some people would say (provably) that valve amps do sound better.

To get all the effects of a Fender Mustang would cost you $1000+; it would be hard to say that a $1000 worth of valve amp and pedals would sound $1000 better.

I think a modelling amp is a great first choice, but I wouldn't spend as much as the Mustang III on one. The interface on the III is perhaps better, but the I is just as good in terms of sound (and it'll be easier to control the volume on a smaller amp - on my Mustang II, I'm constantly around the 1 - 2 mark on the volume scale, and that can suddenly be *way* too loud if I choose the wrong preset). 

The Fender I &amp; II have good facilities for programming presets, so you can just use them as a box of 24 (or more) different sounds, without having to tweak any of the dials. And you can dial in fine settings really well on using the computer interface. The Roland Cube 40XL has a much more ""manual"" interface, but has a looper. I think the G-Dec is a lot of money for a modelling amp - it has backing tracks built in, but the Mustang has a line in you can use with an old CD walkman (CDs often still being supplied with guitar books) or with your iPod.

Use a modelling amp for a year, then see if you can tell the difference that a valve amp makes, and see if that's something you care about.

The character obviously just arrived in LA, and the reason there are so many hispanics there is because its close to the border. Obviously the character isn't fresh from the border. Its possible that the hispanic character grew up somewhere else in America, then moved to LA, but that just doesn't seem legit to me.

The guy on the balcony seems to be the protaganist, and he definitely looks like a white guy of european ethnicity. I think thematically it makes more sense, because with the whole recession idea, I think the character will be a white formerly well off guy (I would guess from Liberty city involved in investment or something) who lost it all and has to resort to crime. 

While CJ, Niko, and a Hypothtical latino character would probably be ""born into"" crime/struggling to survive, i think it makes sense for this character to be a someone falling from success
